2018.18-481,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.32,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-481, the Food Marketing Institute versus the Argus Leader -- versus Argus Leader Media. Mr. Young."
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,9.32,28.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Before I turn to why the Court should jettison the National Parks definition of ""confidential"" and instead restore that word's plain meaning as used in Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, let me address justiciability."
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,48.32,53.8,Not if the government decides that it doesn't want to give it.
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,76.32,84.76,We're not bound for it because the intervention that we successfully moved in the District of South Dakota made us a proper party.
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,88.28,102.28,"But the -- if you had been a part of the -- if you had been the original asker, we have a case that says -- Crystal City -- that if the government chooses to turn it over, you can't appeal."
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,102.28,104.92,And the government did not make that choice.
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,106.04,135.32,"Well, but they haven't made the choice on this exemption. They've made the choice because of a new law. Isn't the proper course for them to go back to the district court with a motion for reconsideration or for them to petition the court or for you to go to the court or for -- or -- or for someone else to go to the court and say they have to turn it over?"
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,135.32,136.4,"No, Your Honor."
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,148.36,155.6,"Well, it's not certain until the district court relieves them of the earlier judgment, telling them that Exemption 3 didn't apply."
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,155.6,158.64,"Well, that -- that premise, I think, is -- is a mistaken one."
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,176.4,179.52,But that's the basis for their refusal to turn it over now.
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,179.52,186.76,"Well, no, the -- the basis for -- for their refusal to turn it over now is an Exemption 4 basis, that the information --"
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,186.76,189.0,"Well, they can speak for themselves, but I thought --"
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,189.0,189.6,Agreed.
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,189.6,197.52,"-- when they chose not to appeal, they chose not -- they chose to follow the order of the court to turn it over."
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,197.52,200.6,There are a number of things that differentiate this from a situation like that.
2018.18-481,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,224.32,230.68,Do you understand the government to be firmly committed to not releasing the information unless required to?
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,230.68,232.0,"Yes, that's what I understand."
2018.18-481,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,232.0,235.0,I noticed them on your -- your side of the lectern.
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,235.0,240.32,"And I won't speak for them, but that's what they have represented not only to the district court but to this Court."
2018.18-481,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,240.32,242.88,"Now, of course, they remain free to change their mind."
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,242.88,263.48,"And that would be a -- a -- a different situation, but the question for standing at the time when we invoked the appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts was would we have a likelihood of relief, and the answer is yes. And, right now, based on the Solicitor General's brief, that was the thing that my friend on the other side invoked in his brief to this Court."
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,284.72,289.16,But it won't be destroyed because they have a 2018(c) argument.
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,289.16,295.4,"Well, the fact, as in Milner, in which there was an Exemption 7 argument pending, this Court took it to decide Exemption 2."
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,304.24,311.88,"If they're wrong on 2018(c), they have to comply with the extant judgment under Exemption 4?"
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,311.88,317.52,"No, I -- I disagree, and I will allow my friend from the government to explain their position."
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,323.04,325.48,They're trying to piggyback their appeal on you.
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,325.48,328.12,"No, I -- I disagree with that as well, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,358.32,359.24,Mr. Young --
2018.18-481,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,359.24,375.8,"But wasn't the whole purpose of -- FOIA says disclose, and one of the concerns was the government official, for one reason or another, doesn't want to disclose."
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,391.6,455.6,"Well, it would perhaps run counter to the idea of FOIA if it were the kind of information that were -- was about the government's own doings or even, conceivably, something that's not presented here, if there were willy-nilly ad hoc promises of confidentiality in which low-level employees could wave a wand and say confidential, confidential, but I think that what this Court has repeatedly said -- I'll mention the Department of Justice versus the Reporters Committee case, where the Court says: ""Yes, FOIA's basic policy focuses on the citizens' right to be informed about what their government is up to."" That's a direct quote. But then the Court immediately says that purpose, however, is not fostered by disclosure of information about private citizens that has accumulated in various governmental files but that reveals little or nothing about an agency's own conduct. And so, here, what we see is a choice. When a SNAP beneficiary receives an allocation from the government, their choice to shop at this grocery store rather than one across the street is in no sense government action."
2018.18-481,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,470.52,472.8,I don't doubt that you're heard.
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,545.12,560.52,"Well -- well, if I'm understanding you, Justice Breyer, I -- I don't think it raises either one of those justiciability questions because the Court can have in reserve many grounds that the lower courts, for example, may not have addressed. In Milner, I mentioned Exemption 7 was still there."
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,572.08,588.44,"The problem with that in Milner is -- and the big difference is that the government chose not to appeal the ruling on Exemption 4, so it acceded to turning it over under that exemption."
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,636.96,643.32,"Justice Sotomayor, I don't believe the government's piggybacking at all. They're here as an amicus."
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,646.52,651.52,"But why -- why can you, without getting stuck in Crystal City?"
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,651.52,652.48,"Well, because --"
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,652.48,665.88,"Just because they've said I won't turn it over, but they're bound to turn it over right now by a judgment below, and they haven't asked the court below to reconsider that judgment."
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,665.88,667.04,I -- I -- I think it's as simple as --
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,667.04,668.6,They raised Exemption 3.
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,678.72,689.96,"Because we intervened, and the opportunity to conclude that we are not a proper party to be able to make any of these merits inquiries has long since passed."
2018.18-481,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,689.96,702.72,"Mr. Young, may I ask you a question about your substantive standard? You at some points in your brief say that the question is simply whether the information is private, private being a synonym for confidential."
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,730.76,732.68,I'll -- I'll readily agree with the latter.
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,821.52,850.96,"So how does that dovetail with the SG's position that if they ask you to turn over something confidentially -- and you seemed to be arguing that earlier -- that that's enough, that that makes it confidential? Because you've just said to me something quite different, which is it's not the government's request or promise to keep it confidential, but is it, in fact, kept in confidence the way you've defined it? So how do you dovetail the two?"
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,850.96,875.72,"Well, I would say that even if the government gives us a promise of confidentiality, that fits within the definition of what confidential is, we now have given something to the government in confidence, if we, nonetheless, publish it, if we're sloppy with it, if we release it in some other way, then we have breached the confidentiality ourselves. And I would argue that someone like that is no longer protected by --"
2018.18-481,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,875.72,876.48,How about the --
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,876.48,879.08,So the government's overlay is really not necessary to this case?
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,879.08,881.8,It's a manifestation of what confidential is.
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,881.8,885.92,"Man -- but only a point of evidence, not a point that binds?"
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,885.92,887.08,I -- I guess.
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,890.88,896.96,"Meaning, you say a manifestation, that a district court judge could look at that as among many factors."
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,896.96,902.32,"Yes, I -- I would say that if the government in a proper form, if the government binds itself here through notice-and-comment rulemaking --"
2018.18-481,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,902.32,908.52,"If you -- if you leave -- if you give this information to your employees, there's no promise of secrecy and --"
2018.18-481,0,23461,evan_young,,908.52,916.36,"Well, Landano defined what confidential meant also, and it recognized that confidential does not mean that nobody knows it."
2018.18-481,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,922.0,924.32,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang."
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,924.32,948.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Before I address the merits, I'd briefly like to address justiciability and be clear: The government will not release the disputed records from 2005 to 2010 if a FOIA exemption applies."
2018.18-481,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,959.52,968.24,Is that true if -- if the -- the other statute here were held not to block the government from releasing it?
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,968.24,968.84,Yes.
2018.18-481,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,968.84,987.2,"You mean so however the other statute comes out, the government now is saying -- I didn't get this at the beginning -- we're not going to release it -- even if we have every right to release it, we're not going to release it, even if we have every right to do so?"
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,987.2,990.04,It would help to take a look at Footnote 5 --
2018.18-481,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,990.04,990.08,Yeah.
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,990.08,992.2,"-- at page 26 of our brief, where we explain --"
2018.18-481,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,992.2,993.4,Yeah.
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,993.4,1022.64,"-- there would -- there is a policy interest in USDA, if they were writing on a clean slate, going prospectively, that they may well release this information and they said they likely would. However, as we explain in Footnote 5, we said, if Congress had not amended Section 2018, so that's an if -- the agency might have explored changing its position. It has not changed its position, one. Two, and then we go on to say, to release store-level redemption data collected after such a change."
2018.18-481,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1036.2,1046.12,"I know, but you sounded in that footnote as if you were saying that the reason we're not releasing it is because of new 2018."
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1046.12,1049.6,"Well, the reason we're not releasing anything, whether before or after --"
2018.18-481,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1049.6,1051.6,"No, but just answer -- look at my -- look at my question."
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1054.6,1055.08,Right.
2018.18-481,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1055.08,1070.36,"And -- and if -- if you're going to tell me I don't care if 2018 never appeared, doesn't appear, doesn't exist, we still won't release it, which is your right in the absence of -- of --"
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1070.36,1071.84,I would say that's partially right.
2018.18-481,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1081.12,1081.28,All right.
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1086.88,1087.56,As I was explaining --
2018.18-481,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1087.56,1088.4,Will you release it?
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1088.4,1089.32,As I was -- no.
2018.18-481,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1090.16,1090.72,No? Okay.
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1090.72,1108.96,"-- on page 30 to 31 of our brief, even if we were wrong about 2018(c), the fact that it was reasonable, it was objectively reasonable in light of the government's assurances for 40 years to understand the government to be providing an assurance of confidentiality, and we understand these retailers to have done so, to be relying on that --"
2018.18-481,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1108.96,1110.44,"Mr. Yang, let me see if --"
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1110.44,1113.2,-- we're not going to release it as a matter of good government.
2018.18-481,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1113.2,1118.44,"Mr. Yang, you are going to tell me that you were going to be in contempt on the order below?"
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1118.44,1119.12,Of course not.
2018.18-481,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1119.12,1121.8,"The order below, you litigated Exemption 3."
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1121.8,1122.44,Of course not.
2018.18-481,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1122.52,1123.2,The court -- the court --
2018.18-481,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1123.2,1125.52,"Could I hear his answer, please?"
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1125.52,1126.2,Of course not.
2018.18-481,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1129.52,1131.56,"But wait a minute, there is no discretion."
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1142.36,1142.4,I --
2018.18-481,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1142.4,1143.68,You were ordered to disclose --
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1143.68,1145.36,I think there's some confusion in the question.
2018.18-481,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1155.68,1157.52,"No, but I'm sorry, but once you didn't --"
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1157.52,1159.4,The Court has repeated -- the Court recognized in a --
2018.18-481,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1159.4,1167.44,"-- once you didn't appeal -- forget about the amendment -- you didn't appeal, would you have had to turn over the material?"
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1167.44,1167.72,No.
2018.18-481,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1189.64,1193.08,Perhaps in your remaining time you could turn to the merits.
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1193.08,1194.08,Sure.
2018.18-481,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1220.2,1222.48,May I ask you -- may I ask you the same question --
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1222.48,1222.92,Sure.
2018.18-481,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1222.92,1234.68,"-- that I asked your fellow counsel? That is, one of the aims of FOIA was to -- FOIA was to make information public despite official --"
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1234.68,1235.28,Yes.
2018.18-481,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1235.28,1236.24,-- willingness.
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1236.24,1245.52,"I -- I think that's right, and that is certainly FOIA's general goal, but, in this exemption, it only targets a particular type of information, not general."
2018.18-481,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1262.56,1269.36,"If I understand your argument, Mr. Yang, you kind of have two prongs, two ways of saying that something is confidential."
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1277.32,1277.76,Yes.
2018.18-481,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1278.12,1278.48,Your --
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1278.48,1280.0,-- those are manifestations. We think the --
2018.18-481,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1280.0,1280.2,Am I -- am I --
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1280.2,1281.2,-- meaning of confidential --
2018.18-481,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1281.2,1284.96,-- am I -- am I right that you're relying here on the assurances point?
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1284.96,1288.52,"We are, because we think it's a little more complicated."
2018.18-481,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1323.04,1330.32,"When can -- when can it be deemed confidential as a matter of law, even without such assurances?"
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1330.32,1335.6,I think this confidential question ultimately is a question that requires factual context.
2018.18-481,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1348.0,1352.96,Can it -- can it be deemed confidential even in cases without government assurance? I'll ask it a different way.
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1352.96,1354.28,"Oh -- oh, sure, sure."
2018.18-481,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1354.28,1356.4,And what factors would determine that?
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1356.4,1360.48,"Well, that's the first manifestation of what's confidential."
2018.18-481,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1361.04,1365.12,And do you have any disagreement with Petitioners on how they articulate that first --
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1365.12,1369.48,I don't think so except that we think you have to take the full context into account.
2018.18-481,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1372.2,1380.32,"So, as I understood your brief, and tell me if I've gotten this wrong, you're basically saying that the first way of showing confidentiality, the non-assurances way --"
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1380.32,1380.52,Right.
2018.18-481,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1380.52,1392.4,-- isn't really met here because what they're seeking to protect is something -- is -- is information that essentially the government reveals all the time by virtue of its payments.
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1393.2,1394.12,I think it's close.
2018.18-481,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1435.4,1447.52,"And this assurances point of yours, does it apply only when somebody is voluntarily giving information to the government, or might it apply when somebody is mandated to give information to the government?"
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1447.52,1449.32,I think it -- it generally applies.
2018.18-481,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1475.36,1475.88,Because --
2018.18-481,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1475.88,1479.24,"Mr. Yang, this is -- this is somewhat confusing to me."
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1487.16,1487.32,I --
2018.18-481,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1487.32,1504.2,"That it's Congress's choice what the government will view as confidential and not disclose. Now you're bringing the government, the government qua the executive branch, into deciding what not to disclose under Exemption 4."
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1506.0,1513.4,"No, I think you -- if you read back a little bit in the statute, you'll see that Congress says that FOIA does not apply if any of the exemptions apply."
2018.18-481,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1521.2,1531.2,"So let's go back. If the store does not keep it confidential, can you, by a promise of confidentiality, protect it from FOIA disclosure?"
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1531.2,1532.6,I think that would be difficult.
2018.18-481,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1540.76,1540.96,Yeah.
2018.18-481,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1540.96,1558.08,"If information is customarily not publicly disclosed by those who submit it, so long as there is nothing in context that suggests that they would understand otherwise, when it's provided to the government, it would be confidential."
2018.18-481,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1558.08,1563.56,"Thank you, Mr. Yang. Mr. Loeb."
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,1563.56,1571.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If the Court reaches the merits here, it should affirm the judgment of the Eighth Circuit."
2018.18-481,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1626.64,1644.92,"Mr. Loeb, this case strikes me as a lot like Milner, that you have a D.C. Circuit opinion which puts some things into the test that maybe the -- the statutory text does not immediately suggest."
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,1668.8,1672.36,Context here is very different than Milner.
2018.18-481,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1687.08,1687.44,As to the --
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,1687.44,1689.16,-- and that certainly was not the case --
2018.18-481,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1689.16,1718.96,"-- as to the consensus, if I can stop you on that point, we're told by the other side that the circuits have been markedly inconsistent in the way they apply the test. So, if -- if -- if the D.C. Circuit had ruled one way and everybody said, yeah, this is how we do it, and the decisions all lined up, that would be one thing."
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,1728.08,1734.24,"Well, I think the -- the key factor is they all adopt the same two-prong standard of National Parks."
2018.18-481,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1829.64,1845.36,"Mr. Loeb, along those lines, the other side makes the argument that, in Exemption 7, the word ""confidential"" is given a different gloss than you would have us give it in -- in Exemption 4. I'm sure you would like an opportunity to respond to that."
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,1845.36,1846.84,"Correct, Your Honor."
2018.18-481,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1865.96,1866.8,That's another point.
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,1899.08,1899.28,Right.
2018.18-481,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1908.28,1913.16,So why should we give the same word two different meanings when they're virtual neighbors?
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,1913.16,1932.64,"First, the commonality, that even under Exemption 7, this Court didn't turn to ask the confidential source, do you think that you had a confidential relationship? Instead, they looked for objective factors. And our -- our standard here is looking at an objective one, objective harm. Second, the fact that the same word is used in different provisions of the exemption doesn't answer it."
2018.18-481,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1948.48,1959.4,"I agree, secrets in the national security context might be different than they are in the trade secret context, but that's -- that's just not helping me with the word ""confidential"". So perhaps there's something particular about it, maybe there isn't."
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,1960.24,1960.6,"No, no."
2018.18-481,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2011.2,2025.28,"So -- so what do you -- do you think? That is, what do you think about that? I mean, in reading some of these cases, it wasn't National Parks so much that I think caused the problem but other cases that sort of run with it."
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2098.36,2099.08,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.18-481,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2099.4,2099.84,Yes?
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2099.84,2103.84,-- the National Parks test requires a likely showing of competitive harm.
2018.18-481,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2103.84,2106.8,And -- and it's other cases that have gone beyond that.
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2106.8,2106.96,To --
2018.18-481,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2106.96,2109.0,Likely showing of competitive harm.
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2134.36,2135.12,I --
2018.18-481,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2135.12,2136.92,Business-related.
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2136.92,2140.44,"Well, trade secrets, which is the brother of this category of information --"
2018.18-481,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2140.44,2143.84,"But, I'm curious, if you can give me a yes-or-no answer, it would really help."
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2146.2,2149.4,Our threshold answer is that it -- it requires a competitive harm.
2018.18-481,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2159.88,2165.08,"I'm sorry, do you accept the reasonable possibility of harm test?"
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2165.08,2165.28,No.
2018.18-481,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2165.52,2179.64,"Because Justice Breyer, in his description, said sometimes you just can't prove it, but you -- there's a reasonable possibility of it. That has been thrown out as a -- as a -- why is that not enough?"
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2179.64,2201.72,"Well, under the common law and under the restatement, there was always a requirement of showing a likely competitive harm or a likely harm of sorts. So having just a reasonable possibility seems to be sort of more of a scintilla argument which -- which would allow so much more information here to be withheld. It's not such a strong burden to say -- I'm not saying you have to show there will be actual competitive harm, just there is a likelihood of -- of competitive harm."
2018.18-481,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2204.6,2208.96,How is that different from substantial harm? That's the National Parks test.
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2208.96,2212.36,"So we think the other side over-reads the word ""substantial""."
2018.18-481,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2214.4,2216.64,Is it them or other courts?
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2216.64,2221.24,"I -- I think there are a few outlier courts, but most courts have applied it as the Eighth Circuit here."
2018.18-481,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2255.32,2272.76,What if the standard were that the -- the agency must reasonably foresee disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption? That's the language of the 2016 amendment.
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2272.76,2278.96,"Certainly, that provides -- that applies now to all of the FOIA exemptions under the 2016 amendment."
2018.18-481,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2281.84,2283.92,But it -- it applies to Exemption 4?
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2283.92,2303.32,"It does for future cases. This case was a pre-2016 case, so it doesn't apply to this particular case, but it -- it certainly undercuts the arguments of the government and of FMI that it's the -- to require a showing of harm requires all these trials and it's really unadministrable, when Congress not only adopted that for Exemption 4 but for all the provisions --"
2018.18-481,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2303.32,2305.12,It just doesn't say competitive harm.
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2311.24,2311.48,Right.
2018.18-481,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2331.6,2354.56,"May -- may I ask, Mr. Loeb, if -- if I were to say to you give me your best shot on a textual argument for your position, so putting aside subsequent congressional inaction, putting aside how many courts have adopted this test, just sort of give me your best shot for why this is the right way to read the text, what would you say?"
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2354.56,2359.64,I would say you have to look at words in context and that their neighbors inform their meaning.
2018.18-481,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2429.12,2438.04,The problem I have is that the common law didn't use it the way -- didn't borrow a term of art.
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2458.52,2479.64,"No, it's not like the word ""fraud"" and -- every time the word ""fraud"" is used, you would look at the common law, but this is a -- it was clear that the restatement and the common law had two boxes of protected business information, trade secrets and confidential commercial -- commercial and financial information. And for both of them, they required some showing of -- of -- of significant -- of competitive harm."
2018.18-481,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2486.2,2496.92,"You'd agree, though, that when -- when Congress uses words that are different from common law terms that are invested with meaning, we usually presume that it means something different?"
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2496.92,2509.92,I -- I think here that common law developed in a way where they're talking about a class of information and it's clear that Congress is referring to that class information. It's not -- so this is not a -- a term of art where you have like one word which triggers it.
2018.18-481,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2539.52,2555.48,"I agree with that, but what -- what happens if -- if the company, a firm, A, says to a group of customers, we would like some information from you which is private, it'll help us in our business."
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2581.24,2587.76,"Well, I mean, your analogy speaks to a private party getting -- a company getting private information."
2018.18-481,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2587.76,2589.28,"Yeah, yeah, and, of course --"
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2589.28,2590.04,And would there be any --
2018.18-481,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2590.04,2590.72,That's right.
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2596.4,2596.48,All right.
2018.18-481,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2598.32,2598.44,Yeah.
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2598.44,2600.96,"-- there is a contract, and there could be damages under this contract --"
2018.18-481,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2600.96,2601.08,Yeah.
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2601.08,2602.6,-- but we're talking about a class of information --
2018.18-481,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2602.6,2603.16,"Well, all right."
2018.18-481,2,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2631.28,2631.56,I --
2018.18-481,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2631.56,2633.56,And I want to know about that.
2018.18-481,3,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2633.56,2636.04,I don't -- I don't think it would be within the statute.
2018.18-481,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2639.24,2641.52,"No, it is commercial and financial information."
2018.18-481,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2648.2,2652.32,"I'm still focusing on what words -- you don't have to write this, but I might. (Laughter.)"
2018.18-481,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2652.32,2665.48,"And I -- and I have -- and I have to write down something by the word ""harm,"" and that word -- that word ""competitive harm"" is still giving me some trouble, and I'm -- that's why I'm asking these questions."
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2665.48,2665.68,Right.
2018.18-481,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2789.36,2809.36,"May I -- may I ask you a question about now -- now that the -- the circuit court was wrong about Exemption 3 under the clarification that Congress provided, so are we supposed to just ignore that? That's --"
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2809.36,2818.84,"Well, we -- we don't believe that -- that the -- the new version of 2018(c) changes the law about this case at all. It's prospective."
2018.18-481,4,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2869.48,2873.96,You seem to be making two distinct arguments about National Parks.
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2887.44,2891.48,"Again, Milner was a very different concept."
2018.18-481,4,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2903.88,2904.08,Why --
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2904.08,2905.72,-- assume that Congress had one way or the other --
2018.18-481,4,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2905.72,2914.32,"Let me take it out from under Milner then and just say why, if we disagree with National Parks, the D.C. Circuit's decision, should we nonetheless follow it?"
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2914.32,2934.12,"Because this Court has long held that when Congress reenacts a statute or revises a statute that's subject to a uniform judicial construction, that you presume that Congress understands and knows that construction, has adopted it in its -- in its ratification, in its -- in its amendment to the statute."
2018.18-481,4,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2934.6,2939.56,"The construction was changed in critical mass in some significant respect, correct?"
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,2939.56,2944.44,"Not correct, Your Honor. So critical mass was just an application of prong one."
2018.18-481,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3000.48,3009.08,That would stop this Court from saying -- this Court has never -- has never answered that question.
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,3025.12,3026.84,"No, Your Honor, it doesn't stop this Court."
2018.18-481,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3081.88,3091.4,Does that -- does that argument depend upon how plausible this interpretation would be as a matter of first impression?
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,3091.4,3095.4,"Justice Alito, I -- I don't think that that -- that is part of the calculus."
2018.18-481,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3111.6,3134.84,"So, I mean, if there were a statute that says something has to be done within 30 days, and a court said 30 really means 50, and all the other courts fell in line, we would say, all right, that Congress has -- and Congress enacts statutes related to that -- we would say, well, Congress has implicitly ratified that?"
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,3134.84,3147.2,"Obviously, that's a hard hypothetical, Your Honor, but I would say yes, that -- that even in that context, that Congress was aware of the construction of that term, even how bizarre it may be. Here, we don't have such a bizarre, you know, construction."
2018.18-481,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3162.44,3169.56,"Well, under the common law, was competitive harm part of the claim itself, or was it simply what you needed to show to get damages?"
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,3169.56,3177.08,"For trade secrets, it was, in essence, a definition of what a trade secret is, something that, when it's released, will cause competitive harm."
2018.18-481,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3178.84,3183.4,"Well, for things that are not trade secrets, confidential financial information that is not a trade secret."
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,3183.4,3190.08,"The courts treated that same confidential business information in the same respect, that you had to show a competitive harm."
2018.18-481,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3197.12,3208.56,"Is -- is there a difference, Mr. Loeb, for purposes of this congressional ratification argument that the court at issue was not the Supreme Court, that it was instead a circuit court?"
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,3208.56,3213.28,It -- what this Court has said is if there's a -- a uniform judicial construction.
2018.18-481,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3245.44,3252.4,"So -- so, again, let's say we just had district courts, but we had uniform district courts saying 30 days means 50 days."
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,3272.4,3275.24,"Well, I don't think we would be -- this Court or -- or -- we're arguing that --"
2018.18-481,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3275.24,3280.96,Is that consistent with fair notice or due process or any normal statutory interpretation methodology you're familiar with?
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,3280.96,3287.56,"In this particular case, there's not this sort of stark it says 30 and we're reading it to be 50."
2018.18-481,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3290.76,3294.72,Exception for maybe due process and fair notice?
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,3294.72,3301.72,"Well, no one can argue that adopting the common law meaning of trade secrets and business information is a violation of due process."
2018.18-481,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3306.44,3308.04,Very kind of you. Thank you. (Laughter.)
2018.18-481,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3308.04,3308.52,But -- but --
2018.18-481,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3308.52,3309.96,"Well, but --"
2018.18-481,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3309.96,3323.6,"-- don't our -- don't our tools of interpretation normally take their cue from things like due process and fair notice, rather than the other way around, where due process and fair notice have to become the exception to our statutory interpretation tools?"
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,3323.6,3339.2,"But it is an established statutory interpretation mechanism that when Congress reenacts a statute and there's a uniform construction, even if it's a uniform circuit construction, that you presume that Congress has adopted that prior judicial construction."
2018.18-481,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3339.2,3350.8,"So how many -- how many courts of appeals do you have to take -- I assume uniform isn't enough -- if there are just two, that's uniform, but you have -- I understand you -- you think you have eight, right?"
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,3350.8,3356.2,"At least eight, Your Honor. And there's no -- and no outlier circuits on the two-prong test."
2018.18-481,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3356.2,3362.92,"Is it that, or are you really relying on the D.C. Circuit's special situation with respect to FOIA?"
2018.18-481,4,62939,robert_m_loeb,,3362.92,3367.2,"With all deference to the D.C. Circuit, no, there's no special deference here."
2018.18-481,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3384.56,3391.0,"Thank you, Mr. Young -- I'm sorry, Mr. Loeb. Now, Mr. Young, you have five minutes remaining."
2018.18-481,5,23461,evan_young,,3391.0,3393.24,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2018.18-481,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3456.72,3468.8,"Counsel, that -- that begs a question, which is we sort of naturally think that if people are going to keep something confidential, that there's a reason for it."
2018.18-481,5,23461,evan_young,,3508.68,3509.96,"Well, I think it's likely that there is."
2018.18-481,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3509.96,3520.4,"And that has to -- and -- and if there is some sense of it, why isn't that sense infused with a concept, if I let it out, it's going to hurt me?"
2018.18-481,5,23461,evan_young,,3520.4,3521.16,"Well, again, we think --"
2018.18-481,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3521.16,3524.32,"Taking aside the quantum of hurt, but --"
2018.18-481,5,23461,evan_young,,3524.32,3524.6,Right.
2018.18-481,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3524.6,3525.36,-- there's a reason I keep it a secret.
2018.18-481,5,23461,evan_young,,3525.36,3526.76,And I will address that as well.
2018.18-481,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3546.24,3547.32,But that's not true.
2018.18-481,5,23461,evan_young,,3547.32,3548.52,-- of whether they think it is.
2018.18-481,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3548.52,3553.44,"If -- if we read ""confidential"" as being confidential in nature, which is part of your definition --"
2018.18-481,5,23461,evan_young,,3553.44,3555.72,It's a manifestation of it.
2018.18-481,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3555.72,3555.92,"Well, it's --"
2018.18-481,5,23461,evan_young,,3555.92,3559.24,Things that are confidential in nature are likely to be kept secret.
2018.18-481,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3560.2,3560.88,"Well, that's the point, which is --"
2018.18-481,5,23461,evan_young,,3560.88,3569.08,But the founder of LifeLock put his Social Security number up on billboards all across the country to prove that his technology was so secure.
2018.18-481,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3634.56,3644.16,"But why not call it harm, some harm, I mean, some harm, because Congress doesn't go around protecting people from X where X doesn't cause any harm."
2018.18-481,5,23461,evan_young,,3647.8,3649.04,"Well, Congress spoke broadly --"
2018.18-481,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3649.04,3652.16,"Do you object to that, saying adding to that some harm?"
2018.18-481,5,23461,evan_young,,3652.16,3674.36,"Well, I -- I -- I -- I object to it in this sense: I think that by opening that door, you now are opening trial courts to have to do the kind of tedious and laborious work that leads to false negatives like this case. It -- it really is amazing that something like store-level SNAP redemption data would lead to a situation in which we had to have a trial at all."
2018.18-481,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3687.32,3687.48,Sure.
2018.18-481,5,23461,evan_young,,3687.48,3702.0,"Objectively, if you have a pattern of keeping this information secret and not publicly disclosing it, that is the only thing the federal courts are authorized to ask, and that gives the government the authority to keep it secret if it so desires."
2018.18-481,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3702.0,3703.0,"Thank you, counsel."
