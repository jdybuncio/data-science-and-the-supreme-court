1987.86-595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.439,"We will hear arguments first this afternoon in No. 86-595, United States against Joseph Fausto."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,13.058,15.593,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,65.022,75.131,"Mr. Wright, before you go on, am I correct in my understanding that the CSRA did not provide for any remedy for this basis of dismissal?"
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,84.57,89.64,"--Well, this employee was dismissed for misconduct."
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,100.095,110.451,"Therefore, this employee's misconduct, or the dismissal of this employee for misconduct is not the dismissal of this employee under the CSRA."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,110.451,112.32,That's right.
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,120.606,124.26,"Well, not only has it not provided him any remedies, it also hasn't provided the government any basis for dismissal."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,124.26,133.632,--This is an excepted service employee for whom it is assumed that there need be no basis for dismissal.
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,141.369,149.208,Then why was he dismissed for violation of another statute outside of the Civil Service Reform Act.
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,150.827,155.962,He was given a list of reasons.
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.459,190.868,"It seems to me it's one thing to say that where you have a comprehensive scheme like the Civil Service Reform Act that provides for the basis of dismissal of a particular employee, and does not provide any remedy, or provides remedy only in certain instances and leaves out other ones."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,208.164,219.472,"That's true, but that other statute gives him no remedies, and this statute is the comprehensive statute covering adverse actions against federal employees."
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.969,332.395,"But the difference in Carducci was that the basis for dismissal in Carducci was a basis set forth in the Civil Service Reform Act itself, or the basis action taken was a basis set forth in the Civil Service Reform Act, unacceptable performance."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,339.732,343.017,"No, that's right."
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,358.443,359.526,"Let me ask you, Mr. Wright."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,367.28,370.501,"Well, we think that's a close question."
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,378.238,385.426,"I know you argued it in the second go around in the court below, and they said it was perfectly... but I don't think see you are not arguing--"
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,385.426,386.726,"No, we are not pursing that."
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,386.726,392.097,"--So we start from the premise that prior to CSRA he had a remedy, and that CSRA really impliedly took it away from him."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,392.097,403.972,"In 1963, the Court of Claims held in the Greenway decision that a probationary excepted service employee could go to court in certain situations."
1987.86-595,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,428.337,440.645,I gather your principal reliance is that this is a very comprehensive scheme.
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,440.645,441.561,Yes.
1987.86-595,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,441.561,447.715,"And yet, you say while it doesn't in terms protect this man--"
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,447.715,449.182,Not in this case.
1987.86-595,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,449.182,450.167,--Not in this case.
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,452.284,456.405,To fire excepted service employees.
1987.86-595,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,464.058,473.116,"Well, I don't understand why... why doesn't the comprehensive statute preempt this so-called inherent authority?"
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,473.116,480.603,"Well, the comprehensive statute gives this person no rights in this situation."
1987.86-595,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,494.946,498.898,And what's the source of this inherent authority?
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,498.898,503.266,We quoted a number of cases in our brief.
1987.86-595,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,516.943,518.543,And assumed.
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,518.543,521.144,And a number of courts have so held.
1987.86-595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,556.151,565.006,"If you are right here, then the government didn't need to rely on a statute that provided for a 30-day suspension if you misused a car."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,566.59,569.642,"Yes, it could have, and I think that's undisputed."
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.642,578.6,"Well, is it the same thing to be fired for no reason at all as to be fired for stealing a car, or for misusing a car?"
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,585.42,590.574,He certainly never argued that he had any sort of liberty interest here.
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,597.978,601.53,I don't think so.
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,606.365,612.536,The Department of the Interior allowed him to file a grievance.
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.161,657.766,"--And your position, as I understand, is even if they just go ahead and violate those regulations, don't give him a hearing, don't do what the regulation provide, there is just still no provision for any judicial review."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,657.766,660.499,That is basically our argument.
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,660.499,670.074,"If you had a regulation that when there is a lot of snow in Washington, everybody can go home at 3:00 and still get a full day's pay, and the excepted service people, they just didn't pay them, they would have no remedy."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,670.074,672.609,"Well, that's not an adverse action."
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,672.609,674.142,That's not paying them?
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,674.142,675.478,No.
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,686.666,693.439,"Then they demoted him for not showing up on a day he was told he could go home, because the regulation says you don't have to work past 3:00."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,700.593,706.43,"--And excepted service employee who wasn't a veteran, we don't think there would be review there."
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,708.365,710.115,Even if there was a flagrant violation of a regulation.
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,710.115,715.936,"--Well, we have held open the possibility not presented here that in an appropriate case mandamus might be warranted--"
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,715.936,716.636,Well.
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,716.636,722.506,--if an agency just flatly refuses to follow its regulation.
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.506,729.945,"Your response is that that's okay, that anyway they should have just fired him for no reason at all instead of for not coming in on a day when he didn't have to come in."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,729.945,735.849,"No, no, but that's not our response, and an agency certainly should follow the regulations."
1987.86-595,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,776.124,795.22,"--he said, if he were a competitive service employee and was charged with this offense, no adverse action against him as a competitive service employee except pursuant to Chapter 75 with all its procedural guarantees; is that right?"
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,795.22,799.505,"--Yes, if he were a competitive service employee, he would have all sorts of rights."
1987.86-595,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,799.505,802.541,"He'd have all kinds of hearings and all the rest of it, wouldn't he?"
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,802.541,804.826,Ultimately go to the Merit Systems Protection Board.
1987.86-595,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,804.826,805.509,But here he gets nothing.
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,805.509,807.259,And from there to the federal circuit.
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.185,824.154,What lets him file a grievance?
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,824.154,826.505,The Interior regulation.
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,826.505,831.707,And that could have been disregarded also and there would have been no relief except for mandamus.
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,831.707,832.307,That's right.
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.908,915.645,"Was he a long... a long-time employee of the government, or a temporary employee, or what?"
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,915.645,917.561,--He was a temporary employee.
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,982.771,986.389,May I ask you one other question?
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,999.531,1002.316,It's about 20 percent.
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.969,1008.086,"That's a lot of people then, isn't it?"
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1008.086,1009.752,--There are quite a few.
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.381,1030.832,"It includes all lawyers in the Executive Branch, doesn't it?"
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1030.832,1031.382,That's right.
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1043.323,1045.342,"If it includes all lawyers, you must have a conflict of interest."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1046.942,1058.233,"Justice Stevens, the Office of Legal Counsel has considered that question, and has decided that it's unlikely I'll be subjected to an adverse action so I--"
1987.86-595,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1234.543,1237.745,Is it that the Respondent's group can only use mandamus?
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1237.745,1246.851,"They can file grievance procedures and it's not presented here, but one would think that in an appropriate case mandamus might be warranted."
1987.86-595,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1250.653,1256.742,"--in mandamus, do you know of any one mandamus that's been granted?"
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1256.742,1262.211,We cited one in our brief in a classification case.
1987.86-595,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1262.211,1262.729,Any more?
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1262.729,1271.584,"Well, if that isn't the case, it must be because agencies are following their regulations."
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1276.62,1288.528,"Is it not true, you say that he would have these procedural rights if he had been included by... who puts him in there?"
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1288.528,1289.278,OPM.
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1289.278,1290.861,By OPM with Chapter 75.
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1290.861,1292.413,OPM in Chapter 75.11(c).
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1293.23,1293.73,All right.
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1293.73,1294.646,--that OPM can do this.
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.646,1306.99,"But isn't it true that OPM has to affirmatively include him not only in order that he have those remedies, but in order that he be included within that chapter at all?"
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1319.213,1321.28,I think all that chapter does is grant rights.
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.184,1352.884,"Well, now wait a minute."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1355.886,1359.172,That's for minor adverse actions.
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1361.09,1362.307,"Well, whatever."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1383.454,1391.977,"--Well, that's the short-term... I assume you would make an analogous argument under 75.12."
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1391.977,1392.595,"Right, right."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1403.134,1409.938,"Well, in the case of an excepted service employee, you don't need any authority."
1987.86-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1420.412,1423.697,I'm puzzled.
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1429.768,1437.855,75.11(a) says employee means an individual in the competitive service who is not serving a probationary or trial period.
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1442.991,1443.308,"Oh, I see."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1444.61,1452.597,"--And then part (c)... which is the subsection governing major adverse actions, suspensions for more than 14 days or dismissals."
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1501.114,1505.232,"When you use the term Chapter 75, you really mean Subchapter 2 of Chapter 75."
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1505.232,1506.601,--That's the major adverse action part.
1987.86-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1506.601,1509.903,Because in Subchapter 1 they don't have that same definition.
1987.86-595,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1509.903,1510.253,No.
1987.86-595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.179,1605.648,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,1607.581,1630.596,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.515,2004.05,What about to other employees?
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2004.05,2004.966,--I'm sorry?
1987.86-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2004.966,2009.852,Would other employees continue to have their pre-existing rights to get into federal court--
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2009.852,2010.804,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.804,2016.608,--apart from the scheme set forth in Chapter 75 of getting there after going through the MSPB?
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2016.608,2017.274,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.175,2055.983,"Isn't there a certain irony there then that the people not covered by Chapter 75 can go directly to court, whereas those who are covered have to work their way up through the administrative procedure?"
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2055.983,2070.158,"Your Honor, I think there certainly would be if that were the fact applicable to Mr. Fausto, and the government endeavors to characterize Mr. Fausto's rights as I think more powerful engines of enforcement, for example, than are available to competitive service employees."
1987.86-595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2090.906,2096.06,What was the source of the authority requiring him to exhaust the administrative remedies?
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2096.06,2101.095,"--Your Honor, I don't believe that there was a specific exhaustion requirement."
1987.86-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2127.912,2152.98,"Unless the agency establishes a grievance system for this category of employee, which it is under no obligation to do, the situation would be that he could go directly to federal court, whereas those employees of a supposedly more protected status would have to go to the MSPB."
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2152.98,2155.182,"Your Honor, I think there are two responses to that."
1987.86-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2155.715,2170.358,"And indeed, in some cases would not even be able to go to the MSPB; would have no relief, depending upon what the level of the sanction was, except asking the counsel to consider their grievance, whereas he would be able to go federal court no matter what."
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2170.358,2180.047,"--Your Honor, in the first instance, the Office of Personnel Management has promulgated regulations that do require all agencies to promulgate and adopt an agency grievance mechanism."
1987.86-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.047,2188.534,"Well, that's a fortunate happenstance, but that doesn't speak to the rationality of the legislative scheme that does not require such a regulation to be issued."
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2206.947,2221.272,"If an employee such as Mr. Fausto were to endeavor to do so, he would be met I think with a more formidable problem, because he would have no agency regulation that had been violated to predicate his claim under the Tucker Act."
1987.86-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.919,2250.525,"Well, that's the case with his particular grievance, but you can have another grievance that doesn't consist of the lack of a promised hearing."
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2250.525,2252.893,"Well, to the extent, Your Honor--"
1987.86-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2252.893,2255.512,Something else that went wrong in the adverse action.
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2255.512,2261.415,"--Well, I think there might be some difficulty if an employee were endeavoring to try to get a court to review the merits of the claim."
1987.86-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2267.902,2278.175,"But do you agree that absent some regulation giving a person in the excepted service some both either substantive right or procedural right, that person is subject to termination at will?"
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2278.175,2280.56,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.566,2296.589,Doesn't Chapter 43 include the employees in the excepted service?
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2296.589,2298.772,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1987.86-595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.772,2301.188,And deals with people like Fausto.
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2301.188,2302.14,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1987.86-595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2302.14,2310.061,And says that... and sets up some required procedures for personnel actions?
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2310.061,2310.58,Formal actions.
1987.86-595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2313.532,2316.734,So the statute at least in some respects does deal with the excepted service--
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2316.734,2318.584,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, and I would concede that."
1987.86-595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.157,2362.945,"--At least on the face of the statute, the statute deals with the excepted service in Chapter 43, and just doesn't provide for the same kinds of remedies as the nonexcepted employees."
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2362.945,2364.13,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's absolutely correct."
1987.86-595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.514,2374.153,"Well, it must be that Congress was probably aware of the statute it was passing regardless of the origin of the various chapter."
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2374.153,2375.753,"--Oh, I'm sure it was aware of it, Your Honor."
1987.86-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2426.252,2438.226,"Mr. Nannes, if I understand it, you are not relying at all on the fact that the dismissal in this case invoked the unauthorized use of the government vehicle statute."
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2452.384,2460.473,It might be... it might have been exceptionally more difficult for Mr. Fausto to so proceed because he was relying upon the rights established for him by regulation.
1987.86-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2468.06,2472.03,The regulatory violations being what now?
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2472.03,2477.351,"In this instance it was the failure to notify him of his right to grieve, and the failure to accord him a formal hearing--"
1987.86-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2477.351,2481.136,Wouldn't he have a right to grieve if he had been fired for no reason at all?
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2488.39,2507.953,"--If he had been fired for inefficiency such that it would be regarded as a Chapter 43 dismissal, adverse action based on nonperformance, or misperformance, he would then be governed by Chapter 43 procedures and he would not have had a right to judicial review, although he would have had certain administrative rights to notice."
1987.86-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2507.953,2510.905,Would he have had to have notice?
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2510.905,2513.857,"He would have had to have notice, I think an opportunity to answer and a written decision."
1987.86-595,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2513.857,2519.928,"Mr. Nannes, do you think the decision below is consistent with the Carducci case?"
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2519.928,2525.415,"It's certainly consistent, Your Honor, with respect to the result reached, because it--"
1987.86-595,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2525.415,2534.271,"What about employees subject to very short suspensions, can they go to the Claims Court, do you suppose?"
1987.86-595,1,32216,john_m_nannes,,2534.271,2535.338,"--Let's see, I guess if we were--"
1987.86-595,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3077.564,3086.42,I would like to very briefly address the nature of what actually happened.
1987.86-595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3160.116,3166.555,--goes to whether they should have decided anything?
1987.86-595,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3169.99,3172.406,"No, I... but I just wanted to set--"
1987.86-595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3172.406,3172.942,--Yes.
1987.86-595,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3172.942,3178.227,--clear that the only mistake here was failing to notify him that he had a right to a grievance.
1987.86-595,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3280.627,3283.311,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
