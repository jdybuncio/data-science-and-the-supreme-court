1987.86-787,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.31,"We will hear arguments next in Cecil Hicks, District Attorney for Orange County, California, acting on behalf of Alta Sue Feiock versus Phillip William Feiock."
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,66.661,67.567,Thank you.
1987.86-787,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.612,229.643,What is the present population of Orange County?
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,230.689,231.283,Something in excess of two million.
1987.86-787,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,231.283,231.736,Two million.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,231.736,232.095,Yes.
1987.86-787,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,276.781,287.105,"Well, Mr. Capizzi, the California Court of Appeals held that the California statutes make this contempt proceeding criminal in nature."
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,287.105,289.479,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-787,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,289.479,297.943,"Now, I guess California is entitled to determine that for itself as a matter of state law, isn't it?"
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,297.943,306.878,"Well, it can place whatever label it chooses on a case, and this case the court below did term the case criminal."
1987.86-787,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,308.628,316.796,"So is it a matter, is it a question of federal law for purposes of answering whether the federal constitution is violated?"
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,316.796,327.323,--I think that unquestionably it is and be that as it may I would submit that the court below was wrong in terming this case criminal even under California law.
1987.86-787,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,327.323,335.272,"Well, but you don't really want us to get in there, do you, and say that the California Court of Appeals was wrong as a matter of California law?"
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,340.708,348.173,"Well, I think the Court has always looked to the highest court... this Court has looked to the highest court of the state in determining what the state law is."
1987.86-787,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,348.173,356.326,"Well, why would we want to do that if it is a question of federal law for purposes of the federal constitutional question?"
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,371.273,386.939,"No, we merely meant to set the record straight, and point out that the California Supreme Court has held repeatedly that there are still two types of contempt in California, civil and criminal, but that is absolutely correct."
1987.86-787,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,450.695,458.175,"But it is up to California to decide what it is coming with a... I mean, that is a purposive test, and it is California's purpose."
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,461.408,464.314,"--California has not said that it is criminal, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-787,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.314,466.579,You are arguing that it doesn't matter what California said.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,483.009,483.931,That's correct.
1987.86-787,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,483.931,489.007,It has applied certain protections that are normally applicable in a criminal context.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,490.912,492.568,"Yes, Justice Blackmun, that is correct."
1987.86-787,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,510.67,511.405,That is a different issue.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,530.256,562.196,"If California should suggest, Justice Scalia, that in a civil case where there are punitive damages those are penal in nature, as they have said in contempt proceedings, the potential of a jail sentence is penal, and because punitive damages are potentially penal, we are going to extend the procedural safeguards of a criminal case, not because they are constitutionally required, but because as a state we are going to extend those rights in the civil case."
1987.86-787,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,622.672,642.491,"Mr. Capizzi, I am looking at page A6 of the petition for writ of certiorari where you have the opinion of the Court of Appeal, and I am looking at the second full paragraph on the page, the second sentence, where its says,"
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,661.172,663.03,No.
1987.86-787,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.012,677.229,Have there been other cases from the Supreme Court of California that have said this kind of proceeding is a criminal rather than a civil proceeding?
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,677.229,677.635,No.
1987.86-787,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.164,685.381,"Roder wasn't a contempt case, was it?"
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,685.381,685.646,"No, it was not a contempt."
1987.86-787,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,693.752,699.845,"What significance do you give to the sentence on page A8, contempt is quasi-criminal and requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt?"
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,699.845,707.528,That is what the California courts have required for in excess of 100 years.
1987.86-787,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,707.528,710.169,In civil contempt proceedings as well as criminal?
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,710.169,756.242,"In civil as well as criminal, and that is why civil contempt proceedings because they have the potential for a jail sentence if the coercive order is violated, they have been given in civil contempt proceedings many of the procedural safeguards that would otherwise be available to a criminal defendant, and as a result, over the 100 years or so, the civil contempt proceedings have been referred to as quasi-criminal and criminal in nature, but that doesn't make them criminal substantively, and as this Court has said in Shilitani versus United States, that we are going to look at the substance, not the procedure by which the order for contempt came about."
1987.86-787,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.473,808.94,What was the procedure that was involved there that we said was not necessary?
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,808.94,811.971,In Shillitani?
1987.86-787,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,811.971,812.5,Yes.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,812.5,813.688,It was the jury trial--
1987.86-787,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.688,837.288,"Now, you are urging here that what is not necessary is not only... not only the burden of persuasion... not only the burden of initiation of the evidence, production being placed on the plaintiff, but also the burden of persuasion."
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,867.433,870.948,"--No, we are not, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-787,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.58,897.295,The Court of Appeals certainly ruled clearly enough that the burden of proving the ability to pay is on the prosecution.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,897.295,904.526,"The Court expressed that, and again--"
1987.86-787,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.526,906.478,As a matter of California law.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,906.478,909.712,"--But it misstated California law, Justice White."
1987.86-787,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,909.712,919.395,"Well, I don't know how you can convince us of that, but I thought that... I didn't read your brief and disagree especially with that."
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,927.079,931.297,The statute points out that if there is an order--
1987.86-787,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,931.297,931.625,Right.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,931.625,933.358,--there is knowledge of the order--
1987.86-787,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.358,933.811,Yes.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,933.811,946.338,"--and there is a violation, it hasn't been paid, that that is prima facie evidence of contempt, and even if we are to--"
1987.86-787,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,946.338,956.896,You are just saying that the statute says that the prosecution's burden is satisfied when you prove the things that you just mentioned.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,956.896,968.471,"--That is correct, and that is consistent with an early California Supreme Court case, In re McCarty, which likewise said those are the three elements of contempt."
1987.86-787,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.246,990.555,Did your brief argue that this statute shifted the burden of persuasion on ability?
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,993.459,996.583,The court below--
1987.86-787,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.583,998.427,What about your brief?
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,998.427,1009.251,--Our brief expresses that it shifts to the respondent the burden of production.
1987.86-787,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.251,1017.201,But the burden of proving ability rests on the... remains on the prosecution.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1017.201,1020.48,"No, the... again--"
1987.86-787,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1020.48,1021.292,"Well, you can't do it both ways."
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1021.292,1030.226,--the California Supreme Court has repeatedly said that inability to pay is an affirmative defense.
1987.86-787,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.226,1031.224,Yes.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1031.224,1040.707,And as an affirmative defense the respondent has the burden of producing evidence.
1987.86-787,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1040.707,1042.067,"Well, we have got--"
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1062.901,1063.104,No.
1987.86-787,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.104,1064.572,It seems to me that could take--
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1064.572,1064.822,No.
1987.86-787,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.822,1065.478,--You don't say that.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1065.478,1066.353,"Justice Scalia, what we--"
1987.86-787,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1066.353,1068.056,"But that is what the Court of Appeals said, isn't it?"
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1068.056,1068.837,--The Court of Appeals said--
1987.86-787,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1068.837,1075.24,The Court of Appeals said that California law puts the burden of persuasion on the respondent.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1080.269,1082.174,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-787,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1082.174,1085.174,"Again, you don't want us to decide that, do you?"
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1085.174,1086.643,I don't think it is necessary.
1987.86-787,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1111.414,1117.13,"Well, Rylander involved a situation where only the burden of production shifted."
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1117.13,1119.989,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-787,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1119.989,1132.282,"Well, do you lose this case if the burden of persuasion is also involved and placed on the defendant?"
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1132.282,1134.032,"No, I don't believe we do."
1987.86-787,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1134.032,1134.827,"I don't think you do, either."
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1134.827,1147.01,"It is a civil case, and regardless of whether it is the burden of persuasion or the burden of production, there is a rational connection between the proven fact and the presumed fact."
1987.86-787,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.693,1291.139,"Mr. Capizzi, whether California decides to or not, and whether you argue it here or not, I had the impression... I don't know which of the briefs I got it from, that most states do place the burden on the defendant, not just for production but of persuasion."
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1291.389,1291.92,That's correct.
1987.86-787,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1291.92,1292.701,--That is correct.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1292.701,1296.2,It is a burden of producing... or burden of proof in most states.
1987.86-787,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1475.376,1478.094,Let me ask you one final question.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1485.966,1487.122,--Yes.
1987.86-787,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1487.122,1492.572,And concluded that there was ability to pay with respect to at least a portion of the disputed period.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1526.903,1532.807,"He did, Justice Stevens, make a finding that there was ability to pay."
1987.86-787,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.979,1569.26,Right.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1569.26,1574.477,And then made the findings that he had the ability to pay and entered the coercive order.
1987.86-787,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.477,1584.677,What I am really asking is whether in the actual decision of this case did the allocation of the burden of proof actually have any impact on the outcome.
1987.86-787,0,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,1584.677,1588.393,"Not the ultimate result, no."
1987.86-787,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.649,1612.29,"Thank you, Mr. Capizzi."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,1614.618,1635.14,"Mr. Chief Justice and the associate Justices of the Supreme Court, and may it please the Court, the issue, contrary to a number of the amicus briefs that were filed in this case, I would suggest, is rather narrow, and I would suggest it has almost no national importance."
1987.86-787,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1789.28,1804.197,"Mr. Schwartzberg, it seems to me that what the California Court of Appeals did ultimately was to say that the California statute as applied here was invalid as a matter of federal constitutional law."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,1804.197,1805.603,"I would concede that, yes."
1987.86-787,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1805.603,1822.173,So is it not also a question of federal law whether this statute is indeed civil in nature or criminal for purposes of answering the federal constitutional question?
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,1822.173,1824.08,"No, Justice O'Connor, no more than--"
1987.86-787,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1824.08,1824.376,No?
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,1840.902,1843.244,"--Well, I think the answer to that is this."
1987.86-787,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1865.577,1888.71,"Well, Mr. Schwartzberg, what about a case like Shillitani v. The United States which at least indicates that we are free to examine the purpose of the contempt proceeding and characterize it as civil in this instance because it was for the purpose of coercing the payment of the money."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,1888.71,1895.317,"I don't know how to reconcile that with California, and I think California would have trouble reconciling it with Shillitani."
1987.86-787,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1914.511,1918.697,"Well, I think that is perfectly all right if California wants to do that."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,1936.113,1939.08,I think the difficulty with that is that we are putting the cart before the horse.
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.285,1983.124,"I assume that to some extent, the answer to Justice O'Connor's question must depend upon what the Federal test for criminality is."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2008.411,2010.146,"--Not only that, but I would go one step further."
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2066.262,2069.697,May I pursue Justice O'Connor's inquiry with a hypothetical?
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2107.448,2119.615,"Well, I am having a little bit of trouble with the analogy because I am not entirely certain as to whether the courts are determining that the civil cause of action is itself a crime."
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.615,2123.646,"Yes, the statute says: Negligent operation of the vehicle is a crime."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2141.404,2145.886,I would be less than frank if I told the Court I really can answer that question.
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2153.165,2153.321,No.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2161.068,2171.079,I hope that this does not devolve into a semantics debate because I don't think that when we say we are calling it a crime that that is all we are doing and that it is not a crime in fact.
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2171.079,2186.276,"But do you say, though, that the California rules applicable to this kind of proceeding should be judged by the same standards that apply to similar rules that produce similar consequences in other states except they don't call it a crime."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2186.276,2187.776,I don't think that they have anything to do with each other.
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2188.823,2191.353,"So, our case pertains only to California?"
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2191.353,2191.665,Yes.
1987.86-787,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2198.429,2211.562,"Well, what if California that has a statute that says, for negligently driving while drunk, you can have your license revoked, your motor vehicle operator's permit revoked, and the California courts say,"
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2234.429,2279.019,"Well, I think the answer to that is that if the California court's interpretation is unambiguous that notwithstanding the fact that this may only involve an administrative penalty, whether it is loss of license, loss of privilege, loss of money or jail, I think that if the California court says that in California, that act is a crime, then I think this court, not bound to accept that determination, in effect, I think this Court must apply those Federal constitutional guarantees which apply to a criminal act within the context of this Court's decisions."
1987.86-787,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2318.458,2321.3,"But how does one ""know"" that it is a crime?"
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2321.3,2326.454,"--Because the courts have, since 1893, defined it as a crime and have treated it as a crime."
1987.86-787,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2326.454,2327.454,And that's all it takes?
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2331.061,2336.044,"Well, I am not suggesting--"
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.044,2343.245,"Could you tell me, Mr. Schwartzberg, could you tell me, because it makes a difference to my answer to the question we are discussing why California has said it is a crime?"
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2347.211,2347.477,--Yes.
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2347.477,2349.803,As opposed to a coercion?
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2352.038,2358.504,"I don't think there is any doubt that the cases have always defined this as a crime because, as the courts say, the ultimate result is punishment."
1987.86-787,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2384.915,2394.723,"Well, Mr. Schwartzberg, isn't the California procedure California's response to the uniform reciprocal support law requirements?"
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2394.723,2397.503,"--Well, California's response as to what, Justice O'Connor?"
1987.86-787,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2397.503,2407.547,"Well, there is a uniform act as you know designed to enable parents with custody of a child to obtain child support."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2407.547,2407.781,Yes.
1987.86-787,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2407.781,2417.823,"And each state, including California, has responded to that by having provisions such as this for contempt proceedings, for non-payment of child support."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2417.823,2418.651,Yes.
1987.86-787,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2418.651,2423.711,And isn't this California's participation in that scheme?
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2423.711,2432.177,"Well, the 1209.5 may be, Justice O'Connor, but the original 1209 statute which presents a contempt remedy is not--"
1987.86-787,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2432.177,2434.817,"Well, 1209.5 is what we are dealing with."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2434.817,2435.052,--Yes.
1987.86-787,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2435.052,2450.684,"And there is an indication, is there not, in that uniform act that these proceedings are civil in nature for purposes of the uniform act and are designed to coerce the parent who is not making the payments to make the payments."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2454.526,2458.901,"There is no question about that, but that act does not supercede 1209."
1987.86-787,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2461.462,2473.098,Would it be more accurate to say they have dealt with contempt proceedings as a matter of California law as quasi-criminal?
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2476.425,2487.671,"I would say that the courts when they get to the issue of what species this is, whether it is criminal or civil, have used a number of different labels to govern it."
1987.86-787,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2515.486,2533.01,"Well, don't you suppose, Mr. Schwartzberg, that because one of the consequences of this coercive proceeding may be imposition of a jail term that a state as a matter of state law might want to build in extra protections, such as a higher standard of proof."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2533.01,2544.568,"But, Justice O'Connor, I would agree with you if I could find in the cases... and I have read them over and over, again... any reference either to California's own constitutional provisions which govern the Fifth Amendment which govern the right to counsel."
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2576.54,2577.477,Before you get there.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2577.477,2578.383,--All right.
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.383,2588.69,"Do the California courts make any difference between an order in a case like this which says, the defendant's fault in the court and the court says,"
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2612.369,2615.273,There is absolutely no distinction in the procedural--
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2615.273,2617.351,Both of them are called coercive.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2617.351,2619.382,--Criminal.
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2619.382,2620.163,Criminal.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2620.163,2638.641,"Yes, in fact, when the Court looks at City of Culver City v. Superior Court, essentially, the petitioners in Culver City stand before the court asking them to tell them what kind of contempt this is because they are obviously looking at other jurisdictions and recognizing that depending on what kind of a contempt it is, they get different rights."
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2669.581,2681.825,"Yes, but in this very case, if this man came up with the money that is in arreared and paid it in the court or paid it for his children's support, would he not immediately get out of jail?"
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2681.825,2685.059,"Well, first of all, he is not in jail and never was."
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2696.413,2701.506,"And what I am saying is if he makes the past payments, he won't go to jail, if he complies with the order."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2701.506,2707.863,"It is clear that essentially through the minority of his children's lives, if he never misses a payment he will not go to jail."
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2707.863,2712.751,"So, it is clear that this order in other jurisdictions would be treated as a coercive and a civil contempt."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2712.751,2713.438,Correct.
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2723.027,2729.9,"See, you are suggesting, I think, in my hypothetical example about a negligence case, if a state not only called it a crime, but also said,"
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2742.801,2744.926,"No, not based upon what you just said."
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.845,2757.202,"Well, it comes from California or my hypothetical state's mistaken belief it was compelled to do so by the Federal Constitution."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2757.202,2761.186,"Well, if you assume it is erroneous then, obviously, I lose."
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2763.278,2766.197,They say it was based on the Federal Constitution and that's why they do it.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2774.491,2777.068,"Well, I wouldn't put it that way."
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2777.068,2778.381,--What else do you have in this case?
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2782.707,2783.004,Sure.
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2784.129,2787.659,It is a crime because they call it a crime.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2787.659,2788.72,But that is always the predicate.
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.953,2792.469,No.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2798.732,2801.184,"Well, then maybe we ought to make it clear."
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2808.477,2812.961,"--Yes, they are because the defendant here carries the key to the prison--"
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2812.961,2816.162,And so does every other criminal defendant in California.
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2830.813,2832.499,"--Yes, but it could also say,"
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2835.388,2837.498,And so can they under the civil contempt statute.
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2850.163,2855.833,"But if he does that, then I think everyone would agree that is the equivalent of a criminal procedure."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2855.833,2862.55,But we don't define whether a matter is criminal after we find out what the sentencing is when the state has already said that it is criminal.
1987.86-787,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2864.876,2880.074,"Could I ask you, Mr. Schwartzberg, if we disagree with you and say that California's notion about whether this law is criminal or civil doesn't bind us and we decide that we will treat it as civil, do you lose?"
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2880.074,2881.199,Yes.
1987.86-787,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2881.199,2882.166,Why?
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2882.166,2899.816,"I lose because I would concede that under Rylander and Usury that the inferences, the burden shifting that this statute accomplishes do not offend the Fifth Amendment in civil matters."
1987.86-787,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2903.392,2904.346,Yes.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2904.549,2908.157,Let me go a little bit further here and indicate to the Court this.
1987.86-787,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2973.131,2984.813,"Well, yes, but the Court of Appeal didn't give short shrift to the notion that this is the kind of a proceeding in which shifting the burden of persuasion is unconstitutional."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,2984.813,2998.387,"--No, because they knew from the outset that they were dealing with a crime in California, and once they had that as a predicate, then the only other question that they had to resolve was whether the wording of 1209.5 offended the Fifth Amendment, and they didn't have any trouble reaching that conclusion either."
1987.86-787,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3006.086,3018.472,You seem to be arguing that we just aren't entitled at all to ask whether or not this is close enough to a crime to trigger these protections.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3018.472,3023.314,"I would be fearful to use the word entitled, but I would hope to argue to the Court--"
1987.86-787,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3023.314,3023.923,Don't be fearful.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3023.923,3030.311,"--I would hope to argue to the Court that, yes, the answer is is that this case is very similar in some respects to Runi."
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3101.579,3107.545,So the example would have to be they made it a felony but they way the only remedy for committing this felony is an injunction or a cease and desist order.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3110.216,3111.652,I don't know.
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3134.972,3138.626,But I think you have agreed that California could solve this problem.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3146.249,3148.265,"Justice Stevens, they did, and they got one vote."
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3166.024,3178.034,"If that is true and they want to keep this burden of proof, they can, no matter what we decide, they can say as a matter of California law we are still going to require that the burden of proof on this issue be placed on the other party."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3178.034,3182.095,"I don't think they can do that as long as the Fifth Amendment exists, but I think what they can't do--"
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3182.095,3184.907,"No, no, no, I mean they could take your position, which you say they have now."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3184.907,3185.673,--They don't need to.
1987.86-787,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3190.483,3199.557,"What I am suggesting is, if you should lose this case in this Court on the federal theory, they could still, as you say as a matter of California policy this is the result they want, they could easily--"
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3199.557,3200.682,"--No question, Your Honor."
1987.86-787,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3202.979,3204.962,--You have your own Fifth Amendment.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3204.962,3210.709,"--Well, we do, but I think that our courts are going to be less inclined to utilize it in the near future."
1987.86-787,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3210.709,3213.068,You can't apply it differently?
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3213.068,3214.287,"No, I don't think that."
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3221.517,3225.453,"Mr. Schwartzberg, what about this as a way of out of your semantical box."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3253.209,3254.551,And I would suggest that does not happen in this case.
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3254.551,3255.035,That is right.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3255.035,3256.831,Absolutely.
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3256.831,3259.799,"What is here is, you are going to jail for not having paid previously."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3259.799,3260.081,Correct.
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3260.081,3266.421,"And that, if you call that coercive, then every criminal penalty is coercive."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3273.809,3274.481,There is no question.
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3275.417,3276.886,That couldn't be what we mean by coercive.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3276.886,3296.972,"--The only concern I have is that I think that petitioner is going to argue to this Court two minutes is that merely facing that jail sentence is going to scare these people into paying their money, and that is what makes it coercive, but the same argument is true that that is supposed to stop crime, because if we know we might go to jail if we are caught, somehow crime won't occur and we know that that is baloney so it is not--"
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3296.972,3298.222,Why don't you make that argument to us?
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3299.439,3307.326,"--Well, I haven't made it because of the difficulty in grappling with how the California courts go back and forth between the definition of what is a civil versus criminal contempt."
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3308.247,3310.559,Do most of these proceedings arise in the fashion that this one is--
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3310.559,3311.418,Yes.
1987.86-787,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3311.418,3315.229,"--that is, the defendant has said you haven't made payments in the past and therefore go to jail?"
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3321.524,3336.986,"I would venture to say that most judges attempt the rod before they put them in jail, and the answer is, yes, most defendants are placed on probation just as I would venture to say that most criminal defendants in the traditional criminal sense are placed on probation for first and second, maybe sometimes--"
1987.86-787,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.986,3344.921,"But if a judge says, you haven't paid, therefore you got jail, and he goes to jail, if he then comes up with his past payments, he gets out."
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3344.921,3346.389,"--No, not in California."
1987.86-787,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3346.764,3347.248,That is it.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3347.248,3347.748,You just do your time.
1987.86-787,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3347.748,3348.279,That's the difference.
1987.86-787,1,40430,richard_lynn_schwartzberg,,3348.279,3348.92,You do your time.
1987.86-787,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3386.638,3387.669,"Thank you, Mr. Schwartzberg."
1987.86-787,2,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,3389.653,3406.818,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it may please the Court, if there was such a defendant in jail and he did have the money, we would be so willing and happy to take that money for the children it is undoubtedly--"
1987.86-787,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.818,3409.129,"Yes, but how about the judge?"
1987.86-787,2,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,3409.129,3409.754,--I think the judge would--
1987.86-787,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3409.754,3416.251,"If he puts him in jail for not having paid for a term, he may not let him out just because he comes up with the money."
1987.86-787,2,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,3416.251,3428.247,"--Where it is the coercive element that is trying to be utilized, and the entire thrust of these proceedings is to coerce payment, to get the payment for that child, and it is only as a last resort that the jail--"
1987.86-787,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3428.247,3438.742,"Well, Mr. Capizzi, is it true as your opponent says, that in California the jail is imposed only as punishment, not as future coercion?"
1987.86-787,2,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,3438.742,3440.663,"--No, that is absolutely incorrect, and--"
1987.86-787,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3440.663,3443.661,So he is wrong as a matter of California law?
1987.86-787,2,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,3443.661,3448.129,"--He is wrong, and I think the judgment of the Court in this case indicated that he is wrong."
1987.86-787,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3460.295,3469.48,"The sentence itself, before its suspension, which is what we are arguing about, the sentence itself was a sentence or having failed to make past payments."
1987.86-787,2,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,3487.239,3487.94,Absolutely.
1987.86-787,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3491.627,3493.143,I am talking about the original sentence.
1987.86-787,2,35577,michael_r_capizzi,,3495.844,3511.353,"--But the sentence was suspended because Mr. Feiock didn't have the wherewithal to pay the $1,650 at the time he was given a payment schedule and told to reduce the arrearage at the rate of $50 per month."
1987.86-787,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3590.992,3592.726,"Your time has expired, Mr. Capizzi."
