1991.91-72,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.654,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-72, Federal Trade Commission v. Ticor Title Insurance Company."
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,9.622,13.474,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-72,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,320.658,338.186,"Mr. Wallace, under your standard as proposed, I wonder how a regulated entity or business would ever know whether the action was going to be protected by Parker immunity?"
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,351.362,353.212,Of course--
1991.91-72,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,353.212,367.455,"And to leave it open, as you suggest, to evaluating in each case the extent to which the State is... the quality of its activity seems to me problematic."
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,367.455,386.351,"--If I may say so, Justice O'Connor, that's several questions rolled into one, and to start at the end, the standard we are proposing and the standard you just described are two different standards."
1991.91-72,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,411.982,425.974,"Well, do you mean the States could never employ the so-called negative option approach that was used here whereby you file the rate, it goes into effect unless the State disapproves it?"
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,430.712,444.703,Professors Areeda and Turner in their analysis came to the conclusion that the negative option approach really cannot suffice as an adequate method of State supervision.
1991.91-72,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,496.988,501.141,--Aren't you getting into the substance of the State regulation if you go that far?
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,501.141,503.657,We don't believe so.
1991.91-72,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,540.996,563.075,"Excuse me, how does the individual who has to know whether he can apply that rate that he's agreed with, with other people pursuant to this State scheme, how does he know it... I mean if the State agency just has a regular procedure whereby the clerk of the State agency after 30 days issues an order saying the rates are hereby approved and the individual doesn't really know whether they looked at them or didn't look at them?"
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,564.109,576.05,--Then he has to find out before he engages in conduct that would be a per se violation of the Sherman Act and similarly a violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.
1991.91-72,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.05,576.669,But how does he find out?
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,578.319,600.951,"He has to find out by asking the officials so that he's got an answer from the State that will stand up under scrutiny in proceedings of this kind so that he can make his defense that yes, I engaged in price fixing with my competitors, but the prices were approved by the State."
1991.91-72,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.951,610.39,"What if the order is not signed by the clerk but is in fact signed by the agency heads, a majority of them or all of them, but in fact they don't look at it, they just sign it routinely."
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,614.342,618.746,This is a difficult question of fact.
1991.91-72,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.746,619.096,I know it is.
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,619.896,628.351,I'm not going to say the fact that the agency officials signed an order is a conclusive showing that they reviewed and approved the rates.
1991.91-72,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,628.351,629.018,It is not.
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,629.018,630.886,It's not a conclusive showing.
1991.91-72,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,632.37,636.338,You're really putting the title companies in an extraordinary position.
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,654.55,659.37,They are acting on the advice of counsel in conducting their business.
1991.91-72,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,680.05,692.525,How would they go about finding out more about... I take it what you're suggesting is that they interrogate the people responsible for the decision as to how the decision in that particular case was reached?
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,692.525,696.495,"--Well, that is one way of going about it."
1991.91-72,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,696.495,697.462,What would be another way?
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,697.462,706.685,"Well, obviously with a public utility commission that issues a decision or that holds a hearing, you've got a written record."
1991.91-72,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,750.762,756.016,In a close case it seems to me that the inquiry will be after the fact of the conduct.
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,777.697,796.659,"Well, it has to know, for business planning purposes it certainly is better for it to know that none of these State schemes compel the companies to charge uniform rates, even if a submission has been made."
1991.91-72,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,913.903,915.936,"May I interrupt with a question, Mr. Wallace?"
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,933.047,955.48,"Well, the various statutes articulate mostly policies to assure that there will not be discriminatory practices and that there will not be unreasonable rate practices, and the submissions--"
1991.91-72,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.48,957.347,"In other words, it's more like the Motor Carrier Act."
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,957.347,966.186,"--The submissions do require supporting data, although in practice sometimes those data were not submitted."
1991.91-72,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.186,971.173,Does the State policy require all the companies to join in the joint program?
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,971.173,976.041,Not so far as I am aware.
1991.91-72,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,981.195,983.331,So that if a big company like--
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,983.331,984.164,--To join in the rate bureau.
1991.91-72,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,984.164,988.885,--Security Title wanted to stay out it could price independently and it wouldn't affect the State policy.
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,988.885,995.788,I'm not aware of any of these programs in which companies are required to join in a rate bureau filing.
1991.91-72,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,999.006,1001.256,"And in fact, are any of these programs still in existence or have they all been abandoned?"
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1001.256,1011.798,"--I am told, though it's not in the record in this case, that the programs are not presently in use, at least pending the outcome of this case."
1991.91-72,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1011.798,1013.666,My guess it probably wouldn't work because they couldn't get the biggest company to participate.
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1013.666,1027.723,After the commission's complaint was filed in this case there were some treble damage actions brought and consolidated in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
1991.91-72,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1042.483,1060.695,"The reason I asked you about the first prong, it seems to me that in order to judge whether there's been adequate supervision of carrying out the State policy, you kind of ought to know what the State policy is, and I'm a little puzzled from the briefs as to just what the States are trying to do here, other than maybe just approve of a joint ratemaking that the companies wanted to get."
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1060.695,1098.903,"Well, we shy away from what we're accused of by filings on the other side from an evaluation of the quality of the State policy, so the Court's cases have made it quite clear in Hoover against Ronwin and others that the States can choose their own policy and it isn't up to Federal courts in deciding whether to confer an antitrust exemption to evaluate whether the policy is a wise one, whether the policy adequately protects consumers in comparison with the antitrust laws and so forth."
1991.91-72,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.452,1126.138,Let me ask one other question.
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1141.313,1142.413,The--
1991.91-72,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.413,1144.182,"--or proceedings, I should say."
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1144.182,1150.602,--There are package rates involved in the submissions to the State officials.
1991.91-72,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1323.131,1332.319,"But in Patrick against Burget the State authority had no authority to review at all the actions of the private authority, did it not?"
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1332.319,1344.711,"--That is true in that case, but not in 324 Liquor, for which the Court relied in the citation immediately following that sentence."
1991.91-72,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.288,1400.381,"Well, Mr. Wallace, you say reviewing the rate itself, which is what you say should be done, and yet you said in answer to a question from Justice Scalia, I believe, that a certificate or an order signed by a majority of the commissioners saying we have reviewed the rate and find it conforms to the State policy would not be conclusive."
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1400.381,1414.223,"Well, you have added a little bit to the way he formulated the hypothetical I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, and it would be stronger evidence if they said we have reviewed the substance of the rate."
1991.91-72,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1414.223,1414.94,Would it be conclusive?
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1414.94,1427.998,I hesitate to say that any one piece of evidence would always be conclusive regardless of what other evidence there is in a particular case.
1991.91-72,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1455.415,1460.818,"At any rate, you're dealing with something that usually is a question of fact in every case."
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1460.818,1461.085,Exactly so.
1991.91-72,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1461.085,1469.841,"There's no presumption of regularity given to administrative proceedings, so that ordinarily turns those things into more questions of law than questions of fact."
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1469.841,1483.982,"Well, the presumption of regularity applies when there is a duty to do something and then it's a rebuttable presumption in a particular case."
1991.91-72,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.084,1612.616,"Assume the statute itself told the agency that one of your duties is to review these rate filings to see if you should object to them, and that they have the staff to do it, they've got the money to do it and the State expects the agency to carry out its duties."
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1617.918,1618.604,Well--
1991.91-72,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.604,1620.237,I guess you do.
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1620.237,1637.315,"--I do, because all of those are questions that are subject to debate in a particular case, whether that's a discretionary duty or a mandatory duty, whether the funding and the staff are adequate to perform the duty or inadequate and they really can't perform the duty."
1991.91-72,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.315,1649.289,"I know, but it wouldn't be... it wouldn't make any difference to you how clearly the duty was spelled out, how well it was funded, and how much staff there was available."
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1649.289,1659.228,"Because price restraints must be the policy of the State, the State must have adopted the particular restraint as consistent with its regulatory policies."
1991.91-72,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1661.097,1673.154,"That certainly puts quite a gloss on what we've said before, don't you think, that it takes a specific action of the State to approve the price restraint that--"
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1673.154,1684.026,--What the court has said is that State involvement in what are actually privately imposed price restraints--
1991.91-72,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.026,1687.562,"--That's a far cry from saying they have to approve them, expressly the price restraint."
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1687.562,1697.353,"--Well, it's hard to see why they don't emanate from the private parties themselves if the State has not reviewed and approved them."
1991.91-72,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1698.653,1710.259,"Well, I know, but here the... here the State has got a mandatory scheme in its law set up to require examination and approval of these rates."
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1710.259,1713.413,"--I trust you mean, here is a hypothetical, because--"
1991.91-72,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.413,1713.746,In my hypothetical.
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1713.746,1715.929,--The 36 States that filed--
1991.91-72,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.929,1717.012,"Well, I know, but the rule--"
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1717.012,1718.262,--in this case describe this differently.
1991.91-72,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1718.262,1720.731,--The rule you're asking us to adopt is precisely that.
1991.91-72,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1722.666,1725.118,If I may reserve the balance of my time.
1991.91-72,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1725.118,1727.201,"Very well, Mr. Wallace."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,1728.653,1736.842,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1792.41,1794.845,"Mr. Christie, can I just ask one factual question?"
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,1801.183,1806.487,"Well, the agencies in every case, Justice Stevens, were State insurance departments."
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1806.487,1807.02,I see.
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,1807.02,1813.343,"They only had to worry about insurance matters, but of course they had many lines of insurance in addition to title insurance."
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1813.343,1818.378,"But the same insurance board, State board that would govern fire insurance, life insurance and everything else."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,1818.378,1819.078,That's correct.
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1819.078,1820.83,This was an additional duty for them.
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,1820.83,1839.91,"That's correct, and if I may respond as well to your question to Mr. Wallace, Justice Stevens, about the underlying State policies that these statutes were designed in effect to enforce, all of the statutes in question required that the rates be not excessive, inadequate, or discriminatory."
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1880.951,1882.82,That's the other half of my question.
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,1889.557,1890.926,"No, Your Honor."
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1908.738,1908.904,I see.
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,1908.904,1909.821,--To file them.
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1909.821,1915.975,So even a company that did not participate in joint ratemaking would nevertheless have to file and have its rates approved by the same procedure.
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,1915.975,1916.391,That's correct.
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1916.391,1916.807,I see.
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,1916.807,1917.441,That's correct.
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.441,1922.378,And the State had no special procedure to review those joint filings.
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,1922.378,1936.769,"Justice White, they had no special procedure, although several regulators in the record in this case testified that they gave extra special attention to rates filed by rating bureaus."
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.769,1945.207,"Well, I suppose just single filings might take one standard of review and joint filings would be a different kettle of fish, wouldn't they?"
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,1945.207,1949.945,The Court will recall Justice Powell's discussion of this in Southern Motor Carriers.
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.907,1981.917,"Let me also... let ask you, as long as I've got you interrupted, what do you think the court below meant by the words that the activity is in place, staffed and funded, and shows some basic level of activity?"
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,1981.917,2010.817,I think the Third Circuit intended by those words to suggest that it's appropriate for an antitrust court simply to confirm the seriousness of the State's intent to assure that its policies were being adhered to by looking to see whether in fact the regulatory activity existed.
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.327,2044.157,"Well, I suppose it would be a very basic level of activity if they just received the rates and put them in the right folder without ever... without ever looking at them in terms of whether they were reasonable or whatever the standard was."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2044.157,2061.452,"Well, I don't think... if you intend by your hypothetical, Justice White, to suggest that... to ask whether the Third Circuit's test is filed... is met if the regulators do nothing, I would agree, I don't think the Third Circuit's test would be met."
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2089.018,2109.599,"Well, if the State's policy... if you define the State's policy as a decision to permit noncompetitive rate-making, well, all you would have to do is to look at these filed rates and say, why, of course these people have agreed."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2117.455,2122.74,"Well, the regulators are charged by their statute to consider more."
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.215,2137.75,That's with respect to joint rates and--
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2137.75,2139.701,And individually filed rates.
1991.91-72,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2145.105,2156.663,"--Now, there's an amicus brief filed by 30-some-odd States in this case suggesting there's no active supervision here."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2156.663,2159.448,"Justice O'Connor, you're right."
1991.91-72,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2200.109,2220.403,"Although it wasn't specific in the submission of the States that were supporting the petitioner, there was a suggestion that perhaps a State should participate at two levels, both at the level at which the rate is initially determined before filing and in the review after filing."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2227.759,2245.638,"I don't think, at least, Justice Kennedy, insofar as the record is established here, that there's an indication that the regulators participated in the sense of sitting down with the bureau itself as it determined what rates it wished to file."
1991.91-72,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2305.759,2313.782,"Mr. Christie, are there any States today that use this negative option approach for this industry?"
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2313.782,2349.871,"Justice O'Connor, the amicus brief filed by the American Insurance Association sets out at considerable length in an appendix all of the States classified by various ways in which they in effect allow rates to become in effect, and their catalogue of what States do suggests that the most frequently used procedure which the States have designed is the so-called demur or negative option procedure."
1991.91-72,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.869,2369.952,"What is the advantage, though?"
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2375.939,2390.699,"Justice Scalia, I think from the State legislature's point of view, the advantage is simply that it doesn't force the insurance regulator to look at each and every filing and take the time to make an affirmative determination that it meets the statutory standard."
1991.91-72,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2390.699,2390.915,Right.
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2391.949,2400.686,"Because obviously, some filings are more significant in terms of their ultimate impact on consumers than other filings."
1991.91-72,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2400.686,2426.17,"Well, suppose the State agency has a general rule... I don't see how it would apply to this title insurance, but it would apply to some other fields of regulation... that any rate that will affect all of the consumers in a total amount of less than $30 million simply won't be reviewed, which might make sense given the staff that the particular agency has available."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2435.192,2438.061,"Well, I don't know that I would think it would be okay."
1991.91-72,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2443.465,2445.131,That's all they do.
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2449.516,2450.366,--Well--
1991.91-72,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2450.366,2451.285,This is what they think.
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2453.001,2468.127,"--That is true, but they were making an individual assessment on a filing by filing basis that this filing doesn't need intensive review on our part because it has minimal consumer impact."
1991.91-72,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2473.864,2474.331,Why?
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2479.983,2487.722,"I submit, Justice Scalia, that these States... this is within the discretion that they give to the regulator."
1991.91-72,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2490.424,2491.024,"I understand they do, but--"
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2491.024,2499.779,They don't want the regulator to be forced to spend the resources she has looking at each and every rate.
1991.91-72,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.779,2515.056,"--So the situation you have left, then, is that under the Federal antitrust laws within that State, people can collude to fix rates so long as they know the take on it isn't more than $1 million within that State, or $30 million, whatever level the State agency picks."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2515.991,2536.321,"As I understand the Third Circuit's... as I read the Third Circuit's opinion, the basic level of activity that they're looking for wouldn't be met in the context of the decision not to look at any rates below--"
1991.91-72,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2536.321,2538.971,"Well, you can't have it both ways, it seems to me, Mr. Christie."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2562.384,2594.272,"--Well, I'm saying that if the record shows, as you look at all that the State did, that State regulators charged with a duty of making sure that their State statutory standards are met in addition to that perform some level of activity consistent with their statutory duty, that that I suffice... suggest is active supervision and it would meet the Third Circuit standard."
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.272,2605.996,Would the answer to Justice Scalia's hypothetical be that it could be sound regulatory practice to rely on the market to take care of these fringe minimum smaller filings?
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2605.996,2615.971,"Well, Justice Stevens, in fact that was precisely the judgment that regulators in Wisconsin made with respect to filings that they considered minor."
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.551,2663.952,"In these States that you represent, was there some legislative explanation for why the decision was made that competition should not be the rule among title insurance companies with respect to examining titles, wholly aside from the insurance?"
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2663.952,2665.987,Justice--
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2665.987,2668.856,It may be historic that--
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2668.856,2691.185,"--Justice White, the insurance statutes didn't distinguish in terms of the rate standard that was to be applied or the duties of the regulators with respect to whether it was that component of the charge that represented the search and examination or that component of the charge that represented the charge for the risk."
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2691.185,2700.225,--Was there some determination that... some explanation of why they thought competition shouldn't be the rule among insurance companies?
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2700.225,2711.949,I don't think that there is any legislative history that would illuminate this intent with one exception.
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2737.5,2738.4,Because they'd been competing?
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2738.4,2743.57,I don't know why they became insolvent.
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.687,2752.676,Or why they would draw this conclusion from the fact that two companies went broke that there shouldn't be competition.
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,2752.676,2772.173,"--Well, they obviously were concerned about insurer insolvency and they felt it was in the State's interests in their wisdom to begin to regulate the rates for title insurance companies and in that instance to permit rating bureaus to operate."
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2990.33,2992.449,"Mr. Christie, something just crossed my mind."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,3005.625,3022.551,"Well, Justice Stevens, at least measured by the commission's perception of the application of the McCarran Act here, you might call it redundant."
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.673,3050.82,"What I mean is... and I'm not saying you're not absolutely correct, but if this is all that's necessary, I'm sure every insurance department throughout the country engages in at least this basic level of activity, so you don't really need a statutory exemption because it will be all taken care of under Parker against Brown."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,3050.82,3083.189,"Well, certainly... certainly as Your Honor recites it, that kind of definition of Parker Brown may in many cases make it unnecessary, if you will, for an insurance company to separately establish a McCarran-Ferguson exemption, but I don't think that should in any way affect this Court's analysis of either."
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3083.189,3087.493,It just suggests that maybe the Southeastern Underwriters case was wrongly decided.
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,3100.301,3102.336,"That's correct, Justice White."
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3102.336,3105.538,"What did the Federal court of appeals say about that, or didn't it reach it?"
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,3105.538,3112.291,They said only that they would defer the issue because having decided for the respondents on the basis--
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.291,3118.278,Was it your position before the commission that McCarran-Ferguson protected you?
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,3118.278,3142.746,"--Absolutely, Justice White, because these search and examination services which title insurers conduct, they conduct as a necessary part of the process of underwriting that they go through, are necessary because it's through this process that they come to conclude what they're willing to insure under the policy and what they're not willing to insure under the policy."
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3142.746,3149.733,The only reason McCarran-Ferguson doesn't cover the whole thing is that some of the activities arguably are not the business of insurance.
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,3149.733,3150.666,"That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3150.666,3160.874,"My hypothetical earlier was assuming, talking only about the business of insurance, and I think under your analysis, and it may well be right, we really don't need the McCarran-Ferguson amendment any more."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,3160.874,3166.075,"Well, of course there are some folks over on the Hill across the street who agree with that."
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3166.075,3170.896,Or the title insurance companies needn't rely on the State action doctrine.
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,3170.896,3173.848,"I'm sorry, Justice White, I missed it."
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3173.848,3175.717,"Well, they don't need both."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,3181.704,3183.787,"Well, in--"
1991.91-72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3183.787,3185.906,"That was your position, I take it, before the commission."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,3185.906,3187.358,--That was our position before the commission.
1991.91-72,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3197.381,3203.035,"Well, of course, with McCarran-Ferguson you would prevail even if it were a totally inactive State."
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,3206.652,3224.781,"Well, I think the regulation by State law aspect of the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption has been pretty well established to be a test that requires a court to simply look at whether by legislation a State has permitted or prohibited the activity in question."
1991.91-72,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3273.511,3283.133,And you think that that's less intrusive upon State sovereignty than simply looking to see whether in fact the rate was considered?
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,3287.621,3294.175,I think it is less intrusive because it looks to the existence as opposed to any effort to assess the quality of the regulation.
1991.91-72,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3351.38,3356.665,"Mr. Christie, may I ask... and perhaps this isn't a proper question, but to what extent is this still a live issue?"
1991.91-72,1,29640,john_c_christie_jr,,3358.95,3367.37,"Well, as I said earlier, Justice Stevens, all of these companies withdrew when the commission began its investigation."
1991.91-72,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3417.953,3419.105,"Thank you, Mr. Christie."
1991.91-72,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3421.023,3435.164,36 States have filed a brief saying that their regulatory options are in fact being constricted by this decision because relatively modest programs would have drastic consequences on consumers.
1991.91-72,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3464.617,3473.039,"Any one of these States could change its policy without any leave from this Court and beef up its regulatory process, couldn't it?"
1991.91-72,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3473.039,3485.966,"That is correct, but the States are arguing that principles of federalism would support their having the option to do more modest programs without having the drastic consequences found here."
1991.91-72,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3485.966,3487.733,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
