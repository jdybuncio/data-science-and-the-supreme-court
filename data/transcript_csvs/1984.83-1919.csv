1984.83-1919,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.496,We will hear arguments first this morning in the City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle.
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,13.386,27.88,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, on the night of October 4, 1980, an Oklahoma City police officer named Julian Rotramel shot and killed a man named William Tuttle."
1984.83-1919,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,365.118,366.336,Mr. Bailey?
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,366.336,366.773,"Yes, ma'am."
1984.83-1919,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,366.773,373.1,Are you objecting to the jury instructions or to the sufficiency of the evidence in the case?
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,374.146,376.457,"Both, Your Honor."
1984.83-1919,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.149,410.521,Did you make your objections to the instructions before the trial court?
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,410.521,439.76,"--The objection was made, Your Honor, not by... I was not at the trial, but the objection was made in chambers, I am advised, and then following... off the record... and then following the giving of the instructions, the trial judge summoned the counsel to the bench, at which point there is an objection in the record by the City Attorney, the Assistant City Attorney trying the case, which is ambiguous."
1984.83-1919,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,469.59,481.883,Is there anything in the record that would enable us to figure out for ourselves whether the trial judge full well knew the meaning of the objection?
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,481.883,491.77,"Yes, Your Honor, there is because this was also raised in pretrial briefs, that is, the single incident objection of the City."
1984.83-1919,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,497.986,506.874,"So you say the term ""single incident"" used by the Assistant City Attorney had taken on a nomenclature that meant something more than just the words alone might mean to the trial judge?"
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,506.874,509.262,"I think there's no question of that, Your Honor."
1984.83-1919,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,509.262,519.291,"But, Mr. Bailey, was there other evidence besides the single incident on the questions of policy or custom?"
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,519.291,525.022,We take the position there was no other evidence on the issue of policy or custom.
1984.83-1919,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,557.79,563.911,But did not bear on whether there was a policy of training which was inadequate?
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,563.911,572.581,"Well, that is our position, Your Honor, that that in and of itself is no showing of an official policy."
1984.83-1919,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,600.726,614.97,"By that, do you mean that they might have introduced evidence that in the previous calendar year, 13 fleeing persons had been shot with no further explanation?"
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,614.97,616.923,"Well, I think that that would be--"
1984.83-1919,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,616.923,622.546,Is that the kind of evidence that you say would have tended to support their case?
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,622.546,631.604,"--I'm not even sure if I would say that, but that is evidence that certainly would point in that direction, that there would be some misbehavior on the part of the police, not necessarily shootings."
1984.83-1919,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,677.148,696.75,"Well, Mr. Bailey, would you take the position that liability could be imposed under Monell, based on a single incident of misconduct, coupled with independent evidence of inadequate training or supervision?"
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,698.201,700.607,"I don't think it is enough, Your Honor."
1984.83-1919,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,754.712,761.725,What if the city or town adopted a policy of hiring police with no training at all?
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,770.69,782.234,"I've thought about that, Your Honor, and frankly I doubt that there is a constitutional duty on the part of a city to train police officers at all."
1984.83-1919,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,798.601,811.722,"Is it not true that many, or at least a considerable number of small communities elect, by popular election, some of their police people, sheriffs, and constables?"
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,811.722,814.033,"They do in the little town I grew up in, Your Honor."
1984.83-1919,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,816.172,818.234,Mr. Bailey--
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,818.234,819.0,"Yes, Your Honor,--"
1984.83-1919,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,819.0,825.934,"--You mentioned, I think, that this officer had been only recently graduated from a police training academy."
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,830.666,834.618,--Tremendous amount of testimony about that.
1984.83-1919,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,838.788,851.799,"Was that offered as a predicate for the conclusion that there was a practice, and that the practice was inadequate to train this officer?"
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,851.799,854.313,"I think that's what it was offered for, Your Honor."
1984.83-1919,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,938.17,948.151,"Well, independently of the challenge you make to the instruction, suppose we were to agree with you that the instruction was error."
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,955.101,957.225,"I doubt that you would have to, Your Honor."
1984.83-1919,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,982.871,994.537,"Mr. Bailey, it seems to me you are making quite a different argument than the question presented in the cert petition, which was focused on the single incident point, rather than whether training can ever be... kind of training can ever be a policy."
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,996.803,997.24,No.
1984.83-1919,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1004.675,1009.938,"--On that point, is it your position that the single incident could never give rise to 1983?"
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1028.962,1031.336,"--Your Honor, I think that points up an interesting distinction in this case."
1984.83-1919,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.786,1081.675,"But then if that's your theory, you are really saying that the evidence doesn't show an invalid policy."
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1085.953,1089.374,"Your Honor, there's a dichotomy there."
1984.83-1919,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1113.41,1124.422,"Well, and yet the instructions do say the existence of such a policy is a question of fact for you to determine, and that was the question; whether there was a policy of putting unqualified people on the street."
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1124.422,1134.636,"That's correct, Your Honor, not that... I doubt in all... I doubt in all truth that the training the officer received had anything to do with this incident."
1984.83-1919,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.214,1139.51,But the jury seems to come to a different conclusion.
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1143.46,1147.928,"--I'm not... the jury found in favor of the officer, Your Honor, as you will recall."
1984.83-1919,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1198.205,1206.873,"Well, juries return verdicts in favor of railroads, or against railroads and in favor of engineers, too, in personal injury cases."
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1225.835,1227.88,"It's not the same at all, Your Honor."
1984.83-1919,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1235.05,1239.08,And it also was a policy that directly affected constitutional rights.
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1239.08,1239.674,That's true.
1984.83-1919,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.009,1263.553,"Did the trial judge, in his instructions, define what a policy was?"
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1263.553,1265.569,"I don't recall that he did, Your Honor."
1984.83-1919,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.63,1270.222,Did he say anything about negligence or gross... or recklessness?
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1270.222,1270.644,A great deal.
1984.83-1919,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1270.644,1274.784,Did he say that that was enough to... that was enough to amount to a policy?
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1274.784,1276.846,"I think he did, Your Honor."
1984.83-1919,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.846,1286.919,"And did he say that a single instance, or did he imply that a single instance of gross negligence or recklessness or disregard could amount to a policy?"
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1286.919,1287.841,Specifically.
1984.83-1919,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1289.294,1290.542,There were no objections to that?
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1290.542,1295.087,"There was an objection to that language, as I was responding to Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-1919,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1295.087,1308.332,"I thought part of your argument and part of the question that you raised in your cert petition was that a single instance of gross negligence or of careless disregard, reckless disregard, could never amount to a policy."
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1308.332,1311.519,"Well, that's true, Your Honor, and that was objected to."
1984.83-1919,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1311.519,1313.861,"That is the heart of your case, isn't it?"
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1313.861,1314.205,Yes.
1984.83-1919,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.205,1329.105,And there was also no objection to the trial judge saying to the jury that the issue of policy is a question of fact for the jury.
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1343.099,1344.833,"I quite agree, Your Honor."
1984.83-1919,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1344.833,1346.097,Well--
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1346.097,1353.22,"There was a motion for directed verdict made by the City at the close of the Plaintiff's proof, which was denied on the single incident basis."
1984.83-1919,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.016,1363.639,--And the Court of Appeals seems to have agreed that a single instance of gross negligence could amount to a policy.
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1363.639,1367.95,"Well, that's... I think they had to agree with that, because that's the only proof in the record."
1984.83-1919,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.95,1375.149,And you think the question has been preserved all the way?
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1375.149,1376.21,"Oh, yes."
1984.83-1919,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1378.428,1388.487,"Counsel, the Respondent brought out the policy of Oklahoma, which was not to shoot in a circumstance like this."
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1388.487,1389.081,That's correct.
1984.83-1919,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1389.081,1395.735,"Is there anything in the evidence, as to what, if anything, was done by the City to the police officer?"
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1395.735,1400.545,I'm not sure there is anything in the record about it.
1984.83-1919,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1404.45,1406.34,"Oh, I see."
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1406.34,1412.68,"And he went to work for, I think, an oil company or something."
1984.83-1919,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1412.68,1424.91,"What worries me is, the jury couldn't just have ignored that fact, that the policy, as expressed by the City, was not to do what this man did."
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1424.91,1426.862,"Well, that's right."
1984.83-1919,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1426.862,1431.735,"And then the man innocently, it seems to me, did something wrong."
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1432.485,1435.109,I think the situation was this.
1984.83-1919,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1501.191,1503.737,"May I just ask one quick question, if I may?"
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1515.217,1520.84,"I don't know whether it's printed in the Court of Appeals decision or not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1919,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.432,1526.682,--I'd be... it would help me to know what instruction you are complaining of.
1984.83-1919,0,17496,burk_bailey,,1532.335,1533.616,"Well, it's this instruction, Your Honor."
1984.83-1919,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1569.696,1570.18,I see.
1984.83-1919,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1570.18,1576.816,Mr. Hughes.
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,1576.816,1587.219,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is an appeal from the jury verdict rendered in the Western District of Oklahoma, as affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit."
1984.83-1919,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1718.978,1720.712,Just one little minor point.
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,1725.898,1729.007,"He used it merely just for motion, just to instruct--"
1984.83-1919,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1729.007,1730.521,In a brightly-lit bar?
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,1730.521,1732.005,--I don't know that the light was turned on.
1984.83-1919,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1733.239,1734.848,"Well, you said it was a well-lit bar."
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,1734.848,1736.019,It was a lit bar.
1984.83-1919,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1736.019,1737.3,Well-lit.
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,1737.3,1738.785,"Well, I took it--"
1984.83-1919,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1738.785,1739.689,And you still need a searchlight.
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,1739.689,1744.67,"--Only for purposes of motion, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1984.83-1919,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1744.67,1749.388,I'd rather not emphasize unimportant points.
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,1770.536,1774.628,"Of course, that issue is not preserved and presented in this case."
1984.83-1919,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1788.216,1803.601,"Well, the jury's verdict would suggest, at least it is susceptible of a meaning that the jury thought that the police officer did have a reasonable basis to think his life was in danger, and therefore they excused him."
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,1803.601,1812.894,--That's a concern that I have about an appellate court reviewing factual determinations that were made at the trial.
1984.83-1919,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1835.291,1844.163,How it was portrayed to you or to some judge is not as important as how the jury viewed him.
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,1854.908,1862.858,I didn't... I respectfully disagree... read that it went that far; that it merely held that he was in good faith in what he did.
1984.83-1919,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1874.555,1885.427,"Mr. Hughes, a moment ago you said that the policy that was relied upon by you as Plaintiff was a policy of Oklahoma City to allow shooting on suspicion."
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,1915.524,1919.334,"Well, that issue, in terms of--"
1984.83-1919,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1919.334,1921.74,I think you can answer the question yes or no.
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,1921.74,1923.911,"--Well, I think they did; yes."
1984.83-1919,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1923.911,1929.972,The Court of Appeals mentioned in its opinion the policy which you refer to of shooting on suspicion?
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,1929.972,1931.236,The issue--
1984.83-1919,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.236,1933.922,Did the Court of Appeals mention that in its opinion?
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,1933.922,1940.093,"--I don't recall them mentioning it, but the issue wasn't before them in that context and in that posture."
1984.83-1919,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1953.618,1980.778,"Well, that may be, but if the Court of Appeals affirmed on some ground that the policy was negligent training or deliberate disregard of rights in training, if that's the policy they identified... and if they were wrong in that, I don't know that we should affirm on your ground."
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,1980.778,1985.293,"Well, of course, that's, in my view, the purpose of Rule 51."
1984.83-1919,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2028.478,2040.582,"Do you agree that the trial court instructed the jury that a single instance of gross negligence, or however you want to describe it, that you may infer a policy from that?"
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2040.582,2041.692,Well--
1984.83-1919,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2041.692,2043.034,Do you agree or not?
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2043.862,2047.221,"--That language is contained in the instructions, yes."
1984.83-1919,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.221,2048.236,So you do agree with that?
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2048.236,2048.735,Yes.
1984.83-1919,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.735,2057.685,"So that it's possible that the jury concluded that there was a single instance of gross negligence, and that was a policy, was enough for a policy."
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2060.637,2064.839,The Court of Appeals agreed that the instructions should be taken as a whole.
1984.83-1919,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2064.839,2065.198,Yeah.
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2069.726,2070.993,I believe that they did.
1984.83-1919,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.993,2073.709,Is that a question of law or of fact?
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2073.709,2078.349,"In the light of this case, I thought it was a question of fact."
1984.83-1919,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.349,2084.799,"Well, certainly the trial judge seemed to think so."
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2084.799,2087.439,I would say that's a fair and accurate statement.
1984.83-1919,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2087.439,2092.124,"Although he did instruct the jury, as a matter of law, that it could be made out from a single instance."
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2092.124,2093.843,He did say that.
1984.83-1919,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2112.162,2115.302,"Of course, what we've taken is the Court of Appeals' judgment."
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2130.265,2132.53,I'm sorry.
1984.83-1919,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2134.373,2138.074,"Well, I don't know how I could make it any more clear."
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2159.346,2165.672,"They discussed training, supervision, and the shoot to kill policy, as I recall."
1984.83-1919,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2165.672,2170.484,"I thought a minute ago, you said the Court of Appeals did not discuss the shoot to kill policy."
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2179.213,2183.024,Not in the specific context that you're talking about.
1984.83-1919,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2183.024,2185.68,"Well, did it discuss it in some other context?"
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2185.68,2189.178,It discussed it in the context of the overall case is the way I--
1984.83-1919,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2189.178,2193.88,"Well, where did it discuss the shoot to kill policy in the context of the overall cases?"
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2193.88,2197.409,--I don't think I can find it in here.
1984.83-1919,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2197.409,2201.548,But you are confident that the Court of Appeals did discuss it?
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2201.548,2202.048,Yes.
1984.83-1919,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2231.427,2265.585,"Mr. Hughes, it seemed to me that basically the theory proceeded on by the Plaintiffs below was that an isolated incident, plus evidence of the training that was given police officers, was enough to establish the liability here."
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2284.828,2285.671,I would say so.
1984.83-1919,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2285.671,2293.496,"Well, didn't Rizzo v. Goode reject that very approach as the basis for liability under 1983?"
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2299.133,2303.99,"Well, we saw it as just a straight Monell issue."
1984.83-1919,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2309.333,2315.908,"Well, didn't Rizzo deal with exactly that situation for purposes of 1983 liability?"
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2315.908,2323.703,I don't know.
1984.83-1919,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2370.027,2373.229,May I ask you a question?
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2391.581,2393.736,Under my theory?
1984.83-1919,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.687,2404.404,Just total... they just let people out who didn't even have a driver's license.
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2404.404,2405.122,--If they had a policy.
1984.83-1919,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.122,2407.683,"The policy was, we don't train people to drive."
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2409.808,2412.026,Under those circumstances--
1984.83-1919,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2412.026,2414.431,But there's not any use of guns or anything.
1984.83-1919,1,19145,carl_hughes,,2416.197,2420.818,"--Under our theory and our reading, that would create liability."
1984.83-1919,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2420.818,2425.254,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Bailey?"
1984.83-1919,2,17496,burk_bailey,,2425.254,2427.629,If the Court has any questions I'll respond.
1984.83-1919,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2428.863,2430.018,I hear none.
