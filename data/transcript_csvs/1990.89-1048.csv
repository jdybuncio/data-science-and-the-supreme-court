1990.89-1048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.38,"We'll hear argument now on No. 89-1048, the FMC Corporation v. Cynthia Holliday."
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,14.991,18.095,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1048,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.318,209.019,Purporting to--
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,209.019,211.39,--Pardon me?
1990.89-1048,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,211.39,214.703,--Regulating... are you talking about the deemer clause now or the insurance?
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,214.703,215.705,"No, the insurance clause."
1990.89-1048,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,250.048,256.3,"Well, the deemer clause uses the word regulate."
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,276.147,278.27,"Well, it goes on."
1990.89-1048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,527.142,549.748,"Your position, Mr. Turner, then is that all of the preemption doctrine could be pretty well spelled out of the try... of the language of the tripartite preemption provision, the broad preemption clause, the exception for the business of insurance and then the deemer provision that says an employee benefit plan shall not be deemed to be the business of insurance."
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,549.748,552.7,"Chief Justice, that's exactly our view."
1990.89-1048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,582.3,584.243,"Mr. Turner, let me... may I ask you two questions."
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,601.573,603.666,"I believe that is right, Justice--"
1990.89-1048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.666,611.922,And if that is true... I guess I have trouble... what sense does it make... why is your client being treated differently?
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,614.333,622.818,"--Congress... and it took me a long while to come to this view, indeed, after the briefs were written."
1990.89-1048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.9,806.965,--by saying that these entities should not become subject to State insurance regulation because they would be considered insurance companies.
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,806.965,807.476,--They--
1990.89-1048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.476,808.036,It's very interesting.
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,815.823,820.778,"--Yes, Your Honor, I think that they missed the point of the articles."
1990.89-1048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.416,867.652,How do you deal with the other argument that's kind of related to this that the second clause... I get the names mixed up... uses the word person.
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,879.453,880.905,Well--
1990.89-1048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,880.905,885.506,"--shall not relieve any person from any law which regulates insurance, banking, or securities."
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,894.343,911.485,"--Yes, I don't know that the word person is where to focus though on 1144(b)2(A), where it says, nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any State which regulates insurance."
1990.89-1048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.383,980.54,"It would, sir, if the status is being subject to State regulation depended on your being an insurance company, status as that kind of person, then you don't become that kind of person just because you're an ERISA fund."
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,980.54,1000.444,"--No, but you are an employee benefit plan, which is the type of entity that my client is and which is what is specifically... so that if it's a person under (a)... it seems to me that type of person is what is carved out."
1990.89-1048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.444,1004.687,What is carver... it cannot be called an insurance company by reason of the deemer clause.
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,1019.058,1039.915,"The... as best I could tell, Your Honor, that a person would be incorporating any type of entity here, and I don't... I'm sorry, I'm just not much help perhaps."
1990.89-1048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1042.618,1053.718,"Well, my point is that the... your client is a person, whether or not it is an insurance company within the meaning of the deemer clause, and maybe that's enough to answer the case."
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,1053.718,1061.032,"If the Court please, I would reserve the balance of--"
1990.89-1048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.032,1075.923,"Counsel, may I just ask... we've received amicus briefs from people on the health care professions cautioning that our decision in this case might affect freedom of choice, chiropractors, et cetera."
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,1081.197,1088.23,"--In this particular case, you don't, of course, need to reach that."
1990.89-1048,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1109.825,1113.999,"So, you were thinking that there would be preemption because it relates to insurance?"
1990.89-1048,0,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,1113.999,1122.915,I'm thinking that there may be as applied to a self-funded plan only.
1990.89-1048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1164.662,1168.766,"Thank you, Mr. Turner."
1990.89-1048,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1189.379,1215.787,"Your Honor, Congress did not give us... I should have said thank you, Mr. Chief Justice... Congress did not elaborate in great detail on why in the first place it excepted insurance regulation from the scope of preemption, and that brought the plan itself under... plans themselves outside the scope of the savings clauses, as we argue."
1990.89-1048,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1437.759,1451.089,"Mr. Shapiro, you omitted two important words when you quoted the statutes: ""purporting to regulate"" which suggest to me that statutes which in terms define the regulated entities as insurance companies, insurance contracts, banks, and so forth."
1990.89-1048,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1463.757,1466.019,"Well, there are two aspects to your question, Your Honor."
1990.89-1048,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.169,1508.623,"Then the word purporting is redundant, is totally unnecessary?"
1990.89-1048,2,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,1508.623,1510.716,We don't think it adds anything.
1990.89-1048,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1510.716,1511.996,You don't think it adds any meaning?
1990.89-1048,2,28249,h_woodruff_turner,,1511.996,1524.555,"No, we don't think it... in fact the word purporting is also found in the statute in the definition of a State, and the use of the word purporting there I think is very similar to the use here."
1990.89-1048,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1731.888,1735.791,"The point that there is no regulatory gap, because this Court is a power to fill the gap."
1990.89-1048,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1736.351,1738.154,"--No, it stops... this Court--"
1990.89-1048,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1738.154,1740.578,It's common law that fills the gap.
1990.89-1048,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1740.578,1742.08,"--That's part of it, Your Honor."
1990.89-1048,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1761.577,1763.029,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1765.28,1768.983,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1048,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.138,1821.923,Or of any law of any State purporting to regulate it.
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1821.923,1822.994,"That's right, Your Honor."
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1899.056,1903.178,Why is that broader... why is that broader?
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1917.362,1922.725,--I think this case actually is one thing that falls within that gap or outside of those two terms.
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.263,1949.104,"--Well, they may have used different language, but I don't see how you can possibly get any broader than... I don't know... what is... what is contained within the meaning of insurance that does not consist of either insurance companies or insurance contracts?"
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1949.104,1962.374,"Well, I think, Your Honor, the language of the deemer clause purports to regulate insurance companies or insurance contracts, is directed as I think was suggested by Justice O'Connor's question, at laws that in terms regulate insurance companies or insurance contracts."
1990.89-1048,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1967.239,1972.343,It certainly regulates the right of an insurer to... to be subrogated.
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1972.343,1976.494,"Well, I think it is a regulation of causes of action, the word subrogation."
1990.89-1048,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1978.627,1983.542,Subrogation is not something that you find across the board in the law.
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1997.884,2002.425,"That... that's true, Your Honor, but that doesn't make it a law that regulates insurance contracts."
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2045.797,2051.71,"It would still... even as it affects the common law remedy, it would still purport to regulate insurance companies."
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2051.71,2057.994,"Well, I think that the use of the term insurance... laws that regulate insurance companies, Your Honor, are directed at a different type of law."
1990.89-1048,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2067.811,2074.317,"That's... that's by no means as self-evident, or that's not the only possible meaning of the word ""to regulate insurance""."
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2076.018,2078.751,"Well, to regulate insurance companies and insurance contracts."
1990.89-1048,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2206.817,2209.21,With respect to employee benefit plans.
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2209.21,2210.961,With respect to employee benefit plans.
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.961,2212.821,I guess that interpretation is--
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2212.821,2213.262,With respect to insurance.
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.663,2222.949,"--interpretation is the perhaps assisted by that phrase in there, in the deemer clause"
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2252.749,2253.67,I think that's right.
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2265.14,2269.895,"The problem I have with that, Mr. Rothfeld, is that I don't see how it makes any sense."
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2281.685,2285.355,"Well, I think precisely the reverse is true, Your Honor."
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.355,2285.525,All right.
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2286.126,2303.119,"In answering Justice Stevens' related question, Mr. Turner suggested that Congress' purpose was to slice apart self-insurance from the insurance industry, people engaged in the business of insurance as you've described."
1990.89-1048,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2628.558,2631.019,"Mr. Rothfeld, you use the term the deemer clause preempting."
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2649.221,2649.762,"Well, I think--"
1990.89-1048,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2649.762,2651.684,Which is not... that doesn't preempt anything.
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2651.684,2652.916,--I'm using preemption as a shorthand.
1990.89-1048,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2664.804,2676.773,"Mr. Rothfeld, do you agree with the reasoning with the court of appeals in this case, which this certainly supports the results you want, about the ERISA core concerns?"
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2676.773,2701.13,"Well, I don't think that we endorse all of language of the analysis used by the court of appeals, but certainly we agree with their general... general conclusion and their general approach which is that one has to examine whether or not a State law falls within the type of State regulation that the deemer clause was aimed at that the deemer clause is not the sweeping preemption provision that is contended for by petitioner and the Solicitor General."
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2705.374,2709.357,How would this statute have to read to come within the deemer clause?
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2724.144,2725.646,--I think that--
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2725.646,2727.397,Then... then it would be covered by the deemer clause.
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2727.397,2737.355,--I think the statute providing that insurance contracts could not contain subrogation clauses would be... it would be a different kind of statute.
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2740.206,2754.083,"What... what about a more general statute that doesn't just speak of whether such a provision in the contract would be valid but it just says insurance companies shall have no right of subrogation, neither by contract nor at common law?"
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2754.083,2758.097,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think that would fall within the terms of the deemer clause."
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.097,2758.768,That would not fall--
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2761.732,2767.416,"I think that if it is a statute... again, and I return to the Pilot Life case which interpreted the phrase regulate."
1990.89-1048,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2779.395,2784.7,"So, it would have to regulate only insurance contracts and not any other kind of contracts?"
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2784.7,2785.568,"I think that's right, Your Honor, although--"
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2785.568,2786.109,It doesn't say that.
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2788.363,2788.733,--Well--
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2788.733,2791.014,It purports to regulate insurance contracts.
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2795.187,2802.822,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, obviously there is a distinction between the statute you hypothesize and the Pennsylvania law that's at issue here."
1990.89-1048,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2811.238,2814.212,"It's not clear that statute would apply to this contract either, is it?"
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2814.212,2815.182,--I'm sorry.
1990.89-1048,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2815.182,2818.394,It's not clear that his hypothetical statute would even apply in this case.
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2818.394,2820.685,"I think that's true, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2967.973,2970.063,"No, I didn't want to interrupt your... your point here."
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2970.063,2986.315,"Well, I think to finish with that point, petitioner's reading would mean that whether or not any particular plan was covered by State law would turn on whether or not the plan had reached the stop-loss point."
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3060.912,3062.681,"Now, let me cut in there now."
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3094.134,3094.985,--Well--
1990.89-1048,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3094.985,3101.999,"You know, you might think that as a policy matter that's not a good idea and maybe it's irrational, but it could have happened, couldn't it?"
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3101.999,3105.931,"--Well, I suppose anything could have happened, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1048,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3206.126,3211.702,"What you're saying that if we adopt the Solicitor General's position, we'll have to take more ERISA cases than if we don't?"
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3213.361,3219.206,"--I'll leave that to your imagination, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1048,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3236.32,3238.81,That might be easier than trying to figure out this statute.
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3257.723,3260.405,"--Well, I'm not sure that it makes sense under--"
1990.89-1048,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3260.405,3261.925,Anybody's?
1990.89-1048,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3261.925,3269.532,"--Well, there's no explanation whatsoever anywhere as to what Congress could have had in mind, and it's sort of difficult to imagine."
