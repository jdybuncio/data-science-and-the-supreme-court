1977.76-719,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,49.854,We will hear arguments next in National Labor Relations Board against Local Union 103.
1977.76-719,0,37058,norton_j_come,,54.176,57.757,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1977.76-719,1,40959,sydney_l_berger,,1440.163,1446.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1977.76-719,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.131,1504.627,"Yeah, but your position would be the same that had been in the chicanery or subterfuge?"
1977.76-719,1,40959,sydney_l_berger,,1504.627,1508.175,"Mr. Justice White, I would say yes and no."
1977.76-719,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.825,1517.122,And far as you are right to picket to enforce this contract.
1977.76-719,1,40959,sydney_l_berger,,1517.122,1517.752,Yes.
1977.76-719,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3205.493,3218.52,Just a small point Your Honor.
1977.76-719,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3275.547,3297.02,"Well, Mr. Come how would it derogate the interest that you think support your side of the case to hold the substantive provisions of the contract rather than the recognition provisions or the bargaining provisions to be enforceable in a 301 suit."
1977.76-719,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3310.982,3329.178,"Off hand, I do not see too much of a problem with that but you do get to the point where how much of the contract is being enforced and if you get to enforcing beyond that then you get the union equivalent of recognition."
1977.76-719,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3329.178,3337.352,"Well, the union apparently was complaining here about his failure to live up to the wage and the welfare and pension agreement."
1977.76-719,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3337.352,3342.487,"Your Honor, as we read the record the union was complaining about a lot more than that."
1977.76-719,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3429.742,3435.632,"Mr. Come, how often would that situation like we have in this case arise as a matter of the fact."
1977.76-719,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3450.549,3453.392,I think that is the normal situation.
1977.76-719,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3460.842,3461.735,Of this Board case.
1977.76-719,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3461.735,3468.806,Of this Board case and there you have to balance 8 (f) against 8 (b)(7)(C).
1977.76-719,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3486.433,3496.225,Do you mean that in the Building Industry it is normal for building contractors to prefer not deal nonunion labor.
1977.76-719,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3496.225,3508.204,"Your Honor, I think that what has happened is that there are several different parts of the Building and Construction Industry."
1977.76-719,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3554.594,3562.195,So if we rule with you on this then we will see more of that.
1977.76-719,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3562.195,3564.085,"Well, whether you will or not."
1977.76-719,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3576.435,3577.166,Thank you gentlemen.
