1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,27.178,31.041,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1990.90-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,93.041,100.497,Insofar as future cases... it may be of no help to your client or many others in her position.
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,108.653,112.025,"Justice Kennedy, that raises an interesting question."
1990.90-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,132.388,134.899,Do you have settled authority for that proposition?
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,134.899,139.924,"--No, Your Honor, there is no settled authority."
1990.90-350,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,178.479,199.932,"So that in that hypothesis a property settlement agreement which is recorded and the parties exchange a deed and mortgage, and the court adopts... enters a decree based on that, still the mortgage would be a judicial lien?"
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,199.932,202.844,"--Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think there is any question about that."
1990.90-350,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.322,247.643,"Well, as the case comes to us you concede that it's a judicial lien?"
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,247.643,248.855,Yes.
1990.90-350,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.855,260.843,"And we have to worry, then, about the meaning of section 522(f) and how that plays out in this context, right?"
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,260.843,261.971,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1990.90-350,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,261.971,269.068,"At bottom, is that a matter of State law as to when the lien fixes?"
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,277.383,286.46,"Your Honor, the definition of the Federal statute, and to be precise the definition of the phrase ""the fixing of a lien"" is a matter of Federal law."
1990.90-350,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,298.627,306.972,Don't you think the Federal law of necessity refers back to State law as to when and how a lien is fixed?
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,306.972,307.563,--Absolutely.
1990.90-350,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,378.929,387.655,"Yeah, but could you answer my question and tell me under State law exactly when the lien was fixed here?"
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,387.655,394.589,"Under State law, Your Honor, the lien fixed at the moment the judge entered the divorce judgment."
1990.90-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.292,423.099,"Mr. Williamson, I am not sure that our job here ought, you know... the job before us is to make all these divorce proceedings come out in a seemingly fair and happy fashion."
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,469.509,475.792,"Justice Scalia, if Mr. Sanderfoot had sole title to the house, he didn't, but if he did--"
1990.90-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.792,476.393,Yes.
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,476.393,489.131,"--And then the divorce court in its judgment awarded a lien, imposed a lien on it, then we would probably not be here today and I would not quarrel with the court's order or suggestion."
1990.90-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.131,489.682,Right.
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,505.222,509.473,"No, Justice Scalia, and if you'll forgive me, I do want to quarrel with your premise."
1990.90-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.813,539.514,You're not saying that.
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,548.439,556.496,"If the husband had sole title, Your Honor, the trial judge could have, and no doubt woul have, taken other steps to correct the difficulty."
1990.90-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,556.496,568.174,"On that point, I thought Wisconsin law was quite specific that all property of the spouses xx presumed to be marital property, and that each spouse has an undivided one-half interest."
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,571.465,573.287,"That's precisely correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,573.287,580.53,"I'm not sure why you conceded to Justice Scalia, then, that if the property had all been in the husband's name you wouldn't be here today."
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,583.104,584.543,We would have a more difficult case.
1990.90-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,586.143,587.154,I thought you weren't going to be here at all.
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,589.126,592.278,"--Justice Kennedy, I am grateful to be here under any circumstances."
1990.90-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,594.952,596.181,You pushed me beyond my hypothetical.
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,604.386,607.257,"--Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy is absolutely correct."
1990.90-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.063,632.846,Legally co-owned or equitably co-owned?
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,632.846,633.277,Both.
1990.90-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.277,635.057,Legally co-owned?
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,635.057,635.778,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,635.778,637.718,So it really doesn't matter whether you take it out in your own name or not.
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,637.718,638.549,It does not.
1990.90-350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,762.641,765.472,"Mr. Williamson, can I ask you a background question?"
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,789.208,803.096,"The... Mr. Justice Stevens, in the respondent's brief they were unable to cite a single case pre-code in which this happened, although under section 67(a) of the Bankruptcy Act it certainly could have happened."
1990.90-350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.892,853.689,"One reason I asked the question is I don't know what this word 4 month period, but then the 4 months just isn't there anymore."
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,875.234,877.095,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,877.095,881.997,Is there anything in the legislative history that tells us what happened to the 4-month period or why they got rid of it?
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,881.997,882.658,"No, sir."
1990.90-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,964.734,975.009,"Could you say that the lien fixed part on his interest and part on her interest, both of which are recognized as being one-half interest, and that one is avoidable and the other is not?"
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,975.009,989.367,"--Well, we have thought about that possibility, Your Honor, and in the first place it assumes that Ms. Farrey could have had a lien on her own interest which, whatever the doctrine of merger might say, seems, seems a bit awkward to have a lien on your own interest."
1990.90-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.468,1037.644,"I guess you say that a whole interest in real estate, a whole fee interest, is equivalent to two divisible half interests, but it's a different interest from two indivisible half interests?"
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,1050.5,1051.281,"Yes, you could."
1990.90-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1098.823,1107.057,"Would you say the same thing if there were two tenants-in-common, not husband and wife, and there was a partition suit and the court ordered a sale from one to the other?"
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,1107.057,1108.659,Probably not.
1990.90-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1108.659,1110.05,What's the difference?
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,1110.05,1111.522,Two differences.
1990.90-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1116.344,1117.475,That's the one I'm interested in.
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,1117.475,1130.142,"It's clear, Justice Kennedy, and has been for, probably since the State became a State in 1848, that Wisconsin has recognized a marital estate as being co-owned."
1990.90-350,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1185.13,1190.032,Was any member of the Seventh Circuit panel a Wisconsin jurist?
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,1190.032,1191.003,"No, sir."
1990.90-350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1214.218,1231.249,I suppose there is no question but what the Bankruptcy Code would discharge the husband from any... just from financial obligations to the wife?
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,1231.249,1234.541,"Justice White, not, not the slightest doubt in the world."
1990.90-350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.541,1242.565,"So that if the court orders the husband to pay the wife and sign a note for $100,000, it can be discharged at bankruptcy?"
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,1242.565,1243.477,Absolutely.
1990.90-350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1244.806,1246.609,"Yes, but how about alimony or support money?"
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,1247.72,1251.101,"--It would not, Justice Stevens, under section 523(a)(5)."
1990.90-350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.832,1304.927,"Well, the Bankruptcy Code discharges a debt, but you say it can't discharge a lien."
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,1304.927,1306.629,"That's absolutely right, Your Honor."
1990.90-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.272,1381.236,"I guess they should have written the statute differently, because the statute does not say that mortgages can be discharged, and it says that judicial liens can."
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,1391.003,1409.285,"Your Honor, in 522(c)(2)(A)(i) Congress has codified the principle that this Court established in the Bullard case, which says that security, valid security interests pass through bankruptcy."
1990.90-350,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1431.9,1435.713,Why does the savings and loan mortgage pass through bankruptcy?
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,1437.162,1438.174,"No, sir."
1990.90-350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.471,1453.023,Straight bankruptcy.
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,1480.873,1501.954,"Your Honor, clearly Congress could have done that, but we believe that the Bankruptcy Code, and there is plenty of legislative history on this point, supports the conclusion of Congress and our contention that there was no need for that kind of language because security interests, like mortgages, always survive bankruptcy."
1990.90-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1522.769,1525.98,"Excuse me, isn't a judicial lien a security interest?"
1990.90-350,0,18150,brady_c_williamson,,1533.817,1547.796,"Justice Scalia, the difficulty is that Congress, in defining a security interest, limited it, and it's in subsection 47 of the definitional sections, limited that interest to consensual liens."
1990.90-350,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1584.789,1586.711,"Very well, Mr. Williamson."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,1589.685,1597.289,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1642.19,1645.191,xxx her half interest in the house.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,1645.191,1646.92,"--That's correct, Justice White."
1990.90-350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.777,1737.259,But sure the Bankruptcy Code isn't designed to let you start over with part of someone else's house.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,1738.991,1743.256,"I don't disagree, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1778.867,1783.481,"But it's secured by that, is it not?"
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,1783.481,1789.155,We don't believe that for bankruptcy purposes that it is a security interest.
1990.90-350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1791.355,1805.006,"No, but I mean just in common parlance there was a requirement this amount of money be paid and the obligation to pay it was secured by some sort of an interest, a security interest on the house."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,1805.006,1806.376,--It was--
1990.90-350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.376,1807.437,"That's correct, isn't it?"
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,1807.437,1809.869,"--It was secured by some sort of lien, yes."
1990.90-350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1809.869,1813.6,Imposed by the bankruptcy court... by the divorce court.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,1813.6,1815.841,Imposed by the divorce court.
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.807,1915.466,"Mr. Samson, am I correct that you acknowledge that if Mr. Sanderfoot had bought this real estate subject to a judicial lien, there was already a judicial lien on it against the former... to secure a debt of the former owner, he buys the real estate with a judicial lien, he could not get that lien discharged in bankruptcy?"
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,1916.257,1917.808,If I understand your question--
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1917.808,1919.891,Because he had no interest when the lien fixed.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,1919.891,1927.275,"--If I understand your question, Justice Scalia, what you're asking is if there was a judgment against Mr. Sanderfoot before he purchased?"
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1927.275,1928.427,"No, no, no."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,1956.894,1972.064,"I am having some difficulty because in the State of Wisconsin, I think as in most other States, a warranty deed requires that you provide a deed free and clear of all those types of questions."
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.064,1973.296,I didn't say it was a warranty deed.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,1974.825,1975.746,A quit claim deed?
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1975.746,1976.365,Sure.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,1976.365,1989.615,"In my opinion with a quit claim deed, yes, it would be subject to the prior owner's lien, assuming that you could not avoid the lien under State law, which would allow a homestead exemption clause."
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.615,1999.743,"But the new owner would not be able to avoid that lien under the Bankruptcy Code, because the lien did not fix upon any interest of that new owner."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2000.732,2006.906,"If he paid for it, it may well fix on an interest of his, assuming he can... it's a homestead of some sort."
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.906,2010.489,I don't understand what you're saying.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2010.489,2012.871,"Well, the difficulty with the--"
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.871,2027.83,"Are you saying that even if I buy property that's already subject to a lien, the lien has never attached to any interest of mine; it attached to somebody else's interest and then I bought that interest already subject to the lien, I can get rid of that in bankruptcy?"
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2027.83,2028.851,"--No, I don't believe so."
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2028.851,2029.971,Okay.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2029.971,2030.882,I don't believe so.
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2030.882,2032.394,I didn't think you believed so.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2034.445,2049.235,"Because, again, it's got to fix on an interest... and, with all due respect to Justice Scalia, I don't think that it's likely that that kind of situation is going to occur, strictly because--"
1990.90-350,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2049.235,2051.446,I don't understand why it's so improbable.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2065.543,2067.136,--It's perfectly conceivable--
1990.90-350,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2067.136,2072.259,"And if that's true, I don't know why the plain language of the code would have a different impact in that situation."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2072.259,2073.899,--Under the--
1990.90-350,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2073.899,2077.222,If fixing means fixed at any time in the past.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2081.666,2086.007,--If it's unlimited I don't believe that there is a problem with that.
1990.90-350,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2088.989,2091.992,What in the code justifies that?
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2094.553,2097.615,I think we're having some semantic difficulty here.
1990.90-350,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2097.615,2099.818,You just think it's common sense that it can't apply that far.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2099.818,2101.327,I don't think it would be avoidable.
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2105.571,2108.513,"No, but neither is Mrs.... the petitioner's lien a debt."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2129.447,2130.258,--That's correct.
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2130.258,2130.779,Right.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2179.6,2183.012,"In the broadest sense, yes, but he always had an interest."
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.676,2187.785,I understand.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2201.466,2205.357,In the State of Wisconsin--
1990.90-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2205.357,2207.47,Or vice versa.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2207.47,2217.054,"--In the State of Wisconsin, Justice Kennedy, there is a presumption that all property in a marriage is marital in nature and subject to division."
1990.90-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2244.483,2250.406,"Is either party, is either spouse free to alienate his or her share of the marital property during marriage?"
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2250.406,2252.237,Not in the State of Wisconsin.
1990.90-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2271.39,2286.09,"Well, that seems to me, then, to illustrate Justice Scalia's point that there is something to the argument that the nature of the property changed in a very substantive and generic way at the moment of the marital dissolution."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2286.09,2288.641,It did change.
1990.90-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2296.038,2300.389,"And he received property with a new character, but at that very moment it also had a lien."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2300.389,2307.514,--It did not have the lien until the point that all of the property division had been concluded.
1990.90-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2328.178,2330.63,"Of course, then, if she had gone bankrupt the home would have had to have been sold."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2342.697,2346.119,"No, the property that... oh, in your case, yes, that didn't."
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2373.246,2375.489,"Mr. Samson, let me try again."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2459.963,2469.82,"--No, Justice Scalia, I don't think so, because the code also defines purchaser as being a voluntary transferee."
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2469.82,2472.051,"Oh, I'm not saying it technically comes within it."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2482.079,2487.412,"Again, that is one of the key terms, is ""an interest""."
1990.90-350,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2586.858,2590.87,"Yes, but if you look at the date of the filing, it seems to me you ought to look at the fixing as of the date of the filing too."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2602.089,2602.688,--Correct.
1990.90-350,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.688,2615.787,"--but it seems to me there's some tension between your saying well, for fixing purposes we go back 100 years, but for, to cancel out all old judicial liens, but for measuring what we're talking about we look at the date of filing."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2616.989,2626.804,"Well, I think that the, that 522(f) specifically says that we look at judicial liens regardless of when they were filed or when they attached."
1990.90-350,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2626.804,2628.807,"Well, why does it use the word avoid the fixing of?"
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2633.208,2636.311,I would tend to agree.
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2655.802,2657.103,So you just read it out?
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2669.452,2673.203,"They didn't say that, and we need to look at what fixing is."
1990.90-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2697.909,2711.538,"Is an explanation that the lien might still exist on other property, so that the lien itself still remains but the fixing of the lien on the interest of the debtor is avoided?"
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2712.68,2723.326,"Well, I think, Justice Kennedy, that clearly if you cannot claim property exempt, the lien would still stay on that property."
1990.90-350,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2760.021,2764.914,"On legislative intent, what do you do with the snippet from the legislative history about rush to the courthouse?"
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2764.914,2773.938,"--Well, the legislative history on rush to the courthouse, Justice Stevens, is in a line from the House report."
1990.90-350,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2827.995,2834.961,"But my question was what do you do with the snippet of legislative history, and you say it really is inconsistent with what they did?"
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2834.961,2835.539,Correct.
1990.90-350,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2835.539,2836.05,Yeah.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2836.05,2843.536,In determining avoidability it will be the Federal bankruptcy court--
1990.90-350,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.536,2846.718,It's inconsistent with what they did and with what they intended to do is really what you're--
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2846.718,2855.834,"--In my opinion it is, because it's got to be inconsistent if the language of the law doesn't say within so many months, days, years, or whatever."
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2855.834,2869.982,"--Mr. Samson, can I come back to this language again, it has to be a fixing of a lien on an interest of the debtor in property, and you say it can be any interest of the debtor."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2877.667,2878.498,Correct.
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2878.498,2879.019,Right?
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2882.73,2883.161,Correct.
1990.90-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2883.161,2883.621,Okay.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2897.489,2898.26,Yes.
1990.90-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2916.143,2924.169,Did his property interest... did he have a property interest that survived the divorce?
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2924.169,2926.11,I believe he did.
1990.90-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2926.11,2929.853,Did... but she did not?
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2929.853,2930.772,No.
1990.90-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2934.704,2935.586,And where did that interest go?
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2935.586,2937.336,--The interest went to Mr. Sanderfoot.
1990.90-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2937.336,2938.138,Yes.
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2941.938,2948.904,"The one-half interest, but the statute says an interest."
1990.90-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2956.728,2959.971,"The statute talks about interests, not properties."
1990.90-350,1,28188,harvey_g_samson,,2959.971,2960.742,That's correct.
1990.90-350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3052.432,3054.061,"Thank you, Mr. Samson."
1990.90-350,2,18150,brady_c_williamson,,3057.264,3058.756,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-350,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3192.682,3197.426,"May I ask you, do you know if there's any legislation pending in Congress to clarify this mess?"
1990.90-350,2,18150,brady_c_williamson,,3197.426,3198.586,--There is none--
1990.90-350,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3198.586,3201.989,Because the statute really is very ambiguous in this whole area.
1990.90-350,2,18150,brady_c_williamson,,3204.242,3207.004,"--I am aware of none introduced at this point, Your Honor."
1990.90-350,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3210.637,3212.459,"Thank you, Mr. Williamson."
