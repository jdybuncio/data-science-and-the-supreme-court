1987.86-1128,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.439,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 86-1128, Immigration and Naturalization Service versus Assisi Abudu."
1987.86-1128,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,13.141,13.991,Thank you.
1987.86-1128,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,126.33,133.318,"Mr. Klonoff, then reopening is not a procedure provided for by statute?"
1987.86-1128,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,133.318,134.068,That's correct.
1987.86-1128,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,308.13,315.986,"Mr. Klonoff, is that new evidence not available before within them engaging of the regulation, do you suppose?"
1987.86-1128,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,315.986,317.92,--It probably was not.
1987.86-1128,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.728,338.834,"So you think it was new evidence not available before, but you take the position that it just wasn't material."
1987.86-1128,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,338.834,340.15,That's exactly correct.
1987.86-1128,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,376.44,380.911,Didn't that become clearer when this man came over from Ghana?
1987.86-1128,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,380.911,382.344,--We don't think so.
1987.86-1128,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,384.863,387.415,"I am not sure, either, but it could be argued, couldn't it?"
1987.86-1128,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,392.569,394.921,"--Well, we don't think that is obvious, Justice Marshall."
1987.86-1128,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,394.921,395.721,What is the other reason?
1987.86-1128,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,395.721,397.271,"Well, the reason--"
1987.86-1128,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,397.271,400.455,That a man would spend that amount of money to come over here.
1987.86-1128,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,400.455,413.096,"--Oh, but it... certainly there is no allegation in the motion to reopen that his man came forth sole purpose of visiting respondent, and in fact he didn't even know where to locate respondent, and had had to contact respondent through his brother."
1987.86-1128,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,423.468,428.353,"You mean, they is trying to kill his own family but they are going to bring him back and let him live?"
1987.86-1128,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,428.353,430.372,We don't know if they are trying to kill his whole family.
1987.86-1128,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,431.038,432.005,That was the testimony.
1987.86-1128,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,432.005,449.916,"--There was no testimony... the only reference to the brother were very brief statements in the motion to reopen, a one-line sentence indicating that the brother's house had previously been surrounded, and then a vague allegation that the brother had made his way out of Ghana, but let me respond--"
1987.86-1128,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,449.916,452.118,And was still out and was still wanted.
1987.86-1128,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,452.118,458.772,"--According to the conclusory allegation, with no explanation as to why, but let me respond, justice Marshall, to your--"
1987.86-1128,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,458.772,467.228,"Well, the way to get around and find out whether a conclusory allegation is correct is one way only, and that is to hold a hearing."
1987.86-1128,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,468.913,470.08,--We don't think so.
1987.86-1128,1,20971,dorothy_a_harper,,1688.645,1709.743,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, we would like to first state our view of what the Ninth Circuit did in this case."
1987.86-1128,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1800.318,1822.167,"Ms. Harper, that may well be true in the context of, say, a motion to dismiss under the Rules of Civil Procedure or the analog in the Rules of Criminal Procedure, but why should the BIA be governed by that kind of a strict legal mode that we allege certain things, and then if there is a contest we have a hearing?"
1987.86-1128,1,20971,dorothy_a_harper,,1822.167,1833.975,"Mr. Justice, we believe that is because the BIA chose the prima facie case test, chose prima facie case."
1987.86-1128,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1876.385,1883.706,And you think it should be analyzed just as if we were in a Federal District Court on a motion to dismiss with the Rules of Civil Procedure?
1987.86-1128,1,20971,dorothy_a_harper,,1883.706,1888.609,"--No, I don't think foursquare exactly on all of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
1987.86-1128,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1912.991,1935.238,"Ms. Harper, do you think that at bottom in this immigration setting, that the BIA had discretion to decide whether to decide whether to grant someone status to remain or not and discretion to decide whether to grant rehearing or not?"
1987.86-1128,1,20971,dorothy_a_harper,,1935.238,1951.516,"Madam Justice, I think the board of Immigration Appeals certainly can exercise its discretion in the discretionary aspect of the case, but in this case they didn't."
1987.86-1128,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1960.639,1969.061,"You don't think that if they decide... if the BIA decides to deny rehearing, that that could be an exercise of discretion?"
1987.86-1128,1,20971,dorothy_a_harper,,1969.061,1987.939,"--If the BIA denies, period, without announcing a standard, simply in essence, if you will, we just don't want to hear this one today, that is arbitrary, and even if it is discretion, it is an arbitrary exercise of discretion."
1987.86-1128,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1987.939,1994.962,"Well, yes, certainly it could be, but you are not arguing that that was the situation here."
1987.86-1128,1,20971,dorothy_a_harper,,1994.962,2007.019,"No, we are arguing that the Board of Immigration Appeals chose not to examine the discretionary factors, chose not to exercise that discretion, which it has."
1987.86-1128,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2210.965,2214.952,"Well, of course, Congress didn't provide for rehearing motions at all."
1987.86-1128,1,20971,dorothy_a_harper,,2214.952,2217.904,"No, that is correct, Madam Justice."
1987.86-1128,2,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3485.776,3498.417,"Ultimately, as Justices Scalia and O'Connor recognized, the issue is whether the BIA must reopen because of a new fact, whether it is compelled now."
1987.86-1128,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3554.587,3556.104,"Thank you, Mr. Klonoff."
