2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.015,"We'll hear argument next today in Case 15-8049, Buck v. Davis. Ms. Swarns."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,7.015,25.31,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Duane Buck was condemned to death after his own court appointed trial attorneys knowingly introduced an expert opinion that he was more likely to commit criminal acts of violence in the future because he is black."
2016.15-8049,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,50.285,57.12,"Didn't that expert say, I don't think he's a future -- I don't think he's going to be a future danger?"
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,57.12,65.545,On cross-examination Dr. Quijano testified that he did believe that Mr. Buck was likely to commit future crimes of violence.
2016.15-8049,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,80.63,82.77,But more likely than not that he wouldn't.
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,82.77,83.26,Yes.
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,142.9,147.305,There's a tension in your -- your briefing over what you're really arguing for.
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,187.98,204.05,"Well, in order to determine whether Mr. Buck was expired -- was entitled to a Certificate of Appealability, this Court and the Fifth Circuit was required to determine whether or not the district court decision with respect to both the constitutional question and the procedural question would be debatable among jurors."
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,204.05,204.49,Right.
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,217.3,223.515,"We believe that the district court's decision is wrong, and, therefore, Mr. Buck was entitled to a Certificate of Appealability."
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,223.515,224.61,Okay.
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,233.86,245.5,"Or that the -- that the reasonable jurists would conclude that the district court's decision that Mr. Buck was not prejudiced was incorrect, and, therefore, Mr. Buck was -- was entitled to a Certificate of Appealability."
2016.15-8049,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,245.5,256.13,"But, for example, last year in a case called Welch, the question came up on the Certificate of Appealability, and we just said, well, of course he should have gotten a Certificate of Appealability because he's right."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,271.635,272.35,Yes.
2016.15-8049,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,272.35,287.77,"I mean, that does leave on the table -- maybe this is what the Chief Justice was saying -- this question of whether the Fifth Circuit is just using the wrong approach and the wrong standards for the Certificate of Appealability question."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,287.77,328.435,"Well, in this case the Fifth Circuit's analysis completely ignored the heart of the case in making its Certificate of Appealability determination, right? The center of Mr. Buck's claim has always been the introduction of racial discrimination that undermines the confidence in, not only his own death sentence, but the integrity of the court's as well. In assessing the debatability of the district court's decision, the Fifth Circuit doesn't engage at all around the central question here about the -- the critical role of race in Mr. Buck's case, in his sentence, in the integrity of the court's, and ultimately in what Texas did in terms of acknowledging the absence of finality in its case."
2016.15-8049,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,339.14,341.43,The centers in this case --
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,341.43,342.02,Yes.
2016.15-8049,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,342.02,349.61,"-- argue that the Court had improperly denied a COA, and that was their basic position."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,373.22,383.15,"I think that the Fifth Circuit -- you know, obviously, I would like for this Court to say we win and Mr. Buck is entitled to a new -- a new, fair sentencing hearing."
2016.15-8049,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,399.225,399.68,All right.
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,432.26,432.93,Yes.
2016.15-8049,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,432.93,465.399,"So first, what does the retroactivity argument have to do with anything? All right? What does it apply to? And aren't you making Martinez and -- and Trevino retroactive if we recognize it as an exceptional reason to forgive a procedural default. And then second, there's a circuit split on this question, and you recognize it in your brief."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,495.845,503.31,"Well, with respect to retroactivity, Teague governs new rules of constitutional law that apply at the trial stage."
2016.15-8049,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,542.54,551.68,"This is a very -- a very unusual case, and what occurred at the penalty phase of this trial is indefensible."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,595.33,614.09,"Well, I think there are three factors, I think, that makes Mr. Buck's case unique. First and foremost, it involves an express appeal to racial bias that not only undermined the integrity of his own death sentence, it undermined the integrity of the court's. Second, he now faces execution."
2016.15-8049,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,640.12,642.34,"That's the Third Circuit test, isn't it?"
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,642.34,642.54,Yes.
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,651.43,667.575,"So the -- the -- the answer to Justice Alito is that in our opinion, we should say our interpretation of Rule 60B, in case it doesn't apply unless it's a capital case? Rule 60B doesn't draw that distinction."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,667.575,668.08,No.
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,681.97,687.3,"The risk of injustice, if it was a sentence for ten years, that's unjust."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,687.3,687.99,Absolutely.
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,687.99,688.08,Okay.
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,688.74,689.37,So there are more.
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,689.37,689.765,What else?
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,689.765,696.46,There are more. The risk of injustice and impairing the integrity of the judicial system more broadly.
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,697.58,699.06,I guess the same answer there.
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,706.33,706.68,Right.
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,706.68,713.03,But it's hard to factor in why it's different in the context of interpreting particular rules.
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,713.03,741.05,"You know, I would say additionally, though, here, Your Honor, particularly unique to Mr. Buck's case, we have the State acknowledging that it has no significant finality interest in Mr. Buck's death sentence. And when you add to that the fact that Mr. Buck's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is -- is, you know, to be mildly meritorious, you know, you have a group of factors which I think can -- this Court should provide guidance around --"
2016.15-8049,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,741.05,752.725,"The State did change its mind with respect to Mr. Buck's case, and I assume they'll tell us that there's a reason for that."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,772.58,775.36,"You know, this is a unique circumstance."
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,807.44,830.44,"To the -- to the extent it is a unique case, it really doesn't provide a basis for us to say anything at all about how the Fifth Circuit approaches Certificates of Appealability, does it? It's a unique case, so this would be an odd platform to issue general rules. But in the brief you say, well, the Fifth Circuit grants these in a very small percentage of cases."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,838.84,841.0,"Well, it's certainly an extraordinary case."
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,864.55,894.575,"Was it wrong? Was it wrong for the court of appeals to conduct the merits inquiry in this case? I mean, they went to considerable length in trying to determine whether or not the claims were valid. Was that an error? Should they have just said, well, you know, the -- the test is what, substantial -- showing a substantial -- a substantial showing of denial? They should have just done, you know, kind of a sort of quick-and-dirty peek at the merits and say, yeah, there might be something there."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,894.575,894.75,Yes.
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,894.75,897.8,So did they err in looking at it more closely?
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,897.8,904.21,Certainly this Court has made clear time and again the COA analysis is a threshold review of the merits.
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,904.21,913.86,"So should our decision be just that, they erred in looking at the merits? They should have just issued a Certificate of Appealability and sent it back? That's not what you want, is it?"
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,913.86,915.24,"I -- no, no, it's not."
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,938.06,940.96,"Well, but it seems to me we're well beyond a COA should issue."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,948.925,954.08,I would like for this Court to say that there was a constitutional violation in this case --
2016.15-8049,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,954.08,970.82,"Ms. Swarns, I would have thought that your answer would be that, you know, you think this is so -- such an extraordinary case, and that the Fifth Circuit got this so wrong, that it's the best proof that there is that the Court is -- is approaching the COA inquiry in the wrong way."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,970.82,971.16,Right.
2016.15-8049,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,971.16,973.51,If they reached the wrong result in this case --
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,973.51,973.705,Right.
2016.15-8049,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,973.705,977.9,-- it's because they are just not understanding what the COA inquiry is all about.
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,977.9,978.19,Right.
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1006.985,1018.51,So what is the test you -- should we say the Fifth Circuit should apply in considering whether to issue Certificates of Appealability? Do you have anything to add to the statutory language?
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1018.51,1021.76,"You know, I don't think -- I -- I don't have additional language."
2016.15-8049,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1056.175,1076.81,Would it be possible to defend what the Fifth Circuit did based on the prejudice prong of Strickland? There -- there was a lot of evidence both relating to the offense that was committed and to other conduct by Petitioner that would show future dangerousness.
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1084.22,1089.385,There is certainly the -- Texas certainly presented evidence of future dangerousness in this case.
2016.15-8049,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1171.9,1186.69,"Counselor, I know that there's been a lot of talk about how small the reference to race was with respect to the questioning at trial on both sides, but how much was it a part of the actual report, because that's what the jury asked for?"
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1186.69,1187.245,Uh-huh.
2016.15-8049,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1187.245,1192.63,And they asked for two things: Could they consider life without parole?
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1192.63,1193.135,Uh-huh.
2016.15-8049,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1193.135,1196.3,So they were obviously considering mercy.
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1197.27,1197.79,Correct.
2016.15-8049,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1197.79,1202.895,"I don't know if all of them, but someone wanted to talk about it, that's what they told the judge."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1211.93,1212.08,Uh-huh.
2016.15-8049,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1212.08,1213.51,"-- but if you do you, can tell me?"
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1213.51,1213.785,Yeah.
2016.15-8049,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1213.785,1217.19,"But, number two, they asked for the psychiatric report."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1217.19,1217.905,That's correct.
2016.15-8049,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1217.905,1229.025,"Does that -- not to have the testimony reread, but for the report. So tell me what -- how that changes the calculus, those two things in any way."
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1229.025,1229.785,Sure.
2016.15-8049,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1242.03,1246.95,"They were told that he would be eligible for parole after, what was it, 40 years?"
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1246.95,1247.93,"No, they were not."
2016.15-8049,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1247.93,1249.54,They were not given that information?
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1249.54,1250.76,"If that were true -- no, they were not."
2016.15-8049,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1268.97,1273.585,How old was Mr. Buck? How old was Mr. Buck at the time?
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1273.585,1275.025,I think he was in his 20s.
2016.15-8049,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1357.33,1360.91,Do we know what the composition of the jury was in this case?
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1360.91,1362.98,"It's not in the records, Your Honor."
2016.15-8049,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1462.4,1463.06,He killed people.
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1479.565,1480.02,No.
2016.15-8049,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1480.2,1481.42,His stepsister?
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1481.42,1482.13,No.
2016.15-8049,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1482.935,1483.5,I'm sorry.
2016.15-8049,0,62750,christina_a_swarns,,1484.71,1485.68,"Yes, exactly."
2016.15-8049,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1559.73,1572.205,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Keller."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1572.205,1581.37,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We're here today defending the death sentence because Petitioner murdered a mother in front of her children."
2016.15-8049,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1586.195,1609.915,"I assume the facts -- I assume the facts in the other Saldano cases are similarly heinous, the ones where the state determined that nonetheless that there was a risk that they would be sentenced to death because of their race. And I don't understand -- I understand the procedural differences in this case, but I don't understand why that ultimate conclusion doesn't apply here as well."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1618.95,1628.63,"There's a key distinction between when a government, a prosecuting authority, is introducing evidence of racist dangerousness."
2016.15-8049,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1638.68,1643.895,"But the prosecutor revisited it, Mr. Keller, in cross-examination."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1643.895,1649.03,"To put that into context, the prosecutor did not go beyond the scope of direct."
2016.15-8049,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1690.43,1708.49,Doesn't -- doesn't the fact that Petitioner's own counsel introduced this show how abysmal his representation was? I don't know why it should make a difference that the Petitioner's counsel introduced this evidence.
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1726.96,1729.635,And we are not defending defense counsel's actions.
2016.15-8049,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1755.44,1768.875,"Why does it matter who uses race? I mean, in Batson challenges we don't care if the person exercising a racial challenge is the prosecutor or the defense attorney."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1796.89,1797.21,Yeah.
2016.15-8049,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1803.67,1813.76,"Well, the level of prejudice is the reasonable possibility that if one juror, because Texas uses one juror does not agree with death, death is not imposed, correct?"
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1813.76,1814.44,Correct.
2016.15-8049,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1814.44,1865.715,"So if one -- is it a reasonable possibility that one juror, even the one who sent the note that says is it possible to do parole, life without parole, could have been convinced to exercise mercy if race wasn't used, can you answer that question ""absolutely not""? When, in at least one of the Saldano cases, a man poured gasoline on a woman and watched her die, we had a nation that was mortified, shocked, and completely traumatized by watching a pilot burn to death."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1869.46,1876.03,"Here, Petitioner executed a mother when she was on her knees in front of her children with her daughter jumping on her --"
2016.15-8049,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1876.03,1885.94,"I don't say it's not, but why is that heinousness so much greater that no jury could have exercised mercy? No juror."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1885.94,1894.785,The standard -- the standard in the Strickland second-prong prejudice analysis is whether there is a substantial likelihood of a different outcome.
2016.15-8049,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1899.035,1903.81,"""Reasonable probability"" is the actual language, not ""substantial."""
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1903.81,1920.32,"And Harrington v. Richter said, ""The likelihood of a different result must be substantial, not just conceivable."" It's 562 U.S. at 111. If I can address the jury deliberation point for a moment: The Petitioner is correct the jury deliberated over the course of two days, but this is only for three hours and 13 minutes."
2016.15-8049,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1952.389,1966.775,"I'm not sure how the quickness of the determination helps you at all, when one response would be, well, they had this evidence that he was, by virtue of his race, likely to be dangerous, so they didn't spend that much time on it."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1966.775,1975.21,"And the -- and the argument here is that under these circumstances when they were focused on the crime scene video, that would have been what the jury --"
2016.15-8049,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1975.21,2000.105,"We're not in the jury room. We do know that the prosecutor asked the expert witness, is it correct that the race factor, black, increases the future dangerousness for various complicated reasons. And he says, yes. So that seems -- I mean, you can't prove it, that that was the key factor, but it seems like it could have been a substantial factor."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2076.005,2079.78,"For two reasons, and both are controlled by Gonzalez v. Crosby."
2016.15-8049,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2102.13,2106.585,And all this took place after this Court decided Martinez and Trevino?
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2106.585,2109.6,In the context of the second 60(b) motion.
2016.15-8049,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2109.6,2113.135,"Yeah, I mean, you listed a whole bunch of things in which he could have done."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2121.095,2127.095,The Federal habeas petition asking for a COA and the first 60 (b) motion were before Martinez.
2016.15-8049,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2136.66,2139.605,He did exactly what you would have expected him to do.
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2152.445,2152.7,Yeah.
2016.15-8049,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2160.65,2178.11,"Isn't this substantially different than Gonzalez? Wasn't it important in Gonzalez that the nature -- what the nature of the error was? In Gonzalez what the court said, the error is commonplace to -- lawyers misjudge time limits all the time."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2222.475,2225.32,This is certainly an unusual case.
2016.15-8049,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.32,2249.16,"Gonzalez v. Crosby, to my understanding, involved a change in the AEDPA statute of limitations; is that right?"
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2249.16,2249.655,Correct.
2016.15-8049,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2249.655,2252.88,"As soon as I say those words, I'm confused. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-8049,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2252.88,2279.52,"I mean, there are all kinds of statutes of limitations, and this is one of them that the court said he didn't -- he didn't pursue the change diligently, and besides, it wasn't that big a deal, and not every interpretation of Federal statute setting habeas requirements provides cause for reopening cases long since filed, and the change was not extraordinary, and it was because in part of Petitioner's lack of diligence in pursuing it."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2286.785,2298.23,"Well, insofar as the extraordinary circumstances analysis under 60(b) has been performed, I believe the Fifth Circuit was correct in that it has to be an extraordinary circumstance justifying relief from the judgment."
2016.15-8049,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2316.83,2328.155,"I understand your arguments on the merits, but do they apply equally to the Certificate of Appealability? I mean, you argue that you should prevail on the merits."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2354.49,2369.77,"It's clearly a harder standard for us under the Certificate of Appealability standard, but even then you'd be asking would reasonable jurists debate whether the district court abused its discretion in declining to find extraordinary circumstances."
2016.15-8049,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2369.77,2371.35,"Well, that gets tougher and tougher."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2415.195,2422.81,And I think this would be a difficult case to infer anything widespread from the Fifth Circuit's practice.
2016.15-8049,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2440.63,2443.54,"You know, I guess my question kind of cuts the other way."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2460.03,2476.47,"Well, and the Fifth Circuit on occasion hears oral argument in considering whether to grant a COA in the capital posture insofar as the court would provide or believe that that is not the type of process that should be afforded at the COA stage, in accordance with AEDPA --"
2016.15-8049,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2476.47,2480.94,Oral argument -- oral argument on whether to grant the COA?
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2480.94,2481.37,Yes.
2016.15-8049,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2489.18,2511.2,"Mr. Keller, you know, some of the statistics that Petitioner have pointed us to -- in capital cases, a COA is denied in 60 percent of Fifth Circuit cases as compared to 6 percent of Eleventh Circuit cases, two roughly similar circuits where COA's are denied in capital cases ten times more in the Fifth Circuit."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2515.1,2519.11,And the court has said that the COA should serve a gatekeeping function.
2016.15-8049,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2557.335,2565.48,So is your suggestion that they deny more because they've taken up more search and look at the merits than the other circuits?
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2565.48,2584.195,"I think it -- insofar as the statistics could be shown that there is, in fact, a different denial and grant rate, I think the level of process that the Fifth Circuit is receiving and -- and the quantum of argument may be going to those statistics, because the Fifth Circuit is not simply ignoring these claims."
2016.15-8049,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2585.67,2587.44,"But this is the whole point, really."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2602.28,2606.05,And I don't think what the Fifth Circuit did here is decide the merits.
2016.15-8049,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2623.53,2645.325,"It doesn't say anything to the Fifth Circuit that three State court judges, two of their colleagues on the Fifth Circuit, two justices of this Court, have said or found Mr. Buck's case debatable, because that's the standard."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2657.37,2660.72,And the Fifth Circuit took these arguments seriously.
2016.15-8049,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2661.89,2675.37,"That's not the issue. They are supposed to decide whether to grant COA or not on whether the questions are serious or not, debatable, not decide the merits."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2686.62,2714.59,"Here the issue would be could reasonable jurists debate whether the district court abused its discretion in finding extraordinary circumstances? And so while the reasonable jurist standard is lower, that's balanced, though, against the more deferential abuse of discretion standard and the heightened extraordinary circumstances standard that this Court has noted will rarely be met in the habeas context. In our brief we present a few examples of courts finding extraordinary circumstances."
2016.15-8049,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2727.38,2734.209,There -- there were extraordinary circumstances in the other cases? In the other five cases?
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2734.209,2738.81,In the other five cases in which the State confessed error?
2016.15-8049,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2738.81,2739.38,Yes.
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2739.38,2752.49,"Well, there we admit that since the prosecution was the one that was eliciting the race-based testimony, that that would go to a -- a due process and equal protection violation, and that would be an extraordinary circumstance --"
2016.15-8049,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2752.49,2759.255,But if you said that that's because those -- that's -- it's more prejudicial when the prosecution introduces this? Is that what you said --
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2759.255,2759.48,Yes.
2016.15-8049,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2759.48,2762.1,-- to Justice Ginsburg? That -- that's your basic theory?
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2762.1,2764.525,The State was using it as an aggravator.
2016.15-8049,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2764.525,2765.16,Yeah.
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2768.6,2769.86,Both points.
2016.15-8049,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2770.51,2776.5,"Because I don't -- I guess if there's both points, tell me what the other point is because I guess I just don't understand that point."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2811.56,2816.08,Except it's not the case here that Quijano was only testifying about race.
2016.15-8049,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2834.13,2842.42,I didn't think that your primary argument had to do with the -- the relative prejudice of having it done by the prosecutor and the defense attorney.
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2864.24,2865.48,That's absolutely correct.
2016.15-8049,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2888.44,2888.7,Yes.
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2913.66,2919.51,"Justice Kagan, when the State is the one injecting race into a proceeding, that's using it as an aggravator."
2016.15-8049,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2921.835,2926.295,People expect the State to use whatever aggravators it has at hand.
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2956.44,2967.05,"Well, this Court, I don't believe, has ever recognized a situation in which a defense counsel's act could give rise to structural error or per se prejudice."
2016.15-8049,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2985.88,3004.895,"What is the relationship between the ruling on prejudice with respect to ineffective assistance and the 60(b) analysis? I mean, do you agree that if we disagree with your submission on prejudice under Strickland, that your 60(b) analysis kind of falls apart?"
2016.15-8049,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3004.895,3010.8,"Clearly the underlying claim on the merits would be stronger, and -- and it would be a lot more extraordinary under 60(b)."
2016.15-8049,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,3010.8,3037.0,"It is a factor that could be considered in doing the extraordinary circumstances analysis, because if there were extraordinary circumstances that were going to justify, really, from the judgment, that would be a factor in the totality of the circumstances the Court would be -- it could consider in doing that analysis. If you have no further questions, we'd ask the Court to affirm the judgment of the Fifth Circuit."
2016.15-8049,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3037.0,3043.23,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Swarns, you have four minutes remaining."
2016.15-8049,2,62750,christina_a_swarns,,3043.23,3052.785,This Court has long recognized that the integrity of the courts requires unceasing events to eradicate racial prejudice from our criminal justice system.
2016.15-8049,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3306.9,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
