1978.77-983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.394,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Washington and others against Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association and the consolidated cases.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,22.779,25.662,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,43.339,45.486,"Well, where are they?"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,45.486,57.633,The clerk has them Mr. Justice Brennan and would not -- Mr. Claiborne just delivered them to him and he didn't wish to put them on your desks until you stated the desire to have them.
1978.77-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,57.633,58.803,I see.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,61.228,75.255,"The central issue in this litigation, the issue to which every other question is subsidiary is the meaning of the phrase and I quote, ""and common with all citizens"" found in each of the treaties with which we are concerned."
1978.77-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,101.327,107.646,"Well, what if we thought that the ""and"" question has already been answered and it wasn't open here?"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,107.646,119.503,If you felt that the question had already been answered that or that it were final in some respect or another we would not be able to bring it here in this litigation.
1978.77-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,119.503,119.516,"Well, I take it you're going to --"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,119.516,119.965,The United States --
1978.77-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,119.965,121.536,-- indicate why you think it's open here.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,121.536,122.425,Yes.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,132.359,134.93,Is the -- those aren't the only words of Article 3?
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,134.93,138.298,They are not and I will deal with the usual and accustomed --
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,138.298,139.367,"Well, and also --"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,139.367,139.717,(Voice Overlap) as well.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,139.717,141.243,-- the right of taking fish.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,141.243,141.424,Yes.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,141.424,142.869,The right of taking fish.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,142.869,146.631,Yes that the entire phrase speaks of the fish and --
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,146.631,148.356,And the right of taking fish.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,148.356,154.672,"The right of taking fish usual and accustomed stations and ""in common with the citizens of the Territory""."
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,154.672,168.322,"The District Court in its original opinion and the Court of Appeals in its original affirmance thought that the phrase ""in common with all the citizens in the Territory"" was the key in critical --"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,168.322,168.941,Exactly.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,168.941,170.809,-- phrase but it may not be.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,170.809,188.76,The crux of our position here again Mr. Justice Stewart is that the District Court's decision mandating a 50% allocation of anadromous fish to treaty Indians is without support either in that treaty language or in the circumstances surrounding the execution of the treaties.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,269.677,270.125,Are there any --
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,270.125,273.308,Thus the major limitation -- excuse me.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,273.308,278.179,"How about the seasons, the season limitations on them and catch limits on Indians?"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,278.179,286.308,That is the -- that's the crux of the case as to whether or not that type of regulation can be imposed to non-Indians equally with others.
1978.77-983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,711.024,718.412,When you say they had a right to -- was it a different right from the right of the Indians?
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,718.412,718.99,No.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,799.562,809.062,"General Gorton, in that connection in Article -- Article II refers to said Indians, what's the -- does this -- what does ""said"" means?"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,809.062,814.21,"""Said"" refers to Indians who are members of the tribes which signed that particular treaty."
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,830.205,831.492,The Indians or the tribes doing.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,831.492,833.851,The tribes and they spoken of these tribes.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,833.851,835.202,That's what I thought.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,835.202,839.078,There is reserved to the tribes out of those grants --
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,839.078,839.297,Reservations?
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,839.297,840.12,-- lands as reservations.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,840.12,841.219,Land reservations?
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,841.219,842.705,But what about fisheries?
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,850.647,853.468,"But now what -- and what do you think ""said Indians"" mean?"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,853.468,867.933,It means the Indians as individuals who were members of the tribes which signed the treaty just as citizens referred to citizens who were part of the corporate body of the United States itself.
1978.77-983,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,867.933,878.613,"General Gorton, does the state take any provision as to whether any position rather as to whether the treaty was or was not self executing?"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,878.613,883.056,The state has not taken an explicit position on that treaty.
1978.77-983,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,912.908,920.318,Ordinarily a non-self executing treaty requires legislation by Congress not by the states.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,920.318,930.41,There -- I was directing it however at the right of the state agency to enforce those treaty obligations as you may interpret them.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,941.494,946.985,"What in 1979 do you think ""said"" mean, ""said Indian""?"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,946.985,948.867,Exactly what it meant in 1854.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,948.867,950.986,I don't know because those people are all dead.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,950.986,953.97,"Oh, the successors, their descendants."
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,953.97,955.438,Present tribal members or any --
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,955.438,955.568,Yes.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,955.568,961.108,-- descendants of the people who were tribal members in 1855.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,961.927,988.285,The complexity of who is a tribal member is turgid and perhaps too difficult for me to go into because the Indian tribes by and large set their own membership and the people are often granted membership in various tribes who have an extremely tenuous blood relationship with the Indians who signed the original treaty.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,988.285,999.329,I was wondering about the concession that you quoted to us on the part of the tribes that you said that Indians generally didn't have any treaty rights at all unless they were present tribal members.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,999.329,1004.735,"Not -- unless they were present tribal members, unless they were members of treaty tribes."
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1004.735,1005.884,Yes.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1005.884,1006.202,Yes.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1006.202,1007.47,Present members of treaty tribes.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1007.47,1008.12,Correct.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1008.12,1011.339,And I wondered whence that concession?
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1011.339,1019.961,The concession simply recognizes the fact that the special rights of treaty tribes stemmed from the treaty and not some -- not from something --
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1019.961,1021.319,I understood the --
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1021.319,1021.64,-- preceding your (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1021.64,1028.576,"-- that your submission is not the rights of the treaty tribes it -- at least under Article III, it's the rights of Indians, individual Indians, isn't it?"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1028.576,1033.249,"Yes but by reason of their status, by reason of their membership in certain tribes."
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1033.249,1038.278,"And in 1979, what status, the direct descendants of those who were tribal members of (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1038.278,1038.665,Members of the tribe.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1038.665,1041.74,-- of the tribal members.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1041.74,1042.672,Members of the tribes.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1043.098,1044.807,Perhaps the members of the treaty tribes?
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1044.807,1046.277,Present members of the treaty tribes.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1051.693,1052.454,Yes.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1052.454,1053.568,-- but that contest has not yet taken place.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1053.568,1061.733,"But if his great grandfather was a member of the tribe and he is now works in a filling station in Seattle, he has no rights under the treaty?"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1061.733,1063.489,"Oh, yes he does."
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1063.489,1064.868,But he's not now a member of the tribe --
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1064.868,1065.5,Yes he is.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1065.5,1067.415,"Well, let's assume he resigned."
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1067.415,1068.887,Then he would lose those rights.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1080.472,1080.849,"Yes, I know."
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1080.849,1084.226,"-- and in cities, perhaps the majority of them."
1978.77-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.745,1194.949,You're referring to a fishery as a commercial fishery?
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1194.949,1195.825,Yes.
1978.77-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.825,1197.044,In that case there was no commercial (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1197.044,1201.682,"No, the -- well, the entire fishery was preempted by non-Indians by your decision --"
1978.77-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.682,1204.345,But commercial fishing was absolutely free.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1204.345,1206.324,Commercial fishing was absolutely barred.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1248.806,1257.145,Those cases involved a -- or at least Puyallup I and II involved a sport fishing for steelhead --
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1257.145,1257.442,Yes.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1257.442,1261.003,-- and this case involves primarily at least commercial fishing for salmon.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1261.003,1261.665,For salmon.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1411.189,1414.965,Is there any freshwater fishing involved in this case at all?
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1414.965,1415.705,Yes.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1418.627,1419.42,That's what I thought.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1419.42,1419.481,-- to their very sources.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1419.481,1420.571,And it is (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1420.571,1424.888,But the principle focus of the case is on the salt water marine fishery.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1425.502,1432.89,There's no indication on this map or any other map of this accustomed -- usual and accustomed grounds and stations.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1432.89,1434.199,They're everything.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1434.199,1434.974,"Well, but you said --"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1434.974,1435.14,For one --
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1435.14,1436.504,-- going upstream.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1436.504,1437.937,"Oh, well, that's right."
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1447.086,1450.62,"But the Pacific Salmon deteriorate in quality as they go upstream, don't they?"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1450.62,1451.94,"Most of them do, yes."
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1457.513,1459.555,There is commercial fishing of them by the Indians (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1459.555,1461.943,"By the Indians, not by non-Inidians."
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1461.943,1462.646,In freshwater?
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1462.646,1463.603,Yes.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1463.603,1465.137,And that is involved in this case.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1465.137,1465.947,Yes.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1465.947,1469.854,"And their right to fish, that those accustomed --"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1469.854,1470.312,They have a right to fish --
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1470.312,1470.944,-- grounds and stations must be --
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1470.944,1471.62,-- if those usual and accustomed places --
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1471.62,1473.512,"-- very ephemeral, so there are no fish there, wouldn't it?"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1473.512,1475.23,Which is -- pardon?
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1477.613,1478.999,"What's the ""right to fish"" mean?"
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1480.775,1483.186,That is exactly correct.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1500.379,1500.838,Yes.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1500.838,1514.257,It is however not only terrible management policy but has also been abandoned by this Court as long ago as Winans and even by the way the United States manages its marine fishery for this reason.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1581.482,1582.945,What is a fish wheel?
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1583.051,1583.721,"Fish wheels are -- well, a --"
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1583.721,1584.543,"Yes, just take your time."
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1584.543,1586.1,A method of taking fish which is now outlawed --
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1586.1,1586.635,Some sort of a trap?
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1586.635,1587.942,-- because it catches -- yes.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1589.448,1591.537,Yes.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1591.537,1594.766,It was on privately owned land on an Indian station.
1978.77-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.061,1731.357,You've gotten around to my question.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1731.357,1733.216,I'm sorry.
1978.77-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.216,1735.332,Why is that issue open here?
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1735.332,1752.879,That issue was open here for the same reason that the -- an issue was open whenever you have denied certiorari in earlier proceedings in the same case and later accept certiorari in connection with later orders in the same case involving the same parties.
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1752.879,1763.334,"So, it is open as a matter of res judicata but the Government doesn't rely on the -- the Solicitor General doesn't rely on res judicata but rather on more prudential."
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1763.334,1769.885,The Solicitor General tells you that you should not judge this case on the merits because we're bad people is essentially what it --
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1769.885,1771.275,"Well, among other things."
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1771.275,1772.607,-- it amounts to.
1978.77-983,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1797.66,1802.121,"In this case, who is the father, who is the son?"
1978.77-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1802.121,1803.555,You're the son.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1803.555,1805.271,"Yes, exactly."
1978.77-983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1807.144,1807.638,Thank you --
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1807.638,1807.759,I'll reserve --
1978.77-983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1807.759,1808.658,-- Attorney General.
1978.77-983,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1808.658,1821.379,-- the balance of my time.
1978.77-983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1821.379,1823.689,Mr. Lacovara.
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1823.689,1827.739,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1978.77-983,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1953.652,1964.644,And would it be your theory Mr. Lacovara that in that treaty the United States as one party was the surrogate for all other than Indians?
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1964.644,1984.465,"In the treaty it was guaranteeing the rights, the continued fishing rights of the citizens of the territory now the citizens of the State of Washington and the treaty so says the language of Article III of the treaties secures the rights of Indians ""in common with"" the rights of the citizens, of the territory."
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2000.769,2009.642,"Well, you think -- is it your submission Mr. Lacovara that Article III doesn't give to Indians any superior or special rights whatsoever?"
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2009.642,2027.212,"It gives them superior rights only to the extent that the Court in Winans for example has said, the state cannot legitimize a complete exclusion of Indians from the fishery through the medium of private ownership of the lands."
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2032.522,2036.374,"(Inaudible) private property to get to these places, (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2036.374,2037.972,Winan so held that it should --
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2037.972,2039.183,-- which citizens would not have.
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2039.183,2041.184,"Which citizens would not have, that's right."
1978.77-983,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2041.549,2042.022,Do you think the --
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2042.022,2051.333,"In Tulee for example, the Court said, ""Indians under the treaty are also immune from licensing right"", regulations also, a protection that citizens would not have."
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2051.367,2059.725,"So you concede that Indians are given superior and different in other -- in rights than citizens by Article III, don't you or you just have?"
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2059.725,2068.618,"No, I think the point Mr. Justice Stewart is that the Indians have certain protections as against state abrogation or interference with those rights."
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2068.779,2070.827,Which citizens don't have.
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2070.827,2071.63,That is correct.
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2071.63,2074.152,So they do have -- Indians do have superior rights and different (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2074.152,2075.255,As against the state.
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2075.255,2075.277,Yes.
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2075.277,2081.17,Certainly the right that the Indians obtained under the treaty can be qualified by federal legislation.
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2081.17,2081.652,Right.
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2081.652,2103.268,The question though is whether or not the right of access which Indians are to be given is one that can be turned from a shield if you will against state interference into a sword which allows the Indians to keep to demand that the state keep non-Indians from fishing side by side.
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2125.164,2132.273,"Well, at the very least Article III makes clear that the rights secured or reserved to the Indians is not an exclusive right."
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2132.273,2133.316,Yes sir.
1978.77-983,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.119,2185.139,I suppose you would indicate -- you would say that the state might be able to cancel all commercial fishing for salmon for several years but not Indians.
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2185.139,2188.077,"If it were acting for conservation purposes, it would have the power."
1978.77-983,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2188.077,2190.421,Say it is not?
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2190.421,2203.359,I'm not sure what other aspect of the police power the state would be relying on just willy-nilly to cancel commercial salmon harvesting unless it were to be the conservation power.
1978.77-983,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2204.715,2211.162,"You still don't meet my question, assume it could, it couldn't do it with the Indians?"
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2211.162,2211.811,Not --
1978.77-983,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2211.811,2212.641,Under the treaty?
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2212.641,2213.615,That is correct.
1978.77-983,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.615,2213.672,Yes.
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2213.672,2222.537,"But if the state has the power to eliminate non-commercial fishing for non-conservation purposes, the Court's decisions in Winans, Tulee and Puyallup indicate that the state cannot do that for Indians."
1978.77-983,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2222.537,2229.525,"I am not talking about down in Virginia, they stopped fishing because of the poison, remember?"
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2229.525,2237.987,I would assume that the state would have that power even as respects Indians but that extraordinary --
1978.77-983,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2237.987,2240.029,The same level as what you did?
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2240.029,2252.581,"Yes, that kind of extraordinary development I think would give rise to police power in the same sense that the Court held that there was an implied police power even as respects Indians under these treaties."
1978.77-983,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2296.525,2302.545,"Mr. Lacovara, but the -- but isn't it inevitable if there is some discrimination against non-Indians?"
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2311.966,2317.256,"Mr. Justice Stevens, its not so much -- how much discrimination but what type that is at issue here."
1978.77-983,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2317.256,2322.726,"Don't you agree that there is sort of a given that we start with, there is some discrimination in favor of the Indians by virtue of the treaty."
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2322.726,2324.077,"Yes, yes."
1978.77-983,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2333.654,2336.175,But it (Voice Overlap) discriminate against the Indians?
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2336.175,2337.041,I think not.
1978.77-983,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2337.041,2338.795,"Well, it took a land."
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2338.795,2340.634,They didn't take it Mr. Justice.
1978.77-983,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2374.923,2375.212,What part was that --
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2375.212,2376.437,-- which the Indians had no choice in it.
1978.77-983,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2376.437,2382.362,"I didn't think you need to say that it discriminated on either side, I know I just -- that's --"
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2382.362,2383.063,"Well, what we're --"
1978.77-983,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.063,2383.626,That's not all.
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2383.626,2391.538,What we're trying to do Mr. Justice is to eliminate the discrimination which is inherent and this my third point in a 50/50 allocation.
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2452.867,2466.674,"Well Mr. Lacovara, let's consider for a moment this upstream accustomed places and stations, in Article III it gives the Indians the right of taking fish there."
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2466.674,2467.818,Yes.
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2467.818,2486.028,"Would you concede that if the State of Washington or any other government should threw its licensing and supervision of fishing adopts such rules, regulations that would be -- assure that there were no fish there that that would be a violation of the treaty?"
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2486.028,2495.375,Mr. Justice I think the key inquiry should be as it was in Puyallup II whether or not the rights of those Indians or the successors (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2495.375,2496.436,The right to take fish?
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2496.436,2502.435,The right to take fish at usual and accustomed grounds not necessarily each specific ground.
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2505.298,2508.236,"Well, do you (Voice Overlap) specific grounds, you'd come to all of them and so --"
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2508.236,2508.828,Yes.
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.599,2528.705,Well that
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2528.705,2528.841,It --
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.841,2530.51,Doesn't quite answer my question.
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2530.51,2534.81,"Well, what I'm suggesting is that there is no discrimination against Indians."
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2534.81,2548.334,"No, no, I'm talking about if there's a treaty violation if the State of Washington so operates it conservation rules and regulations as to guarantee that there are no fish at this upstream station and grounds."
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2548.334,2550.747,My answer would be there is no treaty violation unless --
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2550.747,2554.674,"Because there is a right of taking fish there, guaranteed to the Indians by Article (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2554.674,2556.813,To the extent that fish were there and there was no guarantee --
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2556.813,2562.696,And doesn't that imply some kind of duty to allocate or to see to it that there are some fish there?
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2562.696,2566.154,I don't think it does Mr. Justice but we're a long way from that.
1978.77-983,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.983,2604.195,"But if there were, the District Court certainly violated the treaty."
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2604.195,2605.346,Yes.
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2637.722,2653.415,"Do you think that there -- can be implied from the rights given to the Indians by Article III of the -- these treaties, any duty whatsoever of any allocation whatsoever of fish to the Indians."
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2653.415,2659.059,"In the absence of discrimination I would say no, discrimination in the Puyallup sense."
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2667.802,2669.192,"Well, access to fishing sites, (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2669.192,2669.916,The fishing sites.
1978.77-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2669.916,2672.755,-- just a bath where you can fish all day and not catch anything.
1978.77-983,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2672.755,2673.269,That's correct.
1978.77-983,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2747.991,2749.11,Very well Mr. Lacovara.
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,2756.645,2759.863,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-983,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2868.649,2877.202,"But the essential question is what under the treaty the state had the right to do it and what it didn't, is it not Mr. Morisset?"
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,2877.202,2879.13,"That's the essential question, yes."
1978.77-983,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2900.232,2912.312,"It's conceivable that everything it did before 1915 was barred by the treaty and nonetheless the District Court's order might or might not have -- be in accordance with the treaty, is it not?"
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,2912.312,2913.96,"That's true, be conceivable."
1978.77-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2933.961,2937.436,"Is your opponent correct though, the first thing we have to decide is what is the treaty right?"
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,2937.436,2938.258,Yes.
1978.77-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2938.258,2940.586,"What is -- what does it mean ""in common with""?"
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,2956.782,2959.825,First of all the practical matter that virtually can't happen.
1978.77-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2960.741,2962.725,Assume it could happen under the District Court's findings.
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,2962.725,2963.255,Alright.
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2979.997,2983.698,And doesn't another Indian tribe have a legitimate complaint in that situation?
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,2983.698,2985.378,"Undoubtedly, against the Makahs --"
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2985.378,2985.918,Well if no --
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,2985.918,2986.682,-- but not against the State of Wahsington.
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2986.682,2997.732,"(Voice Overlap) under the treaty if the district judge is correct, not just a right against the other tribes, they have a right against the United States, the other signatory to the treaty."
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,2997.732,2998.553,That's right.
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3002.529,3002.782,(Inaudible)
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3002.782,3003.455,-- no tribes have sued each other.
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3003.455,3011.758,(Inaudible) my Brother Stevens suggest that it test the validity of district judge's construction of the treaty?
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3011.758,3017.039,"Well, it may test it vis-à-vis an action against the United States or tribes."
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3025.257,3033.974,"Yes, but its permitted a certain group of fishermen to take all the fish, they just happen to be Indians but they --"
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3033.974,3034.022,Well the --
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.022,3040.125,-- the state has filed to prevent the exhaustion of the (Inaudible)?
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3040.125,3051.189,The District Court found that the State of Washington had prevented any tribes anywhere basically from taking its share of the fish.
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3051.189,3059.804,"Well, suppose it permits one tribe to take them all, take all the Indian share, isn't it -- just as much trouble?"
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3059.804,3062.527,No it isn't on their decision.
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.603,3066.809,They are the treaty isn't it?
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3074.241,3085.287,"No, I don't believe that the State of Washington has an obligation under the treaties to allocate fish among the tribes as a matter for them, between themselves or for them in the United States Government."
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3087.499,3092.438,Is it trouble if it fails to provide fish -- the Indian share of the fish but --
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3092.438,3093.296,"No, no."
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3093.296,3097.321,But it's -- not in any trouble if it deprives all but one tribe (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3097.321,3100.737,"No, you're misstating what it's in trouble of, of what it did."
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3106.916,3107.124,But it (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3107.124,3108.443,That's when it's in trouble.
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3108.443,3112.81,But it can be preempted by one tribe without the state being in trouble?
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3112.81,3113.911,That's right.
1978.77-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3120.934,3131.402,"Well Mr. Morisset, putting the same problem, a little different framework, let's put ourselves back in 1854 and 55 and say there are three or four tribes on the same river."
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3145.742,3160.836,"Well, he intended to allow the signatories to any one treaty and there are five major ones and sixth that -- as a peripheral interest here to receive as the District Court found."
1978.77-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3173.392,3183.872,But is that a reasonable interpretation of the situation at time if there were more than one tribe on one river affected by two successive treaties?
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3183.872,3198.102,"Well, maybe I don't understand your question, Mr. Justice Stevens but certainly the Indians and Governor Stevens knew that there were a lot of Indians from different tribes and bands that would all be fishing together."
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3239.106,3250.538,"Well, the state has obligated than I gather from your point of view to allot -- to make sure that some fish, that would reach Indian fishing ground."
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3250.538,3264.705,"No, not in the sense that they must guarantee freedom from Acts Of God and freedom from interceptions by other Indian tribes."
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3273.177,3280.501,"But this isn't a duty not to -- if the reason is that non-Indian fishermen have taken it, the state is in trouble."
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3280.501,3283.678,That's right because of the history of how they've done it.
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3308.383,3322.048,"Well, I think the state concedes that it has a duty to provide what it calls an equal opportunity of fishery and if in fact these present law don't, I think it concedes that they should be modified because of that duty."
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3325.064,3325.651,That's correct.
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3402.906,3404.62,I'm certain the Indians wouldn't know anything about it (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3404.62,3405.76,That's right.
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3439.113,3451.544,"Well, let's I want to agree with you, didn't then Judge Boldt err in his first decision by thinking almost that he had no discretion that it -- that ""in common with"" meant 50%?"
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3451.544,3452.671,"No, I don't think he erred."
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3482.126,3482.351,"That ""in common with"" (Voice Overlap) 50% --"
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3482.351,3483.954,-- but that's what it was.
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3483.954,3488.743,"-- and then the Court of Appeals in affirming it said, ""Well, (Inaudible) ""in common"" and that means 50%."
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3488.743,3491.003,"That's one of the rationales that he used, yes."
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3506.67,3517.647,Do you agree with the -- what the Attorney General's reading of your brief that nontreaty Indians are just like the ordinary -- like the non-Indians?
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3517.647,3521.32,I don't ever agree with Mr. Gorton to much.
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3522.741,3524.202,"No, would this be too much or not?"
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3524.202,3527.92,"No, he doesn't quite understand Federal Indian law."
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3554.471,3555.104,So non --
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3555.104,3556.931,-- that they didn't have them at some point.
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3556.931,3560.67,"Well, are there some nontreaty Indians in Washington?"
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3560.67,3563.639,There are some in the southwestern part of the state.
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3563.639,3567.025,Do they have any fishing -- they're like --
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3567.025,3570.078,"No, they are citizens -- as far as (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-983,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3570.078,3585.278,"So you would say if there was -- if there had been a treaty with only one tribe that had this fishing allocation in it, Judge Boldt would still have been right to have given 50% to that one tribe and none to the other tribes would have any fishing right."
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3585.278,3596.775,"That its places only and none of the other tribes would have rights, they would've had a claim for taking which is what all these pages and pages of Claims Commission cases are about as well as the land claims."
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3668.832,3673.418,Would you -- you of course say that Article III was a reservation?
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3673.418,3673.892,Yes.
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3673.892,3679.24,"Although by its terms it's unlike Article II for example, it certainly is not, is it?"
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3683.83,3684.232,As to --
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3684.232,3693.911,-- which could lead to the argument that it wasn't a reservation that there was a conveyance of it and then an agreement that nonetheless these rights would be secured.
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3693.911,3698.462,"Oh, Article II of the Point Elliot Treaty reserves certain lands --"
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3698.462,3700.99,Because they were -- by its terms a reservation.
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3705.875,3709.309,"Now let's see, Article III doesn't have the --"
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3709.309,3709.357,(Inaudible)
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3709.357,3712.26,"In this treaty, it's a different -- I'm sorry, here's a different article."
1978.77-983,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3716.382,3717.355,"I think most of them do, if not all."
1978.77-983,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3717.355,3720.102,"Right, and I -- yes, I think you're right."
1978.77-983,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3737.592,3739.096,Mr. Claiborne.
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3739.096,3742.653,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3763.105,3764.761,Is conceded which way?
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3764.761,3765.748,That it may.
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3765.748,3766.187,What?
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3766.187,3769.929,That the state may regulate the Indian fishing right provided that it --
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3769.929,3773.259,"It may have or it may not, both, it can't require licenses, isn't that correct?"
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3773.259,3778.958,It may regulate it in the name -- in the interest of conservation when that is necessary.
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3778.958,3786.632,"But in certain things it may not apply, certain of it's -- if its conservation laws, it may not apply to the Indians, isn't that right?"
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3786.632,3791.191,"The question Mr. Justice Stewart is yes, which it can and which it cannot that this --"
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3791.191,3795.921,"But in any event its all conceited one way or the other, is that your point?"
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3795.921,3803.727,"There is no -- I mean only to say this, there's no claim of immunity from state conservation laws."
1978.77-983,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3891.164,3905.092,"Mr. Claiborne is it correct that it would've been totally valueless that -- there wasn't any easement problem, I missed the possible, they're usual to custom banks or the streams could've all been bought up by private owners and without this right, they wouldn't have had access."
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3905.092,3920.956,"Mr. Justice Stevens, in that respect alone, that is that the peculiarity of the right of access granted by the treaty is said to be as Winans' held that it includes a right to cross private property a right not otherwise available to citizens."
1978.77-983,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3920.956,3927.137,"And they could be quite vital could it not, it's not just a matter of wondering around in open land."
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3927.137,3934.914,"It could but when we are speaking of fishing in Puget Sound, that is of course a meaningless aspect of the right."
1978.77-983,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3948.565,3949.516,"From the water, right."
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3949.516,3951.386,They could only be fished from the bank.
1978.77-983,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3961.048,3968.549,"But the treaty itself doesn't spells out the right to build structures and so forth, so it does seem to be thinking at least in part about access."
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3968.549,3971.403,"Well, the treaties are all of the pattern Mr. Justice Stewart."
1978.77-983,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3984.771,3988.136,"I'm referring to the ""erecting temporary houses"" language which does seem --"
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3988.136,3988.265,Yes.
1978.77-983,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3988.265,3990.511,-- to be thinking in terms of access.
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3990.511,3994.601,"Mr. Justice Stevens, I suggest that that language is of not much value in Puget Sound."
1978.77-983,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3996.738,3999.026,(Inaudible) at some place.
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3999.026,4000.997,"Indeed, indeed."
1978.77-983,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4000.997,4021.137,"When you talk about that thing not being of much value, if you -- if the states map at page 348 of areas 1 and 2 on the Strait of Juan de Fuca means anything, there is a very substantial stretch of land where access rights to the strait would mean something, I would think."
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4021.137,4041.714,"But Mr. Justice Stevens those are banks -- those areas are fished by both, not from the bank and as long as there is a place where others are public access to the strait, it matters not whether it's adjacent to the usual and accustomed fishing grounds."
1978.77-983,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4041.714,4044.942,That's strictly both fishing in the strait?
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4044.942,4048.528,I think that's so.
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4054.251,4056.561,"Well, it's at least a right of access; Winans holds that."
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4056.561,4058.745,"Of course, of course."
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4059.872,4065.246,"And there are no alternatives, it's this or that cause it clearly and concededly is a right of access, isn't it?"
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4065.246,4070.109,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, I meant to suggest that it is more it is a share in the fishery."
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4175.389,4180.584,You sort of construe that as the -- as a guarantee of the right of catching fish --
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4180.584,4180.8,Well --
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4180.8,4183.723,-- not just to the right of fishing?
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4183.723,4185.323,I go by stages Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4185.323,4190.495,"Yeah, I must say I would have -- that's alright, I would've greatly enjoyed it many times."
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4192.292,4204.906,We say it's a guarantee against encroachments or interferences with the right to fish in particularized locations.
1978.77-983,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4310.343,4327.488,"Well, Mr.-- excuse me, Mr.-- the Solicitor General, the accustomed fishing ground for these tribes, I take this -- the -- from this -- the Attorney General's statement is the entire Puget Sound."
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4327.488,4335.388,This -- if one puts together the separate accustomed fishing grounds of --
1978.77-983,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4335.388,4342.339,"Yes, but the state doesn't suggest that any tribe is precluded from fishing anywhere in Puget Sound, do you?"
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4342.339,4345.741,The tribe as the statement has suggested that I suggest is --
1978.77-983,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4345.741,4350.608,"What about the treaty, do you think the treaty gives any particular tribe the right to fish anywhere in Puget Sound?"
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4350.608,4351.24,No.
1978.77-983,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4352.567,4354.11,"Well, why doesn't it?"
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4354.11,4362.402,"Because the individual treaties give individual tribes particularized locations and beyond that area, they are not protected by the treaty."
1978.77-983,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4362.402,4373.677,"Well, are they protected in the treaty -- by the treaty from -- is there -- are -- does the treaty give them a right that you speak of to take fish in Puget Sound?"
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4373.677,4378.958,It gives some tribes of protected right to fish in some parts of Puget Sound.
1978.77-983,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4386.523,4395.285,So if a -- I suppose then you could think of a tribe that if it were found fishing in the straits.
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4395.285,4396.989,Exactly so.
1978.77-983,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4396.989,4401.798,That -- some of them might have the right to do that or some might not have a treaty right to do it.
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4401.798,4402.029,Yes.
1978.77-983,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4461.279,4476.298,"So you would say that the state would still be violating the treaty if said, ""The only place we're going to allow fishing is out here in this particular four-mile square area of Puget Sound."
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4481.061,4484.178,"Yes Mr. Justice White, I would say that --"
1978.77-983,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4484.178,4489.619,And they can -- that each of them can take as many as they want as long as they leave enough for conservation.
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4489.619,4506.885,"I would say that the tribes of the Lower Sound had been promised, had been secured or the right which they reserved and which was always there to fish in their rivers, at the mouths of their rivers and nearby."
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4506.885,4507.975,A right to take fish though.
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4507.975,4509.047,A right to take fish there --
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4509.047,4509.523,(Inaudible)
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4509.523,4522.895,"But -- in Mr. Justice White's example, they'd be prevented from attempting to take fish and that in less that were essentials of conservation which your example does not suggest --"

1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4523.395,4524.883,It would be about instruments treaty?
1978.77-983,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4524.883,4535.443,"Do you agree with your -- let's see, with the counsel that the state would be in no travel if it permitted one tribe to take the fish."
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4535.443,4538.219,Mr. Justice White I think I have to differ with him --
1978.77-983,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4538.219,4538.623,I'm only thinking --
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4538.623,4540.987,-- on that point.
1978.77-983,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4672.623,4678.568,"Well, maybe it was the District Court who overpromised?"
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4678.568,4690.601,"Mr. Justice White, the District Court merely said that the total Indian share are ought not exceed 50%."
1978.77-983,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4709.447,4724.481,"Mr. Claiborne, I can't get to it at your -- I don't know where pits in but I understood you to say that you did not rely on the word common as creating the 50% figure but rather that the describe the -- ultimately it leads to an allocation of 50%."
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4728.879,4730.803,"Mr. Justice Stevens, I obviously misspoke."
1978.77-983,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4783.865,4788.198,"Well, but that assumes that the Indians had a 100% before the treaty."
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4788.198,4794.562,And that is precisely what this Court explicitly said in its most recent decision in Puyallup.
1978.77-983,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4803.421,4803.949,Exclusive --
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4803.949,4805.139,They gave that much away in the treaty.
1978.77-983,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4805.139,4811.387,Exclusive rights in all the waterways out to the three mile limit?
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4811.387,4818.738,"I'm only quoting this Court's decision in Puyallup which of course involved the river, well (Inaudible)."
1978.77-983,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4818.738,4820.446,I don't remember that quote.
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4820.446,4862.252,Well -- Mr. Justice Stevens I believe it occurs -- on page 176 of the 433rd volume of the United States reports --

1978.77-983,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4939.566,4943.555,What did the tribes give up in the Treaty of Medicine Creek?
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4943.555,4946.238,They gave up most of their land and --
1978.77-983,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4946.238,4948.894,And was that the whole State of Washington?
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4948.894,4953.938,"It was all of the State of Washington, west of the Cascade Mountains."

1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5031.773,5031.787,They --
1978.77-983,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5031.787,5038.538,"They had exclusive rights until others came along and began to compete with them, did they not?"
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5038.538,5058.863,"Mr. Chief Justice, to some extent the historical assumption is -- must be qualified by the fact that there were indeed other people already who had come there, the donation act in 1850 had invited settlers to come into the Oregon territory which included all of Washington and much else."
1978.77-983,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5058.863,5067.272,"The period was once an exclusive right whether -- then put in another time frame, the date of the treaty, that's another problem."
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5070.207,5090.72,"Exactly so Mr. Chief Justice and -- but what is in the bottom to -- is that the Government of the United States recognized that the Indian title, the Indian occupancy was exclusive and ought to be ended by a treaty."
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5222.694,5223.678,In Winans?

1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5253.429,5266.216,"I have Mr. Justice Stewart and it gives me an occasion to correct an impression which is perhaps been left with the Court, I'm sure inadvertently by the Attorney General."
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5273.481,5275.229,What he say -- you say he was not doing that.
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5275.229,5276.409,He was not doing that.
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5276.555,5278.347,What was he doing?
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5278.347,5290.307,-- devoted most of his brief to the proposition that the Indians had been promised a right to fish there not elsewhere whether there were other places was not ahead of that.
1978.77-983,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5336.354,5337.747,"Well, (Voice Overlap) has to be in something."
1978.77-983,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5340.458,5359.04,"He did suggest and if I can turn to his precise suggestion, they were four fish wheels in the case which monopolized that at least the location was where the wheels were."
1978.77-983,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5560.425,5564.818,Mr. Attorney General you have three minutes left.
1978.77-983,4,41407,slade_gorton,,5564.818,5574.003,"Mr. Chief Justice Stewart, Mr. Claiborne in reading from the Solicitor General's instructions said that he skipped a little bit, here's what he skipped."
1978.77-983,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5619.936,5623.394,Is that (Voice Overlap) by negotiation and agreement?
1978.77-983,4,41407,slade_gorton,,5623.394,5624.966,I can't answer that --
1978.77-983,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5624.966,5626.031,I don't know.
1978.77-983,4,41407,slade_gorton,,5626.031,5627.67,-- that question specifically.
1978.77-983,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5666.284,5671.539,Maybe you would have the right to negotiate and agree with that and maybe you wouldn't have the right to do it unilaterally.
1978.77-983,4,41407,slade_gorton,,5671.539,5679.586,"In any event, I've -- my -- the thrust of argument is that in Winans that's what you said by asking than to follow --"
1978.77-983,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5679.586,5679.6,Yes.
1978.77-983,4,41407,slade_gorton,,5679.6,5683.73,-- the Solicitor General could be done is what happens when dams are done.
1978.77-983,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5690.345,5713.861,"Well, Mr. Claiborne's concluding point was as I understood him that the Winan's right of Indian access to this usual and accustomed spots is one part of the Article III guarantee and another part of it is that there will be fish there when the Indians get there, sort of the -- their freedom with the fish -- to have some fish to get there (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-983,4,41407,slade_gorton,,5713.861,5714.634,Or --
1978.77-983,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5714.634,5717.052,-- then that must imply some duty of allocation.
1978.77-983,4,41407,slade_gorton,,5717.052,5718.378,It clearly does.

1978.77-983,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5734.275,5737.293,That's not what the Solicitor General said today.
1978.77-983,4,41407,slade_gorton,,5737.293,5738.41,It certainly was not.
1978.77-983,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5738.41,5741.75,"Well, that's only about what he said today, aren't we?"
1978.77-983,4,41407,slade_gorton,,5741.75,5746.309,"Mr. Justice Stevens, it is correct."

1978.77-983,4,41407,slade_gorton,,5794.224,5795.295,No.

1978.77-983,4,41407,slade_gorton,,5853.363,5853.37,Pardon?
1978.77-983,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5853.37,5856.154,Supposing you took off the limit on the number of non-Indian licenses?
1978.77-983,4,41407,slade_gorton,,5856.154,5868.948,"That might very well at some point, a large -- to bring us to a violation of the treaty because we were preempting the non-Indian -- the Indian fishery as we were in Puyallup II."
1978.77-983,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5871.642,5871.946,Right.
1978.77-983,4,41407,slade_gorton,,5871.946,5876.97,But we are not required to allocate 50% plus or any fixed number or any --
