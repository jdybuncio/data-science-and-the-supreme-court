2000.99-9136,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.132,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-9136, Earthy Daniels v. United States."
2000.99-9136,0,26209,g_michael_tanaka,,9.528,12.606,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-9136,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,51.217,64.566,May I ask whether the record shows whether the petitioner challenged those '78 and '81 convictions in a timely manner on direct appeal at the State and/or Federal level?
2000.99-9136,0,26209,g_michael_tanaka,,64.566,66.446,I don't believe that's in the record.
2000.99-9136,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,71.248,82.34,"You know, it seems to me that the opportunity to make those challenges very likely occurred when the convictions became final."
2000.99-9136,0,26209,g_michael_tanaka,,82.34,93.018,"That's true, Your Honor, and I'm sure that there was, in California, a procedure for direct appeal and, lacking that, also collateral review of those convictions, but that's not what's at issue today."
2000.99-9136,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1419.539,1423.06,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-9136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1442.52,1443.125,With certain exceptions.
2000.99-9136,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1443.125,1449.631,"--With the exception of a conviction that was entered in violation of Gideon v. Wainwright, that's correct, Justice Stevens."
2000.99-9136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1449.631,1451.941,You think that's the only such exception?
2000.99-9136,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1451.941,1456.804,"I think that that is the line that the Court drew in Custis, Justice O'Connor."
2000.99-9136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1477.357,1488.861,"Well, how about a so called Brady violation, where the facts aren't known until maybe immediately before the sentencing proceeding in the new crime?"
2000.99-9136,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1488.861,1495.191,"Well, there are two distinctions between that kind of a situation and the Gideon situation."
2000.99-9136,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1536.998,1542.057,"Well, what about a DNA claim in a death case coming up later?"
2000.99-9136,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1542.057,1560.572,"Well, the second... I think, Justice O'Connor, that is the second distinction in your hypothetical, that the hypothetical posits that this was information about a constitutional claim that could not with due diligence have been obtained, I'm assuming within any time for bringing an appropriate appeal or collateral challenge."
2000.99-9136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1644.319,1647.042,Do you make that argument even if it's a Gideon violation?
2000.99-9136,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1661.466,1666.689,"--Under this Court's decision in Custis he may at the Federal sentencing raise it, and I--"
2000.99-9136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1666.689,1668.038,"No, no, not at the Federal sentencing."
2000.99-9136,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1679.246,1689.58,"--That would be a procedural default, Justice Stevens, and I think it would bar the defendant from coming back even if there were otherwise a right to come back under applicable procedure."
2000.99-9136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1689.58,1694.147,Would that be true even if the sentence had not been served where there was a Gideon violation?
2000.99-9136,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1694.147,1698.049,The sentence of the... the underlying conviction--
2000.99-9136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1698.049,1699.059,"This would always have to have been served, wouldn't it?"
2000.99-9136,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1699.059,1707.822,"--Well, if the underlying conviction sentence had not been served, then the defendant's remedy would be to go back into the jurisdiction that entered it and see if he can comply with--"
2000.99-9136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1707.822,1707.822,"He couldn't then go in on a 2255 and call that to the court's attention and get relief, in your view?"
2000.99-9136,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1707.822,1730.33,"--I don't think so, Justice Stevens, because he has the right to do that under Custis at the Federal sentencing proceeding itself, and the failure to bring that claim at a timely point in the proceeding, when it is available, would constitute a default, and then he would be left with the argument--"
2000.99-9136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1730.33,1732.846,Even if he had... even if it was inadequate assistance of counsel?
2000.99-9136,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1732.846,1742.394,"--Well, inadequate assistance of counsel isn't even permitted to be brought under this Court's decision in Custis with respect to the underlying conviction."
2000.99-9136,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1805.202,1816.427,"Yes, but it's the therefore part that I guess is giving us all the trouble, and the reason it's giving me trouble is, number 1... of course, I was a dissenter in Custis, so maybe I'm looking for trouble--"
2000.99-9136,2,26209,g_michael_tanaka,,3173.155,3180.018,I'd first like to address the question of what Custis left open.
