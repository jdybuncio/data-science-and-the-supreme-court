1982.81-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.606,We will hear arguments next in Texas against Brown.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,17.962,22.496,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,348.475,352.009,"Now, what did you say was observed in the glove compartment?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,352.009,354.795,"Three classes of items, Your Honor."
1982.81-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,397.205,402.042,Any firearms discovered?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,402.042,402.909,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.494,416.202,"Well, Mr. Marshall, could I ask you, when was the decision in the Court of Criminal Appeals?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,416.202,418.738,It was in the spring of 1981.
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,432.395,436.33,Did you... had Bolton been announced at that time?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,436.33,441.734,"My recollection is that it may have been announced on the very same day, on July 1st."
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,441.734,447.321,"Well, what do you make of this statement in the... in the Court of Appeals... in the Court of Appeals opinion:"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,459.613,469.671,I believe what they were talking about there is what I would refer to in a moment as the so-called prior lawful intrusion aspect of the plain view doctrine.
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,469.671,474.907,"I know, but they say they do not... they apparently say he was legally arrested."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,474.907,476.774,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,477.34,486.013,"Well, if he was legally... if he was legally arrested at the time, what kind of a search of the vehicle would have been authorized under Bolton?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,486.013,489.232,"--Well, certainly under New York v. Belton, a search of the entire--"
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,489.232,489.834,"Or Belton, yes."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,489.834,491.384,--The entire passenger compartment.
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,491.384,492.536,Including... including the balloons.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,492.536,494.136,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that's right."
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,494.136,499.273,"Well, do we... isn't that the end of the case if he was legally arrested?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,499.273,504.927,"Well, I believe the facts didn't develop that way, at least the way the testimony was developed."
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,504.927,509.146,"Well, the case comes here to us with the Texas court having said he was legally arrested."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,509.146,520.369,"Well, what I'm trying to say is that the officer's testimony was... and, of course, there is always that dispute about when the formal arrest occurred... was that he did not place the respondent under arrest."
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.369,521.336,You don't have to find facts.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,523.471,525.84,I realize that.
1982.81-419,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,534.363,540.517,"Well, then, I suppose... how would you explain their setting aside the conviction if they had found he was legally arrested?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,546.171,551.206,"Well, another thing, if I could clarify this, this respondent has--"
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,551.206,552.575,Because Belton came down on the same day.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,552.575,569.369,"--This respondent has never raised, nor did the Court of Criminal Appeals address the actual search inside the balloon but merely the seizure of it, which I believe took place when the officer reached inside the car and when he determined that there was some powder in the balloon."
1982.81-419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,585.879,587.331,I wonder... excuse me.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,595.001,602.091,"The officer did testify that he issued a ticket for no operator's license, the respondent never having produced one."
1982.81-419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,610.444,619.802,Is there any doubt as to which arrest the Texas Court of Appeals was talking about in its opinion when it says we don't doubt the validity of the arrest Are they talking about the drug arrest?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,621.202,622.268,"--That is certainly what I thought, Your Honor."
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.268,629.074,--They refer... they refer to the fact that we do not question the propriety of the arrest since appellant failed to produce a driver's license.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,632.193,644.168,"Well, as I say, I know they said that, and I think they also were saying when they don't question the stop that they were assuming under Delaware v. Prouse, the initial stop of the vehicle was proper."
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,652.689,658.677,Is failure to produce a driver's license ever an occasion for a custodial arrest?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,658.677,663.645,Under our state law it would be possible to make a custodial arrest for that.
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.866,668.749,Okay.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,669.249,669.749,Yes.
1982.81-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,669.749,676.905,"Now, you referred to the panel having considered it and then another step in there."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,683.893,692.748,"No, Your Honor, it wouldn't have been, because as I said, my recollection is Belton was decided either on the same day or one day after the Court of Criminal Appeals--"
1982.81-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,692.748,697.468,"Yes, but I thought you said there was some effort after that to get reconsideration by the Court of Appeals."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,697.468,698.118,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,703.039,704.089,I see.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,704.089,710.776,"When they declined to hear the case, under state procedures we had no ability to make a second motion for rehearing."
1982.81-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,751.187,763.578,Ordinarily isn't an inventory process something that occurs after the vehicle and the person have been taken to the police headquarters?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,768.315,777.754,There is some testimony about this in our record indicating that Fort Worth officers make an initial quick inventory and fill out what they called a record sheet.
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,777.754,781.056,"Well, that's after... that's after you've got some business to do it."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,781.056,781.522,Yes.
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.522,784.341,"Like having made an arrest, which requires probable cause."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,784.341,784.808,Yes.
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,784.808,800.036,"Mr. Attorney General, if I can go back a little, do I understand your position to be that this man was stopped and the officer asked him for a license, and he reached in his pocket and said I don't have a license but I've got an illegal drug and a dollar bill?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,800.036,803.238,"That is what he brought out of his pocket, Your Honor."
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,804.138,805.94,I just wanted to be sure I understood you.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,805.94,823.485,"--I suppose it's an equal inference from the record whether he was trying to get the balloon out of his pocket because he was afraid the officer might come across it, or if it was just sheer bad luck on his part that it became wedged in his hand when he may have legitimately been looking for a license."
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,830.555,833.257,You mean he was going to bribe the officer with a dollar?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,834.757,835.293,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,845.915,848.767,"Well, according to you he never did have a driver's license."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,848.767,850.385,"No, Your Honor, he never produced one."
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,850.385,852.536,So he wasn't reaching for a driver's license.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,852.536,857.472,"Assuming he was consciously aware that he didn't have one, I think that would be true."
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,858.991,864.693,I would think people are consciously aware of what they have and what they don't have in their pockets.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,864.693,869.764,"Well, I would think most of the time, but I can't read the mind of this respondent."
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.764,873.732,May I ask you a question about your theory of the plain view doctrine?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,896.062,898.331,"Yes, Your Honor, that's right."
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,898.331,903.835,And is that because the person seeing the balloon has probable cause to believe its contents are contraband?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,903.835,904.568,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.103,907.503,All right.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,924.565,930.553,"--Your Honor, I think they would have the power to seize the suitcase."
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,943.645,946.045,"Well, here did they also open the balloon?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,946.045,948.364,At some point they certainly did analyze--
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,948.364,948.88,Without a warrant.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,948.88,951.463,"--Yes, Your Honor, as far as I know."
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,951.463,952.915,Then why couldn't you open the suitcase?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,952.915,961.354,The only reason I hesitate there is because of the... this Court's so-called container cases... Chadwick and Sanders.
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,961.354,962.571,"Well, that's exactly the point of my question."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,964.24,966.842,"Your Honor, it may be."
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.411,974.261,I understand.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,974.261,974.861,--Not the opening of it.
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,982.517,992.373,"Well, is it your position that a law enforcement officer may seize a container whenever the container is in plain view and he has probable cause to believe the container has contraband within it?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,992.373,993.325,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,994.242,994.725,That's your position.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,994.725,995.275,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-419,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1074.461,1094.207,"Well, without regard to Belton, if there was probable cause, as your Court of Criminal Appeals said, and the propriety of the arrest, that was on probable cause, could they not have... couldn't the officers have seized the balloon without regard to what its contents were?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1094.207,1099.428,"--Well, I think they would have had to have had probable cause to think it was in fact seizable."
1982.81-419,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1111.652,1114.521,"Well, I... I... I... I just wonder without regard to Belton."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1124.377,1131.982,"--Well, I suppose that brings up kind of an interesting problem again as was alluded to earlier: what did the Court of Criminal Appeals mean by the arrest."
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1157.181,1160.467,But the search was made when he was at the back of the car.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1160.467,1164.085,"The seizure of the balloon was, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1165.137,1166.571,He moved to the back of the car.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1166.571,1167.489,--Yes.
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1168.073,1170.441,So there was nothing in that car that he could have touched.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1170.441,1171.125,No.
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1176.761,1179.213,Nothing that man could do in the back of the car.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1179.213,1180.88,I wouldn't think so.
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1180.88,1189.652,"Well, it's my understanding that in Texas anybody with a balloon is subject to arrest."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1189.652,1191.521,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1192.971,1196.306,"Well, what else do you have to have in addition to the balloon?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1196.306,1199.608,"--Well, we think you have to have probable cause, and it's--"
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1199.608,1200.46,Like what?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1200.46,1201.577,--Pardon me?
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1201.577,1203.746,Like what?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1203.746,1231.663,"Well, in this case the unusual nature in which this balloon was brought out of his pocket and, in our view, discreetly or surreptitiously dropped along his pants leg onto the car set; the distinctive knotted nature of this balloon which the officer said he associated with narcotics; and then what we think are obvious narcotics packaging items in the glove box... the milk sugar, the powder, the plastic vials, the bag of balloons."
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1250.06,1253.695,"Well, I don't... the experience he has in balloons?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1253.695,1255.795,"Well, that is one thing, Your Honor."
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1268.104,1269.338,I'm not interested in that.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1277.21,1278.16,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1289.685,1291.72,"Well, he was all by himself, wasn't he?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1291.72,1299.723,"--Well, all by himself in terms of another person, but not all by himself in terms of narcotics packaging paraphernalia in the glove box."
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1317.252,1319.787,"Let me ask you, have you ever knotted a toy balloon?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1319.787,1321.406,I have.
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1321.856,1322.506,"Well, I thought so."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1325.025,1325.575,"--No, sir."
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1328.477,1328.76,I know.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1328.76,1332.029,And I didn't have all the other items in the glove box.
1982.81-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1343.736,1345.688,It's humorous four years?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1346.404,1374.791,"--Humorous on the facts of this seizure, that it seems, in our view, which we hope will prevail but which, of course, is a matter for the Court to decide, that this was so clearly probable cause; and yet, the Court of Criminal Appeals said the officer had to know what was inside the balloon, says nothing about the officer's testimony concerning his experience with this very type of balloon, everything else."
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1385.646,1386.648,I just wonder if this is really a plain view case.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1399.573,1400.775,Yes.
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.775,1407.429,And then you say... but you're really not saying that there was an item all by itself in plain view that was subject to seizure.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1407.429,1415.951,"Well, I suppose this balloon in context is an item that's subject to seizure."
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1424.723,1425.656,"Well, that's... that's exactly what's troubling me."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1440.733,1442.768,"Your Honor, I believe that's true."

1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1446.904,1448.339,To the extent--
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1448.339,1450.556,You don't want us to analyze it as a container case.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1450.556,1466.633,"--The reason I don't want it analyzed as a container case or don't think it should be is because the container cases, Chadwick and Sanders and at least whatever dicta is left in Robbins, are ones dealing with the entry inside the container, not the seizure of it."
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1473.721,1476.756,"Well, but... but do you concede that it was wrong to take a look inside the balloon here?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1476.756,1478.358,"No, I don't."
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1479.008,1479.508,"Well, then--"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1479.508,1480.31,--Concede that.
1982.81-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.877,1515.733,"--And under your view, the plain view doctrine applies whenever a container which is in plain view is... probably contains contraband."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1515.733,1520.768,"As far as the mere seizure of the container is concerned, I believe that would be our position."
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.768,1525.089,That's just surplusage isn't it really?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1537.23,1539.515,"Well, I know this Court has--"
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1539.515,1540.498,That's all you really need to say.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1542.55,1553.739,"--Well, I know there is even to me some indication in this Court's cases whether plain view is an independent basis, or if Your Honor's suggestion would completely cover the waterfront, so to speak."
1982.81-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1553.739,1556.358,"Well, doesn't Belton take care of that?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1556.358,1577.807,"Again, had this case been litigated differently, the facts turned out slightly differently, had the Court of Criminal Appeals approached it from a different manner, it possibly on these precise facts could have been held... could have been decided as a search incident to arrest where the... you search the interior of the vehicle when you arrest the occupants."
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.807,1587.662,"Do you think Belton applies... let's suppose that I stop a... well, in Texas an officer stops a person for speeding and gives him a ticket."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1603.272,1604.958,"Well, not Belton."
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.826,1609.11,"Well, that's what I mean."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1617.099,1625.287,"The way Belton sits right now I would say so, assuming a custodial arrest were made for the speeding and it's transported to the station."
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.287,1626.404,"Well, I didn't say a custodial arrest."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1627.287,1629.239,"Well, I'm sorry then, Justice White."
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.239,1635.727,"Well, they stopped him, and they said you just wait here; I'm going to give you a ticket, and also I'm going to search your interior of your car."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1635.727,1641.047,Then I don't think merely giving a ticket would authorize a Belton type of search of the vehicle.
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.916,1646.618,Would you call that giving him a ticket an arrest?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1646.618,1651.689,"--I don't believe so, at least not in the sense--"
1982.81-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1651.689,1652.155,All right.
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1656.891,1659.509,--Apparently so.
1982.81-419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1659.509,1666.281,"Well, certainly if you're giving somebody a ticket there's some... there's some element of seizure, isn't there?"
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1673.435,1674.085,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.852,1676.137,You're not free to drive away.

1982.81-419,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1685.41,1691.314,"Mr. Marshall, you didn't mention, I believe, the independent state ground issue in your discussion."
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1691.314,1692.097,Very well.
1982.81-419,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1744.131,1747.733,Would Texas law be any different than the federal law in this case?
1982.81-419,0,19514,c_chris_marshall,,1747.733,1754.654,I am not aware of any decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals that has ever announced any special state law plain view doctrine.
1982.81-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1759.441,1760.158,Yes.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,1763.612,1766.647,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-419,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1848.099,1857.121,"Mr. Butcher, can you cite any Texas case that's treated Article I, Section 9 of the Texas constitution any differently than the Fourth Amendment?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,1925.865,1927.351,"No, sir, it's not."
1982.81-419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1930.603,1931.603,"Would you repeat that, please?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,1931.603,1935.907,556 Southwest Second 796.
1982.81-419,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1935.907,1952.618,"Are you aware of Crowell v. State, a Texas Criminal Court of Appeals case which stated that Article I, Section 9 of the constitution of Texas and the Fourth Amendment to the federal Constitution are in all material respects the same?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,1952.618,1955.903,"No, ma'am, I'm not familiar with that."
1982.81-419,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1987.34,1989.957,"I guess he didn't persuade his colleagues, though."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,1989.957,1991.243,"No, he didn't."
1982.81-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.701,2053.734,"Mr. Butcher, would it be fair to say that the opinion of those judges... Judge McCormick, Dowley, Davis... dissenting from the en banc hearing proposition treated the opinion of the Court of Appeals, of the panel as a federal constitutional case?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2056.852,2063.006,"I don't think so, sir, and the reason I don't think so is that Coolidge is cited."
1982.81-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2071.528,2076.599,"Well, I'm not asking you about how you would interpret the Court of Appeals panel opinion."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2084.086,2089.74,"--Well, it's certainly not clear, just as I would suggest the entire opinion is not clear as to what is the basis."
1982.81-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2134.436,2137.821,And it would be very easy for the Court of Appeals to make it clear.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2137.821,2138.923,"--Yes, it would."
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.157,2177.631,"Well, would you... assume the Court agreed with you that it ought to go back for that purpose, but I suppose you would object to saying to reconsider also in the light of Belton."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2177.631,2180.167,"No, I wouldn't, because this is not a Belton case."
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2181.0,2188.404,"Well, I know, but assume the... that's only because you say that the arrest they were referring to was a traffic arrest."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2188.404,2191.022,"--No, it's not a traffic arrest, Your Honor."
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.471,2225.862,"Well, I'm just asking... referring to this passage in the Court of Appeals opinion, just saying we do not question the propriety of the arrest since appellant failed to produce a driver's license."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2225.862,2230.1,"--Well, the--"
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.1,2246.109,"If there was an arrest... if there was an arrest that is valid under state law, then it certainly wouldn't violate the federal Constitution if they searched the passenger compartment of the car."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2246.109,2250.561,"--That's true, if there was a valid arrest that preceded that."
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.279,2251.813,Well--
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2251.813,2253.881,--A look at the record shows that that is not the case.
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.881,2268.189,"--Well, I'm... I'm just... if you... if you suggest we ought to send it back to find out what the basis of their judgment was, if they decided that it was a federal ground, they would have to also... I would like to know what they meant by the arrest."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2268.189,2275.061,"Well, the record... I understand, and I have no good answer for you."
1982.81-419,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2275.061,2276.144,All right.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2285.15,2286.352,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-419,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2286.352,2290.404,Do you give people Miranda rights on traffic violations?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2290.404,2291.704,Generally not.
1982.81-419,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2291.704,2297.994,"Well, then don't you assume that he was arrested on the major charge--"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2297.994,2298.644,You don't even--
1982.81-419,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2298.644,2299.577,--At that stage?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2299.577,2301.112,"--Your Honor, you don't even have to assume that."
1982.81-419,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2302.512,2303.212,That's what I thought.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2303.212,2312.401,"On page 28, for example, Officer Maples testified... the question by Mr. Bankston:"
1982.81-419,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2337.099,2345.122,"Mr. Butcher, did the respondent challenge below the opening and inspection of the contents of the balloon?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2345.122,2346.105,"No, ma'am, they didn't."
1982.81-419,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2346.105,2348.157,Just the seizure of the balloon.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2348.157,2348.874,That's correct.
1982.81-419,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2357.18,2364.083,"And the seizure technically occurred prior to the arrest, according to the record, is that right?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2364.083,2368.32,"Well, perhaps at the same time as."
1982.81-419,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2368.32,2368.787,That's your position?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2369.803,2370.953,He saw the balloon.
1982.81-419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2383.963,2398.389,How do you explain the language in the Texas court's opinion that Justice White called your attention to and your opponent's attention: the arrest is not questioned since appellant failed to produce a driver's license.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2404.21,2405.343,"Well, it's conceivable."
1982.81-419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2422.422,2434.979,"Well, are they saying that even though the officer should not have seized the balloon and could not rely on that to support the arrest, nevertheless, a custodial arrest was permissible because he didn't have a driver's license?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2446.12,2446.52,That's correct.
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.244,2460.144,But they could have arrested him--
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2460.144,2461.128,--Could have but didn't.
1982.81-419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2461.128,2461.98,"--Well, but that--"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2461.98,2463.58,And they could have given him a ticket.
1982.81-419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.58,2468.934,"--But if there's a legal basis for the arrest, even if the officer acted for the wrong reason, I suppose that would not invalidate the arrest, would it?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2475.337,2475.92,That is correct.
1982.81-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2560.573,2567.811,The last instance you mentioned... I think it was about oral confessions... you referred to a Texas statutory provision.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2567.811,2568.411,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2568.411,2573.63,I suppose that would be apparent if the court were relying on a statutory provision.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2575.082,2585.688,"Well, in our brief we have cited a statute, Article 1.06 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure is... is a prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures."
1982.81-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.019,2609.987,Perhaps in your next case you can raise that.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2609.987,2613.005,In my next case I'm certainly going to include that.
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.005,2633.919,"The heart of your case, though, is challenging the notion that viewing this tied off balloon gave probable cause to believe anything except that it was a tied off balloon; because if it did give probable cause to believe there was narcotics in the balloon, why, he could have been arrested, and then the balloon could have been searched on the spot."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2633.919,2637.371,"Well, we--"
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2637.371,2638.573,Isn't that right?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2638.573,2641.775,"--Well, it's true if it gave rise to probable cause."
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2641.775,2642.425,"That's what I mean, yeah."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2643.892,2644.394,Yes.
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2657.317,2657.851,Why?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2657.851,2668.925,The reason is that in the record you don't have specific articulated rationales as to why this officer thought he had evidence of a crime before him.
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2671.794,2674.163,"Well, that's just saying that he didn't have probable cause."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2674.163,2677.715,--He could have had probable cause.
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2683.685,2693.808,"Well, do you say that's a... do you say that that violates the federal... the Fourth Amendment if there was actual probable cause there but the officer didn't know it?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2693.808,2697.611,--I'm saying that the Court--
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2697.611,2698.228,I don't know.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2700.344,2700.996,--No.
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.846,2728.031,"Well, he said he did."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2729.648,2733.618,"--Well, that's... I think a close reading of the record doesn't really show that."
1982.81-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2733.618,2759.167,"Well, do you think all of our cases saying that there was probable cause are based on testimony in the trial record that an officer said yes, I saw this thing, and I immediately thought it should be seized because there was reasonable grounds to think... a lot of probable cause holdings of this and other courts are just common sense statements by judges that if an officer saw this, he'd certainly have basis to seize or search."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2759.167,2761.269,"I understand, sir."
1982.81-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2761.269,2766.523,"And he did say here at the top of page 31 in answer to the question,"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2790.704,2797.292,"Well, I believe, Your Honor, that his experience is not clear; and that's really the key issue."
1982.81-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2805.814,2808.016,"Well, he said it in all but the words you've just said it now."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2808.016,2814.487,"Well, the Court of Criminal Appeals, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals looked at what he recited and found it insufficient."
1982.81-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2826.211,2833.983,"What about the things that he observed, the officer observed in the glove department... the typical utensils of the narcotics trade?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2836.685,2839.637,But they were--
1982.81-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2839.637,2840.187,Isn't that so?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2840.187,2840.687,--Yes.
1982.81-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2843.523,2847.041,"Well, can't he add these things up, add two and three and four and come to a conclusion?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2853.862,2855.247,"Yes, he did."
1982.81-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2856.664,2858.348,"Well, what more... what more does he need?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2858.348,2860.05,He needs to specify it.
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.436,2866.971,What did the trial court find?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2866.971,2873.025,The trial court found that the object was... they upheld the--
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2873.025,2876.144,"Well, I know they upheld, but did they say there was probable cause?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2876.144,2877.929,"--Well, that's implicit."
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2881.464,2885.583,And you said there wasn't probable cause to believe that the--
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2885.583,2890.987,There wasn't probable cause demonstrated in that courtroom that day.
1982.81-419,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2892.104,2907.615,"--Mr. Butcher, getting back to this question of not raising the point of opening the balloon, is it still true in Texas that you have to write out your exceptions during the trial?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2907.615,2911.917,Write out exceptions to the charge?
1982.81-419,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2911.917,2912.817,"No, sir."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2913.369,2914.569,"No, sir."
1982.81-419,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2915.369,2917.554,But you do have to make exceptions?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2917.554,2921.023,"You do have... well, you do have to have an objection."
1982.81-419,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2922.625,2923.125,Did you?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2923.125,2924.525,"--Yes, sir, we did."
1982.81-419,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2925.577,2926.477,And you just left it there?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2927.643,2928.795,Excuse me.
1982.81-419,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2928.795,2930.495,You didn't raise it on appeal.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2930.495,2931.231,"Well, I'm sorry."
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2936.635,2943.554,"Because if there was probable cause to believe the balloon had heroin in it, the show was over."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2943.554,2944.388,That's correct.
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.388,2945.906,Because he could have been arrested right then.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2945.906,2946.506,That's correct.
1982.81-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2947.123,2951.292,"He doesn't have to know in an absolute sense that it is heroin, does he?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2951.292,2951.81,"--No, he doesn't."
1982.81-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2952.46,2952.944,He's not a chemist.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,2952.944,2953.86,"--No, he doesn't."
1982.81-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3089.116,3096.289,Why does an officer know in the case of a handgun that's placed on the car... is there a law against carrying handguns in Texas?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3096.289,3097.239,"Yes, sir, there is."
1982.81-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3160.795,3166.449,So the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that that negative was not seizable?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3166.449,3166.885,That's correct.
1982.81-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3166.885,3171.77,"Although if it had been a print in the same place, it would have been seizable."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3171.77,3172.403,That's right.
1982.81-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3174.622,3179.526,I see what you mean about the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals having a different doctrine than the federal Constitution.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3205.843,3207.943,"Well, I--"
1982.81-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3207.943,3210.662,Why isn't the balloon just like the tinfoil package?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3210.662,3214.716,--It would be if the officer had said that.
1982.81-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3229.958,3232.327,"Well, then, what did he mean... I'll read that question to you again."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3244.218,3250.972,--But he didn't give any rational basis for why he believed there was a controlled substance in there.
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3250.972,3251.555,"Well, let me ask you this."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3294.132,3308.474,"Well, I recognize I'm going counter to the... to the... to the opinions, but it would seem to me that the officer... the officer making the stop, he's the one who has to recognize that he's got probable cause in front of him."
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3319.116,3320.932,Do you... do you... do you have... do you have cases to that effect?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3320.932,3321.549,"--No, sir."
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3321.549,3324.001,"You've got cases on the other side, don't you?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3324.001,3324.368,Yes.
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3324.368,3325.853,In this Court.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3325.853,3326.52,Yes.
1982.81-419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3326.52,3329.722,How does the Texas court treat that problem?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3338.761,3342.03,I don't know.
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3344.415,3353.67,"You don't think it was enough in this case that the fellow who examined the... who did the forensic examination, he said how many drug analyses have you done?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3363.945,3368.53,"Yes, but that testimony was from Frank Shiller, the chemist."
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3368.53,3369.215,I understand.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3369.215,3373.584,It still would bother my sense of justice if--
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3373.584,3374.284,Yes.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3374.784,3375.586,--You will--
1982.81-419,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3375.586,3376.353,Okay.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3376.353,3383.975,"--That the officer doing the act did not have the probable cause, and we shouldn't bootstrap it with somebody else's knowledge."
1982.81-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3383.975,3386.409,Does it trouble your sense of justice or your sense of procedure?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3386.409,3389.343,I think it troubles my sense of justice.
1982.81-419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3393.08,3395.699,Let me ask you another question about your Texas procedure.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3403.103,3403.72,Yes.
1982.81-419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3403.72,3407.155,Were they decided... do you know whether they were decided on Fourth Amendment or Texas grounds?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3407.155,3407.94,It's not clear.
1982.81-419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3502.402,3503.102,This isn't also a case.
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3508.306,3508.772,"Oh, no."
1982.81-419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3523.481,3524.198,Examples of what?
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3524.198,3537.139,"--Examples of incidents where you had an innocent item there that did in fact contain a controlled substance, but the officer was unable to articulate a rational basis for arriving at the conclusion that he had--"
1982.81-419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3537.139,3557.302,"Well, then, is it... are you arguing... I sometimes have difficulty being sure what you're arguing... but are you arguing that there is a set of Texas cases that sets aside searches on the ground that even if there might have been in an objective sense probable cause, it was nevertheless bad because the officer could not testify to facts that prompted him to do... to make the seizure?"
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3557.302,3557.919,--Yes.
1982.81-419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3558.835,3560.669,"Now, that may be a different rule than we apply."
1982.81-419,1,15640,allan_k_butcher,,3569.893,3571.143,--That's correct.
1982.81-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3574.345,3575.262,Very well.
1982.81-419,2,19514,c_chris_marshall,,3579.082,3582.634,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, if I have time to make just a couple of points."
1982.81-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3628.396,3629.515,"Well, you can arrest a person on probable cause."
1982.81-419,2,19514,c_chris_marshall,,3629.515,3630.031,Certainly.
