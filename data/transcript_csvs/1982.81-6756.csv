1982.81-6756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.261,We'll hear arguments next in Tuten against the United States.
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,125.354,130.883,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.81-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,491.252,503.7,"Ms. Stuntz, would your second ground require us to interpret differently than did the D.C. Court of Appeals a statute dealing primarily with local matters in the District?"
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,503.7,523.3,"--Mr. Justice, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, as I understand its treatment of that issue, which was very perfunctory, felt it was not a matter for its determination as a court, but that the issue was better addressed to Congress."
1982.81-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,523.3,527.783,"Well, that's one way of telling you that you lose, I suppose."
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,527.783,534.514,I do not think there would be involved any alteration of their interpretation.
1982.81-6756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,537.217,544.197,Is it an independent state ground for decision?
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,544.197,567.53,"Your Honor, since it... since this question involves the interrelationship of both statutes, it would be petitioner's position that there would... could be no independent state ground since it necessarily involves the construction of both the Federal Youth Corrections Act and the District of Columbia provision."
1982.81-6756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,567.53,580.668,"But supposing this case had come to us from New York or Illinois and the state court had said, we are going to treat the Federal Youth Corrections Act as a proper basis for a state recidivist penalty."
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,586.666,599.597,"To the extent that that interpretation of the Federal Youth Corrections Act, which is plainly a matter for this Court's purview, differed with a matter of this Court's interpretation, I should think it would not be an adequate State ground."
1982.81-6756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,599.597,610.074,Do you think we could prevent a State court from treating a Youth Corrections Act conviction as a basis for its own recidivist statute?
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,625.041,625.775,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-6756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,627.069,630.758,"Well, isn't that pretty close to what has happened here?"
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,630.758,635.395,That is not the primary basis for this Court's decision below--
1982.81-6756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,635.395,635.91,"Well, you say they--"
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,635.91,636.584,--as I understand it.
1982.81-6756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,636.584,641.455,"--didn't articulate it that way, but that's the net effect of the result reached, is it not?"
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,641.455,660.807,"It may be, but as applied to this particular case, but I believe the precedential value that this case would set in terms of its construction of the Youth Act Section 5021(b) and when set aside occurs would have an impact far beyond this particular jurisdiction."
1982.81-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,660.807,663.323,"At any rate, that's your second point, isn't it?"
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,666.79,668.49,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1982.81-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1131.724,1157.948,"But isn't the thought, Ms. Stuntz, that if someone sentenced under the Youth Corrections Act is discharged prior to the term for which they have probation, however long, that's a recognition of kind of a specially good rehabilitation, whereas if the person simply serves out the term, it's thought that's probably about as expected but no big pluses?"
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1157.948,1178.191,"Your Honor, I think that is precisely why the statute was written as it was, to, as the government puts out and as petitioner agrees, reward not just average adjustment but... but good behavior, special response to the Federal Youth Corrections Act program."
1982.81-6756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1256.937,1266.857,"How does the fresh start concept fit an acknowledged recidivist now, going to the policy underlying the statute?"
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1266.857,1270.885,--The question--
1982.81-6756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1270.885,1286.753,"Assuming... assuming he was entitled to some special consideration for his first offense, what justification is there for any special consideration for him for the second offense?"
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1286.753,1295.355,"--Your Honor, I agree that the benefit of hindsight often would change the application of a--"
1982.81-6756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1295.355,1296.296,"Well, do not--"
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1296.296,1297.388,--search warrant or... or--
1982.81-6756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1297.388,1320.3,"--do not Judges in sentencing take... use hindsight to... suppose a Judge were totally free... this is not directly related to your case... but suppose the Judge were entirely free, don't you think a Judge would treat him as a second offender if there were none of the points you raise?"
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1320.3,1324.735,"--I am sorry, Your Honor, I am not sure I understand the--"
1982.81-6756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1324.735,1327.25,"Well, the Judge is going to look at the total record."
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1350.771,1358.706,"--I think that is precisely why, Your Honor, the set-aside provision was inserted and--"
1982.81-6756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1358.706,1361.206,To prevent Judges from taking it into account?
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1361.206,1373.42,"--That... whether or not the set-aside completely expunges the record is an issue which has not yet been finally adjudicated by the Court, this Court or even the Courts below."
1982.81-6756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1396.13,1398.376,Even when it's... even when it's practically the same crime?
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1398.376,1414.326,"Whether... whether it is... whether or not it is the same crime, Your Honor, the question before the Court is did he qualify pursuant to the statutory criteria set out in the Federal Youth Corrections Act."
1982.81-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.748,1486.623,"Ms. Stuntz, you say it is not proper to use it."
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1501.413,1505.867,"Your Honor, I rely primarily upon the rule of lenity."
1982.81-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1530.324,1531.556,Well--
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1531.556,1532.746,--is improper.
1982.81-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1532.746,1541.477,--Do you concede that at least by implication the D.C. Court of Appeals has resolved the issue of legislative intent against you?
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1541.477,1553.456,"The D.C. Court of Appeals has certainly, at least by implication, resolved the issue of the legislative intent of Section 3204."
1982.81-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.456,1556.985,Which is the one you want construed according to the rule of lenity?
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1556.985,1576.338,"What I am asking the Court is not just 3204 but also the Federal Youth Corrections Act, because I think it's important to keep in mind the policies of both acts to determine whether applying them together, as they were in this case, makes sense and serves the policies of either one."
1982.81-6756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1592.923,1594.05,Very well.
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1594.05,1614.616,"--petitioner would ask that for these reasons and the reasons set forth in his briefs, the decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals be reversed and that his felony sentence be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing pursuant to Section 3215 of the D.C. Code as a first offender."
1982.81-6756,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1614.616,1616.43,But he is no longer a youth?
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1620.193,1621.445,"That's correct, Justice."
1982.81-6756,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1621.445,1627.567,"He's 27 years old when he was convicted, he was 27 years old?"
1982.81-6756,0,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,1627.567,1629.002,That's correct.
1982.81-6756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1629.002,1644.451,"Ms. Etkind, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1982.81-6756,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1644.451,1650.714,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-6756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1702.347,1707.643,"If he were discharged one day before the expiration, he would satisfy the statute?"
1982.81-6756,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1707.643,1708.988,"Yes, he would."
1982.81-6756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1708.988,1711.469,What do you think is the purpose of the statute?
1982.81-6756,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1711.469,1725.651,"I think the purpose of the statute, Congress' purpose, was to hold out to youth offenders the possibility of a set-aside as an inducement to fully rehabilitate themselves and to take--"
1982.81-6756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1725.651,1727.667,Even though it's one day before?
1982.81-6756,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1727.667,1733.601,"--Well, I think... I think it may have to be one day before."
1982.81-6756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2067.353,2069.759,Very well.
1982.81-6756,2,35051,linda_gillespie_stuntz,,2072.758,2084.516,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1982.81-6756,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2207.17,2208.075,"Thank you, Counsel."
