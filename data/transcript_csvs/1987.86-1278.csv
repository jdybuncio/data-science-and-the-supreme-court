1987.86-1278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.522,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 86-1278, Hustler Magazine and Larry C. Flynt versus Jerry Falwell."
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,13.641,17.61,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1987.86-1278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,67.894,72.762,Are you suggesting that would be a change in our constitutional jurisprudence to protect that?
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,72.762,74.548,"Yes, sir, I am."
1987.86-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,276.695,287.151,"Well, Mr. Isaacman, is the fact that you claim Mr. Falwell is a public figure in dispute in this case?"
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,287.151,289.187,It isn't in dispute at all.
1987.86-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,289.187,298.026,"Well, then, I guess we could move on to the arguments, because apparently your remarks are for the purpose of demonstrating he's a public figure."
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,298.676,315.67,"Justice O'Connor, it's to really to fill out the political context and the fact that what we have here are people who are at opposite ends of the political spectrum, engaging in the uninhibited robust and wide open debate in New York Times v. Sullivan."
1987.86-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,315.67,320.808,"Does the State have an interest in protecting its citizens from emotional distress, do you suppose?"
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,320.808,325.426,"Clearly, the State has an interest in protecting its citizens from emotional distress."
1987.86-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.426,330.347,And perhaps that's an even greater interest than protecting reputation.
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,330.347,351.911,"I would submit that it is not a greater interest than protecting reputation, because in the area of reputational injury, libel as we know it, for example, when it's in written form, emotional distress is an element of recovery as well as damage to reputation, and reputation affects what other people think of you."
1987.86-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,386.315,401.575,Would this be a different case if the jury had found that the allegations could be considered factual?
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,401.575,403.26,It certainly would be a different case.
1987.86-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,461.882,468.969,"Well, do you think that finding by the jury has opened for this Court to consider again de novo?"
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,468.969,471.254,"No, we don't think it is."
1987.86-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,472.738,479.51,"I thought you were suggesting that in the First Amendment context, we'd have to consider those issues again."
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,479.51,501.69,"--Justice O'Connor, I suggest that in the First Amendment context, when a determination is made by a jury that's adverse to speech, and when a jury finds that the speaker made statements that could be construed as statements of fact and were knowingly false, then it is incumbent upon the Court to take that review for the purpose of protecting the speaker."
1987.86-1278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,505.411,507.927,"You think Bose is a one-way street, then?"
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,507.927,511.898,"Your Honor, I do think it's a one-way street."
1987.86-1278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,532.229,536.596,This is all matter that isn't really directly involved in your case.
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,539.132,541.167,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
1987.86-1278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.96,698.702,"Mr. Isaacman, what the New York Times rule provides is not an absolute protection, but what a knowing element, an element of specific intent to create a falsehood."
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,739.975,750.58,"Justice Scalia, we have a lot of cases including New York Times v. Sullivan, including Garrison v. Louisiana, and say it's not the intent to cause harm."
1987.86-1278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,765.506,767.189,I understand you can draw the line there.
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,796.191,814.087,"I don't think that any reasonable reader of any of the speech that has occurred in the cases including New York Times v. Sullivan, Garrison and all the other cases that have come down, Letter Carriers I gave as an example, could ever say that the speaker did not intend to cause harm."
1987.86-1278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,837.868,839.085,That may well be.
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,851.545,853.278,That's correct.
1987.86-1278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.147,870.073,"But even in the New York Times sense, if what the asserted facts here were known to be untrue, I mean, one who knew nothing about Mr. Falwell or anything about the background could read this and think there might be some individual that this was a factually correct statement about."
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,876.827,883.916,"Justice Stevens, the response to that is really that there were no facts asserted."
1987.86-1278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,883.916,892.772,"Well, I understand what your argument is, but to the extent that there are factual statements, they satisfy the New York Times standard because everybody knows they're false, including the speaker."
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,892.772,906.163,"If you change what this article means, and you say this article's capable of being interpreted as an assertion of fact, then you've kind of set the stage differently from what it is, and from what the jury determined."
1987.86-1278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.785,917.385,"Really, all I'm suggesting is pretty much the same thing Justice Scalia is."
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,921.105,925.491,"--It speaks in a sense that a knowing falsity, a reckless falsity is required."
1987.86-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,941.686,951.041,"Well, that gets us back to Bose and whether we have to reexamine this statement for ourselves to determine whether it's a factual statement."
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,951.041,962.432,"Well, that brings me back to my response, Justice O'Connor, that if there were an adverse determination to the speaker, this Court would have an independent obligation to examine."
1987.86-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,962.432,966.218,I don't think Bose spelled it out that way.
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,975.257,984.53,"Well, the only thing I would say is the only case I saw that dealt with that is Brown v. KNB Corporation, a Connecticut Supreme Court case decided August 18, 1987."
1987.86-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,996.903,1001.557,I suppose that Connecticut case isn't binding on us.
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1001.557,1002.074,--That's correct.
1987.86-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.426,1034.194,"Well, even accepting what the jury found, that there was no reputational injury here because there was no believable fact asserted, for you to win, you have to say that opinion or parody is never actionable, even though it's done intentionally for the purpose of inflicting emotional distress."
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1037.747,1039.43,"Well, Justice White, my proposition is--"
1987.86-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1039.43,1039.68,"Isn't it, or not?"
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1039.68,1040.945,"--No, no."
1987.86-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1043.048,1044.298,"What is it, then?"
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1044.298,1052.035,Because what that leaves out is opinion or parody that does not contain anything that can be reasonably understood as a statement of fact.
1987.86-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1052.035,1052.368,All right.
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1057.92,1070.745,"The second thing that your hypothetical left out, your proposition left out was that this is a public figure who is bringing this action, somebody whose supposed to have a thick skin."
1987.86-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1070.745,1071.328,All right.
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1089.206,1092.657,And even though it contains nothing that can be understood as a false statement of fact.
1987.86-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1092.657,1092.857,"Sure, sure."
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1092.857,1094.457,"Including that, I agree, yes."
1987.86-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.776,1096.343,That's your proposition.
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1096.343,1100.428,You cross the line when you say something that can be understood as a false statement of fact.
1987.86-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.963,1117.771,"Well, I take it certainly it's arguable that we must judge this case on the basis that there was no fact involved."
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1121.889,1126.542,"--The jury said there was nothing that could be perceived, could be understood as a fact."
1987.86-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1126.542,1133.696,"If we judge the case on that basis, then your proposition is there can't be any liability here at all,--"
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1133.696,1134.815,That's correct.
1987.86-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.815,1137.182,--if there's a public figure involved.
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1166.953,1169.553,"Fortunately, that's not my case."
1987.86-1278,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1173.273,1174.54,"Well, you haven't mentioned it, yet."
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1174.54,1189.783,"I would say that if it does not contain a false statement of fact, or something that can be perceived as a false statement of fact, then even it's a private figure, it's protected speech."
1987.86-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1189.783,1197.889,"At common law, I suppose the exception was just for fair comment, wasn't it?"
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1197.889,1202.626,Common law in the?
1987.86-1278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1202.626,1209.53,"In this tort of emotional distress, that there was leeway for some kind of fair comment?"
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1209.53,1222.421,"Well, this tort of emotional distress is really such a new tort that there is, to my knowledge, not a lot of decisions on point."
1987.86-1278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1261.646,1276.823,"Mr. Isaacman, you puzzled me with your answer to Justice White, and assuming there's no public figure involved, and you've admitted there's a public interest in protecting the citizenry from emotional distress, what's the public interest in protecting speech that does nothing else?"
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1276.823,1287.279,There is a public interest in allowing every citizen of this country to express his views.
1987.86-1278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.646,1292.932,"Well, what view was expressed by this?"
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1292.932,1295.384,"By this ad parody, or your example?"
1987.86-1278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.384,1301.121,"Well, either one, other than something that just upsets the target of the comment?"
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1301.121,1308.894,"What view is expressed by the ad parody is really a couple fold view, two views or more."
1987.86-1278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1314.512,1314.679,I understand--
1987.86-1278,0,16270,alan_l_isaacman,,1314.679,1317.298,So it's not a treatise or a novel that's gone into a long development.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1874.069,1888.143,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1987.86-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1985.057,2003.169,"Mr. Grutman, I guess there are those who think that the conduct of certain newspapers in pursuing Mr. Hart recently was of the same unwarranted character."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2007.405,2019.38,"I don't think so in that case because what was being done by the newspapers in that case was reporting the truth, the truth about a public figure who was a candidate for public office."
1987.86-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2027.319,2035.657,So you would limit the recovery for the tort of emotional distress to recovery for a falsehood?
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2035.657,2036.675,No.
1987.86-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2036.675,2037.542,No?
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2037.542,2052.368,"Under the theory of the intentional infliction of emotional distress, even the truth can be used in such a way if it is used in some outrageous way, it must be something which is so repellent--"
1987.86-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2052.368,2059.022,And what if the jury were to determine that what the newspapers did with regard to Mr. Hart fell in that category?
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2060.373,2073.431,"--If the jury were able to find from the evidence, Justice O'Connor, that the publication was outrageous... I would doubt that they would find that because it is not that kind of conduct... reporting the truth."
1987.86-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2073.431,2076.8,But you would say it's open to a jury determination?
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2076.8,2085.072,"Only in a highly theoretical sense, if the animating purpose behind the publisher was simply to inflict intense and severe emotional distress upon Gary Hart."
1987.86-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2095.177,2105.835,"Well, do you think a vicious cartoon should subject the drawer of that cartoon to potential liability?"
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2105.835,2121.095,Only in the event that the cartoon constitutes that kind of depiction which would be regarded by the average member of the community as so intolerable that no civilized person should have to bear it.
1987.86-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.861,2132.485,"Well, Mr. Grutman, you're certainly posing a much broader proposition than is necessary for you to win this case."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2132.485,2134.852,"Indeed, but I was answering the question of Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2134.852,2141.674,"Well, the way you put it from the very outset, you put it the same way."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2153.732,2154.432,No.
1987.86-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.895,2179.613,What do you make out of the special verdict the jury returned?
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2179.613,2190.155,--I make out of it the fact that the jury said that this was not describing actual facts about the plaintiff or actual events in which the plaintiff participated.
1987.86-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.27,2227.678,"I don't know why you insist on this because if there's anything factual about this statement, you certainly have to contend with New York Times."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2250.46,2262.751,"--I agree that parody or so-called satire, whatever it calls itself, is not necessarily protected speech when the purpose of the publisher is to inflict severe emotional distress."
1987.86-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2287.235,2305.196,"But you would subject, thought, the range of political cartoonists, for example, to that kind of jury inquiry, whether it was vicious enough to warrant recovery."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2305.196,2305.362,No.
1987.86-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.821,2362.383,"What about a cartoonist who sits down at his easel, or whatever cartoonists sit down at, and thinks to himself, a candidate acts for the presidency as just a big windbag, a pompous turkey and I'm going to draw this cartoon showing him as such."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2378.708,2379.327,No.
1987.86-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2391.552,2394.52,What about the state of mind required from the defendant?
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2394.52,2398.289,"Well, the state of mind is precisely what we're concerned with."
1987.86-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2398.289,2400.889,What about the state of mind I've hypothesized to you.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2404.543,2405.176,"No, it would not."
1987.86-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2420.135,2422.504,Even though he knows it will inflict emotional distress?
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2422.504,2465.164,"It has to be... correct, because you cannot have emotional distress for mere slights, for the kinds of things which people in an imperfect world have got to put up with, calling somebody some of the epithets that were mentioned in the opposing argument, blackmailer, or some other conclusory and highly pejorative terms, an epithet, but when you say not that you are some foul conclusory term, but when you depict someone in the way in which Jerry Falwell was depicted with all of the hallmarks of reality including the pirated copyright and the pirated trademark so that the casual reader looking at it could think this is for real, that rises to the level of--"
1987.86-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2465.164,2465.981,That's a different argument.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2487.113,2489.379,"--I do not think so, or it's a much harder case."
1987.86-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2489.379,2489.729,So it's free game now.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2492.315,2496.683,"Justice Stevens, Mr. Flint republished it for a third time after the jury verdict."
1987.86-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2496.683,2496.9,I understand.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2502.087,2504.956,Liability requires an intent.
1987.86-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.956,2506.673,But you do agree with what I said?
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2506.673,2507.841,"I do, I do Mr. Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1278,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2514.144,2519.215,"Mr. Grutman, you're given us a lot of words to describe this: outrageous, heinous,--"
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2519.215,2521.332,Repulsive and loathsome.
1987.86-1278,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.332,2522.75,--Repulsive and loathsome.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2556.388,2560.875,"Justice Scalia, we don't shoot the piano player."
1987.86-1278,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2561.809,2574.867,"But can you give us something that the cartoonist or the political figure can adhere to, other than such general words as heinous and what not."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2578.754,2583.056,"No, it's not the amount of hair the beast has or how long his claws may be."
1987.86-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2649.95,2655.421,"Well, Mr. Grutman, in today's world, people don't want to have to take these things to a jury."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2668.479,2702.55,"I frankly think that it isn't too much to expect, Justice O'Connor, that a responsible author, artist, or anyone would understand that attempting to falsely depict as a representational fact that someone is committing incest with his mother in an outhouse and saying that she's a whore, and that when the person involved is an abstemious Baptist Minister, that he always gets drunk before he goes into the pulpit, it isn't too much to say that anybody who would do that ought to take the consequences for casting that into the stream."
1987.86-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2702.55,2708.037,"Well, the say you put it, we don't need any new law for that."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2714.726,2718.994,"Justice White, I don't think this case is governed by the New York Times rule."
1987.86-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.632,2761.088,"Well, if these were factual statements like you mentioned, you could win under New York Times any time."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2761.088,2789.722,"Yes, we could win under New York Times, but I'm suggesting that as a jurist prudential matter, the New York Times formulation of actual malice is inappropriate and irrelevant for this tort for the reason that when you're dealing with the tort of libel, the focus of inquiry, the gravamen is on the issue of true or falsity in which facts become the measure of what is true or false, or something which has been dealt with recklessly."
1987.86-1278,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2808.284,2812.485,"Well, Mr. Grutman, there's plenty of malice here all right."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2822.193,2829.097,"I disagree, Justice O'Connor, and if you'll give me a moment... that is the easy way of looking at it, but that's not what they said."
1987.86-1278,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.664,2856.564,Give me a statement that isn't a statement of fact.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2856.564,2857.047,Pardon?
1987.86-1278,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.047,2863.284,Give me a statement that isn't a statement of fact in your interpretation of what statement of fact means.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2866.986,2867.652,No.
1987.86-1278,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2896.171,2900.373,So there's no statement that is not a statement of fact is what you're saying.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2900.373,2900.69,That's correct.
1987.86-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2908.979,2915.15,"Mr. Grutman, that's not the way the Fourth Circuit interpreted the finding in this case."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2934.194,2950.204,"--Candidly, I must say that I do not think that the Fourth Circuit made the point which I first tried to make to Justice O'Connor, and which I am making to you: in retrospect, I believe we could have appealed this as a proper basis for libel with that finding."
1987.86-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2950.204,2950.87,"You could, but you didn't."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2950.87,2955.489,"But I didn't and that's therefore it wasn't before the Fourth Circuit, and it's not before you now."
1987.86-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2955.489,2965.445,"Not only that, but the purpose in the jury instruction was to ask that question as a predicate to the second question which related to malice which wouldn't have had any purpose to it unless it's interpreted the way--"
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2965.445,2968.88,That is the way it looks in the cold light in the Supreme Court today.
1987.86-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2983.306,2990.643,"--Yes, but your second question all goes to whether the New York Times malice standard, and that just isn't even implicated unless it's a false statement of fact."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,2990.643,3001.851,"--Justice Stevens I agree that maybe I should have done something different, but I thought at the time that the damages we were seeking to recover were equally recoverable under the intentional infliction of emotional stress."
1987.86-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3001.851,3004.969,May I ask a different question that just troubles me a little bit about the case.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,3009.873,3011.239,This is a Virginia Tort.
1987.86-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3011.239,3016.277,And so the contours of this tort presumably we would find in some Virginia decisions?
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,3016.277,3016.66,Yes.
1987.86-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3016.66,3024.883,And the latest decision that's cited in your opponent's reply brief is a lower court decision which seems to say there's no tort of this kind at all.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,3027.033,3032.453,"That case which I saw when I received their brief I believe yesterday, I noticed was a Court of inferior jurisdiction."
1987.86-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3032.453,3032.619,Right.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,3032.619,3035.236,I do not think that it is controlling on this Court.
1987.86-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3037.419,3040.271,"Well, if it correctly describes Virginia law, it is controlling."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,3046.508,3059.867,"I understand that but I believe that there are other cases in Virginia, which have been cited in our brief, which support the validity of the preposition that we are asserting that Virginia recognizes this as a separate and independent tort."
1987.86-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3068.287,3069.487,Which are cited in your brief?
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,3069.487,3070.87,"Yes, they are, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1278,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3124.188,3132.191,"Mr. Grutman, is libel, per se, recognized in Virginia when you charge somebody with a crime?"
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,3132.191,3132.876,--I believe so.
1987.86-1278,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3132.876,3135.911,"Well, nobody pays any attention to that at all."
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,3135.911,3139.53,No one pays it?
1987.86-1278,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3139.53,3141.649,Any attention to that fact.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,3141.649,3142.665,In this case?
1987.86-1278,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3142.665,3143.115,Yes.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,3143.115,3162.979,"In retrospect, I understand what you're saying about that, Justice Marshall, but I was fighting in that case, the suggestion that this was hyperbole or the expression of an opinion, and Judge Turc would not accept the view that the accusation of incest is a crime which constitutes libel per se, and so I was unable to try the case in that posture."
1987.86-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3176.87,3181.024,It's certainly a new tort when applied to the press.
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,3181.024,3193.082,"No, it is not a new tort, because there have been cases that have been decided in a number of States in which the press has been held libel for this tort, not only for the intentional infliction--"
1987.86-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3193.082,3196.05,"Yes, but how recent are cases?"
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,3196.05,3200.938,"--Well, the Florida case that I speak of is a 1984 case."
1987.86-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3200.938,3213.661,"What I said was it's only recently, isn't it, that the courts have been bringing activities of the press within this expanding tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress?"
1987.86-1278,1,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,3213.661,3216.297,"To that extent, I agree with you, Mr. Chief Justice."
