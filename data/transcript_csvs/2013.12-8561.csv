2013.12-8561,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.623,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-8561, Paroline v. United States."
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,9.215,15.495,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-8561,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,84.232,91.933,"Well, before -- before you do that, could you explain why there is an issue of proximate causation here?"
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,96.727,108.504,"Well, I think there has to be -- in all restitution cases, the issue is whether or not the person's conduct caused the harm and losses."
2013.12-8561,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,110.565,111.127,Yes.
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,123.014,134.758,"That's a fact-intensive question and that's what the district court has to determine, whether on the facts presented, there are identifiable losses that were caused by the defendant's conduct and there can be."
2013.12-8561,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,134.758,141.756,It seems you're confusing proximate cause with cause in fact.
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,177.913,178.694,Well--
2013.12-8561,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,178.694,187.55,"Is her treatment -- I think you're arguing that her treatment has to be a ""but for"" this possession."
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,187.55,199.498,"--I think they go hand in hand because when dealing with proximate cause, would the conduct -- is the losses the natural sequence from the conduct and the result."
2013.12-8561,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,229.345,230.735,Why do we -- why do we--
2013.12-8561,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,230.735,243.246,Would you agree -- would you agree that the -- the losses here were the proximate result at least of the aggregate actions of all the offenders?
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,243.464,250.712,"Justice Kennedy, the problem with aggregate causation does not apply--"
2013.12-8561,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,250.712,258.584,Would -- would you agree that it is the proximate result of the aggregate actions of all the offenders?
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,258.584,260.631,"--It would be a harm, but not--"
2013.12-8561,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,260.631,261.052,Pardon me.
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,264.426,293.132,"--But the problem is when you're dealing with aggregate causation, that conflicts with the statutory burden of proof that the government has under 3664(e), which is made applicable to the 2059 under section (b)(2), and you'll find 3664(e) at Appendix 22 to our merits brief."
2013.12-8561,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,294.757,307.58,"--Why -- why should we get to that question when we have what seems to be a clear order from Congress, and it is in 2259(a)."
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,325.276,342.801,"--Only if -- if the losses are the result of the offense, because the government's burden of proof is that they must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the losses sustained by the victim are the result of the offense."
2013.12-8561,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,342.801,343.426,"Well, it doesn't--"
2013.12-8561,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,343.426,356.42,My question is -- my question is why isn't it -- and you were going to point to the statute -- why isn't it at least the result of the aggregate number -- aggregate offenders?
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,356.42,357.967,It's on the indictment.
2013.12-8561,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,360.839,367.151,But he is -- he is one of the offenders in the aggregate.
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,367.151,370.195,--He's not -- it's not in the indictment.
2013.12-8561,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,391.624,410.195,"Mr. Schneider, on your view if only one person viewed the pornography, that person would be responsible for the entire damages, but if a thousand people viewed the pornography and the harm was that much greater, nobody would be in -- would be on the hook for restitution."
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,412.179,428.033,"Justice Kagan, that's not what -- there are numerous cases where someone who looks at -- possesses child pornography has been shown to be liable for losses and restitution and some individual cases that it's not."
2013.12-8561,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,476.997,478.996,"Well, what's the answer, though, to the problem, forgetting this case?"
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,531.256,536.223,It's a -- it's a very difficult question.
2013.12-8561,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,536.223,537.035,"Yeah, it is."
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,537.957,552.577,And -- and the answer is to -- multifaceted because the government's burden of proof for restitution applies to all restitution statutes.
2013.12-8561,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,567.119,567.818,All right.
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,606.195,623.235,"--Well, in some of the cases there's evidence that -- of not -- of the victim having knowledge of an individual and in that case -- those cases, there have been awards of restitution, some of them 3,000, 5,000, 15,000, 30,000."
2013.12-8561,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,640.009,653.02,"But your answer is in a large category of cases, and this may be -- these may be the typical cases, where there's a digital image and it's out there and you don't even know that there are a thousand people who've seen it."
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,687.662,689.162,I don't -- and that's not what I'm saying.
2013.12-8561,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,718.134,721.679,So what exactly -- give me an example of what you're talking about.
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,733.018,734.206,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-8561,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,745.483,755.572,"So give me an example of how the government can -- the hypothetical that Justice Alito spoke about and Justice Kagan, you've got -- or -- or Justice Breyer."
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,755.572,777.423,"--Lundquist is a perfect example where there are two reports by their expert explaining how the knowledge of -- of an individual of Lundquist affected her treatment, affected her day-to-day life, and their specific report talks about knowledge of the -- this individual."
2013.12-8561,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.423,778.937,The particular individual?
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,794.946,796.352,By--
2013.12-8561,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,796.352,808.582,The woman has undergone serious psychiatric harm because of her knowledge that there are thousands of people out there viewing her rape.
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,852.798,862.483,"--Justice Scalia, the answer to your question is -- is multifaceted and--"
2013.12-8561,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.483,864.965,You said that for another question.
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,864.965,865.777,--I understand.
2013.12-8561,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.777,866.98,Give me one facet.
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,868.277,880.646,And Congress dictated that all victims who are identified receive notice and that notice goes to her lawyer.
2013.12-8561,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,895.859,897.108,--Let me ask you.
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,914.446,918.334,"I think in Wright it was $500,000 was the court's order, I believe."
2013.12-8561,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,918.334,927.971,"Now, was there something in the evidence there that made it proper to award restitution in the Wright case, but not in this case?"
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,927.971,928.439,No.
2013.12-8561,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,928.439,929.766,They're the same?
2013.12-8561,0,42112,stanley_g_schneider,,929.766,930.531,Yes.
2013.12-8561,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,932.812,933.608,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,940.606,943.684,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.434,982.745,Yes.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1026.463,1028.618,"I agree with that, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.618,1031.476,"Because I'm not going to go along with you on, you know, modern tort."
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1033.412,1034.615,Okay.
2013.12-8561,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1055.358,1059.48,But how do you square your position with the statutory language?
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1112.084,1125.03,"--Justice Sotomayor, I think that the key to reading the statutory language is that the definition of ""victim"" refers to a victim of the offense in this case."
2013.12-8561,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1148.195,1149.646,So why isn't that a but-for cause?
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1153.661,1154.614,--I don't think so.
2013.12-8561,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1154.614,1156.551,--that their damages have to be the but-for cause.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1156.551,1170.138,"I hope that the Court will read the ""as a result of"" language to require causation, but to interpret it in light of the way causation has been understood in the unique circumstances that you have here."
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1170.138,1172.356,You don't deny but-for.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1177.745,1179.963,"There's collective, aggregate but-for cause."
2013.12-8561,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1216.931,1225.803,But doesn't -- doesn't the individual at least cause some harm without regard to the harm caused by the others?
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1225.803,1227.319,--Yes.
2013.12-8561,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1227.319,1228.13,"Of course, yes."
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1286.122,1290.245,"Mr. Chief Justice, that would allow assessment of some of the damages."
2013.12-8561,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1308.097,1308.894,I'm sorry.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1315.736,1334.571,"If there's a specific amount of harm caused and if Amy could find an expert who would testify to that respect and it would require, say, six counseling sessions and it would set her back in employment for a year, then I guess a court could, if it found that credible, conclude that a certain amount of loss is attributable directly."
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1334.571,1341.569,"Well, you're -- you're confusing whether there's a specific amount of harm caused with whether it is easy to measure that harm."
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1414.741,1421.395,"Justice Scalia, I think that is consistent with the conclusion that the government reaches, although we take a different route to it--"
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.395,1422.161,I understand.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1422.161,1423.301,--than Your Honor's position.
2013.12-8561,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1423.301,1425.518,"Well, is it consistent with human psychology?"
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1458.069,1463.443,"Justice Alito, that is why the government has proposed a different approach to getting to the same conclusion."
2013.12-8561,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1463.443,1472.143,"Mr. Dreeben, I would really like you to tell us concretely what the government's approach would be."
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1504.833,1508.893,"Justice Ginsburg, the courts have approved several different formulas as not being an abuse of discretion."
2013.12-8561,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1536.804,1538.427,"How do you get to the 18,000?"
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1538.427,1552.735,"By considering the number of defendants who have been ordered to pay restitution to Amy, because that provides some certainty in the face of, as Justice Alito pointed out, the great difficulty in determining how many people have actually viewed these pictures--"
2013.12-8561,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.735,1554.547,How does that -- I'm sorry.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1554.547,1563.964,"--the number of people who have been ordered to pay to restitution represents a judicial finding that, in fact, her picture is involved in that person's offense."
2013.12-8561,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1563.964,1564.683,And so it wouldn't--
2013.12-8561,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1564.683,1566.401,How does that work for -- go ahead.
2013.12-8561,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1566.401,1574.538,--It wouldn't include the people who are not prosecuted and it wouldn't include the people who in the future are prosecuted.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1574.538,1575.132,That is correct.
2013.12-8561,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1584.269,1585.519,Can I ask you one -- just one moment.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1587.299,1590.595,"--It doesn't work very well for the first person, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-8561,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1590.595,1591.437,All right.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1592.234,1595.42,"And for that reason, I think there are other approaches that do work."
2013.12-8561,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1595.42,1598.56,"Can we with ease say, look, it's very complicated."
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1642.01,1648.054,The Court can certainly say that the statute requires reasonable apportionment--
2013.12-8561,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1648.054,1648.617,Yes.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1648.617,1652.585,--and the districts courts have jurisdiction to experiment with different formulations.
2013.12-8561,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1652.585,1657.927,"But can we say -- can we suggest that the sentencing commission -- you can't order them to do it, of course not."
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1672.889,1675.7,They could recommend a -- an approach.
2013.12-8561,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1690.419,1692.066,"Well, could you say more about that?"
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1699.553,1715.099,The alternative that I would propose in that instance is to look at other similarly situated child pornography victims and take a look at what district courts have been awarding to those victims in similar types of cases and provide some sort of an average range.
2013.12-8561,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1715.099,1728.382,"But, you know -- I mean, it struck me when I read your brief that it said, I don't know why these courts started where they started, whether each violation is worth 1,000 or 5,000 or 50,000."
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1743.66,1749.55,"I hope that it's not quite as arbitrary as plucking it out of the air, but the reality is--"
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1749.55,1751.577,"No, but they're certainly not using your theory."
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1755.34,1757.268,--On the first one it's impossible to--
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.268,1757.32,Yes.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1757.885,1759.151,--They are using some theory.
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1759.151,1763.837,"And you have no idea what that is and can't suggest one, right?"
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1763.837,1785.812,"I think that sometimes they articulate various considerations and other times they rely on basically a consensus, a judicial consensus that in a world in which perfect information and mathematical computations are not going to happen, a reasonable approximation that accords with the judgments of 200 other Federal judges is a sensible way to do this."
2013.12-8561,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1785.812,1787.748,"But that makes no -- I mean, how do you tell the difference--"
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.748,1788.701,I'm not sure what sensible--
2013.12-8561,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1788.701,1797.292,"--How do you tell -- your model, how does it work if it turns out that the damages are a million dollars as opposed to $3.4 million?"
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1801.587,1815.534,"We would, as I indicated, start with a -- a division problem and approximate the -- the number of damages that are allocable to that individual and then adjust it because these defendants are not all identical."
2013.12-8561,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1815.534,1816.377,So you start with the--
2013.12-8561,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1816.377,1827.421,So you would expect -- you would expect the defendant in a case where the restitution sought is a million dollars to pay 50 percent of what he would pay if the damages were $2 million.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1827.421,1831.747,"Not necessarily, because as I indicated, Mr. Chief Justice, the defendants aren't all identical."
2013.12-8561,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1843.055,1853.034,"--What about taking into account that the perpetrator, the uncle, that the restitution was something like $6,000; right?"
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1853.034,1855.471,"Yes, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-8561,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1855.471,1871.043,"So if there's any kind of proportionality, it seems that the possessor of two images should not be responsible for more than the person who perpetrated this horrendous crime."
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1871.043,1880.134,"Well, his -- his restitution may have been predicated on a very early period where it was not clear that Amy would be as victimized as she has turned out to be."
2013.12-8561,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1900.642,1907.824,"I would like you to, to the extent that you can, to help district judges get a handle on this."
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1916.338,1925.223,"Justice Ginsburg, the formula that I proposed is the one that the government has been suggesting to district courts around the country."
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.338,1955.149,"--And that's wonderful and, you know, I -- I want to go along with you."
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1977.359,1980.139,--That's the amount of money that Amy has asked for.
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.139,1987.995,"I have no idea what he's going to be socked with, and that's not what we usually do with criminal statutes."
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1987.995,1988.901,"Well, in criminal--"
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.901,1997.71,"You just can't say leave it up to the district judge, you know, and they all come out different ways, but who cares, it's -- you know, so long as it's within some--"
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1997.71,1998.851,"--Well, Justice Scalia--"
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1998.851,1999.881,--some reasonable amount.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1999.881,2000.819,--Post Booker--
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2000.819,2002.584,That's just not the way we do law.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2002.584,2005.176,"--post Booker, that is what happens in criminal sentencing."
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2025.839,2027.199,That's because the statute says so.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2043.88,2050.173,--But there are two background principles that I think reinforce that a reasonable estimation is better than all or none.
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2090.734,2091.937,We have a fudge factor here?
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2098.482,2101.465,It is a criminal provision.
2013.12-8561,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.465,2103.339,We're going to be liable for a fudge factor.
2013.12-8561,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2104.401,2118.537,--that is -- that is placed into criminal sentencing with a goal of both compensating victims and determining that each defendant comes face to face with the fact that that person has inflicted some harm on a particular victim.
2013.12-8561,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2144.806,2145.681,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2150.961,2153.928,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-8561,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2185.525,2186.728,Why?
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2197.207,2199.894,"--We disagree with your premise there, with all respect."
2013.12-8561,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2199.894,2201.972,"Well, if you think he caused the full amount, fine."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2212.404,2220.76,"The solution to the point that you're raising, Justice Breyer, is to recognize that Petitioner was a contributing cause to all of Amy's losses."
2013.12-8561,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2254.841,2264.275,So Congress assumed that this defendant could be liable in part for other people's crimes?
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2264.275,2265.554,"No, Justice Kennedy."
2013.12-8561,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2272.802,2274.691,A single law or loss?
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2274.691,2275.157,--I'm sorry.
2013.12-8561,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2279.586,2280.539,He had two pictures.
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2284.001,2284.954,--That's right.
2013.12-8561,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2284.954,2288.074,He was convicted of possessing two pictures.
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2319.861,2321.172,"Congress did intend that, Your Honor."
2013.12-8561,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2362.859,2367.623,"Well, but responsible for those as a proximate result of the offense."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2367.623,2367.997,--That--
2013.12-8561,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2367.997,2373.228,The only offense shown here in this case is the possession of the two pictures.
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2379.882,2384.788,"--The language you have quoted, Mr. Chief Justice, is from Subsection (F)."
2013.12-8561,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2388.427,2392.488,"Well, you understand the statutory principle that it says"
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2403.562,2409.903,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, and we would ask you to affirm the Fifth Circuit's en banc decision, which disagreed with that reading."
2013.12-8561,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2412.417,2424.365,"Why would it make sense to say that he's liable for lost income, whether or not it's a proximate result, but when it comes to other losses suffered by the victim, they have to be the proximate result?"
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2424.365,2427.473,"--There are a number of answers to that question, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-8561,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2448.09,2454.65,"But aren't those all if we don't buy your argument, if we read into (F) proximate causation?"
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2454.65,2457.07,"No, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-8561,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2457.07,2460.834,So why are you wasting time on the argument if you win either way?
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2462.817,2469.018,"I think we win either way, and obviously I have to anticipate that there may be a variety of views on this very difficult question."
2013.12-8561,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2496.056,2503.146,"Can I get back to -- your point was that all of the (A) through (E) is limited, and you don't need -- well, it's not."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2535.696,2539.068,"--Well, there -- you're talking about the problem of but-for causation."
2013.12-8561,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2541.677,2542.129,"No, no."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2544.098,2544.784,Right.
2013.12-8561,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.073,2582.035,"Like Justice Sotomayor and like the government here, I think, even if there is a proximate cause requirement, it has been -- it has been met, once you adopt the aggregate offense notion."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2628.204,2629.047,No.
2013.12-8561,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2643.979,2646.791,And is that another way of saying as a result of this defendant's offense?
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2646.791,2650.024,--As a result of this defendant's offense.
2013.12-8561,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2654.788,2657.601,"But you are not claiming, are you -- or are you?"
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2664.771,2671.578,"We are saying that she -- that the Petitioner in this case, the defendant, contributed to all of the losses that she suffered."
2013.12-8561,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2671.578,2672.746,"Well, contributed to."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2672.746,2673.052,Yes.
2013.12-8561,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2673.052,2681.402,But I take it that the point of the government's submission is only contributed to and now we have to sort of approximate what the contribution was.
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2695.927,2698.706,We think that the defendant contributed to all her losses.
2013.12-8561,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2714.825,2718.2,"I guess I'm just not sure what that means, contributed to $100."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2724.088,2724.931,--Yes.
2013.12-8561,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2724.931,2733.022,"--as a matter of fact, or does it mean that the defendant is responsible as a matter of fact for some lesser part of the entire harm?"
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2733.022,2733.818,"No, the first."
2013.12-8561,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2737.191,2741.455,I -- I guess I'm -- when I say responsible I don't mean as a legal conclusion.
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2746.828,2753.2,"He contributed to the entire $100, just as multiple polluters contribute to asbestosis--"
2013.12-8561,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2753.2,2753.778,"Well, that's--"
2013.12-8561,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2753.778,2755.043,So he should contribute to the payment.
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2762.103,2765.024,"--Well, Justice Scalia, we're pure textualists on this."
2013.12-8561,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2774.598,2775.394,"--Well, full amount--"
2013.12-8561,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.394,2776.379,They don't say from that person.
2013.12-8561,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2776.379,2783.157,"--from the particular offense, Mr. Cassell, so that it's the full amount of whatever the particular offense caused."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2788.655,2791.622,--We're saying he contributed to the entire 3.4--
2013.12-8561,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2791.622,2792.466,"Well, let me give you this--"
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2792.466,2793.387,--along with the other people.
2013.12-8561,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2793.387,2794.356,"--I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2794.356,2798.337,"No, I -- you can't disaggregate them, and that's the fundamental problem here."
2013.12-8561,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.818,2817.738,So -- so contributed also a person who didn't have a picture of her but watched other victims.
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2817.738,2818.472,"--Well, no--"
2013.12-8561,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2818.472,2822.814,"That person contributed to her too, because it creates a market for the entire situation."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2853.144,2853.254,"--No, I'm--"
2013.12-8561,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2853.254,2863.984,"--But answer to what seems to be bothering me and a lot of others is, okay, let's accept the notion of cause, but what is a -- this is called restitution--"
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2863.984,2864.111,--Yes.
2013.12-8561,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2864.111,2865.064,--it isn't called fines.
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2885.584,2888.943,The best way to do it is to give Amy the full amount of her losses in this case.
2013.12-8561,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2888.943,2889.864,That's what I suspected you would say.
2013.12-8561,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2890.379,2892.754,"Well, let me give you -- Mr. Cassell, let me give you this example."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2949.683,2952.697,"That's our answer, and that's exactly what Congress wanted."
2013.12-8561,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2971.674,2977.141,What about at least the amount of the judgments she has already received?
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2980.172,2981.28,Yes.
2013.12-8561,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2981.28,2983.358,And she has so far collected how much?
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2983.358,2988.292,"As of yesterday, 1,752,000."
2013.12-8561,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2988.292,2990.449,Would you at least deduct that from the--
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2990.449,2990.651,Certainly.
2013.12-8561,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2997.929,3009.551,"Usually when we approve joint and several liability we do so against a background of a functioning system of contribution where one defendant pays the entire thing, but then can go after--"
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3009.551,3009.662,Right.
2013.12-8561,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3009.662,3013.689,--other defendants and be pretty well assured that he gets their share.
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3024.372,3027.573,We disagree with the premise here.
2013.12-8561,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3093.297,3102.17,"In my example, suppose that the first person, who has a restitution order for the full amount, seems unlikely ever to be able to pay that."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3110.446,3113.523,"Precisely, until -- until the victim recovers the full amount."
2013.12-8561,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3113.523,3125.487,"Well, what about doing -- what you'd say is make the department, you can find out figures, you could find out from figures what's the likelihood that X number of people will be caught."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3138.514,3145.652,"But the problem is in this particular case the numbers show that at least 70,000 people have viewed Amy's image."
2013.12-8561,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3145.652,3148.259,--And how many -- how many are going to get caught and convicted?
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3148.259,3149.681,We have no way of knowing.
2013.12-8561,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3149.681,3150.492,"Well, you can find out."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3158.411,3159.254,A tiny percentage.
2013.12-8561,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3159.254,3159.957,"All right, fine."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3166.252,3176.28,"What you're assuming, though, is there's going to be a steady stream of cases, that criminals aren't going to discover new encryption techniques to keep their nefarious activities secrets."
2013.12-8561,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3274.55,3276.175,This is subsequent legislative history?
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3276.941,3280.971,--Some of the members of the Court reviewed--
2013.12-8561,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3280.971,3285.016,Even those that like legislative history don't like subsequent legislative history.
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3285.969,3289.795,"--Well, then if you want to go the with the textual approach, this is a simple case, Your Honor."
2013.12-8561,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3289.795,3290.905,"No, it's not a simple case."
2013.12-8561,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3307.804,3312.848,"Well, what happened was the Petitioner in this case contributed to the entire amount."
2013.12-8561,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3351.832,3361.407,--But the point has already been made that it isn't a typical joint tortfeasor situation where you can seek contribution from people who equally contributed.
2013.12-8561,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3361.407,3363.642,Please answer.
2013.12-8561,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3363.642,3374.105,How would -- how would the defendant here go about seeking contribution?
