1987.86-1431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,82.717,"Ms. Van Amburg, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,82.717,86.169,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,310.218,316.278,"Well, if this weren't a Title VII case, don't you think that the Government would agree with you, with everything you've said so far?"
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,316.278,326.102,"I don't know if they'd admit it, that interest is recoverable against a sue and be-sued agency, but I would think they'd have to."
1987.86-1431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,326.102,333.038,"What about the Postal Service, would they agree with you in the Postal Service if this were an ordinary lawsuit, rather than a Title VII case?"
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,333.038,342.207,I would hope they would because there's so many consistent court decisions to the effect that interest is recoverable against a sue and be-sued agency.
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,365.73,369.992,I think their argument follows from Title VII in Shaw.
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,369.992,371.445,That's right.
1987.86-1431,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,403.058,410.9,"Well, Ms. Van Amburg, I suppose at bottom, we're dealing with waiver of sovereign immunity and the extent to which it's been waived."
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,437.466,437.997,That's correct.
1987.86-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,648.676,665.311,"As the Government points out, you sued the Postmaster General by name, rather than the Post Office, and had 717 not spoken to what happens in the courtroom, that was incorrect."
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,665.311,670.762,"Well, that is a procedural distinction, and--"
1987.86-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.762,674.902,"Well, you acknowledge 717 has some bearing in the courtroom, then?"
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,674.902,675.963,--It does.
1987.86-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.963,677.182,Or maybe you made a mistake.
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,677.182,679.68,More by what it doesn't say than what it does say.
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,728.926,730.863,May I ask you a different question.
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,735.61,737.516,"Yes, that's correct."
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,737.516,740.765,And the Title VII amendment was 1972.
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,740.765,741.562,1972.
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,741.562,750.185,"Now, in 1971 say this lawsuit had been brought, could your client have recovered from the Postal Service, and I guess the answer is, no."
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,750.185,756.494,"In 1971, if we had brought an action under Title VII?"
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,756.494,758.244,Yes.
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,758.244,763.618,"I would have to say the answer is, no, because we didn't have a right to proceed under Title VII at that time."
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,763.618,767.521,"And is the reason that you had no right, did that have anything to do with sovereign immunity?"
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,767.521,769.426,No.
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,769.426,776.752,Your position is the only relevant sovereign immunity was waived in 1970?
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,776.752,777.705,That's correct.
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,777.705,782.25,And what happened in '72 was you got a cause of action you didn't previously have.
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,782.25,782.844,That's right.
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,799.648,804.272,Why couldn't they have been sued as a private enterprise under Title VII in 1971?
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,804.272,820.969,"Well, because of what we know of the legislative history of the Postal Reorganization Act, Congress expressly listed those Federal labor laws applicable to the Postal Service in its charter and left out Title VII."
1987.86-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,896.784,903.594,"Why do you say that in 1972, Congress created a cause of action, rather than eliminate the cause of action?"
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,903.594,905.67,I didn't mean to say that if I did.
1987.86-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,905.67,906.186,"Well, I thought you did."
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,906.186,908.108,The right of proceeding into the courtroom.
1987.86-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,908.108,909.53,"Well, Justice Stevens made you do it."
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,914.263,915.949,I don't think so.
1987.86-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.665,924.29,Against the Post Office?
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,924.29,928.929,"It's certainly debatable, however, under Title VII whether an employee could have gotten back pay."
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,935.021,942.767,Was there a cause of action for damages by an employee who was discriminated against by the Postal Service in 1971?
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,942.767,949.983,"Possibly under 1981, possibly under 42 U.S.C. 1981 there might have been."
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.983,950.857,Against the Federal Government?
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,950.857,952.778,Against the Postal Service.
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,952.778,958.277,"Well, I mean the Postal Service as stated, I mean, how would you sue the Postal Service under 1981?"
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,958.277,970.131,"Well, in the same way you would sue a private enterprise if you assume that the Postal Service occupies the status of a private commercial enterprise, which has not really been decided by this Court."
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.348,978.691,What's your position on whether they were suable in 1971?
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,980.816,994.216,"Well, there were some cases that went into the Court of Claims under the Executive Order for back pay, and I would say that they were suable back then, at least in the Court of Claims."
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1011.382,1020.486,"In other words, you say the Executive Order created a duty not to discriminate and a violation of that duty, since the sovereign immunity had been waived, gave rise to a cause of action in 1971."
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,1020.486,1021.095,--That's right.
1987.86-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1021.095,1028.578,All that Title VII did was change the procedure a little bit and make it a statutory duty instead of an administrative duty?
1987.86-1431,0,34068,lisa_s_van_amburg,,1028.578,1031.029,"That's correct, that's our position."
1987.86-1431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1053.317,1054.831,"Thank you, Ms. Van Amburg."
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1057.378,1062.282,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1431,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1092.754,1100.953,"Well, if this weren't a Title VII suit, say it was a contract action against the Postal Service."
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1100.953,1110.497,"We don't disagree with the petitioners as a general matter a sue and be sued clause in that sort of proceeding, a contract-type proceeding is a waiver of sovereign immunity which may entitle it to--"
1987.86-1431,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.497,1118.415,So your submission is that the Title VII 717 really took away that waiver to some extent?
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1118.415,1120.883,"--Well, I wouldn't say that it took away the waiver."
1987.86-1431,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1136.018,1148.029,So you should look at this 717 just as a waive with respect to Title VII suits?
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1148.029,1148.685,We think that's right.
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1170.676,1190.7,"I really am puzzled because if the sue and be sued clause enacted in 1970 was a general waiver of sovereign immunity for any claims for which there was a cause of action and a remedy, why wasn't, to the extent that sovereign immunity would otherwise bar the recovery of interest, why hadn't that been waived?"
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1198.071,1199.555,"No, not at all."
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1199.555,1203.585,You're saying that all they did in '72 was create a cause of action which hadn't been created.
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1203.585,1206.521,"Well, I don't think that's a proper characterization."
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1206.521,1208.459,"At least that's one... isn't that an argument, at least?"
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1208.459,1210.224,That is the argument that petitioner makes.
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1210.224,1212.988,"Well, she waivers a little on it, but I guess that's her argument."
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1212.988,1216.877,"Well, I think that was the final landing place for the petitioner."
1987.86-1431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1263.908,1270.546,"Well, you could regard that as reserving sovereign immunity, or you could regard that as not creating a cause of action."
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1272.514,1273.53,"--Well, I think it was both, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-1431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1300.551,1304.689,"--Yes, but there, there had been no preceding waiver of sovereign immunity for the Library of Congress."
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1312.687,1315.935,"Well, I think there are two answers to that, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1345.474,1354.425,"But can't you describe that in either of two ways: one, as you do now, they were preserving a portion of sovereign immunity; or simply say, they just didn't create the cause of action?"
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1354.425,1356.017,"Well, I think they were doing both."
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1356.017,1361.812,Supposing you had a statute passed today that created a cause of action against the Postal Service for late delivery of mail?
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1370.542,1374.307,I think you might if you're suing under the sue or be sued clause.
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1375.759,1379.571,"Brand new cause of action, you just waived sovereign immunity as to late delivery of mail."
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1379.571,1385.427,"--That's quite right, Justice Stevens, but the crucial point is not when the cause of action was created."
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1529.154,1532.06,"Mr. Rothfeld, who pays the judgment if your client loses?"
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1532.06,1535.261,"Well, the short answer is that the judgment comes out of the U.S. Treasury."
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1535.261,1537.886,"It does come out of the Treasury, not out of the Postal Service?"
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1537.886,1550.114,"Well, the judgment comes in particular out of something called the ""Postal Service Fund"" which is a fund created in the Postal Reorganization Act in which Postal revenues are placed and Postal expenditures are made."
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1555.567,1565.33,"If it were a non-discrimination suit that arose in 1971 for something that you could sue the Post Office for then, maybe rent, would it come out of the same source?"
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1565.33,1566.548,"Yes, it would--"
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1566.548,1567.158,It would.
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1573.389,1574.826,"--No, that's correct."
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.826,1576.464,And neither does the United States generally?
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1576.464,1580.15,"Well, again, it comes out of the United States Treasury."
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1580.15,1582.18,"Yes, in the same sense that a rent payment might, or a suit for rent might?"
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1582.18,1585.102,"Well, that's true."
1987.86-1431,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1893.751,1900.498,"The employees, did they get the two percent raise?"
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1900.498,1905.885,"Well, for purposes of equal employment opportunity they are treated identically to Federal employees."
1987.86-1431,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1908.432,1910.087,They are or they are not?
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1910.087,1911.929,"--Well, they clearly are Federal employees."
1987.86-1431,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1912.414,1914.304,"But do they get the two, the raise?"
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1914.304,1930.345,"--Well, the Labor Relations section of the Postal Service is modeled to a certain extent on the private sector, and therefore their pay is not awarded under the same standards as that used for other Federal employees."
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.213,1959.191,"May I ask, following up on Justice Marshall's thought, do you suppose it would be permissible as a matter of Federal law for their collective bargaining agent to negotiate an agreement which authorized the award of prejudgment interest in all litigation against their employer?"
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1959.191,1963.409,As far as I'm aware--
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1963.409,1966.251,Or would they say they couldn't do it because sovereign immunity would preclude it?
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1966.251,1977.731,"--Well, to the extent that that was being done to redress employment discrimination claims which are cognizable now under Title VII, I think that would be appropriate because--"
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1977.731,1983.62,"Well, the question wasn't whether it was inappropriate, the question was would there be as a matter of Federal law, would it be prohibited."
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1984.792,1995.757,"--I think it would be prohibited if it was something which is cognizable under Title VII, because the Postal Service clearly cannot by its own action waive sovereign immunity when Congress has declined to do so, and Congress has declined to do so."
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2014.921,2019.811,"For most other terms and conditions of employment, they're treated differently from Federal employees?"
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2019.811,2020.358,"Well,--"
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2020.358,2024.356,They do have collective bargaining rights that are different.
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2024.356,2035.709,"--Well, there are a long list of ways in the Postal Reorganization Act and in Title V which we set out in our brief, in which they are treated identically to other Federal employees."
1987.86-1431,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2103.105,2109.26,What do you suppose the Court had in mind in its footnote 5?
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2114.132,2117.599,"Well, I think that the Court had two things in mind, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2292.466,2293.716,I have a question.
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2307.743,2308.476,That's correct.
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2308.476,2315.036,"What requires them, if anything, to obey non-discrimination laws, most of those?"
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2322.628,2331.42,"Well, I think that this case would apply essentially to any component of the Federal Government which is sued pursuant to Section 717(c)."
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.164,2351.382,But does this statutory provision apply to all these other sue and be sued agencies in much the same way?
1987.86-1431,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2351.382,2353.74,"Well, I'm actually not sure of the answer to that question."
1987.86-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2353.74,2355.505,I don't think... it doesn't seem to on the face of the statute.
