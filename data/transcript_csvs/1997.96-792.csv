1997.96-792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.919,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-792, Kalina v. Fletcher."
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,60.429,64.739,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.96-792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,126.388,133.087,"Mr. Maleng, is the crucial thing here the Information or the application for the arrest warrant?"
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,137.664,159.701,"It was a burglary charge, Mr. Chief Justice, and as a part of the charging package is, the deputy prosecutor prepared an Information which was the initial pleading in a prosecution, also requested the issuance of an arrest warrant, and provided the certification to the court to meet the Gernstein requirement."
1997.96-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,163.481,170.432,"Well, in Washington could a police officer have obtained the arrest warrant?"
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,170.432,175.414,"--Justice O'Connor, the police officer could not have obtained the arrest warrant."
1997.96-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.414,180.351,So Washington is different from most other States in that regard?
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,180.351,192.735,"It is different than many States and, of course, there's a diversity of procedures throughout the United States, but in the State of Washington is that an arrest warrant cannot be issued unless it's in connection with the filing of a--"
1997.96-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.735,213.821,"In a State where a police officer could obtain the arrest warrant, even though the prosecutor filed the Information against a defendant, would the police officer have absolute immunity under our case law for a false statement in getting the arrest warrant?"
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,213.821,218.912,"--No, Justice O'Connor, the police officer would not have absolute immunity."
1997.96-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.912,219.146,No.
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,220.74,223.16,"We would look to the function, but--"
1997.96-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,223.16,227.08,And what would be the function if the police officer were getting it?
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,227.08,238.686,--If a police officer was obtaining the arrest warrant it would be the part of the completion of his investigation in preparation for handing the case over to the prosecutor.
1997.96-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.342,246.917,"Now, do you say that the function is different in Washington, where the prosecutor gets the arrest warrant?"
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,246.917,249.118,--The principles that we are advocating--
1997.96-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.118,250.649,Or is it the same function?
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,264.783,269.641,--The analysis is really the same in this sense.
1997.96-792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,322.885,331.319,"If you simply have an Information filed and don't seek an arrest warrant, is this certification necessary--"
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,331.319,332.178,No--
1997.96-792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,332.178,332.928,--under Washington law?
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,332.928,350.108,"--Under our State procedures, at least in King County's as a local rule, is that we are required to provide a summary, a brief summary of the facts for the court, and so our certification really meets two purposes."
1997.96-792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,360.027,370.835,But is it possible that in some cases in King County there would be an Information filed but not an effort to immediately arrest the person?
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,370.835,382.346,"In the State of Washington as a matter of routine, any time that we file an Information in a felony case is that we request the issuance of an arrest warrant."
1997.96-792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,400.198,407.492,"So here, letters were sent before the arrest warrant was issued requesting the defendant to surrender?"
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,407.492,425.936,"After the arrest warrant was ordered by the Court but before it was actually served there was several letters that were sent to the defendant, but they went to the wrong address, and did not reach the defendant, and when that occurred the arrest warrant was served."
1997.96-792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.936,433.293,Is... does the prosecutor's description or summary that you just explained have to be under oath?
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,433.293,470.934,"The certification, yes, does need to be under the oath to meet the Gernstein requirement, is that we really adopted this procedure in the State of Washington following the Gernstein decision, and it not only meets the requirements of Gernstein, but we believe that it is a better practice to follow to have the prosecutor prepare this document, and the reason is, is that I think it really acts as a citizen's buffer, is that a prosecutor, by preparing the certification, I think provides for a more thorough evaluation of the police file."
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,487.381,494.457,"Mr. Maleng, is it the case here that the certification could have been executed by a police officer?"
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,494.457,495.879,There's no... yes.
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,513.465,513.933,Right.
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,525.288,533.581,"Under those circumstances the... if it was prepared by a police officer, he would not have absolute immunity unless he was--"
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,533.581,548.17,"How is that possible under what I understand to be the functional approach, and the functional approach that your argument assumed, and that was that it was the function, not the officer, with respect to which the immunity decision is made?"
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,548.17,561.633,"--First is that, unlike a prosecutor, is the police officer wouldn't meet the threshold question of immunity analysis, and that is that there's no common law tradition of absolute immunity for a police officer."
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,561.633,579.563,"Well, but he's performing the same function and, I mean, the theory of the way the common law practice is applied to immunity doctrine is, we look to the function and see whether that function at common law was subject to an immunity."
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,591.246,595.12,"Justice Souter, they're performing different functions."
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,595.495,599.148,"Well, I don't... I guess, explain that to me."
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,606.818,617.126,"--This Court has set forth the functional test and said that we look to the nature and function of the act being performed, and not just to the act itself."
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,617.126,633.495,"And the nature and function of the act here is the provision of information under oath, with whatever probability of soundness that oath carries, on the basis of which a magistrate is going to issue an arrest warrant."
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,640.334,653.096,"It is a different function if it's performed by a police officer, as a police officer can't move from the ""investigative function"" over to the prosecutorial advocatory function, namely--"
1997.96-792,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,653.096,679.397,"Are you saying that a police officer never has absolute immunity because he's always engaged in investigating and never crosses the divide into prosecuting, so that the same... the very same act which we all agree is involved here, the same act is characterized one way if it's done by a police officer, a different way if it's done by the prosecutor, because the prosecutor does prosecute, and police officers don't prosecute?"
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,679.397,686.066,"--A police officer, Justice Ginsburg, would have absolute immunity if they were functioning as a witness."
1997.96-792,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,705.105,720.177,"But how does the same act, swearing out this warrant application, become prosecutorial if done by one person but merely investigatory if done by another?"
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,720.177,737.109,"This Court has indicated also, I believe, is that you can have a situation in which prosecutors do a whole series of preliminary acts in conjunction with the filing of criminal charges."
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,787.526,793.585,"Mr. Maleng, I think you're doing... making the following assumption in your argument, and I'd like you to comment on it."
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,916.942,924.565,"Justice Souter, I think you've really raised the issue before the Court, and that is whether you take the broad view or the narrow view."
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,942.589,946.587,"But Malley took the narrow view on the way you and I are using the terms, didn't it?"
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,946.587,953.772,Malley took the view that a police officer cannot be held to be analogous to a prosecutor.
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,953.772,967.577,"Right, but the Malley case said, when you're getting a search warrant, which is essentially a prosecutorial kind of function, the witness, the police witness does not get an absolute immunity, and it seems to me there's an analogy here."
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,996.832,1042.329,"What the Court indicated, Justice Souter, in the Malley case is that the police officer in that situation was one step removed, really, from the initiation of a prosecution, and was really not intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process, and that's true throughout the whole activities, because, as I indicated, what the Court was seeking to do in the Imbler case is to protect the sensitive decision to prosecute, to initiate a prosecution, and the Court in the Buckley cases reaffirmed the fact that a prosecutor may undertake a whole series of preliminary acts in conjunction with the initiation of that prosecution."
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1042.329,1045.563,But prosecutors are not characteristically witnesses.
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,1045.563,1063.757,"In the State of Washington, it is the practice that we follow, but Ms. Kalina was not a testifying or complaining witness in this case, is that her certification specifically disclaimed the role of being a testifying witness."
1997.96-792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1067.491,1069.178,How did she disclaim it?
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,1069.178,1080.237,In the joint appendix on page... which is in the joint appendix on page--
1997.96-792,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.237,1081.97,"19, I think."
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,1081.97,1099.774,"--19, it indicates at the beginning that Lynne Kalina is a deputy prosecutor and is familiar with the police report, and investigation conducted in the Seattle Police Department case, that this case contains the following upon which the motion for the determination of probable cause is made."
1997.96-792,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1099.774,1108.864,"She goes on to sign it under penalty of perjury, which I understand she's not required to do, or correct me if I'm wrong."
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,1108.864,1124.92,"She is required to sign it under oath for purposes of meeting the Gernstein principle, but the fact that she does or doesn't sign shouldn't be the factor that determines whether absolute immunity applies or not."
1997.96-792,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.92,1126.216,Are there other situations--
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,1142.57,1156.049,"There was an affidavit, Justice Stevens, in the file from the principal that Mr. Fletcher had no association with the school, and that was the--"
1997.96-792,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1156.049,1163.515,--But the person to who... who issued the warrant relied on that as a statement of fact by the person who signed the certificate.
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,1163.515,1163.797,--That is correct.
1997.96-792,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1163.797,1172.308,"And that was an inaccurate statement purporting to be given by her own... you see, she... would let the reader think she's saying she knew that."
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,1172.308,1175.431,It would have been preferred if she'd made a reference to the affidavit.
1997.96-792,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1175.431,1177.994,"Well, that may be what this whole case is about."
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,1189.708,1191.16,Yes.
1997.96-792,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1191.16,1191.894,That suffices?
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,1191.894,1192.441,Yes.
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1192.441,1199.125,"And if that were done, would there be probable cause, a basis for probable cause within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment?"
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,1199.125,1202.858,We believe that there is a probable cause--
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1202.858,1213.058,"No, but I mean, on that theory the prosecutor comes up and says, look, I really don't know anything about this, but these people out here are telling me that it is so, and I'm not warranting to you that they're right."
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,1220.757,1227.333,"--Under our procedures is that she's stating that she's familiar with the report, and that she--"
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1227.333,1230.379,"Well, but the magistrate has got to make... whoever issues the warrant--"
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,1230.379,1230.613,--Yes.
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1230.613,1232.94,--has got to make a determination of fact.
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,1251.917,1258.477,"Yes, Justice Souter, because under... you can meet the Gernstein requirement with hearsay evidence, and that is the character of the--"
1997.96-792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1258.477,1269.644,"Yes, but when you meet it with hearsay evidence you in effect are warranting that you believe the hearsay is correct, and that there is a sufficient basis for doing it, and it seems to me the prosecutor can't have it both ways."
1997.96-792,0,37220,norman_maleng,,1285.902,1298.804,"--Trial lawyers and prosecutors routinely make factual representations to the court, and they're under high duty to tell the truth whether they are sworn or not sworn."
1997.96-792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1298.804,1300.069,"Thank you, Mr. Maleng."
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1302.771,1318.217,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-792,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.571,1395.376,"Would it be the same case if she had filed a certification just as a lawyer but not sworn to anything, and then the magistrate had said to her when she appeared in court, I'd like to know whether the defendant had any access to the property before, do you have a witness who can testify to that, and she had responded, yes, and then he swore her as a witness and she said exactly what she said here."
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1396.298,1406.277,"--We believe that she would get absolute immunity for statements in court, whether it would be considered prosecutorial immunity or witness immunity under Burns v. Reed and Briscoe v. LaHue."
1997.96-792,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1414.509,1422.364,Do you think the witness immunity in the context of testimony at trial applies to any sworn statement in support of an affidavit for a search warrant?
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1422.364,1425.848,I think it depends... arrest warrant.
1997.96-792,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1426.254,1426.675,Arrest warrant.
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1427.55,1458.866,"--a search warrant may be much further away from the criminal judicial process, but once the process has been initiated by the Government, as it has here, or triggered as it is in the Federal system, that as written or... whether a statement is written or said in court should not make a functional difference for purposes of absolute immunity, so we actually believe that had a police officer signed it or, for example, the suspect information report that was also filed with the Information and request for arrest warrant here would merit absolute immunity."
1997.96-792,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1458.866,1459.724,"Well, your view, then... I want to be sure I understand."
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1462.645,1462.91,It would.
1997.96-792,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.736,1474.265,So you're relying not on prosecutorial immunity but witness immunity as your basic position.
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1474.265,1474.937,Well--
1997.96-792,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1474.937,1476.093,That that applies in this context.
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1476.093,1485.027,"--If it were a police officer, the label might be witness... I'm not sure if absolute immunity attaches, or whether the exact label matters, but what's--"
1997.96-792,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.027,1485.62,"Well, it matters a great deal, I think."
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1485.62,1486.183,--All right.
1997.96-792,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.183,1499.177,"Because under your theory here it really doesn't matter whether she's a prosecutor at all, because you're suggesting, if I understand you correctly, that any affidavit, any person who makes an affidavit in support of an arrest warrant is entitled to absolute immunity."
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1499.177,1500.27,Two things.
1997.96-792,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1506.221,1507.83,At the time you file an Information and so on--
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1507.83,1515.42,"--Right, and the reason I'm equivocating somewhat about a prosecutor here is just because I think that she was performing a hybrid function here."
1997.96-792,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1519.076,1522.762,"--I understand, but I'm asking to the extent that she's performing the half of the hybrid that was--"
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1522.762,1523.168,--Mm-hmm.
1997.96-792,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.168,1527.291,--testimonial rather than a lawyer presenting a case to a judge.
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1531.524,1533.85,"Under witness or, one wants to call it affidavit immunity."
1997.96-792,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1533.85,1539.067,"So it doesn't matter whether she's a prosecutor or a member of the mafia or a police officer, she's still entitled to--"
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1539.067,1548.282,"It would matter for some things, but right, certainly for purposes of whether absolute immunity attaches, but I think the reasoning here is a little more complicated, because... and one of our concerns in this case--"
1997.96-792,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1548.282,1556.919,"--Absolute immunity but not perjury, would there be, or just absolute immunity from a 1983 suit, or--"
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1556.919,1560.652,--From civil liability damages.
1997.96-792,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1568.04,1571.241,--Do I understand that you are drawing a straight time line?
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1595.56,1596.107,--I believe--
1997.96-792,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1596.107,1604.493,"But if it's removed, it's before the prosecutor has decided whether there's going to be a criminal case, then it's only qualified whoever that--"
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1604.493,1629.436,"--I... taking the first part of your question, I believe the time line is absolutely critical for purposes of deciding whether... is a critical factor in functional analysis, and yes, it's very relevant here, because the time line... it's not so much a date time line, but it's an initiation of the judicial process, which is exactly what the purposes of immunity doctrine are supposed to cover."
1997.96-792,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1704.093,1740.563,"--Well, as you rightly say, or rightly indicate, I mean, the issuance of a search warrant is the beginning of a judicial proceeding, too, and I assume that your argument assumes that there is a historic... given the way we go about the immunity question that there is a basis in historical practice for distinguishing between the immunity that seems to be implied by the initiation of the one judicial process, search warrants, and the other judicial process, arrest warrant and filing of charges."
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1749.825,1766.225,"The closest, strongest case for the common law precedent for immunity in this context which we think is on fours with this situation is a case, Kitler v. Kelsh, which is cited I believe on page 19 of our brief, and was cited by this Court in Imbler."
1997.96-792,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.777,1792.526,What about the other side of the--
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1813.44,1814.19,"Well, I think--"
1997.96-792,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.19,1828.105,"And that's the explanation of that case, not the functional distinction that our cases have, I think, mistakenly applied, mistakenly if we think we're tracking what the common law was."
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1828.105,1831.167,"--Well, I think it... there's more than sort of two factors coming together."
1997.96-792,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1851.268,1855.656,It's the implication of what you're saying that Malley was wrongly decided.
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1855.656,1856.0,--No.
1997.96-792,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1907.714,1928.878,"Would your argument be different if we were dealing with a State in which the historical practice had been traditionally that the... what is called the certification here, the statement under oath about fact, was given by police officers and investigators as opposed to prosecutors?"
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1932.61,1942.45,"What is critical is whether it is the initiation... whether that would be combined with a prosecutorial decision to, as here, initiate a criminal prosecution."
1997.96-792,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1944.902,1946.761,"If so, the witness would get the immunity?"
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1946.761,1948.542,"--Yes, whether it would be called prosecutorial immunity or not."
1997.96-792,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.058,1949.73,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
1997.96-792,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1949.73,1950.089,--Mr. Chief Justice.
1997.96-792,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1950.089,1951.493,Mr. Ford.
1997.96-792,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,1951.493,1956.366,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-792,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1993.399,1998.583,So you would not have made this claim if there had been no actual arrest.
1997.96-792,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2004.519,2007.955,"It is not in the nature of a defamation claim, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-792,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2079.522,2085.801,What is the jurisdiction over... what kind of criminal actions do those lower courts have jurisdiction over?
1997.96-792,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2085.801,2099.747,"That rule itself, Your Honor, would only deal with misdemeanors, but in felonies you can also have those same courts have jurisdiction issue arrest warrants, although I admit it would not be on the complaint only of a citizen or police officer for felonies."
1997.96-792,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2099.747,2102.028,And this was a felony involved here.
1997.96-792,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2102.028,2105.621,"This was a felony, although I'm not... I would contend there's no constitutional difference--"
1997.96-792,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2105.621,2106.183,How can that be?
1997.96-792,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2126.128,2129.128,"--The policeman could attest to the fact, Justice Breyer."
1997.96-792,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2133.065,2133.424,Why not?
1997.96-792,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2133.424,2140.983,Because you do... under Washington law you do have to have either a complaint or an Information filed in order to issue an arrest warrant from our court.
