1968.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,24.222,"Number 39, Enrique Perez, petitioner versus California."
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,28.557,30.923,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,322.478,323.526,"Mr. Fetros, --"
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,323.526,323.616,Yes.
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,323.616,330.107,There is a statement in your brief that is not quite clear to me on page 6.
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,350.73,354.347,Concurrently with counts one and two.
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,354.347,355.269,So that --
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,355.269,359.431,"No, his maximum sentence therefore would be at the exploration of count of two."
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,359.431,360.353,Of count two --
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,360.353,360.593,That's correct.
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,360.593,370.377,-- counts three and four where the sentence is imposed were fully concurrent with the consecutive sentences imposed upon counts one and two?
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,370.377,373.731,That's correct and of course in California we have the indeterminate sentence.
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,373.731,374.144,Yes.
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,374.144,389.114,And what we have this situation in the parole board of the state meets and determines what sentence is going to be based on his past record and they would also take into consideration the fact that he was convicted of these crimes in determining when he was -- would be eligible.
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,389.114,395.102,On sentence on counts three and four would never end later than on one and two under this sentence?
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,395.102,396.749,That's correct.
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,405.515,410.276,"Well, I suppose the parole board could consider anything including the fact he was accused of other crimes?"
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,410.276,410.809,That's correct.
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.809,411.581,Is that correct?
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,411.581,424.186,But I think that it would have much greater bearing to know that he was actually convicted of two crimes after a jury trial and of course this is the thing that we are concerned with.
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,425.563,427.629,May I ask what is the relief you're asking for?
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,430.234,433.587,"Well, I'm asking to set aside three and four because --"
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,433.587,435.264,Only three and four?
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,435.264,438.209,"Yes, because I don't think there was harmless."
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,438.958,442.754,"Now, what if only three and four then he remains in jail and one and two does not."
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,442.754,444.551,"No, I was going to finish."
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,444.551,444.646,Oh!
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,446.791,452.863,My argument is that since this trial was a long protracted trial.
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,474.588,476.378,But you're not asking us to set aside?
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,476.378,477.037,"Yes, I am."
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,477.037,477.606,"Oh, you are!"
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,477.606,478.049,Yes.
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,478.049,479.606,You want all four convictions?
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,479.606,489.995,"That's correct and I want things either separate when they're retried and then the clear determination made by the jury if he is guilty of one, two, three and four."
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,771.171,776.778,But that of course if everybody realizes that then the jury can be assumed to realize that too?
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,777.491,785.988,"Then, we get into this idea of whether the instruction focuses attention onto the fact that he didn't remain -- that he remained silent and didn't explain something."
1968.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,791.108,796.342,Because he had this -- he has a lawyer and if the lawyer is representing him he can make all this.
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,803.396,807.492,"Well, it's just the same factual realities of life."
1968.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.492,854.152,"I gather in count one concerned the robbery in January 3 at the white club, count two were robbery on January 15, (Inaudible) and three and four, robbery that's still third and fourth places in January 13, is that right?"
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,854.152,857.589,"No, there is just one place on counts three and four."
1968.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,859.835,861.027,January 15
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,861.027,861.799,That's right.
1968.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,861.799,872.009,"Had he took the stand and testified on defense on the accusation of robberies on January 3rd and January 15th, is that right?"
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,872.009,872.608,That's correct.
1968.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,873.171,875.231,(Inaudible)
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,875.231,875.794,That's correct.
1968.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.329,890.578,"Well, why didn't you say that those convictions are pleaded by the count of three and four?"
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,890.578,896.387,"Well, I don't think we can be reasonably certain that that after the jury went in to the jury room."
1968.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.04,908.315,Does this touch on harmless error problem?
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,908.315,909.453,I beg your pardon.
1968.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,909.453,911.28,From the Chapman on the harmless error?
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,911.28,913.13,"Yes, on the harmless error."
1968.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.13,916.933,Was there a harmless error finding here at all?
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,916.933,917.795,In the Supreme Court?
1968.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.795,918.214,Yes.
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,918.214,922.676,I believe they did find it that it was harmful.
1968.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,922.676,923.598,They what?
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,923.598,927.82,I think they did find that it was harmless.
1968.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,927.82,935.826,My difficulty is and these are concurrent sentences.
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,957.958,958.647,That's correct.
1968.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.034,990.127,"The defendant did testify himself to counts one and two, didn't he?"
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,990.127,1000.001,"Yes, that alibi and then he had two, I believe he had his brother or his brother and mother or brother-in-law and his mother who testified as to where they were."
1968.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1000.001,1007.876,"So, I suppose that his evidence whatever he testified to or didn't testify to it to counts one and two could've been come on his own."
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,1007.876,1008.071,Oh!
1968.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1011.403,1023.732,But you're saying that comment on his failure to talk about three and four obtained in his convictions on one and two?
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,1023.732,1025.384,That's right.
1968.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1046.067,1054.421,"Well, you do agree don't you that we have to get to counts one and two before you can get any relief at all on any of these counts?"
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,1054.421,1057.349,"No, you could reverse as to three and four without reversing as to one and two."
1968.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1057.349,1061.81,"But, we don't know what there concurring sentence si moot?"
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,1067.433,1071.08,I'm sorry I just can't answer that.
1968.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1071.08,1073.978,But you're familiar with the ordinary rule that we don't --
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,1073.978,1074.517,Yes.
1968.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1074.517,1082.242,We'll view this rather concurrent sentence and it's conceded at least that two of the convictions must stand and we don't reach the --
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,1082.242,1083.404,"Well, I haven't conceded them."
1968.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1083.578,1084.231,I know you haven't.
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,1084.231,1084.704,No.
1968.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1084.704,1102.159,You said they were tainted and I'm trying to find out what exactly in what respect you say that the convictions by the jury on one and two for those separate crimes were tainted by the comment of the prosecutor on his failure to testify as to three or four and that's what I --
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,1102.159,1111.299,"Well, because on three and four now you're also bringing in the idea that by finding him guilty of three and four if they're saying that it's a similar type of crime."
1968.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1111.299,1125.371,"Yes, but you have to say don't you that they convicted him on one and two in part because they felt that he was not to be believed in his defense on one and two if he didn't take the stand as to three and four."
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,1125.371,1126.09,That's correct.
1968.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1126.09,1127.042,That's really what you're saying.
1968.39,0,37902,peter_g_fetros,,1127.042,1127.425,That's right.
1968.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1179.521,1184.096,Mr. Haws.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1184.096,1189.21,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1481.634,1482.856,May I ask you Mr. Haws?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1482.856,1483.599,"Yes, sir."
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1483.599,1489.222,I don't find in your brief that you make any argument based on concurrence?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1489.222,1490.473,"No sir, I don't."
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.473,1494.965,Don't you think there are any -- do you have any replacements?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1494.965,1510.288,"Well, Your Honor I thought about that -- I gave that considerable thought and of course we would take that argument if we had to but we thought that this case was so clear that there might be some --"
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.288,1515.827,"Well, you wanted us really to decide the waiver question?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1515.827,1519.941,We thought that the principles of waiver were so clear that we would hit --
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1519.941,1528.384,"No, it's not really presented by the case provided (Inaudible)"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1528.384,1540.031,"Well, as I say that to your statement is entirely in my favor and it would perhaps I have to take that but we had considered briefing but we didn't --"
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.031,1547.421,"Here was just decided constitutional question, you migth use that of rule, do you?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1547.421,1549.008,"Well, Your Honor that --"
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1549.008,1550.595,Do you think in that?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1550.595,1572.146,"Yes, that was waived but on the fear of not taking the stand because of prior convictions that has no validity here because two prior convictions were charged against this petitioner."
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.051,1716.728,"Well, what would happen if there was an objection to the cross-examination about counts three and four?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1716.728,1717.77,That is right.
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1717.77,1720.429,And the objection that was sustained?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1720.429,1721.74,That is right.
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1721.74,1726.89,"And so, there was no testimony about three and four for him?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1726.89,1727.639,"That is true, Your Honor."
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1727.639,1728.95,But there was comment?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1728.95,1729.759,That is right.
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.759,1739.394,"And then the California Supreme Court said, “No, the law in California that there was no privilege as to counts three and four.”"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1739.394,1740.346,That is right.
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.346,1742.592,"And so, he should've testified?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1742.592,1745.661,Should've been allowed to be cross-examined.
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.661,1752.137,And should've been force to testify?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1752.137,1753.838,I don't think they said that Your Honor.
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.838,1764.042,"Well, what if he has no privilege and he's asked the question on cross-examination and on privilege question and he refuses to answer, what happens?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1764.042,1767.928,"Well, of course I would -- the general -- I understand --"
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1767.928,1769.515,"You didn't instruct him to answer, don't you?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1769.515,1771.82,That's right.
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1772.898,1786.072,"Well, what do you think the defendant would've done if he had found out and he had mistakenly claimed his privilege and it has been mistakenly upheld, do you think he'd rather had comment or would he rather testify?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1786.072,1787.803,"Well, I don't know Your Honor."
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1794.414,1795.306,There wasn't?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1795.306,1795.546,"No, he --"
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.546,1797.636,"Well, what was the objection based on?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1797.636,1800.714,Beyond the scope of direct examination.
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.714,1802.954,I see.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1802.954,1804.056,"So, you see there and you don't --"
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1804.056,1809.799,I know but he's claiming that privilege.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1813.476,1827.781,"Well, now but you see the prejudice would have to relate to the factual situation Your Honor occurring then as in Johnson the witness or I think it was the defendant did claim a privilege which the trial judge granted."
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.781,1836.075,"All right, do you think the Supreme Court of California also said that this was unprivileged?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1836.075,1837.566,They didn't discuss that.
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1837.566,1840.291,"They said, this isn't beyond the scope of cross-examination."
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1840.291,1842.051,That's right and since it is --
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1842.051,1845.165,Do you think they also rule that was unprivileged?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1845.165,1847.471,"Well, I think that that would follow."
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.471,1848.483,Didn't they have to?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1851.261,1859.615,"I think it would follow that if it's within the scope the privilege is waived therefore, he should've answered it."
1968.39,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1874.369,1879.902,"Mr. Haws, are you familiar with this Court's decision in Raley versus Ohio?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1879.902,1881.363,I don't recall on that.
1968.39,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1881.363,1900.764,A situation and which the witness was told that he could avail himself of the privilege and he did and then he was prosecuted for contempt in the Supreme Court of Ohio so he should've been told that he could avail himself to the privilege because it was an immunity statute.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1935.035,1943.951,"Well, Your Honor his direct examination was in on counts one and two."
1968.39,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1950.538,1951.909,"Well, he couldn't obviously."
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1951.909,1953.077,That's right.
1968.39,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1962.382,1966.993,"So, the point here is that the objection was made whatever the ground of the objection was."
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1966.993,1978.101,The objection was made not that you're requiring him to incriminate himself on a matter not charged but you're going into matters --
1968.39,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1978.101,1980.191,Beyond the direct testimony?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1980.191,1981.023,That's right.
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.023,1986.742,But unless you utilize the concurring sentence rule Mr. Justice Brennan was asking you about it.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,1997.425,1998.048,"Well, --"
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.048,2010.168,Because I'm not so sure of what -- did not know that he was suppose to testify that he would rather testify than have to comment.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2010.168,2010.821,"Well, of course --"
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2010.821,2014.857,Because the Supreme Court certainly upheld the comment.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2014.857,2015.809,Our California Supreme Court?
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2015.809,2016.767,Yes.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2016.767,2022.516,"Well, yes upon this ground that was within the scope of relevant cross-examination."
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.346,2061.388,"Well, anyway that he did has a choice in the sense that he knew there was going to be comment he didn't testify?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2064.255,2079.196,In any event whether he took the stand or not the comment would've been permissible at the time of the trial.
1968.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2079.196,2092.145,"Mr. Haws, I'm having a little trouble in finding -- satisfying myself what happened here in the California Appellate Court."
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2144.851,2145.749,"No, Your Honor."
1968.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2145.749,2147.007,That's what it seems to say.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2147.007,2154.516,"No, Your Honor, that language relates to the judgment of the trial court affirming --"
1968.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2154.516,2159.57,"Well, that wasn't the judgment was it that the Supreme Court of California was reviewing."
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2162.289,2170.906,"No, Your Honor, when our California Supreme Court grants a hearing it is reviewing the conviction of judgment."
1968.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2177.816,2179.942,I see.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2179.942,2182.241,"Now, just on that I might --"
1968.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2182.241,2184.337,I see.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2184.337,2192.75,"So, as the case stands before the Court today, all counts of the conviction have been affirmed."
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.75,2199.786,"So, that instead of the judgment is affirmed which submits judgment of the conviction at all four counts charged?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2199.786,2203.409,"That would've been a full explanation, yes Your Honor."
1968.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2275.08,2296.791,Do I need a Gettysburg's opinion directly in reading it to say in effect that all of the evidence on counts three and four as a matter of California law were admissible on the charges under counts one and two as part of the modus operandi?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2296.791,2297.66,That is correct.
1968.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2297.66,2306.995,"So that it was all -- if they've never been at counts three and four, isn't never been that evidence nevertheless would've been admissible in the trial on counts one and two."
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2306.995,2307.923,That is true Your Honor --
1968.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2307.923,2309.6,And that's what he said and that's (Voice Overlap).
1968.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.6,2313.073,And the same comment would've been justified if he didn't --
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2313.073,2314.54,That is true.
1968.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2401.839,2404.049,Because there would have been no waiver with respect?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2404.049,2406.438,That is right Your Honor.
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2406.701,2424.456,"Well, I suppose that here in your theory that there was a waiver as to counts three and four where prosecutor could've said, “All right, I'll now examine him as I examine the petitioner as my own witness.”"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2424.456,2427.713,He couldn't -- you can't do that Your Honor under --
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2427.713,2430.468,Why?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2430.468,2442.678,"Well, I can't think of the California cases but that has been attempted in California and of course that violation --"
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2442.678,2456.175,"Well, I see in your theory is that as I understand it that there was a waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination as to counts three and four as well as to counts one and two, is that right?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2456.175,2457.343,"That's right, Your Honor."
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2457.343,2472.824,"Well, the Court excluded cross-examination as to counts three and four on the evidentiary basis that that cross-examination would be beyond the scope of the direct, that's right isn't it?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2472.824,2473.656,That is true.
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2474.255,2497.04,"Now, does it follow that the prosecutor -- the privilege having been waived could have made the petitioner his own witness and proceeded to examine him with respect to counts three and four?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2497.04,2501.741,I don't think that would follow Justice Fortas.
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2501.741,2520.627,"And I don't understand because it seems to me that's necessary logic of your position, it's a necessary consequence of saying that testimony as to counts one and two resulted in a waiver of the privilege as to counts three and four."
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2520.627,2536.34,I don't think so Your Honor because of this; his examination of this defendant of course is within the bounds of the relevant cross-examination.
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2536.34,2538.34,Of the relevant direct examination.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2538.34,2538.879,"Excuse me, direct examination."
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2538.879,2559.502,"But why, why couldn't he -- if the privilege is waive, why couldn't he call petitioner as his own witness, why couldn't the prosecutor call petitioner as his own witness, does it call John Jones on your theory that the privilege was waived?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2559.502,2575.724,"Well, I think that calling as his own witness with no doubt open up a broader field than what he had to work with and what he could work with under relevant cross-examination."
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2575.724,2581.257,"Well, then don't you have to say that privilege was not waived as to counts three and four?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2606.605,2626.21,"Well, I would say that the waiver extended to counts three and four because that would be permissible cross-examination and he can do that because the privilege is waived."
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2643.772,2651.311,That's right and if the privilege has been waived why can't he?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2651.311,2660.401,That privilege has been waived but it occurs to me other things might come into involvement there in it.
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2668.485,2676.599,I know but that's a valued judgment if you think that's too coercive whether that's a little inconsistent with your position.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2676.599,2681.868,"Well, that's not my judgment that was the judgment of the California Supreme Court on this --"
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2681.868,2710.37,"But the problem here is whether offhand it seems that the trial court took position and maybe somewhat inconsistent if or let me put it this way; that if the prosecutor had said, “Privilege has now been waived, defendant testified as to counts one and two."
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2742.065,2755.981,"Well, all I could to answer your question, all I could say that the privilege extends to counts three and four under the theory that that is proper cross-examination."
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2768.909,2776.807,"No, but the court didn't allow to examine as to counts three and four to cross-examine as to counts three and four --"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2776.807,2777.735,That's true.
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2777.735,2779.831,That was outside of the scope of the direct.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2779.831,2784.143,And of course that was -- our California Supreme Court said that was error.
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2786.502,2792.7,On the grounds that there was a waiver of the privilege?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2792.7,2798.472,"No, there's a waiver of the privilege Your Honor because it's within the scope of cross-examination."
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2807.095,2836.559,"Yes and I see what you mean but I still I suggest to you that if it is your contention that the privilege was waived, that would open up the defendant to being called as -- by the state if the state want to do it and examine it with respect to the entire scope of counts three and four."
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2836.559,2851.134,"Your Honor I would think that if logically if you can insulate it to this cross-examination waiver problem, it will logically follow perhaps but as I mentioned so many other aspects of calling the defendant would --"
1968.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2851.134,2900.047,"I understand that but I mean to say we have to look at this thing as a matter of principle, not to look at the parameter of the problem as well as its immediate focus and I suggest to you that what you're telling us is that may result in the logical conclusion that if a defendant take stand as to any counts as a waiver as to all counts and the net result of that is that the prosecutor if he sees fit, and examine the witness as his -- and examine the defendant as his own witness with respect to those other counts."
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,2900.047,2907.319,"Your Honor, that has not been the history of the situation in the federal practice."
1968.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2974.779,3002.084,"May I ask you Mr. Haws, supposing the Court had not found that these were similar offenses and therefore that he could be cross-examined on that scope but have put it on the grounds of pure waiver, could this be sustained?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,3002.084,3019.593,"Well, some of the earlier federal cases seem to indicate that the waiver of the privilege was not bounded by the scope of cross-examination."
1968.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3052.096,3065.406,"So, they had a broader scope of cross-examination for a defendant than for a witness -- ordinary witness?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,3065.406,3071.987,I would say that it would be perhaps broader for the ordinary witness because since he is not charged.
1968.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3071.987,3086.292,"And suppose the witness -- suppose then a witness in this trial had testified as to count one only but you have cross-examined him as to two, three and four?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,3086.292,3087.999,An uncharged witness?
1968.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3087.999,3088.502,Yes.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,3088.502,3090.472,"No, no Your Honor, I don't think so."
1968.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3090.472,3099.274,"Well, that I would be -- there is a difference scope then according to our theory as between the witness and a defendant."
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,3099.274,3101.789,"Well, that is true."
1968.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3101.789,3106.759,And it's broader for the defendant?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,3106.759,3134.516,"Well, what I meant was that the non-charged witness his privilege or he can be questioned about many things in a much broader area because he is not charged and I think that the privileges would work differently between the non-charged witness and the charged witness that in your -- if I made myself clear."
1968.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3136.133,3148.911,"But I don't see how that follows if you say that if he testifies concerning one count, he cannot be cross-examined as to the other counts."
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,3148.911,3170.265,"Your Honor, I think it's the theory; the non-charged witness is not being -- you're not proving anything against him but as with the defendant here, you're proving a defense against him and when he makes a general denial he has an effect denied the collateral offense of count three and four."
1968.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3170.265,3174.876,"He didn't make a general denial on the witness stand as two, three and four?"
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,3174.876,3175.559,No.
1968.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3175.559,3176.631,Just one and two?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,3176.631,3188.9,"That is true but because of that general denial under the rules of evidence, he makes a general denial also of counts three and four and therefore, within the scope of cross-examination."
1968.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3188.9,3205.572,Then you would say that even if three and four were not similar offenses under the similar offense rule in California that they could still cross-examine him if he testified concerning one and two?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,3205.572,3207.093,"No, I'm sorry Your Honor."
1968.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3226.728,3234.237,Can you tell us in just a moment what to make these similar offenses?
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,3234.237,3235.728,"Well, --"
1968.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3235.728,3243.423,Counsel -- the counsel said that in his opinion they were not that's the only reason I asked you.
1968.39,1,22402,edsel_w_haws,,3243.423,3288.863,"Well, I have a chart here and just running across they were similar because of clothing, because at all counts they searched other areas looking for other things such as the radio in count two, credit cards in count one, and in counts three and four they also search to other areas they were in all of the offenses; they were some type or use some type of mask but I think most significant of all is that you had the admitted robber David Perez unrelated to this provision."
1968.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3324.247,3327.325,"Mr. Fetros, did you have some time left?"
1968.39,2,37902,peter_g_fetros,,3330.463,3338.78,I just want to make one very brief comment and that's the use of the term “cross-examination” by the California Supreme Court.
1968.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3429.834,3432.588,Very well.
