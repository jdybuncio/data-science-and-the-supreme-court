1980.80-780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.556,We'll hear arguments next in Rowan Companies v. the United States.
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,49.131,52.533,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,130.718,132.837,Too costly for?
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,132.837,134.437,--The crews to leave the--
1980.80-780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,134.437,136.039,"Yes, but too costly for whom?"
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,137.805,138.824,--The employer.
1980.80-780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,148.346,149.812,On their time or company time?
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,149.812,150.714,On company time.
1980.80-780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,154.916,158.535,And was there a figure on that?
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,159.57,160.287,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,160.887,161.687,How does it relate--
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,161.687,178.366,"--$275 to $350 per crew per trip, which breaks down to about $25 to $29 per man, with a 12-man crew as compared to about $6 a day for furnishing food and lodging aboard the rig."
1980.80-780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,178.366,180.334,--A little bit more than the food.
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,180.334,181.334,"I beg your pardon, sir?"
1980.80-780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,181.334,182.818,A little bit more than the food.
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,182.818,186.704,"Yes, sir, about five times as much as the food and lodging."
1980.80-780,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,186.704,189.089,Unless they're awful hungry.
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,189.089,202.097,"Unless they are awfully hungry, but I believe it's been stipulated that the value of the food and lodging is $6 per man per day, as compared to the $29 cost per man per day to transport them back and forth to shore."
1980.80-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,251.08,256.416,I realize this hypothetical example is vastly different factually.
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,281.216,286.603,"I don't think it's any difference in principle, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, however, I should say in candor--"
1980.80-780,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,286.603,299.111,"In that case, perhaps the Members of the Court are... perhaps you don't have a court here, because I'd venture to guess that most if not all of the Members of the Court have such household employees, at least part time."
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,299.111,310.135,"--I should say, in all candor, Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that by statute the meals and lodging furnished to household employees are exempt."
1980.80-780,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,317.122,317.456,By statute.
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,317.456,322.491,I think I should be perfectly fair about that.
1980.80-780,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,381.396,382.948,They are not subject to--
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,382.948,386.9,They are not subject to; they are not wages subject to income tax.
1980.80-780,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,386.9,389.702,--The employees don't have to include these for income tax purposes?
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,389.702,401.643,"That's correct, sir, but not only that, but more significantly they are not within the definition of wages for income tax withholding purposes, the income tax withholding being one of the four employment taxes imposed."
1980.80-780,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,401.643,404.928,"But the reason... is that the reason for that, since they're not subject to tax?"
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,405.828,406.63,"No, sir."
1980.80-780,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,430.679,431.329,My question was--
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,431.329,432.864,--for the last 62 years.
1980.80-780,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,432.864,439.468,"--No, but isn't it logical, if they're not to be included as income for tax purposes, you wouldn't include them for withholding purposes, would you?"
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,439.468,442.187,"Certainly that's logical, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1980.80-780,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.916,521.722,"You say there are four, and that's repeated in the briefs, and I'm sure there are, but I count only three, the income taxes and FICA and FUTA."
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,521.722,523.739,"Well, FICA consists of two taxes."
1980.80-780,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,523.739,524.257,I see.
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,524.257,541.417,"There's one tax which is by statute an income tax, which is highly significant; it's a tax on income limited to the wages of employees, which is withheld by the employer; and a tax in an additional amount... the first tax is borne by the employee through the withholding system."
1980.80-780,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,554.976,556.376,Since there are two FICAs--
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,556.376,557.278,There are two FICAs.
1980.80-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,559.162,572.872,"--Isn't it fairly common for, say, again, an employer of a domestic to agree to pay the domestic's share of the narrower wage?"
1980.80-780,0,34023,k_martin_worthy,,572.872,584.062,"--Yes, sir, it is common, and the Service has ruled that the employer can do so without that additional tax being counted as wages as a part of the tax base."
1980.80-780,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1073.213,1081.486,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1183.735,1185.487,That's a FUTA regulation?
1980.80-780,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1185.487,1188.539,That is a FICA and a FUTA regulation.
1980.80-780,2,34023,k_martin_worthy,,2367.92,2369.989,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.54,2426.826,Was this in an individual case of an individual taxpayer?
1980.80-780,2,34023,k_martin_worthy,,2426.826,2427.778,"No, sir."
1980.80-780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.547,2459.499,Was that a GCM or a rev rule?
1980.80-780,2,34023,k_martin_worthy,,2459.499,2460.749,--That is a Revenue Ruling.
1980.80-780,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2460.749,2462.215,Revenue Ruling.
1980.80-780,2,34023,k_martin_worthy,,2462.215,2463.851,GCMs are no longer issued.
1980.80-780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.653,2472.923,"It must have been... the rev rule was prompted by some cases, wasn't it?"
1980.80-780,2,34023,k_martin_worthy,,2472.923,2473.757,I assume so.
1980.80-780,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.859,2477.46,"Specific cases, that's what I asked you a while ago?"
1980.80-780,2,34023,k_martin_worthy,,2477.46,2478.226,--specific facts.
1980.80-780,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2483.23,2483.714,Right.
1980.80-780,2,34023,k_martin_worthy,,2488.449,2496.522,"Well, with all due respect, since I filed many GCMs myself, I can tell you that they were discontinued, I believe, Your Honor, in 1954."
1980.80-780,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2496.522,2497.588,But there's a lot of difference--
1980.80-780,2,34023,k_martin_worthy,,2497.588,2498.674,As far as being published.
1980.80-780,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2501.326,2502.576,--But they're revenue rulings.
1980.80-780,2,34023,k_martin_worthy,,2510.615,2513.417,"That's probably true, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.80-780,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2513.417,2515.936,That's the difference.
1980.80-780,2,34023,k_martin_worthy,,2515.936,2521.489,"Certainly, it would have been very difficult for these people to get meals and lodging."
1980.80-780,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2547.488,2548.14,"Thank you, gentlemen."
