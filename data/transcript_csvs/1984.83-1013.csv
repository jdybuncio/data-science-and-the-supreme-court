1984.83-1013,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,51.599,"Mr. Alito, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,51.599,54.385,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1984.83-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,409.782,420.155,"Suppose regulations could be issued and then amended to care of refinements as time went on, could they not?"
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,420.155,426.225,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, and that is essentially what we believe the FDF variance mechanism does."
1984.83-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,428.111,438.718,"It accomplishes the same goal, but I suppose not with the same procedural accoutrements that a regulatory change would encompass."
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,438.718,440.151,--That is precisely correct.
1984.83-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,443.77,457.411,Is that what we are really concerned about here as to whether the EPA should have to follow the regulatory procedural requirements and adopted regulations versus issuance of individual--
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,457.411,464.934,"--Based on the concessions that I perceive in Respondent's brief, I think that's what the issue in the case boils down to."
1984.83-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,489.315,493.351,"--Well, 307 permits a revision, does it not?"
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,493.351,504.559,"That's correct, but if I take Respondent to have made in one part of its brief the argument that 301(l) is clear on its face, and it is not necessary to look any further, and I think--"
1984.83-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,504.559,510.129,Does EPA claim that an FDF variance is a revision--
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,510.129,510.529,--An FDF--
1984.83-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,510.529,512.998,--under the meaning of 307?
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,512.998,520.319,"--No, it is not a revision within the meaning of 307, but neither is the modification within the meaning of 301(l)."
1984.83-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,562.745,576.319,"Mr. Alito, has the Agency requested the appropriate congressional committee to draft an amendment to Section 301 to take care of the problem we are dealing with in this case?"
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,576.319,587.627,"My understanding is that during the testimony in the House during this session, EPA mentioned the fact that the Third Circuit's decision in this case should be overturned, but that no--"
1984.83-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,587.627,594.781,Did it go further and offer specific language by EPA to the committee to take care of this problem?
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,594.781,596.733,"--I'm not aware whether that occurred or not, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,596.733,599.684,It was my understanding that it had.
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,599.684,610.706,"My understanding was that no specific bill containing such a provision had been proposed and, in fact, no amendments to the Clean Water Act were adopted by this session."
1984.83-1013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,630.62,633.256,"Mr. Alito, may I just ask one clarifying question."
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,646.665,671.797,"I think it stems from 501 which authorizes the Agency to issue regulations necessary to implement the Act, and I think it stems from two potentially conflicting statutory commands in the Clean Water Act, namely, to issue these limitations on a categorical basis, and then to do it based on factors that vary significantly among seemingly similar plants."
1984.83-1013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,715.91,722.146,"Are... Sections 301(c) and 301(g), they're not sources of authority, right?"
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,722.146,723.096,"No, they certainly are not."
1984.83-1013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,867.041,867.758,Can you help me once more.
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,881.734,882.151,--Yes.
1984.83-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1087.751,1094.922,"Would that trigger the revision of Section 307, Mr. Alito?"
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1094.922,1113.818,"Well, we think it would, Justice O'Connor, but our point is that a provision that prohibits modifications but permits revisions is not a provisions that is clear on its face, and it is necessary to take into account the interpretation of the Agency with expertise under this Act."
1984.83-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1116.27,1123.276,"You think the word ""modify"" is a term of art requiring Agency expertise to define it?"
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1123.276,1126.059,I think it is indeed a term of art in 301(l).
1984.83-1013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.467,1269.169,"May I interrupt once more, Mr. Alito?"
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1279.108,1285.512,There were variances pertaining to pollutants that were later designated by Congress to be toxic.
1984.83-1013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.512,1291.5,Were there variances with respect to pollutants that had been designated as toxic pollutants at the time the variance was granted?
1984.83-1013,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1291.5,1300.355,"No, but that is because the way that toxic pollutants were handled under the Clean Water Act was radically changed in 1977."
1984.83-1013,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1440.548,1452.022,We will resume at 1:00 o'clock.
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,1472.333,1475.352,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.545,1748.73,What does it say?
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,1751.599,1762.721,"It says, do not modify any requirement of Section 301, and the term 301, means the variance."
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.721,1765.99,It includes a variance.
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,1765.99,1768.191,"It includes the variance, yes."
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.493,1774.778,"What else does it prohibit, other than variances?"
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,1774.778,1779.416,--I think it is limited to variances.
1984.83-1013,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1779.416,1782.634,For toxic pollutants.
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,1782.634,1783.501,That's right.
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1783.501,1789.938,Do you think they could amend the standard?
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,1789.938,1797.211,There is a provision in Section 307 to revise standards from time to time.
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.211,1801.763,So that 301(l) doesn't mean what it says.
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,1801.763,1806.167,"No, 301(l) means modification, i.e., variance."
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.167,1813.887,"The word 307 permits, is that right?"
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,1813.887,1819.89,"The word ""modify"" in this context means variance, it does not mean revision."
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.926,1829.58,"""Modify"", that is a strange word to use just to apply to variances."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,1829.58,1835.586,Congress used to encompass waivers and variances.
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1835.586,1838.186,So it does permit the changes of standards.
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,1838.186,1843.256,"It does permit EPA to revise the standard from to time, yes, it does."
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.477,1863.253,"Do you think, then, that a variance... You just don't accept that a variance could be a revision of a standard."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,1863.253,1873.525,"A variance, as the FDF variances, is an attempt to relax pollution control requirements for a single source, and that is what 301(l) prohibits."
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.763,1889.571,"What if anybody who is in a similar situation to the person who gets the variance, would also get a variance."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,1907.865,1916.035,"Yes, they argue that you can... They argue that the FDF variance is a tailoring to an individual source."
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.173,1925.742,They must believe they would give a variance to everybody else who is in the same situation.
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,1925.742,1931.98,The FDF variance doesn't contemplate looking at the group as a whole.
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.74,1952.477,"Yes, but that kind of a variance is based on what they claim to be a mistake."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,1964.452,1977.109,"There is a difference between a variance that is an individual tailoring of a standard, and a revision that considers the category as a whole."
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1977.109,1988.817,"So you would say... You would say that surely under 307, the Government could say to itself: Well, this person has applied for a variance and has claimed that there were factors we didn't take into consideration."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2007.444,2011.348,"EPA would have the authority, if it had information--"
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2011.348,2016.669,But it shouldn't go about it by purporting to issue a variance.
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2016.669,2021.871,"--If EPA had information that the standard as a whole was wrong, it could change it."
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.304,2034.095,"Or that it needed to be tailored, or it needed to recognize some subgroups."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2034.095,2039.933,--Congress told EPA to set these standard across classes.
1984.83-1013,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2095.852,2096.752,Right--
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2096.752,2097.569,That is not what Congress intended.
1984.83-1013,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2106.125,2112.862,"--Ms. Dubrowski, this case, of course, involves BAT standards."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2112.862,2113.797,That's right.
1984.83-1013,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2113.797,2131.425,Would you say that EPA is barred under 301(l) from granting FDF variances for BPT toxic effluent guidelines?
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2131.425,2138.829,"We would say that EPA is, although I should point out that that question is at this point legally irrelevant."
1984.83-1013,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2138.829,2146.785,"I understand that it is phasing out, but I want to know what your view is."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2146.785,2150.82,"We would say, yes, 301(l) would apply to BPT."
1984.83-1013,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2150.82,2157.993,How do you square that with the language this Court used in the DuPont decision?
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2157.993,2164.829,"301(l) was enacted after DuPont, it changes the law."
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2795.074,2811.869,"Ms. Dubrowski, what do you think... what do you suggest the standard should be, that we should apply in this situation where the Agency has construed the statute in a way that you think is wrong."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2824.795,2828.247,This is not a case of an ambiguous statutory provision.
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2831.865,2835.317,"Now, how about my question, what questions should we ask?"
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2842.238,2855.48,"If this Court decides contrary to our argument that 301(l) is not clear, then the question arises, what could EPA do outside of the context of 301(l)."
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2855.48,2862.218,"If it is clear like you say it is, any other construction would just be irrational, wouldn't it."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2863.503,2864.27,That's right.
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2864.27,2873.109,So is that our question that we should ask?
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2873.109,2879.763,I am not quite sure I understand the question.
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2879.763,2896.558,"Well, here the Agency is pressing a construction of the statute, and what should we do, say, well, we think there is a better construction of it, or should we say, or should we ask, is this a permissible construction, a rational construction, even though there are other constructions."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2899.943,2900.426,That's right.
1984.83-1013,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2906.847,2914.934,"Of course, the Agency, certainly and obviously, has not agreed with you for some time, and neither does the Solicitor General."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2918.905,2921.607,"Then the question becomes, is that valid?"
1984.83-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2981.876,2983.645,May I ask a question there.
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,2986.18,3002.956,"I just wanted to add one other point to the answer there, and that is that Congress wanted these standards to be uniform, or as uniform as possible across the class, because it wanted sources who paid for pollution control equipment to know that their competitors were doing likewise."
1984.83-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3016.264,3032.558,"I just would like to know whether you agree with your opponent that there was statutory authority for variances in the non-toxic area, and that the statutory authority is what he described, namely, 501 and of the general scheme of the Act."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,3032.558,3034.641,501 simply... No.
1984.83-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3047.735,3053.222,"Is it part of your position, then, that before... Was 301(c) part of the '77 amendments?"
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,3053.222,3055.855,301(c) existed in 1972.
1984.83-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3060.393,3067.696,So your position is that variances in the non-toxic area all had to be pursuant to 301(c) or 301(g)?
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,3067.696,3068.714,That is correct.
1984.83-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3068.714,3073.616,"If that were true, then the prohibition would have cut them out in the toxic area."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,3073.616,3074.285,That is correct.
1984.83-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3074.285,3080.472,So you disagree with your opponent's reading of what the basic statutory for any variance was before '77?
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,3080.472,3081.722,That is correct.
1984.83-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3081.722,3090.728,"May I ask one other question which was prompted by what Justice White asked you, the extent to which we should give deference to the Agency's construction of the statute."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,3109.308,3110.341,That is correct.
1984.83-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3110.341,3114.693,"--At least, we have a consistent agency interpretation of the Act."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,3114.693,3116.379,"Actually, no, we don't."
1984.83-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3157.787,3164.959,"Yes, but the Agency in '78, and the Agency since 1980 has taken the same view of the statute."
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,3164.959,3165.343,Yes.
1984.83-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3173.047,3176.934,I understand what you are saying.
1984.83-1013,1,23819,frances_dubrowski,,3176.934,3185.207,One other argument that EPA makes is that this variance is necessary to the rulemaking.
1984.83-1013,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3249.047,3250.982,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Alito?"
1984.83-1013,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3250.982,3252.515,I have no rebuttal.
1984.83-1013,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3252.515,3253.665,"Thank you, Counsel."
