1991.90-8370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.356,"We'll hear argument next in 90-8370, Teofilo Medina v. California."
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,75.111,81.765,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1991.90-8370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,92.714,97.056,xxx.
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,97.056,136.524,"--The question before the Court is whether in a situation after a trial court has found a bona fide doubt as to the defendant's capacity to proceed in a criminal matter, as to the defendant's capacity to cooperate rationally with counsel to understand the nature of the proceedings and the charges, whether, after that doubt has been declared, the State can, consistent with due process, put the burden on that individual whose competence is in question to prove incompetence by a preponderance and in that proceeding impose an evidentiary presumption of competence which is contained in a jury instruction."
1991.90-8370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,205.621,211.633,Would the burden of proof be satisfied if the Government proved by a preponderance?
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,211.633,221.426,"Our contention... is yes, Your Honor, that if the Government proved by a preponderance that the defendant is competent to stand trial, that... maybe I'm misunderstanding Your Honor's question."
1991.90-8370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,221.426,224.551,"Well, you would not insist on a higher standard of proof than a preponderance."
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,224.551,229.736,I submit that we do not need to go any farther than that in this case.
1991.90-8370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,229.736,241.418,I didn't ask you... do you think that a preponderance standard is constitutional if the Government undertook that?
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,241.418,244.605,"I would have to say yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-8370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,244.605,245.762,I'm glad.
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,245.762,287.526,"The difficulty with the resolution of those issues in this kind of case I think is dependent largely on psychiatric testimony, and I will try to discuss that in the context of the Mathews test in a moment, but as this Court has recognized in a number of cases that are cited in the briefs, those kinds of decisions are fraught with risk of error, and therefore although the preponderance standard is a low standard in which the burden... in which the risk of error is roughly evenly shared by the parties, we submit that that standard is the least that is constitutionally mandated."
1991.90-8370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.213,300.506,"Well, Mr. Pescetta, you're asking us to reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of California and presumably then the California courts would have to conduct a rehearing, a retrial, at least on this aspect of the case."
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,327.416,331.882,--Maybe I expressed myself ineptly.
1991.90-8370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,351.968,353.718,It's also the maximum.
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,353.718,359.45,"I submit that a State may impose a higher burden, but we are saying--"
1991.90-8370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,359.45,361.855,But if we're talking about the United States Constitution--
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,361.855,362.277,--Yes.
1991.90-8370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.055,372.741,--Why do you make that concession?
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,401.385,405.462,"I think that suspicion might be rational, Your Honor."
1991.90-8370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,543.204,547.078,"This is what, the Fourth Amendment now you're talking about?"
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,547.078,550.591,I'm simply talking about any constitutional protection.
1991.90-8370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,550.591,558.995,"Well, are you sure that you're... you mentioned Nix v. Williams, which I think is Fourth Amendment, Lego against Twomey, isn't that also Fourth Amendment?"
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,558.995,560.26,That's Fifth Amendment.
1991.90-8370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,560.26,563.54,"Yes, you've got two different constitutional provisions there."
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,563.54,566.445,"I agree, Your Honor, that those are different constitutional provisions."
1991.90-8370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,578.582,579.222,"Well, I wonder if you are justified."
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,600.729,603.009,"--Well, I may not be correct in every instance, Your Honor."
1991.90-8370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,631.84,637.026,But doesn't the history have a good deal to do with it of how that burden has been allocated historically?
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,637.026,638.744,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-8370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,662.986,667.357,Doesn't that suggest that perhaps the Constitution doesn't speak much to those questions?
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,667.357,670.371,"I don't agree, Your Honor."
1991.90-8370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,715.353,718.446,Have we ever applied Mathews in the criminal constitutional law field?
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,718.446,724.303,--In United States v. Raddatz and in Ake v. Oklahoma the Court did so.
1991.90-8370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,856.173,861.077,He could get to all the evidence that the State could get to.
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,868.464,870.621,The State has--
1991.90-8370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,870.621,873.838,"Do you think they could put his lawyer on the stand, the State?"
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,873.838,876.634,--That has been done.
1991.90-8370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,883.084,893.345,"Well, certainly you don't suggest that the State has access to more sources to prove competence than the defendant would have."
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,893.345,897.733,"--The State has the same access to evidence that the defense has, yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-8370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,897.733,900.826,So the defense has an equal ability to get it.
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,911.511,913.524,"I disagree, Your Honor."
1991.90-8370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.524,914.853,"Well, what about the lawyer?"
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,914.853,922.067,"The lawyer, his observations of the defendant's demeanor and mental state, they are available to the prosecution."
1991.90-8370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,930.486,939.374,"So they can take the lawyer and say what did he tell you and what did he say about this crime, or not?"
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,939.374,941.795,"--Well, in fact, that's what happened in this case."
1991.90-8370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,957.93,962.554,"Well, at least the defendant has equal access to information."
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,962.554,986.105,"--I would suggest, Your Honor, that equal access implies that the defendant, him or herself, does have control over the evidence of his or her mental state, and I submit that the problem in this case is precisely that the mental disorder that is the source of this competency proceeding--"
1991.90-8370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,986.105,993.291,"Well, perhaps if you say defendant, but suppose we talk about the defendant and the defendant's counsel, the defense team."
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1012.86,1015.579,"--Yes, Your Honor, but so does the State."
1991.90-8370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1045.925,1057.032,"Well, but the critical issue I take it... correct me if I'm wrong... is the ability of the defendant to cooperate with counsel in the presentation of the case."
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1057.032,1058.234,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-8370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1058.234,1059.656,Is that the ultimate legal--
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1059.656,1061.998,"--That's the ultimate test, and what we're arguing is--"
1991.90-8370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1061.998,1064.372,--Who would know that better than the attorney?
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1064.372,1070.167,"--Well, to the extent that the attorney knows it, I submit, that evidence is available to the State."
1991.90-8370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.396,1127.862,But it seems to me we have to look at the totality of the cases to which this rule you're urging upon us applies.
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1177.453,1186.401,"Well, Your Honor, the initial stage at which those cases are weeded out is the stage at which no bona fide doubt as to competence arises in the first instance."
1991.90-8370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1352.864,1356.769,Do you mean by that that at the end of the 40-some-odd days the person is found to be competent?
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1356.769,1391.755,"My understanding of that statistic is that 43 days is the average duration of the commitment, so that in an average of 43 days the defendant is returned to the Court as competent, and that's an average of cases in which the defendant is received at the facility and immediately turned around and returned to the Court as competent, and it includes cases in which there is a longer commitment when the State would suffer no harm to its interest because the defendant is in fact incompetent and it has taken whatever the amount of days it is to restore his competence."
1991.90-8370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1391.755,1404.391,"Is it clear both in this case and in the classic cases that we're considering that, if there is an erroneous determination of incompetence, that the defendant is held in custody until there is a second hearing on the issue?"
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1404.391,1409.701,California law provides for outpatient treatment in appropriate cases.
1991.90-8370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1415.246,1416.809,And what about this particular case?
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1416.809,1429.49,"In this particular case, Mr. Medina was incarcerated in the county jail prior to trial and he would have been incarcerated I am sure in Atascadero or Patton State Hospital, which are the normal places for commitment as incompetents."
1991.90-8370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.785,1476.034,"Well, you can say that about a lot of criminal rules."
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1500.304,1504.006,"I certainly do not suggest, Your Honor, that that is the only criterion."
1991.90-8370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1515.69,1539.228,"Counsel, are there things that the defendant's counsel is just inadequate to evaluate when he suspects that there may be a mental imbalance, and is that why it is not important or dispositive in your view that the defense counsel has real access to the defendant?"
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1546.193,1551.177,"Well, that's what the statute in California contemplates, is appointment of experts."
1991.90-8370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1609.419,1617.789,"It's probably hard for you to generalize, but in most of these cases are there standard tests that medical experts testify to?"
1991.90-8370,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1619.429,1625.583,"There is normally an... a... the experts normally give tests, if they can, to the defendant."
1991.90-8370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.559,1686.325,"Very well, Mr. Pescetta."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1688.341,1693.385,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-8370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1770.401,1775.774,You're suggesting that a defendant may not always welcome a determination of incompetency.
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1775.774,1780.179,"--Indeed, and that has been the case in some instances."
1991.90-8370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1815.916,1827.505,"Well, maybe we should put the burden on the defendant only when... put the burden on the State only when the defendant is seeking it and put the burden on the defendant when the State is seeking it, and vice versa."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1827.505,1832.393,"Well, Your Honor, admittedly that is a conceivable solution, but I can only emphasize that--"
1991.90-8370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.393,1832.783,Why not?
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1832.783,1837.376,--It's not incumbent upon California to adopt such a procedure.
1991.90-8370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1853.696,1867.004,"Of course, their argument as I understand it is you don't really lose the right; you merely delay its assertion for whatever time it takes to have a more accurate competency determination after he's in the institution for a while."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1867.004,1867.613,--Yes.
1991.90-8370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.728,1937.382,So what you're saying is that his 43-day figure really should be 90 days or 120 days.
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1937.382,1941.677,"Well, no, his 15-day figure should be 90 days or 4 months."
1991.90-8370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2006.058,2006.573,"Well, let me ask you this."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2018.91,2019.551,Absolutely not.
1991.90-8370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.414,2052.789,"No, but isn't there this different."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2078.746,2079.371,That's correct.
1991.90-8370,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2192.076,2199.291,"Your comment about less secure, does it apply to Federal prisons in your estimation?"
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2199.291,2201.947,"I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1991.90-8370,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2204.008,2210.038,I think it is incorrect as applied to Federal medical centers such as Springfield and Rochester and some of the others.
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2212.473,2219.532,"I don't know what the situation is, and again I'm not suggesting we don't have very secure facilities."
1991.90-8370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2303.029,2311.042,"Excuse me, could the defense attorney be required to provide that... I don't understand how a competency hearing would... is conducted."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2317.617,2323.147,--I would hesitate to characterize it as customary for the defense attorney to take the stand.
1991.90-8370,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2342.404,2347.059,Observations and impressions of the mental condition are not within the privilege?
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2347.059,2360.711,"Yes, and for example, petitioner suggested that the defense investigator testified, and he indicated that in his conversations with the defendant he wanted to talk of irrelevant subjects, and he was able to discuss what those irrelevant subjects were."
1991.90-8370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2400.944,2407.488,This burden of proof has been imposed on defendants in California for quite a while.
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2407.488,2409.221,"--Since 1917, Your Honor."
1991.90-8370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.221,2432.649,"Well, you would think that if the defendant has the burden to prove not only to come forward with some evidence but... the ultimate burden of proof, you would think that attorneys would play a major role in producing evidence of incompetency."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2439.021,2443.864,They certainly have an incentive to marshall that evidence.
1991.90-8370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.864,2444.941,"Well, do they appear a lot, or not?"
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2444.941,2446.488,It's not unprecedented.
1991.90-8370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2453.922,2456.672,"Well, they take the stand on the defendant's side of the case."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2456.672,2457.015,Yes.
1991.90-8370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.015,2461.435,"Yes, in furthering his claim of incompetency."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2461.435,2463.247,"Yes, exactly."
1991.90-8370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2465.792,2485.909,"I suppose if the lawyer takes the stand and testifies to the conduct of the defendant, I suppose he's subject to cross-examination to... in areas that he hasn't testified to."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2485.909,2497.125,"--Your Honor, he'd be subject to cross-examination, but it has not been resolved as to the intrusiveness into the actual attorney-client privilege."
1991.90-8370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2523.722,2537.061,"Why, because the... don't the California courts treat... if a defendant takes... if a defense lawyer takes the stand and testifies as to some aspects of competency, isn't the privilege waived across the board, or do they say no?"
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2537.061,2551.038,"I don't know that that has been precisely litigated, but I would suggest that there has been a distinction drawn between challenging the competency of your counsel and challenging the mental competency of the defendant."
1991.90-8370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2572.578,2575.842,"But you say that that has not been resolved, as the law presently stands in California."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2575.842,2578.294,"No, there has never been that specific question addressed."
1991.90-8370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2620.918,2623.198,Where did that reaffirmation occur?
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2623.198,2641.627,"--Your Honor, I rely heavily on Patterson v. New York, and particularly the language in Martin v. Ohio, which characterizes the strength of Patterson, which reiterates the opportunities that this Court has had to depart from Leland, and it has repeatedly declined to do so."
1991.90-8370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.592,2656.543,"But you don't think just Leland and the reaffirmation of it controls this case, do you?"
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2656.543,2660.369,Yes.
1991.90-8370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2661.276,2668.055,"Other than to support the notion that you should leave it to the State, but--"
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2668.055,2672.739,I think that we find support in that.
1991.90-8370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2808.747,2818.416,"--What it boils down to, as I understand it, you take the position that if the judge doesn't know, he just can't tell whether this man is competent or not, then he should make him stand trial."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2818.416,2821.679,"--Well, yes."
1991.90-8370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2826.568,2826.959,Yes.
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2826.959,2836.735,"But it's our position that if a defendant cannot convince 12 jurors that it's more likely he's incompetent than competent, indeed he should stand trial."
1991.90-8370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2858.93,2868.833,"No, but it would be the same, I suppose, if they had a hung jury and they deliberated for 14 days and they said we really can't tell, we can't return a verdict."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2871.722,2875.36,"Well, procedurally, if we had a hung jury in California we'd do it again."
1991.90-8370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2875.36,2876.282,"Oh, you do."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2876.282,2876.813,Yes.
1991.90-8370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2884.653,2896.649,"If the jury comes back with a verdict turning down the defendant's submission of incompetency, you don't really know whether the jury in the jury room said gee, this is a toss-up."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2901.445,2902.318,That's correct.
1991.90-8370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2903.724,2906.911,So you really don't know if they thought it was a tie.
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2906.911,2907.551,--That's correct.
1991.90-8370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2954.36,2957.608,"Based, for example, on his performance during trial?"
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2957.608,2958.53,--Yes.
1991.90-8370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2961.435,2963.278,Or outside of trial.
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2963.278,2964.121,--Absolutely.
1991.90-8370,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2986.847,2989.487,"Counsel, may I ask you just to go back to one issue?"
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,2998.856,3005.745,"It is definitely not of evidentiary value, and it is simply a restatement of the--"
1991.90-8370,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3005.745,3018.787,"I thought you were indicating that it was when you answered Justice White, or I think agreed with Justice White, that it might be that the... when the verdict comes back... the verdict of competence... that it reflects the presumption rather than mere equipoise."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,3018.787,3038.56,"--My reference was if the jury cannot resolve it and truly believes that the evidence is in equipoise the law instructs them that it is the defendants, or whoever is asserting incompetence, it is their burden, so by virtue of their failing to meet the burden, they are to return the competency finding."
1991.90-8370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3038.56,3040.418,Why do they instruct on the presumption?
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,3042.59,3046.603,"Well, it's in accord with the statutory language."
1991.90-8370,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3055.506,3058.208,"Well, are they... is the jury instructed on that?"
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,3058.208,3062.629,"The jury is instructed on very simple language, which indicates that--"
1991.90-8370,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3062.629,3068.564,"Well, does the simple language state what you just told me, that a presumption has no evidentiary force in California?"
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,3068.564,3072.141,"--They are not specifically told that it has an evidentiary force, but there's--"
1991.90-8370,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3072.141,3080.277,"Well, if they're not told that, don't you think that a normal juror would assume that the presumption, as in the instructions here, did carry some evidentiary force?"
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,3080.277,3085.025,"--No, I don't understand how a lay person would make such a judgment."
1991.90-8370,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3085.025,3089.617,Is that because you assume a lay person wouldn't understand what they were talking about in the first place?
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,3089.617,3096.598,"No, I don't think that they would... I don't think they would interpret the presumption of competency to have evidentiary value."
1991.90-8370,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3098.88,3124.947,"Well, why wouldn't the jurors... I mean, don't we assume that the jurors are going to be rationale at least to the extent of assuming that if they are instructed on a burden of proof, then are instructed on a presumption, that the probable inference is the presumption means something different from or in addition to the burden of proof, and if that's the case, isn't the juror going to say gee, if we're... if the see-saw is level, we better give effect to the presumption."
1991.90-8370,1,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,3124.947,3132.538,"--If that were the order in which they were instructed, I might agree, but here it states a criminal defendant is presumed to be mentally competent."
1991.90-8370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3188.937,3191.108,"Very well, Ms. Wilkens."
1991.90-8370,2,36447,michael_pescetta,,3193.904,3197.385,I'll try to talk fast.
1991.90-8370,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3222.25,3225.827,"On that point, has that been decided in California, or are you just saying that's the position you would take?"
1991.90-8370,2,36447,michael_pescetta,,3225.827,3232.434,"--Well, certainly that's true under Estelle v. Smith with respect to the confidentiality of the expert evaluations."
1991.90-8370,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3247.568,3256.16,"Yes, but it seems to me as a general rule counsel often could testify about demeanor and tone of voice and things like that without necessarily violating the privilege."
1991.90-8370,2,36447,michael_pescetta,,3257.736,3266.888,--But Your Honor the only way the inquiry starts is when counsel makes a representation about the substance of his communications.
1991.90-8370,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3273.011,3273.714,"--Well, that's not so, is it?"
1991.90-8370,2,36447,michael_pescetta,,3275.995,3283.398,"Well, yes, Your Honor, but that... to the extent that that's based on behavior, that demeanor evidence is equally available to the State."
1991.90-8370,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3294.425,3295.017,"Yes, but what if he doesn't invoke it?"
1991.90-8370,2,36447,michael_pescetta,,3299.392,3311.667,"My understanding of California law is that once the competency proceeding is initiated, the privileged... the privilege... the defendant's ability to invoke privileges is gone."
1991.90-8370,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3327.583,3327.864,"Thank you, Mr. Pescetta."
