2013.12-1315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.987,"We will hear argument next in Case 12-1315, Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer."
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,7.67,11.206,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,62.406,64.09,Let's -- Let's take your second point.
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,81.702,82.904,Yes.
2013.12-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,84.404,98.664,"So it seems to me there is nothing -- if -- if we adopted the position of the other side, there's nothing that would cause the statute of limitations to be frustrated."
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,98.664,105.15,"--This is not purely about the text, but about the background principle of equity that laches is."
2013.12-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,120.177,124.895,"Yes, but it continued to be used in equity, even when there were limitations period, didn't it."
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,128.513,131.465,"Not where there was a binding, a Federal one."
2013.12-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.171,143.023,"Well, it was Federal law."
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,145.323,152.645,"This was in the pre-Erie days where there was an understanding that there was a general Federal common law, an equity, that those cases were decided."
2013.12-1315,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,182.565,186.682,Should we see anything in the particular way this provision is worded?
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,202.792,203.978,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,204.444,204.961,It doesn't.
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,212.25,213.25,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,266.199,270.853,"Why, by the way -- I mean, I guess the ones that increase the statute of limitations, do they apply too?"
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,272.153,277.607,The timeliness doctrines of tolling and the discovery rule are distinguishable.
2013.12-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,304.074,308.793,"Can I just take exactly your words, and I fill in, instead of ‶ tolling ″, ‶ laches ″."
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,310.311,0.0,Tolling has always been used--
2013.12-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,313.013,313.797,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,317.165,317.699,--Right.
2013.12-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,317.699,320.284,Because the language sounds to me like the same.
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,334.359,339.412,"Well, first, briefly, Respondents concede there are no words in this Act that even give a toehold for laches."
2013.12-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.1,354.336,"But they originated in equity, just as laches did."
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,453.017,458.069,"--Yes, not only the words of Section 2072(b) that you may not"
2013.12-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.444,469.277,"But it says,"
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,486.839,497.896,--I point to this Court's having repeatedly rejected that extension in Mack and then Russell and Holmberg and Oneida and Merck just 4 years ago.
2013.12-1315,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,504.467,515.942,Could you -- do you have to accept Justice Scalia's premise that the Court in all areas is deprived of that right?
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,525.714,526.483,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,567.041,569.81,"You see, counselor, this is my problem."
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,634.919,636.121,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,673.929,674.529,Why?
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,685.285,694.409,"--We certainly agree that we're entitled to damages going forward, but we don't agree that that's exclusive because I -- I'd point to the Chief Justice's concurrence in the eBay case."
2013.12-1315,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,736.051,766.086,"Mr. Bibas, I would have thought that there was something in the copyright context that cuts against you, and that's that because of this separate accrual rule and the feature of these roll-in statutes of limitations combined with very, very lengthy copyrights terms, that essentially a plaintiff can not bring suit for years, decades and time the suit in order to maximize her own gain."
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,797.356,801.592,"Your Honor, I think your considerations cut in favor of our position."
2013.12-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,858.262,873.356,"Yeah, but the -- the mortgagor does -- does not invest substantial amounts of money the way MGM did here on the assumption that since suit hasn't been brought for 20 years, there's -- there's no valid claim."
2013.12-1315,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,900.233,907.737,"Under the Copyright Act, they are entitled to deduct all the expenses that are attributable to earning the profits from infringement."
2013.12-1315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,928.233,928.683,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,954.284,956.57,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1315,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1007.933,1010.451,On damages as well as injunctive relief?
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1013.803,1014.303,--Right.
2013.12-1315,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1027.23,1030.182,We don't make that distinction with respect to equitable tolling.
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1031.315,1033.634,"Well, because the history is different."
2013.12-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.493,1052.677,Why can't we change our mind?
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1052.677,1057.747,--Because this is a statutory claim that -- and a statute of limitations that Congress put in place.
2013.12-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1068.621,1081.179,"And you say that none of the other instances in which we brought into law equitable doctrines, none of those were applied with respect to a prior enacted Federal statute?"
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1082.862,1083.298,No.
2013.12-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1083.298,1084.564,I'll have to look it up.
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1084.564,1085.214,Right.
2013.12-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1094.487,1099.058,"There was a long history that tolling didn't apply of law, and then we changed our mind."
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1099.058,1099.408,--Right.
2013.12-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1099.791,1104.712,And you're saying we -- we never changed our mind where there was a statute of -- Federal statute of limitations?
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1105.845,1113.15,"--I'm saying that in the laches context, we are not aware of any instances in which this Court has used laches to bar a claim at law--"
2013.12-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1113.15,1120.137,"That's not surprising, because to show laches, you have to show unreasonable delay plus reliance."
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1182.295,1184.164,"--Well, two -- two responses to that."
2013.12-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1192.769,1193.669,I understand the words.
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1197.737,1198.121,Yes.
2013.12-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1198.121,1215.433,"--once you have given them the right to apply laches to an injunction, you have given them precisely nothing, because exactly the same thing will happen to them once you bring 15 legal actions, as if you gave them the injunction."
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1223.205,1223.789,Okay.
2013.12-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1257.878,1259.595,You still haven't answered my question--
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1259.595,1260.262,--I'm trying to.
2013.12-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1260.262,1261.947,--which comes to the same thing.
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1284.945,1289.164,"Well, that's what I'm trying to say is that I don't think that that would be the case if infringement were shown."
2013.12-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1319.618,1328.641,Did that equitable remedy overrule the statement that you're entitled to sue for all the profits within that 3-year period?
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1333.51,1335.878,"--Well, these are two different remedies."
2013.12-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1337.164,1339.93,"I understand that, but does the second eliminate the first?"
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1344.168,1348.12,--I think that both are susceptible to the Court's equitable consideration.
2013.12-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1356.791,1360.779,"Well, then, you said both are subject to equitable consideration."
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1390.799,1391.599,Right.
2013.12-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1401.737,1405.141,But suppose sitting on your rights amounted really to an affirmative representation.
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1416.764,1424.87,"--Well, you're right that laches can -- is a cousin of equitable estoppel and that it's right that equitable estoppel could bar the claim entirely."
2013.12-1315,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1466.68,1480.289,"Ms. Saharsky, this -- before you sit down, there's one puzzle I'd like you to address for us, and that is your position is damages within the 3 years, okay."
2013.12-1315,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1529.372,1531.372,--You're right that there is that difference.
2013.12-1315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1568.697,1569.114,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1576.686,1579.638,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1651.299,1654.767,"Counsel, how do you deal with the language in Holmberg, Mack, and Russell?"
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1654.767,1655.267,--Your Honor--
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1655.267,1670.193,"Then you're after -- I've looked at that, not myself, but my law clerk, looked at all of the cases and they are absolutely right that in every case we've applied laches, it's only where there's not been an underlying statute of limitations."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1677.032,1679.349,"--Justice Sotomayor, let me answer that in two steps."
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1695.978,1697.128,They lost there.
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1697.128,1697.963,--I'm sorry?
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1697.963,1700.397,They didn't apply laches there.
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1700.397,1704.016,"Your Honor, this Court said that laches was available five times."
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1704.016,1708.134,"But the facts didn't support that, meaning that they didn't grant such."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1708.134,1708.684,"It wasn't raised, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1855.527,1868.019,"‶ Bizarre ″ seems to me a little strong, because I take it that Mr. Bibas is making a statutory argument -- I mean, he's saying not the language of the statute, but he's saying what was Congress thinking at the time."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1907.811,1916.517,"Justice Kagan, the Congress cited Holmberg which cites Patterson as the leading laches case, and cites Russell as well, and Patterson dealt with this very point."
2013.12-1315,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.369,1918.935,Excuse me.
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1920.219,1920.737,--I'm sorry.
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1960.662,1971.753,"It is true, however, that your -- while your -- all of your investment in this is going to be offset against your profits, correct?"
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1971.753,1973.57,"--That is not exactly clear, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1992.081,1994.183,What's so bad about that?
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1994.183,1995.066,"--Because, Your Honor--"
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1995.066,2002.939,"Why should you -- you've gotten a lot of profits in those 18 years and, in fact, at one point when she did reach out to you, you told her,"
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2006.241,2009.943,"--Your Honor, on a net basis, the film still has never made a profit for when--"
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2009.943,2012.845,"Well, if it has not, then we're back to the point I made."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2023.535,2024.804,"--Two answers, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2044.949,2045.366,I don't understand.
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2048.92,2051.955,"Because, Your Honor, we sent -- she made a demand which we refused."
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2134.523,2138.494,"Counsel, she was going to get this copyright when her father died."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2147.13,2148.765,"You're absolutely right, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2148.765,2150.467,Your complaint is not against the witness dying.
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2165.577,2167.643,"Justice Sotomayor, she still has her copyright."
2013.12-1315,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2239.191,2243.16,The Ninth Circuit here used this language of presumption.
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2257.32,2257.87,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2257.87,2260.272,Do you concede that that presumption is wrong?
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2260.272,2260.839,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2266.175,2272.162,"Well, that's one -- you know, one understanding of the opinion is, Look, that's just nothing."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2274.062,2280.435,"--This Court, Justice Kagan, in the Foster vs. Mansfield case in 1892 said -- and I quote -- after ten years, quote,"
2013.12-1315,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2328.583,2339.891,"Well, I guess partly that suggests a burden of persuasion, but partly it suggests just a kind of starting position is that if there was conduct outside the limitations period it was prejudicial."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2342.426,2356.483,"Your Honor, I think it's -- there's a common sense concept that if you are within -- if the claim were brought within the initial three-year period, after the claim first accrued in 1991, you might say colloquially that there's a presumption that laches doesn't apply."
2013.12-1315,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2381.218,2394.441,One can agree with that and not think that if conduct happened three years and two days earlier that the burden of coming forward and the necessity to give a reason flips to the other side.
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2394.441,2395.477,"I agree with that, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2444.475,2487.385,"Mr. Perry, you said that the objective is to get the copyright holder to sue early on and not to wait, but if no profits had been made in that early period and it would cost the plaintiff more to mount a lawsuit then the plaintiff could possibly receive in damages, why should the plaintiff, who has a copyright that's going to run a long, long time sue?"
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2497.609,2517.321,"Justice Ginsburg, that's why Congress put in the statutory damages and also an attorneys' fee provision, so even if there are no profits, and many works of authorship never become profitable, there is an incentive, an economic incentive for the rights asserter to come forward to court and clarify those rights, because these are valuable assets."
2013.12-1315,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2543.62,2562.8,"I take it in the example that Justice Ginsburg gave, your position -- tell me if I'm wrong -- is of course the defense laches in principle applies, but the defendant will lose because the plaintiff did not wait an unreasonably long time."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2562.8,2563.217,--Yes.
2013.12-1315,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2563.217,2567.669,"She waited a reasonably long time, for the reason that Justice Ginsburg gave."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2567.669,2568.537,"Justice Breyer, thank you."
2013.12-1315,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2570.487,2572.337,I thought you might agree.
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2573.137,2577.741,-- in this case between the availability of laches and the applicability of laches.
2013.12-1315,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2589.763,2599.186,"Well, that may just mean, you know, where it is a defense, it is an affirmative defense that has to be treated the way Rule 8(c) says."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2630.657,2632.525,"--The latter, Your Honor, for three reasons."
2013.12-1315,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2652.17,2655.807,"They had been used in law before, before the rules--"
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2655.807,2659.592,"I don't believe unclean hands ever had been before Precision Instruments, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2709.692,2723.666,"If we search every Federal -- every reported Federal decision since 1938, how many would we find in which the Court recognized the available laches as a defense to a claim for legal relief?"
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2723.666,2727.118,"--In this Court, Your Honor, you would find the Morgan case."
2013.12-1315,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2753.451,2755.068,Is your argument limited to that?
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2760.939,2762.207,"Yes, Your Honor, absolutely."
2013.12-1315,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2789.006,2793.993,Can you tell us in response to Justice Alito's second part of his question about the other cases?
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2799.295,2799.811,"Yes, sir."
2013.12-1315,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2860.936,2876.379,"--Assume -- assume we have an interest, just assume we do, in not having too many suits simply to protect your rights in cases where the copyright may not be worth much or may not be well established."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2881.515,2886.003,"So our rule, the availability of laches, has been the rule since the 19th Century."
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2898.077,2911.552,"That is true about the Ninth Circuit, but between the Second, Sixth, Tenth and Eleventh, I always -- I thought those circuits announced laches are available, but only in an exceptional circumstance."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2921.426,2924.211,"--Justice Sotomayor, we agree it's an exceptional circumstance."
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2925.611,2927.08,Just answer.
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2930.548,2931.032,--Sure.
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2936.952,2938.721,An injunction but not the suit completely?
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2938.721,2941.504,--I don't remember actually.
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2945.042,2946.808,The Ninth Circuit I know--
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2946.808,2948.244,"And this Court, of course--"
2013.12-1315,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2948.244,2950.862,Could you finish answering my question?
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2950.862,2951.179,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.868,3067.601,--Did not dispute what?
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3067.601,3072.105,"--That if laches was available, it bars the entire suit, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3072.105,3090.15,"Mr. Perry, what troubles me a bit about your argument is I think the dearth of cases on this is probably explainable by the fact that people just haven't thought that they had a laches defense when a plaintiff brought a suit within a statute of limitations period."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3104.409,3106.861,"Your Honor, let me answer in two steps."
2013.12-1315,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3120.669,3123.335,Why should it be different from the patent case.
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3123.335,3125.304,"Your Honor, we don't think it should be different than the patent case."
2013.12-1315,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3128.489,3131.625,So you think the Federal circuit's decisions are wrong?
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3131.625,3136.679,"To the extent it says that there's a categorical bar on applying laches to injunctions, they can't be right."
2013.12-1315,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3169.4,3175.32,But you've said -- I think you've said that -- that it would apply to ordinary statute of limitations.
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3185.259,3185.944,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3186.961,3193.698,I -- I share Justice Kagan's reservation about that.
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3196.3,3199.169,"--Your Honor, it's an equitable doctrine, and of course it can be adjusted."
2013.12-1315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3272.133,3276.002,Does the laches defense bar everything in the future?
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3279.304,3280.073,Your Honor--
2013.12-1315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3280.073,3287.493,"To the extent your concern is reliance, okay, wait until the reliance is, you know, off -- off the table."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3288.827,3296.099,--We -- we think it bars her claim against MGM to renegotiate this contract because of those unique sequence of events.
2013.12-1315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3319.198,3319.848,"Well, not just injunctions."
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3334.374,3335.591,--So here's where film is different.
2013.12-1315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3371.264,3373.249,--How about your creation of another derivative work?
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3373.249,3380.689,"--Your Honor, I believe if -- if these studios -- well, first of all, if somebody else re-created a different derivative work, this case doesn't bar her at all."
2013.12-1315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3387.642,3389.894,Briefly.
2013.12-1315,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3389.894,3390.544,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2013.12-1315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3405.137,3406.054,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1315,3,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3407.856,3409.722,"Thank you, Your Honor."
