1983.83-346,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,2.683,We'll hear arguments first this morning in United States against Yermian.
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,7.57,11.974,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,157.535,160.57,"May I ask right there, what about the work sheet?"
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,163.272,169.026,"Well, I think the matter within the jurisdiction was the entire security clearance process."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,169.026,170.143,So the work sheet would be part of it?
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,170.143,178.282,"The work sheet was part of that process, and it was really a preparation for the final sheet that was typed up and sent in."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,178.282,180.068,So you could have indicted him on the basis of the work sheet?
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,180.068,187.971,"Well, I think that depends on whether the security clearance process worked its way through."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,193.875,202.647,"Well, suppose the employer had just forwarded the work sheet without having the supplemental document which had on its face the evidence about the security clearance?"
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,202.647,208.135,"Well, I would note preliminarily that the work sheet did have some indications that it--"
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,208.135,208.901,"Well, suppose it had none."
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,208.901,209.501,--was a government document on it.
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,209.501,211.253,"Suppose it had none, to get my hypothetical."
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,211.253,222.793,"Well, if it hadn't had anything on it, I think it would... and it were forwarded, I think it would depend on whether the information initially had been requested in connection with the government security clearance."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,222.793,223.145,Supposing it was.
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,229.881,239.67,"Well, I think if the employer had requested the information and requested that the work sheet be filled out for the purpose of forwarding it to the Department of Defense, it would be--"
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,239.67,240.606,Without telling the employee?
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,240.606,241.972,--That's correct.
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,246.593,251.295,So that the employee could be liable under the statute without having any knowledge of federal involvement?
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,251.295,258.901,"Yes, that is our position, that Congress did not intend that the government prove knowledge of federal involvement in a case like this."
1983.83-346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,395.772,407.247,"Ms. Corwin, does the government agree that the shifting of the language in the 1948 revision was not intended to achieve any substantive result?"
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,407.247,411.382,"Yes, and indeed this Court has suggested it wasn't intended."
1983.83-346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,415.936,423.69,Before '48 the language wasn't quite as favorable to this particular part of your argument as it is now.
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,423.69,443.003,"Well, I'm not sure that that is quite so, although I would not preliminarily that we ought to give some credit to the fact that in 1948 Congress thought it was clarifying an ambiguity; and to the extent that it was attempting to do that I think we ought to read today's statute rather than the older one."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,605.376,612.963,Do we have any cases in which a defendant has been held criminally liable without having any knowledge that what he was doing might be a crime?
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,635.395,647.369,"I think that something such as the hypothetical you're suggesting may well not violate the statute, although I don't want to take a position on that particular Mike Royko incident."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.616,672.001,"It's a deliberate lie, I'm assuming, a deliberate misstatement of how a person voted."
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,679.59,700.921,"--Well, I would suggest that the element of willfulness which is on the face of the statute requires some sort of conscious wrongdoing, and I think the individual who engages in the sort of private conversation or perhaps a conversation in which he doesn't expect that anyone is going to rely in any meaningful way on what he says--"
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.921,705.223,"But the real question, does it require knowledge of anything other than willful falsity?"
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,705.223,709.193,"--Well, I think not."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,714.495,714.93,Right.
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,714.93,725.803,"And you also... the government also must prove it's in a matter within federal agency jurisdiction, as well as being in many cases material to the functions of the government."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,725.803,726.405,Correct.
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,726.405,736.277,"And I suggest that maybe some of those elements are going to exclude the sort of hypotheticals that you've suggested, and particularly the sort of hypotheticals that Respondent has posed."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,736.277,745.117,"Well, I assume FBI agents frequently interrogate people without disclosing their identity, and they're engaged in very important federal work."
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,745.117,770.415,"Well, that's indeed true, and I suggest that perhaps in a different setting, if the FBI agent were working undercover in a business perhaps, you might have a situation in which you would have something you could call willful conduct, something that would very likely violate the state criminal statute of, say, false pretenses, and there you might have coverage because the conduct was willful."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,777.854,781.04,"I agree with those hypotheticals, with your view on those hypotheticals."
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,789.645,792.013,"--Well, I'm just not sure that's true."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,802.703,804.405,"Well, what is willfulness other than knowing falsity?"
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,808.623,823.45,"Well, of course, the statute says ""knowingly and willfully"", and I think that the element of conscious wrongdoing is something that may well exclude this private casual conversation between neighbors, in which you never anticipate that anyone's going to--"
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.45,836.042,"How about an application for employment form without knowing... assume the government required all employment application forms to be screened for security purposes at some defense plant or something, without telling the people."
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,841.53,847.767,"--I think that if one could prove all the other elements of the statute that, yes, that would be a crime."
1983.83-346,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,863.777,871.132,"But Ms. Corwin, doesn't everyone know that assaulting someone is going to be a criminal offense?"
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,878.136,892.729,"Well, that may be, but I think that in many cases people who make false statements, particularly in a context such as that of Respondent, they are certainly going to know that their conduct is wrongful."
1983.83-346,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,979.383,1002.682,"Well, Ms. Corwin, in this particular case I suppose that the evidence available here, the document in question which was signed by the Respondent here, is evidence of knowledge, and so if knowledge is required presumably the government could go to trial with the same proof it had."
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1016.775,1027.4,"Well, I think that's right, and it is certainly conceivable that on a remand that we would prevail in this case on the basis of that sort of evidence."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1237.569,1257.198,"Well, there's another example you suggested on page 30 of your brief, on the information gathering function in connection with the NRA in the hot oil cases, where you mention that people might send information in to the central information gatherer, who in turn would forward it to the government, and they would not know it was going to be used for a government purpose."
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1270.356,1275.993,"Well, I'm not sure that's precisely right in the hot oil context."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.115,1288.05,"Well, in that particular case that's right."
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1299.358,1305.445,"--Well, I think that's right, but I think Congress had in mind that sort of interference with federal functions."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1305.445,1310.833,Even though the businessman had no knowledge that there would be any federal use of the information?
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1310.833,1312.533,"Well, I think that's correct."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1350.974,1359.23,"Oh, I agree with you in that particular program that people should have been aware they were violating some state rules, if not the federal rule."
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1380.51,1382.945,"Well, I suppose that's possible."
1983.83-346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1419.018,1422.922,"Well, they have to prove two things: federal involvement and knowledge of falsity."
1983.83-346,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1424.606,1429.426,"Well, many courts have... well, the willfulness is separate."
1983.83-346,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1494.768,1503.374,Mr. Hillman.
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,1503.374,1508.778,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.83-346,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1544.265,1553.871,"Well, isn't there an answer to that, that it's none of the government's business how a person votes, and it washes out all of Mr. Royko's concerns?"
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,1562.977,1574.301,I think that such a question could arise during the questioning by a federal election official who was there to ensure the integrity of the voting process.
1983.83-346,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1580.272,1584.49,What would that do to our traditional secrecy of the ballot?
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,1584.49,1590.58,"--Well, supposing the federal official was acting improperly."
1983.83-346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1600.952,1607.006,Wouldn't the defendant be protected in your example by the requirement of materiality?
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,1607.006,1614.093,--The requirement of materiality may not be enough.
1983.83-346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1709.407,1714.744,"Mr. Hillman, the government's cert petition does not raise a question about the form of the instruction as I read it."
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,1721.131,1733.438,"--The government does argue, Your Honor, that even if our position is correct, that the jury instruction cured any error, and we believe that that is incorrect because it was an ambiguously worded--"
1983.83-346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1733.438,1735.307,"Yes, but they didn't preserve that question, is all I'm saying."
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,1735.307,1736.324,--All right.
1983.83-346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1736.324,1738.176,And they're seeking reversal.
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2130.83,2133.882,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.882,2135.4,Is it in the joint appendix?
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2135.4,2137.769,"Yes, it is, on page 49."
1983.83-346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2137.769,2139.169,39?
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2139.169,2139.919,"49, Your Honor."
1983.83-346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.919,2140.887,49.
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2164.087,2166.52,Knowledge of federal involvement.
1983.83-346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2166.52,2167.622,What does that mean?
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2167.622,2181.798,"Knowledge that the statement is within federal jurisdiction, that it is destined for a federal agency, that there is some material legitimate concern on behalf of a federal agency."
1983.83-346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2181.798,2203.045,"So do you agree that if you have a knock on your door at home and the gentleman there identifies himself as an FBI agent, saying he's investigating a murder in the neighborhood or something... does it violate 1001 for you to lie to him?"
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2203.045,2203.878,Of course.
1983.83-346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.532,2220.856,"That's all you really need as far as you're concerned, is just some knowledge that that statement is relevant to some official business of the government?"
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2220.856,2221.456,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2223.556,2227.074,"Mr. Hillman, you don't want to concede any other people's cases, do you?"
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2228.86,2230.645,"--No, sir."
1983.83-346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.645,2243.236,But you don't... didn't you request an instruction that the government had to prove an intent to defraud the government?
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2243.236,2244.82,I'm sorry?
1983.83-346,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2244.82,2249.106,Didn't you request an instruction that--
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2249.106,2251.641,No.
1983.83-346,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2378.741,2381.443,"--Well, this man knew he was lying, didn't he?"
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2381.443,2382.726,"--Yes, he did."
1983.83-346,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2382.726,2384.892,"Well, I don't know what this argument's going to help him."
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2384.892,2386.344,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1983.83-346,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2386.344,2388.796,I don't see how this argument helps that point.
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2388.796,2390.946,"My point, Your Honor, is simply--"
1983.83-346,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2390.946,2393.765,I thought it's admitted he deliberately lied and meant to do it.
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2393.765,2395.284,"--Yes, and he was subject to state--"
1983.83-346,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2395.284,2395.967,Is that not the case?
1983.83-346,1,41455,stephen_j_hillman,,2395.967,2398.502,--He was subject to state penalties.
1983.83-346,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2487.31,2488.394,Very well.
1983.83-346,2,18633,carolyn_corwin,,2491.095,2494.113,Just a brief response.
1983.83-346,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2539.178,2541.578,"Well, ordinarily that isn't the case, Ms. Corwin."
1983.83-346,2,18633,carolyn_corwin,,2551.902,2569.863,"--Well, but I'm suggesting that in this context of false statements a person's state of mind would be affected by whether he expected that the context in which he was speaking would induce someone else to rely to their detriment or to give him a benefit based on what he was saying."
1983.83-346,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.313,2596.531,Let's just look at the question.
1983.83-346,2,18633,carolyn_corwin,,2604.954,2619.046,"Well, I simply suggest that perhaps in looking at what ""knew"" means in that question, it may be appropriate to stop short of actual knowledge if the Court concludes that our initial position is incorrect."
1983.83-346,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2747.444,2749.229,"Thank you, counsel."
