2017.16-961,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.095,11.8,"We'll hear argument next in Case 16-961, Dalmazzi versus United States, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Vladeck. (Laughter.)"
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,11.8,84.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At the heart of these complicated cases is the simple and well-settled distinction between federal officers who are appointed to a second office and those who have been assigned to exercise additional duties germane to their original appointment who hold one office, not two. The dual office-holding ban incorporates this distinction, prohibiting active-duty military officers from holding a second office that requires nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate absent express congressional authorization, while generally allowing military officers to be assigned to exercise the duties of such positions. That's why when the four judges at issue here began to serve as appointed judges on the CMCR, the Court of Military Commission Review, it violated the dual office-holding ban and disqualified them from hearing the Petitioners' appeals. Congress created the Court of Military Commission Review in 2006 as part of the Military Commissions Act, and the initial plan for the CMCR was modeled very much on the then-existing courts of criminal appeals in the court-martial system, right down to how the judges were to be selected."
2017.16-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,153.43,153.7,So are you --
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,153.7,154.03,-- on the CCA.
2017.16-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,154.03,184.865,"-- saying it was the suggestion of the D.C. Circuit that the constitutional problem would be cured by appointing these judges to the CMCR, that gave you the basis for your lawsuit? In other words, when Congress said it authorized CCA judges to serve on the CMCR and said the Secretary of Defense may assign persons who hold military positions, you had no case, right?"
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,184.865,204.705,"We certainly would have no case under the dual office-holding ban, Justice Ginsburg, for the simple reason that when military officers are assigned, whether to the CCAs or to the CMCR, they don't hold a second office in the first place. There, of course, was the Appointments Clause challenge to those assignments, but, yes, there would be no problem under this statute in that circumstance."
2017.16-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,204.705,222.985,"And you say the consequence now, because they are appointed rather than assigned, is that they not only can no longer serve on the CMCR, but they're out of the service entirely."
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,238.31,248.93,"So just to clarify, they can still serve on the CMCR, right, that we are not challenging the appointments to the CMCR. Our argument is simply that that converted these officers into civilians. But to Justice --"
2017.16-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,248.93,253.985,And -- but you are saying that how -- you -- they would have to be civilians on the CMCR.
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,253.985,254.97,That's correct.
2017.16-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,254.97,260.03,"Because you say they -- they lose their military -- and to be civilians, they'd have to be reappointed."
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,260.03,268.42,"So we don't -- we don't dispute that it is a severe consequence, Justice Ginsburg, but we would just suggest that it was the consequence Congress wrote into the statute in 1870."
2017.16-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,279.35,289.83,What about the -- the idea of fair notice to people who have devoted their lives to military service and then are told you're out?
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,289.83,299.64,"There's no question, of course, that Congress could make these officers whole if there is any regard in which this action led to the deprivation of benefits. But, of course, this has happened before."
2017.16-961,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,318.66,344.725,"Well, what do you -- what do you make -- what do you do about the fact that in 1983 Congress eliminated the part of 973 that said that an officer is automatically terminated if the officer accepts a covered civil office? And what about the savings clause, which says that nothing in Section 973(b) shall be construed to invalidate any action undertaken by an officer in furtherance of assigned official duties?"
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,344.725,350.63,"So I think the -- the answer to both questions, Justice Alito, depends upon placing the 1983 amendments in context."
2017.16-961,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,371.48,377.65,"We can accept that that might have been the purpose of the statute, but what do we do with the text, I think is what Justice Alito is getting at."
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,377.65,399.035,"I totally -- and -- and if you'll bear with me, I'm -- I'm hoping to get there, Justice Gorsuch. So the -- the point of the statute was to basically say these assignments are not, in fact, a problem under the dual office-holding ban because they're not reflecting a military officer holding two offices; that, in fact, the pre-1983 statute had been construed by the Justice Department perhaps over-broadly."
2017.16-961,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,409.24,409.67,Got it.
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,411.33,413.61,"So there's no text, of course, on termination."
2017.16-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,462.78,478.74,"So what do we make of the words ""except as otherwise authorized by law""? It seemed to me that what was the purpose of the automatic termination were people who were running for public office without authority by law."
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,485.39,494.155,"So I think -- I mean, a good example, there are, of course, examples where Congress has expressly authorized military officers to hold a second, even civil office."
2017.16-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,508.755,509.28,I'm sorry.
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,510.1,589.36,"There is a special -- a separate section, I believe it's 10 U.S.C. Section 528, Justice Sotomayor, where Congress has said that the CIA director may be a military officer, without any consequence inuring to his military service, without losing his commission, without losing benefits, without losing rank or pay or anything else. The government argues here that the Military Commissions Act itself provides comparable authorization, that Congress when it allowed military officers to be assigned to the CMCR was showing similar approval. And, frankly, again, I think that misstates the distinction between being assigned to exercise additional duties, Congress clearly did authorize military officers to be assigned additional duties as CMCR judges, and being appointed to a second office. There's no language in the Military Commissions Act, especially the provision that refers to the appointment of additional judges, that's Section 950f(b)(3) -- and I apologize for the number of section numbers and acronyms -- there's no language in that provision, Justice Sotomayor, that comes anywhere near suggesting that in 2009 Congress was thinking about military officers when it created this separate appointed office that it was allowing additional judges to hold."
2017.16-961,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,589.36,629.45,"What about 9 -- what about -- I mean, there are a lot of statutory hurdles you've got to get over. What about 973(d), which delegated to the Secretary of Defense the authority to prescribe regulations to implement the ban on dual office holding, and the Secretary has said in regulations that, under -- the ""actions undertaken by a member in carrying out assigned military duties shall be invalidated solely by"" -- by virtue of such member ""having held or exercised the function of a civil office in violation of the prohibitions"" of 973(b)."
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,629.45,633.28,So I -- I think -- I thank you for pointing out the directive.
2017.16-961,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,650.62,651.68,"Where is this, I'm sorry?"
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,651.68,701.725,"I'm sorry, it's pages 18a and 19a of the blue brief in the appendix. The directive was the Secretary's response to the provision Justice Alito cited, to Section 973(d), which delegated to the Secretary of Defense the power to promulgate regulations to enforce Section 973. And, Justice Alito, I think it's telling that the Secretary's response, and this is page 18a of the blue brief -- was to delineate eight specific categories of cases where termination of the officer's military status was not to be the consequence, basically reflecting the Vietnam era concerns that the government raised in its brief, identifying circumstances where the -- the remedy for a violation of the statute was not going to be forfeiture of military office. What -- I'm sorry."
2017.16-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,701.725,708.34,Why -- I'm just curious why -- why is this a civil office? This thing is -- can you hear me?
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,708.34,708.61,I can.
2017.16-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,712.7,714.21,"Well, go ahead and finish that first."
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,714.21,761.25,"So, Justice Alito, as we say in our reply brief, it would have made no sense, there would have been no need for the Secretary to identify the eight circumstances in which a military officer was not going to have to surrender his military office, if the 1983 statute did, in fact, as the government argues, categorically eliminate termination as a consequence. If I might turn to Justice Breyer's question, with regard to civil office, for us, of course, the key to concluding that an appointed judge on the Court of Military Commission Review holds a civil office is the fact that Congress has created the office by statute, that it exercises the sovereign authority of the United States, and that it can be held and, indeed, is held by civilians. That is in contrast to the --"
2017.16-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,761.25,766.005,"Why -- why is that? I mean, after all, Congress creates the military by statute."
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,796.375,796.62,So --
2017.16-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,796.62,803.445,"I mean, except the fact you mentioned, it's of course true, it is of course true, that there is one civilian on it or two or three."
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,812.68,816.6,"Well, I would start -- I would start, Justice Breyer, with the government's definition of what a military office is."
2017.16-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,881.89,885.37,"In the Civil War, I think you had military commissions, didn't you?"
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,885.37,887.14,"There were military commissions, Justice Breyer."
2017.16-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,889.88,893.36,So you want us to distinguish between appeal and just carrying out a trial?
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,893.36,900.42,"Well, I think -- I think the distinction is structural, Justice Breyer. So a military commission, like a court-martial, is not a stand-in court."
2017.16-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,977.52,994.01,"Is there anything incompatible about serving on a CCA, which deals with ordinary court-martials, and service on the CMCR, which deals with enemy combatants?"
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,994.01,1007.57,"So, I mean, certainly, Justice Ginsburg, we think there's first, of course, statutory incompatibility, that the dual office holding ban, if read correctly, creates a statutory incompatibility where any functional incompatibility is actually a secondary consideration."
2017.16-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1007.57,1009.1,But is there any functional?
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1009.1,1010.65,So we -- we suggest that there is.
2017.16-961,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1044.43,1050.88,"What is the big deal, though? What is the big problem with being a principal officer in one context and an inferior officer in the other?"
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1050.88,1051.37,There's no default --
2017.16-961,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1051.37,1054.915,It's not like you're branded one or the other and you carry it around with you wherever you go.
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1054.915,1056.31,"No, of course not, Mr. Chief Justice."
2017.16-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1094.545,1102.42,"Mr. Vladeck, you didn't raise the amici's point, but what position do you take with respect to that point?"
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1102.42,1102.875,So --
2017.16-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1102.875,1106.385,I know you don't -- I know you don't want to be non-suited --
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1106.385,1106.62,"No, no."
2017.16-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1106.62,1115.56,-- but -- but I trust -- I trust your independent judgment that you'll give us your views on that presented question.
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1115.56,1118.48,And -- and I'm mindful that my federal courts class begins tomorrow. So --
2017.16-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1118.48,1118.69,Yes.
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1118.69,1165.84,"-- the -- the -- with regard to the amicus's point about constitutional appellate jurisdiction, I think it's worth starting from this Court's decision in United States versus Coe, which, frankly, I did not know about before this case. Coe is an 1894 decision which we cite, which the government cites in its brief, where this Court expressly upheld its appellate jurisdiction from the Article I Court of Public Land Claims. And the -- the government -- I'm sorry, the -- the appellant in error in that case moved to dismiss the case in the Supreme Court on the ground that this Court lacked constitutional appellate jurisdiction because the relief that the government was seeking in that case was tantamount to what it had sought in Marbury. And this Court expressly rejected that argument."
2017.16-961,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1183.49,1187.035,How -- how is that different from the National Labor Relations Board or the SEC?
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1187.035,1195.125,"So, Justice Kennedy, I think there are a couple of differences. First, of course, Congress has never purported to describe the NLRB or the SEC as a court."
2017.16-961,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1195.54,1196.945,It's just labels we're talking about?
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1196.945,1197.25,No.
2017.16-961,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1218.41,1222.99,"You mean the NLRB doesn't exist -- if there's a vacancy, there's no NLRB anymore?"
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1222.99,1250.19,"If it's inchoate, it's quite possible that the NLRB would not be able to hand down decisions. But, Justice Kennedy, the larger point is we don't think this Court needs to reach what is obviously the much harder question of direct appellate jurisdiction over adjudicative proceedings by an agency here because here, unlike in the NLRB and SEC cases, you have Congress creating a court of record, a court of record, mind you, that is capable of dispensing capital punishment."
2017.16-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1252.315,1253.75,"Yeah, but that isn't the issue."
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1330.035,1335.125,"So, again, I -- first of all, let me take those in order if I might, Justice Breyer."
2017.16-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1335.125,1338.33,It's one question. (Laughter.)
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1338.33,1342.645,"Indeed, although I hope you'll indulge me in multiple sentences. (Laughter.)"
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1342.645,1358.75,"The -- the -- with regard to the territorial point, I think it's worth reminding this Court of its decision in Palmore, where Justice White went out of his way to uphold jurisdiction over the D.C. Court of Appeals because the territorial courts looked like military courts."
2017.16-961,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1416.29,1417.04,Does the President --
2017.16-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1417.04,1421.235,"I thought the court of record was a court -- for years, I must have been under a misapprehension."
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1443.67,1447.935,"I'm -- I'm fairly sure, Justice Breyer, that the circuit courts are also courts of record."
2017.16-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1447.935,1448.455,Because?
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1448.455,1453.8,"Because they are standard tribunals that produce records, that produce transcripts, that produce proceedings --"
2017.16-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1453.8,1453.91,Okay.
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1453.91,1455.17,-- independent of the participants.
2017.16-961,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1455.17,1455.945,And judgments.
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1455.945,1456.89,And judgments.
2017.16-961,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1490.44,1498.03999995,Do you think Marbury versus Madison is right? (Laughter.)
2017.16-961,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1498.03999995,1505.145,Particularly as to the interpretation with such exceptions as Congress may make.
2017.16-961,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1505.145,1520.63,"So, I will confess, Justice Kennedy, that I may perhaps belong in the school of scholars who thinks that Chief Justice Marshall read both the statute and the Constitution to reach the constitutional questions he wanted to reach. I'm not sure that he nevertheless didn't end up with the right -- with the wrong answer."
2017.16-961,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1530.755,1540.56,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bamzai."
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,1540.56,1552.72,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: This Court lacks Article III jurisdiction to issue the writs in these cases. The CAAF is an executive branch entity, something that I believe the government does not dispute."
2017.16-961,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1613.96,1614.14,Well --
2017.16-961,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1614.14,1614.58,I'm sorry.
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,1651.37,1654.795,"Your answer -- Your Honor, a couple of answers to that."
2017.16-961,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1674.88,1690.02,"Well, we've also said, with respect to military justice, that it -- it is -- that it is the jurisdiction -- jurisdiction of the commander in charge of either that base or that division."
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,1694.895,1698.73,"Your Honor, it's true that civil law doesn't apply."
2017.16-961,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1742.24,1752.92,I -- I understand your argument that they're different because of -- but I don't understand what possible pertinence the fact that they cover a territory as opposed to a subject matter has to do with your Article III objection.
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,1752.92,1779.24,"Your Honor, it's both. It's the -- the -- the reason why territorial courts were created, and this is Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in American Insurance versus Canter points this out, that -- that Article III courts, under the understanding of Article III at the time, may not have been able to resolve certain disputes that were necessary, just in order to govern a group of people, such as divorce disputes, things of that nature."
2017.16-961,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1779.24,1788.155,"So your doctrine wouldn't apply if, you know, the Article III Court couldn't do it, then you'd have to say it's all right for them to do it in a way that seems inconsistent with your theory?"
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,1788.155,1806.75,"Not at all, Your Honor. What I'm -- what I'm pointing out is that the territorial courts were created for a certain reason, and that is that they stepped into the shoes of state courts where state courts were not available. And that explains why certain principles of the structural separation of powers don't apply within the territories and D.C."
2017.16-961,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1807.09,1810.92,I guess I don't understand why the exact same rationale wouldn't apply here.
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,1846.74,1848.26,"Your Honor, I think it is --"
2017.16-961,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1848.26,1849.395,"By people, really."
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,1849.395,1851.99,I think it is different in relevant respects.
2017.16-961,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1909.05,1920.91,May I go back to the beginning of your argument? You said that the CAAF exercises original jurisdiction.
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,1931.99,1933.11,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-961,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1939.98,1940.29,All right.
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,1976.665,1986.27,"Your Honor, all of that may be right, but for constitutional purposes, the -- this Court is the first Article III court to be reviewing an executive branch decision."
2017.16-961,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1986.27,1991.15,Suppose Congress made the CAAF an Article III court.
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,1991.15,1993.55,"That would be perfectly constitutional, Your Honor."
2017.16-961,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1995.95,1997.515,And that would alleviate your concern here?
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,1997.515,2001.33,"Absolutely, Your Honor. This would fix the constitutional -- constitutional problem."
2017.16-961,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2004.24,2007.165,It wouldn't -- it wouldn't affect the Commander-in-Chief argument?
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2007.165,2011.48,"Your Honor, that may be some separate argument that I have not fully explored."
2017.16-961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2013.61,2016.56,"I'm also worried about the -- well, two things."
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2034.66,2035.55,The D.C. Court of Appeals --
2017.16-961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2035.55,2035.905,What?
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2035.905,2037.25,The D.C. Court of Appeals --
2017.16-961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2037.25,2037.53,"Yeah, that's right."
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2037.53,2038.24,-- is not an Article III court.
2017.16-961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2038.7,2038.76,Yeah.
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2043.74,2048.67,"Your Honor, the -- the explanation is that the D.C. courts, the local courts --"
2017.16-961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2048.67,2048.73,Yeah.
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2048.73,2051.29,-- stand in the same position as territorial courts --
2017.16-961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.29,2066.455,"No, didn't -- didn't -- aren't the -- weren't the territorial courts, they're Article I courts, I guess, but didn't Congress intend under your theory to delegate to those courts part of its judicial power or not?"
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2066.455,2069.56,That is true in the -- of the territorial courts.
2017.16-961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2070.2,2072.57,Were they life appointments?
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2072.57,2073.2,They were not.
2017.16-961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2076.25,2076.45,Okay.
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2115.52,2119.59,"Your Honor, respectfully, I don't know if that is entirely the government's position."
2017.16-961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2120.71,2120.935,All right.
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2121.13,2141.0,"And that is because the government appears to concede that this Court in Ex parte Vallandigham held that it could not directly -- directly review a military commission in that case because the military commission did not exercise the judicial power in a relevant sense. And as I understand the government's argument, it is that this Court can review the CAAF."
2017.16-961,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2145.29,2147.025,Why don't you take another couple minutes.
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2147.025,2161.17,"Thank you, Your Honor. That the CAAF is relevantly different because it has been codified by Congress and exercises its authority in a more formalized sense than the ad hoc military commissions in the Vallandigham case, and I submit --"
2017.16-961,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2161.17,2172.7,"When -- when we write this opinion, whichever way we come out on the issue you're arguing, will it be necessary for us to define what a court is?"
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2172.7,2175.515,"Your Honor, it would not be necessary."
2017.16-961,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2191.95,2234.56,"Well, but how does that really fit with the language of Article III, Section 2? Because what Article III says is ""The judicial power shall extend to all cases"" and then talks about in those cases or in various ones of them, ""the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction."" Now there might be uncertainty as to what cases means with respect to a good many things, but I would have thought that when we're talking about the proceeding here, which is a criminal prosecution with big criminal sentences, including the death penalty, I would have thought that those criminal prosecutions are indeed cases under the language of Article III."
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2234.56,2286.04,"Your Honor, I think the answer to that question is that Marbury establishes that it's more than simply a case that triggers this Court's jurisdiction, that there's something to the language of original and appellate, and original jurisdiction because it's specified in the Constitution by implication means that appellate jurisdiction can only be exercised from certain types of bodies. And, incidentally, that is not only the position that Chief Justice Marshall embraced in Marbury, but it's also the position that Alexander Hamilton embraced in the Federalist Papers, it was proposed at a number of the state conventions ratifying the Constitution and embraced by a number of the cases that the Court decided in its early years that are cited in our brief. And so I think that answers why it's not simply a matter of a case, and one could understand the dispute between Marbury and Madison --"
2017.16-961,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2286.04,2287.26,"So, if I understand your answer --"
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2287.26,2287.35,Yes.
2017.16-961,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2287.35,2307.36,"-- you're not pointing to anything in Article III, is that correct? You're pointing instead to Marbury and saying that the principle derives from there, but I could look at Marbury and say: You know, what -- what Chief Justice Marshall was talking about was James Madison handing around commissions, nothing to do with criminal prosecutions."
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2307.36,2316.5,"Your Honor, I do believe that I'm pointing to something in Article III, and that's the original and appellate jurisdiction provisions and the appropriate structural inferences that can be made from that."
2017.16-961,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2316.5,2318.965,But -- but that's all with reference to the cases.
2017.16-961,1,62952,aditya_bamzai,,2332.72,2333.49,That is true.
2017.16-961,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2361.02,2368.955,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fletcher."
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2368.955,2383.985,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Because a question has been raised about this Court's jurisdiction, I'd like to start by explaining why, in the government's view, Section 1259 validly grants this Court appellate jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces' decisions."
2017.16-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.83,2460.36,There are a lot of --
2017.16-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2460.36,2474.625,"What is the -- what -- how would you have us distinguish the situation that people are concerned about, which is every alphabet agency in the government, that Congress says you can appeal from the sanctions that the SEC imposes right to the Supreme Court?"
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2474.625,2475.225,Yes.
2017.16-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2503.73,2503.82,Okay.
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2507.27,2516.07,"Well, I -- I don't think it could do that, Mr. Chief Justice, because, as this Court's decisions elucidate, there are only very limited circumstances where Congress can create courts outside of the context of Article III."
2017.16-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2517.72,2524.56,"So, in other words, it's -- it's okay because -- we don't have to worry because you can only do it in cases where they've already done it?"
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2524.56,2535.87,"Well, you can only do it -- I think what we would do is we would link the rule about when is this Court's jurisdiction appellate versus original to the existing jurisprudence that this Court has about when can Congress create courts outside of the Article III system."
2017.16-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2543.84,2555.815,"But when can they not do it? If -- if you're doing anything more than just saying everything they have done so far is okay and nothing else, then -- then what is the rule for telling them when they can create these courts under Article I?"
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2555.815,2563.5,"So what this Court has said -- and, again, I -- I just want to illustrate that that's -- that's a question that the Court is going to have to grapple with however it resolves the appellate jurisdiction question here."
2017.16-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2581.76,2582.82,I -- the amicus says --
2017.16-961,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2582.82,2590.02,Will we have jurisdiction -- appellate jurisdiction over state courts? Can states do anything there -- can states have an NLRB type of thing and --
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2590.02,2591.26,I don't think that they could.
2017.16-961,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2591.26,2596.58,-- with -- with no appeal and -- and -- and then it has a federal question and they come to us?
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2596.58,2598.56,"I -- I don't think that they could, Justice Kennedy."
2017.16-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2622.68,2641.62,"What we're doing is looking, I think -- at least I am, I think others are too -- for a reason; that is, what is it that -- that -- I can see the states. You say -- the easiest is the federal courts. I mean, Congress has judicial authority who exercises it."
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2730.59,2732.36,So let me say two things about that.
2017.16-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2738.08,2743.19,"I know that, but looking at Coe, it doesn't seem to give much of an answer."
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2743.19,2747.56,"Well, the answer that it gives is appellate jurisdiction is review of another court's decision --"
2017.16-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2747.56,2747.62,Yeah.
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2747.62,2748.55,-- at the most basic level.
2017.16-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2757.51,2757.72,All right.
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2775.355,2775.71,Yes.
2017.16-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2775.71,2781.96,"-- and has stenographers so it's of record, da da, you see? Now, that's the concern."
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2781.96,2782.59,Yes.
2017.16-961,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2805.79,2806.25,"Well, have they, though?"
2017.16-961,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2806.25,2806.87,Do you think it's --
2017.16-961,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2806.87,2807.91,"I mean, I look at the -- I'm sorry."
2017.16-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2807.91,2808.81,Justice Alito?
2017.16-961,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2808.81,2817.72,Do you -- do you think it's relevant that the President or the Secretary of Defense can alter a decision of the CAAF after it's issued?
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2817.72,2821.09,I don't believe that the President or the -- the Secretary of Defense can do that.
2017.16-961,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2827.29,2829.06,"Well, that's what I'm referring to."
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2838.56,2839.395,That's correct.
2017.16-961,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2840.1,2842.635,"And you think that's relevant to the question this, the question before us?"
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2842.635,2853.96,"I -- I think it might be if the action of the President or the Secretary extended to upsetting the conviction or upsetting the judgment of the CAAF, but that's not the type of action that the President can take."
2017.16-961,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2855.43,2857.11,What kind of action can the President take?
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2857.11,2869.055,"There are certain types of sentences, death sentences in particular, that require the President's approval before they can be executed, and there are other types of sentences, including the dismissal of an officer, that require secretarial approval before they can be executed."
2017.16-961,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2884.62,2885.4,How does that provision work?
2017.16-961,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2885.4,2890.0,"I'm not doubting you, but where -- where do I look to find -- to find the authority for your proposition?"
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2890.0,2897.67,You find the -- the statutory provision that speaks to the finality of Court of Appeals of the Armed Forces' decisions and court-martial decisions in general is in 876.
2017.16-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2904.325,2906.21,I -- I -- I guess I am doubting you. (Laughter.)
2017.16-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2906.21,2926.285,"If you have the -- if the executive prevails in any case, he always has the discretion not to enforce it. I mean, if the judgment is you can, you know, suspend the pay of this service person for this period, he can review it and say, well, okay, you know, the -- the principle is established, but I'm not going to do it."
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2945.125,2947.01,"Well, I think he's -- he's constrained."
2017.16-961,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2963.78,2963.92,So --
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2963.92,2965.01,-- quoted in your opinion in Denedo --
2017.16-961,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2965.01,2991.47,"So, counsel, don't we, though, have to assume the constitutionality of that limitation on the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief for -- for this position to work and, second, what if Congress were to alter that scheme and provide the -- the President or the Secretary further authority to alter the results of military tribunals? And, in fact, I think the Secretary, if I'm correct, has to approve the dismissal of any commissioned officer as well --"
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2991.47,2992.36,"That's correct, yes."
2017.16-961,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2992.36,2992.7,-- under 871(b).
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3001.36,3002.815,So let me say two things about that.
2017.16-961,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3014.09,3024.065,"Well, if it changes the analysis, then where -- we're back to the Chief Justice's question -- where is the line, and assuming the constitutionality of these limitations."
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3024.065,3024.49,Yes.
2017.16-961,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3024.49,3034.78,"Where is the line? How much authority -- how much of a court is it before it is no longer a court when it's all sitting in the executive branch, as this Court ruled in Edmonds?"
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3034.78,3039.17,"So first and foremost it's a court that doles out criminal sentences, up to and including death."
2017.16-961,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3046.965,3047.51,So it's --
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3047.51,3047.94,-- can alter.
2017.16-961,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3047.94,3052.23,"-- criminal versus civil? I mean, I can see the next case being civil."
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3063.225,3068.36,"Well, I think there's no doubt that court-martial -- courts-martial are criminal and the fact that they are able to impose criminal punishment --"
2017.16-961,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3068.36,3069.29,"Well, I accept -- I accept that."
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3083.55,3091.78,"I guess I would say the fact that it can distribute criminal penalties is certainly an indication that if we're drawing a line, is it a court, is it not, it falls on the court side of the line."
2017.16-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3091.78,3092.06,"Well, what if --"
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3092.06,3094.17,That's what it shares in common with territorial courts.
2017.16-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3094.17,3099.215,What about -- you're really make -- you're making me think in this. I guarantee it's a hard question.
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3143.13,3143.535,Yes.
2017.16-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3143.535,3152.705,"The same is true of the military, which is a separate world, and it is Article I giving them power over the military that lets them do that."
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3152.705,3153.065,Yes.
2017.16-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3153.065,3172.735,"The same is not true of the NLRB, which is a specialized agency, and because the judicial and adjudicatory functions that the executive branch performs in its carrying out of executive duties are rule-making and decision-making authorities under execution, not judicial."
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3172.735,3173.435,Yes.
2017.16-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3173.435,3174.755,You think that might work?
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3174.755,3176.41,I think that -- I think that works exactly.
2017.16-961,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3200.88,3201.09,So this --
2017.16-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3201.09,3204.98,"Mr. Fletcher, maybe it's a good time for us to let you get to the merits of the case. (Laughter.)"
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3204.98,3206.675,"I appreciate that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2017.16-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3646.77,3655.165,"If your reading of the authorization or the savings clause is correct, then you really have no reason to fix any problem that's been identified, right?"
2017.16-961,2,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3655.165,3655.91,Except --
