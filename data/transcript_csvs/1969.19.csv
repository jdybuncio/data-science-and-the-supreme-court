1969.19,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,18.186,First National Bank versus Dickinson and the Camp versus Dickinson.
1969.19,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,20.646,23.704,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.19,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,132.282,140.473,"Let's see Mr. Springer, the Florida Court would say that this is not prohibited by a part of a statute then the issue we have here wouldn't be here?"
1969.19,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,140.473,142.466,"Yes, yes, that is correct Mr. Justice Brennan."
1969.19,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,142.466,144.834,"Instead of putting the cart before the horse, is it?"
1969.19,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,144.834,154.128,"In fact, it seemed a little strange to me that the Florida Court would stay itself pending determination of this case, but it in fact until is done so."
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,1920.161,1923.022,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2114.812,2116.927,What is the population of Plant City?
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2116.927,2117.469,I beg your pardon sir.
1969.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2117.469,2119.798,What is the population of Plant City?
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2119.798,2124.748,"Within the incorporated limits, our Chamber of Commerce claims 18,000 people."
1969.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2125.228,2126.783,Are there any other banks there?
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2126.783,2131.897,"There are -- there's one other bank, a state chartered bank that's been existing since 1905."
1969.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2151.897,2154.966,Interveners and what's their position?
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2154.966,2158.295,They are on the side of the state banking commissioner.
1969.19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2382.718,2385.963,I'd like to ask you a little more about the factual setting --
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2385.963,2386.382,Please do.
1969.19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2386.382,2391.047,-- that I think Mr. Justice Black was addressing himself to a while ago.
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2393.075,2394.742,Yes we do.
1969.19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2394.742,2424.544,"Suppose a customer who is a contractor calls the bank and said that he wanted $10,000.00 in small bills delivered in a certain way and delivered to the job site where the contractor was performing work in order to pay off his employees, would the bank -- would the First National carry out that instruction?"
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2424.544,2436.035,"If he has own deposit in the First National Bank $10,000.00 and has previously signed this contractual arrangement with us whereby we have agreed to charge his account."
1969.19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2454.894,2466.779,Would they put it in envelopes with names on it specifying amounts for each person so that these envelopes could be handed out to the employees on the job site?
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2466.779,2478.571,"We do that quite frequently for people in our -- to come to our drive-in window -- if they asked for a pay -- that a payroll will be made up, yes we do that and place it within the bag and it can be picked up in our drive-in window at the bank."
1969.19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2487.349,2487.866,How far?
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2495.049,2497.004,"Well, there is no rule on it."
1969.19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2515.99,2521.107,But a state bank could not or could it afford that service?
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2521.107,2530.161,"Under the present circumstances in Florida, it could not because it has been held by Comptroller Dickinson to be a matter of branch banking and they would not allow that."
1969.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2538.698,2541.725,Do you go to villages outside of Plant City?
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2541.725,2544.568,"Yes we do, some very small villages are --"
1969.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2544.568,2545.709,What size?
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2545.709,2550.822,"Of one store or two stores, fill-in stations and a store combined to something in its stature."
1969.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2550.822,2552.706,Do you have any bank in any of those other places?
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2552.706,2553.782,"No sir, there is not."
1969.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2575.746,2579.582,Did you say you had a night depository at some of these places?
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2579.582,2587.468,We have a night depository or we have a drop at the shopping center that is the same thing as a night depository.
1969.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2591.373,2592.688,Is that the only one you have there?
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2592.688,2594.781,"It's the only one that we have, yes sir."
1969.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2594.781,2599.153,"In other places, you just simply move in there and carry their money --"
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2599.153,2607.675,Our truck drives to their door and our messenger carries it to the business house which is previously contracted with us for this service.
1969.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2607.675,2612.231,"And you get deposits from them, money which is to be deposited then?"
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2612.231,2613.641,We -- that is correct sir.
1969.19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2636.233,2642.378,"Suppose the night depository out there is broken into, who is responsible?"
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2642.378,2647.04,"Under the contract, the funds have not become deposit funds in the First National Bank."
1969.19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2662.21,2670.528,"Well, then what outside of the technicality is the difference between deposit and out then deposited in your night depository, your night depository in them?"
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2671.74,2678.505,"There is no difference in that -- in deposit to get out there and the night depository which is located adjacent to our bank, but we would --"
1969.19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2678.505,2683.962,And your night depository is admittedly a part of the banking business?
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2683.962,2684.965,It is a part of the banking --
1969.19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2684.965,2692.343,And why -- isn't that the one out at the shopping center “a part of the banking business?”
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2692.343,2704.091,"It is a part of the banking business as it were for terms of the -- of a bank's activities and perhaps comes within the ambit of the Florida statute, I say perhaps."
1969.19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2732.732,2737.042,"Well, why do you -- well, why do you insure it if it's not your money?"
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2737.042,2743.375,We insure it because it is a service to our customer and we feel that the customers would be at lost without it.
1969.19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2752.864,2759.455,"There are two contracts taken there, one is the contract and the other is an insurance policy."
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2759.455,2765.267,The contract that they have with us is a definitive contract as the type of service that we're rendering them.
1969.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2770.707,2775.588,"Well, you have your own liability for the money after all you have custody of it, don't you?"
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2775.588,2782.97,"Well, we have a possible liability except for the fact that we have a clear contractual understanding that the money is there."
1969.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2782.97,2788.933,"So, one way of satisfying that contingent liability to insure your customer."
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2788.933,2791.496,That's correct sir and that's what we've elected to do.
1969.19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2791.496,2800.206,"If there was a holdup on the way in of this truck, they would not be robbing the National Bank, would they?"
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2800.206,2808.212,"No sir, under the contract that exist they would not be and we of course would look to the insurance company for their reimbursement."
1969.19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2808.212,2823.908,"Mr. Edwards, suppose that the shopping center is set up in building which you called a bank and said that this is a limited bank, all we do is take in money and pay out money, we do not render any other banking services, would that be a branch bank?"
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2823.908,2826.543,"Yes sir, I think we would definitely have reached --"
1969.19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2826.543,2830.084,"(Voice Overlap) what's the difference except you don't have a big building, you just have a little truck?"
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2830.084,2832.38,"Well, to begin with we have no people there."
1969.19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2835.199,2836.632,You have messengers there?
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2836.632,2837.004,I beg your pardon.
1969.19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2837.004,2838.34,You have messengers.
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2838.34,2840.635,"No sir, the messengers does not stay there, he simply calls picks up."
1969.19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2840.635,2841.698,"If he goes there, he pick it up."
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2841.698,2842.581,"Yes he does, very definitely."
1969.19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2842.581,2843.396,He picks it up.
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2843.396,2844.195,He does.
1969.19,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2895.447,2911.52,"How would you characterize this as a branch or not a branch within the federal test theory, federal laws controlling, is the function of -- the functional activity of the bank or other [Inaudible]"
1969.19,1,39187,robert_s_edwards,,2911.52,2931.777,"Well, to begin with, I believe that when we start dealing with deposit law or contract law and move over into the functional definition rather than the strict contract law which now exists as well developed throughout the United States and it is now in our brief that we are beginning to deal with a lot of problems."
1969.19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3016.601,3019.686,Thank you Mr. Edwards.
1969.19,2,46314,william_reece_smith_jr,,3021.797,3025.464,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.19,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3132.421,3138.506,"I take it that the Florida statute forbids the bank, Oh!"
1969.19,2,46314,william_reece_smith_jr,,3141.877,3142.918,"It does, sir."
1969.19,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3143.86,3145.775,Never mind.
1969.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3145.775,3151.456,Would you mind telling me what's it at the core of this controversy?
1969.19,2,46314,william_reece_smith_jr,,3151.456,3153.704,"Well, there are two arguments, Mr. Justice Black."
1969.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3159.081,3163.444,"I'm not talking about legally speaking, I'm talking about practically speaking."
1969.19,2,46314,william_reece_smith_jr,,3163.444,3186.868,"Practically speaking, what is it the core of it is that the National Bank through the ruling of the Comptroller of the Currency which completely reverses the rulings that the Comptroller of the Currency had been making for over 40 years as to armored cars and as to depositories has gained a competitive advantage over the State Banks in the State of Florida in the performance of basic essentials of banking."
1969.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3226.46,3246.258,"That's it -- let's take a village at a little distant from Plant City, 20 miles and you find that the Plant City sends this traveling bank or traveling whatever it is into that community and it can get the deposits."
1969.19,2,46314,william_reece_smith_jr,,3250.406,3252.556,That's right.
1969.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3254.715,3257.421,Of course you'd say it should pass the law and not authorize it.
1969.19,2,46314,william_reece_smith_jr,,3257.421,3257.633,Oh!
1969.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3272.338,3275.69,But they can send in their deposits by mail.
1969.19,2,46314,william_reece_smith_jr,,3275.69,3277.267,"Yes sir, that is true."
1969.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3278.832,3282.523,Is that a satisfactory way of doing business?
1969.19,2,46314,william_reece_smith_jr,,3282.523,3289.078,"A satis -- its certainly not a satisfactory way to combat the armored car operations because it does a good deal more, may it please --"
1969.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3289.078,3294.856,Do you take the position that the armored car is in effect a moving ambulatory bank?
1969.19,2,46314,william_reece_smith_jr,,3294.856,3296.363,I do indeed sir.
1969.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3368.828,3373.747,"Why did -- you said the rule had been otherwise for 20 years, what had been the rule for 20 years?"
1969.19,2,46314,william_reece_smith_jr,,3373.747,3384.579,The Comptroller of the Currency had disapproved and discouraged armored car operations and depository operations of this sort on the ground that they were branch banking under 36 (f).
1969.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3384.579,3386.977,"On the ground, is that in the record?"
1969.19,2,46314,william_reece_smith_jr,,3386.977,3387.991,Yes sir.
1969.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3401.393,3405.38,"They had been called branch banks for 20 years, this level?"
1969.19,2,46314,william_reece_smith_jr,,3405.38,3415.455,The comptroller is saying that they were not authorized in states which were non-branching states because they would violate the provisions of 36 (f) and (c).
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,5081.637,5084.788,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.19,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5380.977,5388.165,Would you agree that Congress could authorize national banks to do all the things that are challenged here?
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,5388.165,5389.722,Yes Mr. Chief Justice.
1969.19,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5859.425,5867.575,Could you draw any distinction in your own line between the armored car service and the depository?
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,5867.575,5868.559,"Well, the armored car service --"
1969.19,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5868.559,5870.657,For purposes of Section 36?
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,5870.657,5871.475,No sir.
1969.19,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5876.058,5882.22,But you have to call -- can you really call an armored car service that's moving around a place of business?
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,5882.22,5882.8,I think that's --
1969.19,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5882.8,5887.253,Or a branch office or a branch agency?
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,5887.253,5888.091,It's an additional --
1969.19,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5888.091,5889.152,Or a branch?
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,5889.152,5892.961,"It is a place of business, I would suggest, Mr. Justice White."
1969.19,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5892.961,5894.745,A branch or place of business?
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,5894.745,5897.443,"It is a branch, place of business --"
1969.19,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5897.443,5897.576,[Inaudible]
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,5897.576,5916.093,"-- at which essential activities relating to the deposit making process are going on because I do not see how you construe, can construe Section 36 (f) in any other way and still reconcile it with the basic competitive equality of Congress."
1969.19,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5916.093,5926.206,Do you think the president of the bank every now and then stops by a customer's place and picks up his deposits; that's a branch place of business?
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,5926.206,5926.538,No sir.
1969.19,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5928.247,5936.731,"Because (Voice Overlap) under 36, you don't only need the acceptance of deposits but you need to have those accepted at a place of business."
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,5936.731,5937.93,Yes sir.
1969.19,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5976.995,5982.496,Also you think [Inaudible] this is hypothetical because an armored car service is here as well as the depository.
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,5982.496,5983.441,Yes sir.
1969.19,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5984.463,5985.392,[Inaudible] hypothetical about that.
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,5985.392,5990.07,The depository and the armored car service are essential elements relating to the depository --
1969.19,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5990.07,5995.664,[Inaudible] together or does each separately a branch place of business?
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,5995.664,5998.089,They are together in the sense of the --
1969.19,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5998.089,6003.47,[Inaudible] only the armored car service without the supermarket or a shopping center depository.
1969.19,3,29005,james_f_bell,,6003.47,6005.031,No sir.
