1971.70-5112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.785,"We’ll hear arguments next in 70-5112, Weber against the Aetna Casualty."
1971.70-5112,0,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,29.785,31.353,Mr. Chief Justice --
1971.70-5112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,31.353,32.572,Mr. Lacour.
1971.70-5112,0,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,32.572,35.315,-- and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,101.206,103.514,"When you say common-law, that did not mean --"
1971.70-5112,0,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,103.514,107.393,That don’t mean -- I mean out of wedlock wife if I may put it that way.
1971.70-5112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,107.393,109.143,He could not be a common-law husband.
1971.70-5112,0,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,109.143,111.899,There are no common-law marriages in Louisiana.
1971.70-5112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,111.899,113.929,And his lawful wife was still living?
1971.70-5112,0,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,113.929,120.412,His lawful wife was still living but they were separated not judicially separated or divorced.
1971.70-5112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,156.094,164.293,"Is there any question Mr. Lacour about that second child if that second child had been a legitimate child, although a posthumous child?"
1971.70-5112,0,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,168.708,170.554,"Yes, he would have."
1971.70-5112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,196.836,202.258,But it is not partly related in a practical sense to the problems of proof?
1971.70-5112,0,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,202.258,217.855,"That is argued, I suppose so; however, without being suspicious, I suppose the proof of paternity you assume it."
1971.70-5112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,240.269,257.439,"Has Louisiana in any case you know of ever given any special status to extra judicial acknowledgements, that is letters, affidavits, things of that kind, acknowledgements of paternity?"
1971.70-5112,0,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,257.439,297.465,"Not of paternity, of maternity, even though Louisiana law requires -- well, it’s earn settle in Louisiana as to whether or not what we call an informal acknowledgement of an illegitimate child, lifts that child from the object of lowest level of which the Civil Code say it is known by the escalation basket, whereas the child acknowledged either formally by notarial act or some formal act or informally the mother, because of maternity doesn’t leave open the question of uncertainty as to parentage."
1971.70-5112,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,309.872,322.472,"Mr. Lacour, is it -- in the amicus brief, I think it’s a statement that these out of wedlock children could not have been acknowledged under, is it Article 204?"
1971.70-5112,0,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,322.472,324.073,204 of the Louisiana Civil Code.
1971.70-5112,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,324.073,325.28,Do you agree with that?
1971.70-5112,0,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,325.28,327.324,That is correct; that is correct.
1971.70-5112,1,45402,w_henson_moore,,1232.414,1235.951,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1324.71,1327.575,But you got a complete setoff haven’t you from --
1971.70-5112,1,45402,w_henson_moore,,1327.575,1327.824,"Well, we got that --"
1971.70-5112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1327.824,1330.261,We got the recovery by the four legitimate children?
1971.70-5112,1,45402,w_henson_moore,,1330.261,1335.109,We got that but I don’t think it’s clear at all that what should happen if this Honorable Court should reverse this decision.
1971.70-5112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1347.819,1352.314,It wasn’t 65% of the wages the maximum whether or not they are four children or six children?
1971.70-5112,1,45402,w_henson_moore,,1352.314,1352.87,That’s correct.
1971.70-5112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1355.053,1355.797,And the --
1971.70-5112,1,45402,w_henson_moore,,1355.797,1356.164,Workmen’s Compensation.
1971.70-5112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1356.164,1360.442,"And this covered more the four they covered more the maximum and you got a complete set off, am I wrong?"
1971.70-5112,1,45402,w_henson_moore,,1360.442,1362.554,"I have the complete set off as to those four, Your Honor."
1971.70-5112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1362.554,1364.901,"Well, it isn’t 65% of the maximum."
1971.70-5112,1,45402,w_henson_moore,,1364.901,1365.66,That’s right.
1971.70-5112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1365.66,1368.334,And whether therefore it is 6 or 12 children?
1971.70-5112,1,45402,w_henson_moore,,1368.334,1375.904,"Well, but what I’m trying to say is Your Honor, it is not clear under our law at all whether or not I will still be liable to Mr. Lacour’s class for Workmen’s Compensation."
1971.70-5112,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1450.941,1459.358,"In other words, had there been no legitimate children in this case, the illegitimate children that Mr. Lacour represents would have been entitled some share of the Workmen’s Compensation?"
1971.70-5112,1,45402,w_henson_moore,,1459.358,1460.557,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-5112,2,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,1977.64,1983.414,"Just three comment, may it please the Chief Justice and members of the Court."
1971.70-5112,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2168.388,2176.69,"Under 8 -- under Subsection 8, a complete stranger so far as that is a complete non-family member could qualify as a dependent as I understand?"
1971.70-5112,2,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,2176.69,2177.666,Yes.
1971.70-5112,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2180.874,2181.633,If he proves the fact to dependency?
1971.70-5112,2,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,2181.633,2196.055,"And provided the nature that would have taken even though they were unacknowledged, incapable of being acknowledged illegitimate would have taken whatever promise that have been left if they had not been a enough people to use up all the [Voice Overlap]."
1971.70-5112,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2196.055,2200.557,Just on proving the fact of the dependency not on proving the fact of --
1971.70-5112,2,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,2200.557,2209.441,"Yes, not only proving the fact of being fair and having the nexus to apply the need the same reparation for the loss of a parent that has illegitimate children."
1971.70-5112,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2209.441,2219.455,And it is your claim that whatever it may or may not provide that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment entitles your client as to be treated as children?
1971.70-5112,2,43631,vanue_b_lacour,,2219.455,2219.635,Right.
1971.70-5112,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2247.588,2248.583,Thank you Mr. Lacour.
