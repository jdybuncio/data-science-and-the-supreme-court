1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.665,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Michigan against DeFillippo.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,16.648,20.287,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1978.77-1680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,149.405,153.209,"The Court of Detroit, the Court of General Criminal jurisdiction."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,153.209,158.785,It handles all criminal matters in the city of Detroit both felony and misdemeanor.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,158.785,165.438,Mr. Baughman you stated the one that petitioner who responded rather refused to identify himself he was arrested.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,165.438,166.613,Yes that's correct.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,166.613,170.797,The ordinance doesn't provide for an arrest in that situation or is that considered to be an arrest.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,170.797,173.402,It is our position that it is considered to be an arrest.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,184.043,194.428,"It's under the general code rather than the sentence that says, if the person is unable to provide reasonable evidence of his true identity the police officer may transport him to the nearest precinct in order to ascertain his identity, that's not what you are --"
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,194.428,206.39,"That's correct, I believe that is separate provision from the refusal to identify portion, I think that's made more clear in the ultimate revision of the ordinance by the Detroit City Counsel."
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,207.516,209.532,The revision of the ordinance is not before?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,209.532,213.9,"No I think the revision only makes clear what was intended all along, I see --"
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,213.9,221.5,"The arresting officer had some other grounds on which to arrest this man, did he not?"
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,221.5,222.414,"He may have, that has not been --"
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,222.414,233.668,"He may have one, he represented that he was a police officer is it not a crime of some kind in Detroit and in Michigan for a person to impersonate a police officer."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,233.668,235.184,It is and --
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,235.184,235.841,Wouldn't that --
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,235.841,240.919,He may well have had probable cause to arrest for false personation of a police officer at that time.
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,251.717,257.19,When did the defendant refused to identify himself?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,257.19,263.974,Well it is our position that by giving a false and admittedly false answer when he later changed the answer that that is tantamount to refusal to identify.
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,268.068,273.205,"Yeah, looking backwards that's right I guess, yeah."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,283.681,289.129,Well I think if he gave a name then we would go on to the next portion of verifiable proof written or oral --
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,289.129,291.878,"So that is in, that is also a part of the ordinance you are saying."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,291.878,292.723,Yes.
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,296.247,297.549,Totally different answer.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,297.549,298.133,That's correct.
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,298.133,305.446,Mr. Baughman this case is not one prosecution for violation of ordinance is it?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,305.446,307.655,"No it not, this is a derivate evidence case."
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,307.655,314.446,Do you know of any instances in your city where one has been prosecuted for violating the ordinance.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,314.446,317.981,"I am not personally aware of those, those would be tried by the --"
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,317.981,319.741,You are a prosecuting attorney are you not?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,319.741,320.353,Yes I am.
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,320.353,321.768,Have you ever prosecuted one?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,321.768,331.142,"No I have not, they are not prosecuted by the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office, they are prosecuted by the City of Detroit Corporation Counsel as they are ordinance violations and not State law violations."
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,332.431,337.438,How would the constitutionality of the ordinance ever be determined if no prosecutions were ever brought under it?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,337.438,344.266,The only other method would be a possibility a suit for declaratory judgment in Michigan law which would be allowed.
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,360.057,366.928,"Well, except the prosecution as -- and determine what they want to prosecute for."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,366.928,379.876,"That's correct, I am just saying that I, on this record and personally I do not know if persons have been prosecuted and they well have been but that within the knowledge of the Detroit Corporation Counsel and I do not know."
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,447.093,448.876,Due process defect or any defect.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,448.876,461.61,"Any defect that's correct, but it does not mean that when he is arrested for probable cause to believe that he violated that ordinance by a police officer when the ordinances of that time presume valid that his Fourth Amendment rights have been violated."
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,479.447,487.0,Did the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit say there was no Fourth Amendment violation or that the evidence shouldn't be excluded.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,487.0,489.078,Well our charge is --
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,489.078,491.467,"If they said the first, well they would say the second too."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,491.467,497.243,They said the arrest was valid and saying that the arrest was valid I would take to me that they were saying there was no Fourth Amendment violation.
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,503.871,504.984,Even if there had been a --
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,504.984,508.952,Even if there had been a Fourth Amendment violation and we take both of those positions.
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,560.466,568.296,"Well you must, you certainly must not only say there is a grounds for a Terry stop search but there must have been grounds for an arrest and a search."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,568.296,576.503,"Correct, but the ordinance provides that when one is stopped pursuant to Terry versus Ohio, he must upon request state his identity."
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,580.314,593.117,"You think this -- so was there any question, ever any question in this case raised about the grounds for the so called stop?"
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,593.117,594.947,"I do not believe so, no."
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,699.633,720.718,"Now, in Stone against Powell, the reason that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had held that search to be invalid was that it held a ordinance of, that was at Henderson in Nevada, the vagrancy ordinance was an invalid ordinance it held it after the fact, after the search."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,720.718,722.934,That's correct.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,722.934,730.083,"Did the court either approved or disapprove that reasoning in Stone, did this court in Stone against Powell either approve or disapprove."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,730.083,742.519,I don't I think the majority did not reach that question deciding the case on the habeas corpus issue instead the working current opinions which disagreed with the application of exclusionary role under those circumstances.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,742.519,755.188,But the court rather assumed that it was an illegal search because the vagrancy ordinance was an invalid ordinance although the placement at the time of the arrest had no reason to believe so.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,755.188,768.273,"I'm not certain if that may well have been in underlined assumption of the court, I believe that it just stood for the proposition that those kind of claims could not be brought for habeas corpus valid or not I don't think it really settles whether or not the claim was valid."
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,768.273,770.68,You don't think that throws any light on your question here?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,770.68,772.111,I don't believe so.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,772.111,773.879,Although that was the fact wasn't in Stone against Powell.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,773.879,775.985,That was the --
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,775.985,782.64,The reason the Ninth Circuit held that was an invalid arrest was that the Ninth Circuit after the fact decided it was invalid --
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,782.64,787.163,"Certainly and that demonstrates that there was, there is split among the circuits because the Fifth Circuit is held to the contrary."
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,787.163,791.429,In which case did you mention Justice Powell's concurring opinion?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,791.429,798.447,That was in Brown versus Illinois.
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,798.447,800.085,He was the author of Stone against Powell.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,800.085,805.271,Yes he was.
1978.77-1680,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,805.271,813.487,May I come back to the sort of what happened at the time of the arrest did the pat-down occur before or after the arrest?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,813.487,815.294,It occurred after the arrest.
1978.77-1680,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,815.294,816.064,After the arrest.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,816.064,818.164,Yes.
1978.77-1680,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,818.164,826.214,And would you state again exactly what the issue is before us is the validity of the ordinance before us in this case.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,826.214,855.078,"I believe it is, it is not necessary ultimately for this court to decide that issue to decide that Phencyclidine is admissible against respondent in this case because this court could hold that that even if the ordinance is unconstitutional, Phencyclidine is admissible because either the arrest was valid or because the exclusionary rule should not apply to this conduct in any event and therefore not reach the constitutionality of the ordinance, it then being relevant but --"
1978.77-1680,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,855.078,863.543,We could hold that there was probable cause for this arrest and the search would have been incident to that arrest and would end the case?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,863.543,865.945,I believe it would the --
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,865.945,867.123,And that is your primary understanding --
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,867.123,867.722,That's my primary --
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,867.722,883.438,Understanding that this was in ordinance duly enacted by the City of Detroit that there was a reasonable cause believe that the respondent was violating that ordinance and that therefore the policemen arrested --
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,883.438,885.561,There was no Fourth Amendment violation occurred.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,885.561,896.273,"And that your submission is a valid arrest without reference to whether or not some court, this court or some other court might subsequently find that ordinance to have been invalid."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,896.273,898.459,"That's correct, that is our first position."
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,898.459,899.709,That's what I thought.
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,899.709,903.817,In other words you're standing on the presumptive validity of the ordinance.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,903.817,919.609,We're standing on the proposition that that even if a person cannot be convicted badly for violating a penal statute when he is arrested before that finding of unconstitutionally occurs upon probable cause to believe he violated it that no constitutional violation has been committed by the officer.
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,919.609,929.983,If that were not so I suppose the officer would be subject to leisure to suit for unlawful arrest.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,929.983,938.372,"He may have a good faith defense on the civil suit but then the suit maybe brought against him, that's possible."
1978.77-1680,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,938.372,961.127,"If we were to reach the constitutional question, do you see any Fifth Amendment problem here, you discussed the Fourth Amendment, is there a Fifth Amendment problem with the respect to an ordinance that allows an officer who makes a crime to decline to identify oneself or when an officer is arrested for any purpose."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,961.127,967.988,I don't believe there's a Fifth Amendment problem here and we rely heavily on the cases from the California courts which are cited in our brief.
1978.77-1680,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,967.988,969.71,What about Miranda?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,969.71,995.434,"Well there, in asking someone to identify themself under these circumstances, a person is not being compelled to give incriminating information I think California versus Byers is somewhat on point although I think the facts are stronger in this case, in California versus Byers that only did a person identify himself but by so doing they indicated that there were a person involved in an accident and this court indicated there that identification is essentially a neutral act."
1978.77-1680,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1000.372,1006.976,Not in Byers to a criminal case situation would you or not Byers involved automobile accident.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1006.976,1015.539,"Yes, but it was a criminal violation to fail the stop at the scene and leave your name and address that was a penal statute."
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1036.39,1047.435,One of the cases held or do you know many cases where there has been a Terry stop has anyone ever held that as soon you'd stop and make a Terry stop you must get Miranda warnings?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1047.435,1051.138,I'm not aware of any such cases.
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.351,1082.596,"Mr. Baughman, at the time the officer first approached the respondent, was there a reasonable cause to believe he was engaged in criminal activity?"
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1082.596,1085.726,I believe there was responsible cause to believe criminal activity.
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1085.726,1087.772,What criminal activity by the respondent?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1087.772,1097.45,"Well, there are several possibilities but I think the officer had at least a reasonable suspicion that either consensual or forcible criminal sexual conduct may have been afoot."
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1099.25,1101.93,Is there anything in the testimony about that?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1101.93,1103.094,"No, there's not."
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1103.094,1107.254,That's just your supposition that found in the alley -- you might have assumed it.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1107.254,1110.956,"That's my supposition from the, the women being in the alley taking her pants down and --"
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.956,1113.329,But her purpose was explained to something quite different.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1113.329,1114.604,"Well, that of course that occurred after the incident, they had stopped."
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.604,1117.816,As soon as they asked her.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1117.816,1123.286,I think the stop had already occurred at that point and under the ordinance then the officers were entitled to ask for identification.
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1123.286,1125.343,Terry authorizes the stop.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1125.343,1125.695,Yes.
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1125.695,1130.776,On the basis of facts observed by the officer.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1130.776,1132.034,That's correct.
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1132.034,1140.366,And you're saying that what the officer observed gave him all the right to make a Terry.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1140.366,1147.25,That's correct and that the ordinance then gave him the right to arrest for the violation of the law that the respondent committed by not identifying himself.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1147.25,1153.028,Well the purposes to stop under Terry must be to search the stop being for weapons was --
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1153.028,1157.142,"That assumes also that there's a reasonable, further reasonable suspicion that he's armed and dangerous."

1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1158.636,1159.565,That's correct.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1159.565,1166.418,"Based on suspicion that he is armed in dangerous and the stop is for the purpose of searching him for weapons and if necessary disarming him, is that correct."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1166.418,1169.064,"It's also for investigation I believe, the stop itself."

1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1199.351,1214.981,"Yes, I think the detention portion of Terry I believe is for investigation, the frisk only occurs and can only occur if there is a further reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous, and then you can frisk but the stop is an investigatory stop I believe."
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1214.981,1218.014,"And you say, what would the investigator stop."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1218.014,1218.903,"Well, in this case --"
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1218.903,1222.039,In a justification for it.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1222.039,1223.386,In the general context.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1223.386,1223.939,In this case.

1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1240.335,1241.796,"Well, that's why you said two possibilities."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1241.796,1243.875,That's two.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1243.875,1244.819,Forcible or consensual.

1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1250.554,1252.872,That's correct.

1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1556.47,1557.861,Likely not because John Dillinger is --
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1557.861,1572.38,"Well, that mean it was apprehension, but the fact that he is indentified as a person who he is, is no more incriminating in taking his finger prints, his blood his hair, other his handwriting example or other activities this court has held are not testimonial."
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1589.673,1599.933,"Well, aren't there cases arising under the constitutional guarantee against compulsory self incrimination which protect a witness from even giving his name."

1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1644.604,1647.304,"No, I think any officer can ask that to any citizen but he can't arrest --"
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.304,1650.529,But it could a make a crime for the citizen to refuse to tell him.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1652.194,1656.374,I don not believe that legislature can make it a crime to refuse to answer that question.
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.374,1657.32,Why not?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1657.32,1658.587,Upon no other facts.
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.587,1660.744,What's the constitutional objection to that statute?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1660.744,1669.61,"Well, I think that it's just a Fourteenth Amendment due process question is whether a governmental interest to serve and whether the means employed are recently related to the end."
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.92,1693.189,You would say it's a due process question.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1693.189,1698.479,I believe the constitution of the ordinance says yes.
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1698.479,1710.166,"Wouldn't there be a Fourth Amendment issue though if the, without any reason whatsoever the officer went up to a person and detained him while he ask him?"
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1710.166,1714.109,That would be a Fourth Amendment question but I don't believe that's what's before us here.
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.109,1721.123,"If he walked up and walked along side of him, and just followed him along and asked him what his name was."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1721.123,1722.779,That he could I think any citizen --
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.779,1724.886,And you can do certainly that there is no problem there.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1724.886,1725.528,No.
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1725.528,1730.327,Identity if the person said no I give it you and then if he arrested and you think then there is a problem.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1730.327,1733.778,Then it will be a problem even if there was a statute I think certainly without a statute it could be a problem.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1733.778,1736.443,Even though there but you say statute or ordinance.
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1736.443,1736.872,Yes.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1736.872,1748.088,"Making it a criminal office for a person to refuse an inquiry by a police officer, knowing him to be police officer, what is your name would that would be a invalid statute or ordinance?"
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1748.088,1757.649,"Assuming without any Terry basis just anybody on the street, it mean, I am not saying it would for certain, I think there would be a much more problems with that ordinance than this one."
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1757.649,1758.433,Why?
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1758.433,1774.495,"Because I do not, because the end the effective crime prevention and detection I do not think it would be reasonably related to the means stopping anyone on the street to ask them their name as it is in this case and I think that might be unduly impressive on individuals, which is also a due process test."
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.495,1779.525,I think when the draft was enforced that was a violation of --
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1779.525,1781.953,No.
1978.77-1680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1781.953,1789.644,"If an officer walked up to somebody and said let me see your draft card and person said awfully sorry, but it's none of your business."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1792.634,1807.74,"No, there maybe, there maybe there is a different governmental interest served there when you have a request for certain document as the -- it's not effective crime prevention and detection that's been served in that case it's the enforcement of the draft laws and that might be a different circumstance."
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1807.74,1826.962,"Well the Court of Appeals of Michigan in this case had, what was wrong with this ordinance was that it seeks to make criminal conduct which is, make criminal conduct which is innocent, but that's true with every criminal statute, it's innocent to drive over 55 miles an hour on a highway and the correct statute tells you its criminal does it?"
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1826.962,1832.694,Any law making conduct which is not an element say criminal makes criminal conduct which is innocent.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1837.152,1852.003,"Well that's really, I think that's -- arrest of that doubtful validity of a statute such as we have hypothecated, that it makes criminal conduct which is, was before this ordinance was passed was innocent conduct."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1852.003,1852.871,That's --
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1852.871,1855.87,"Why is that, I mean isn't that true with every criminal statute -"
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1855.87,1858.195,It is true of every criminal statute.
1978.77-1680,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1858.195,1860.436,"Well, this one believes in natural law of some kind."
1978.77-1680,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1860.436,1863.211,That's correct.
1978.77-1680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1866.197,1868.825,Mr. Howarth.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,1868.825,1873.803,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1903.562,1911.648,By doing that they were rejecting the Terry type of situation were they were not -- they were saying this was not a Terry stop.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,1911.648,1914.246,Certainly it was not a Terry stop and it was --
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1914.246,1916.001,What time of the day or night was this?
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,1916.001,1945.441,"10:00 PM, it was at 10:00 o'clock at night, but it was made very clear in the cross examination of the police officer, Officer Bednark at the preliminary examination that there was no fear of weapons that the arrest was being made for no other reason other than the fact that Mr. DeFillippo did not satisfy the particular standards of that police officer regarding his identification."
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2029.777,2031.834,Were any of these accurate?
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2031.834,2033.547,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2053.664,2056.65,Well you can't offer a proof before this court counsel.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2056.65,2072.025,"Alright but the question having been was that in fact accurate, I wanted to answer by responding although it is not in the record that there was certain proof that Mr. DeFillippo did in fact work for Sergeant Mash."
1978.77-1680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2072.025,2086.293,"Mr. Howarth on page 12 of the petition for certiorari, the first page of the opinion of Michigan Court of Appeals which is the court that laid down the rule that we are reviving here, I take it."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2110.529,2111.577,I would agree with that.
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2124.651,2129.774,Are telling us we should not accept what Mr. Justice Rehnquist just read to you out of the opinion.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2129.774,2131.493,"No I am not, what I am --"
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2131.493,2137.46,"Either accept it or we don't, and if we accept it we can't accept any of your hypotheses."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2137.46,2145.903,What I would say merely is that the joint appendix filed with the court makes three references to the answer given by Mr. DeFillippo.
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2161.491,2180.506,"Well would you say that at that time and in those circumstances in an alley, after 10:00 o'clock at night, presumably after dark that the police officer's suspicions were being aroused by at least the ambiguity that you are suggesting."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2180.506,2183.398,The police officer could have been suspicious.
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.943,2230.579,Don't you agree that the Michigan Court of Appeals proceeded on the basis at least on the assumption that there was reasonable suspicion for a stop and then also proceeded on the assumption that there was probable cause to arrest under the ordinance and then struck down the ordinance.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2230.579,2233.329,They may have although Mr. Justice --
1978.77-1680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2233.329,2240.538,Why should we independently make some factual determination that's never been made in the state courts?
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2240.538,2240.667,The difficulty--
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.667,2242.014,That have been passed on.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2242.014,2256.145,"The difficulty that I have had with this particular proposition and has been pointed out in the brief, in the State of Michigan probable cause is not sufficient to arrest for an ordinance violation, an officer must have actual proof of the existence of an ordinance violation."
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2257.047,2270.166,"That may be so but the, I don't know, suppose the Michigan appellate court would just unnecessarily breach the constitutional question then would abide on by these preliminary questions, wouldn't they?"
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2270.166,2274.561,Certainly the Michigan Court of Appeals went directly to the constitutionality of the ordinance.
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2457.162,2461.384,But you don't need a document to identify yourself do you?
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2461.384,2464.029,That is unclear under the Detroit ordinance.
1978.77-1680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.95,2492.594,That is true that the ordinance makes criminal only a refusal not an inability.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2492.594,2495.663,"That is correct, but it would allow a detention."
1978.77-1680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2495.663,2496.702,And there is a difference.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2496.702,2498.19,That is correct.
1978.77-1680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2498.19,2510.006,"A person in a bathing suit, you can and ask him his name, he just gives you his name you ask him for his driver's license, he says I am sorry I don't have my driver license in my bathing suit, that's not a refusal."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2510.006,2512.998,"No, but it would be an inability and it could cause his detention."
1978.77-1680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2512.998,2515.427,But an inability is not criminal under the ordinance.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2515.427,2517.42,No it would not.
1978.77-1680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2517.42,2538.15,"Then the predicate for all of this is reasonable cause to believe that behavior of an individual wants further investigation and if you define that as a grounds for a Terry type stop, you have certainly eliminated a lot of people from the purview of the ordinance, haven't you?"
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2538.15,2551.37,"You have Mr. Justice Rehnquist eliminated many people but certainly not all people because anybody who is in the vicinity of criminal activity might be considered to be in a suspicious circumstance, such as Mr. DeFillippo."
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2569.058,2573.373,How many other people we nearby in this dark alley?
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2573.373,2578.9,"The record is unclear, the record merely states that the officers observed two people."
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2578.9,2590.389,"Well, then that means up here that there were only two people on this record and the court has so indicated that Michigan Courts have taken that for granted?"
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2590.389,2601.752,"The answer which I gave earlier stating that many people could have been involved would not necessarily apply to the particular situation in DeFillippo, but in many situations which could occur."
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2601.752,2604.032,We are only treating one situation here now.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2604.032,2605.127,I understand.
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2623.896,2635.581,"Well, of course, if we only put it this way the question in Detroit or Michigan can people be detained as material witnesses?"
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2635.581,2645.014,"I am not familiar with any material witness statute in the State of Michigan which would allow detention of people on the street, however applying your question --"
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2645.014,2651.557,If police officers don't get the witnesses then and there very often the odds are they won't get them at all.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2651.557,2683.112,"That is correct the and certainly, if this had been a felony arrest as opposed to misdemeanor arrest, the officer would have the obligation to produce res gestae witnesses and Mr. DeFillippo could have been considered a res gestae witness to whatever crime the young lady was being arrested for, but the young lady arrested for a misdemeanor and there is no res gestae rule in the State of Michigan which requires the police officer to ascertain the names of all parties in the presence of a misdemeanor arrest."
1978.77-1680,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2683.112,2693.321,"Mr. Howarth, part three of your brief you state and argue that the Detroit Common Council lacked good faith in enacting this ordinance."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2693.321,2694.3,Yes.
1978.77-1680,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2694.3,2699.22,Is there any evidence in this record to support that rather serious charge.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2699.22,2703.1,The evidence in the record comes form two sources.
1978.77-1680,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2709.201,2712.151,"Is this in the record, is this in the record?"
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2712.151,2728.874,"That is not in the record and we had hoped to included in the brief before the court under the principle of a brandeis brief and that it is documented material that we have put into the statement of facts, and we had asked the court to consider that."
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2763.938,2776.059,Can you point to anything in any of the opinions of the Michigan Courts that indicate they thought what you are presenting to us now in this brandeis concept was relevant to this case?
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2776.059,2777.524,No and the reason for that Mr. Justice --
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2777.524,2781.456,Then why we should spend any time considering it here.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2781.456,2811.794,"Well, the issue was raised before the Michigan Court of Appeals, but not reached, and we thought that under the position of this court in Smith versus (Inaudible), a fact that if facts as we allege them are true, that perhaps the matter should be remanded to the Michigan Court of Appeals to reach that question, it has been raised before the Michigan Court of Appeals that there was a state preemption problem involved in this case, that ordinance violations dealing with emergency situations."
1978.77-1680,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2828.671,2835.249,Was it argued to the Michigan Court that the police officer also acted in bad faith another charge you make in your brief?
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2835.249,2839.994,Yes Mr. Justice Powell we did -- the state.
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2953.057,2962.754,"May I ask you a moment, how you interpret this statement of the appellate court, you can probably explain it."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2978.591,2980.054,I think they did not.
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2988.589,2998.618,"But aren't we rather, shouldn't we take for granted that what the statute means if such state court has construed it."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,2998.618,3003.652,I don't know that we would necessarily be compelled to accept the ruling of the state court on that.
1978.77-1680,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3003.652,3013.329,"Well if you have a lawful arrest, the violation of a valid criminal statute at the time of arrest, you can search that person lawfully."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3013.329,3016.491,That would be correct under the Robison decision.
1978.77-1680,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3016.491,3018.912,Under established Fourth Amendment law.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3018.912,3019.556,I would agree with you.
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3019.556,3036.596,"But apparently, that maybe true under the Fourth Amendment but I thought you were suggesting that the State has in this very ordinance has restricted the officer's freedom to make a full search even if he makes a valid arrest under this ordinance."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3036.596,3054.541,"The following section to the ordinance, the ordinance in question is ordinance number 52.3, the following section is Section 52.4, Section 52.4 is the Section which states that if an arrest is made under Section 52.3."
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3054.541,3058.134,That would be if you arrest a person for refusing to identify himself.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3058.134,3061.286,That is correct as the law now stands.
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3066.838,3071.977,But was 52.4 enforced that time this arrest was made?
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3071.977,3074.264,"It was enforced, it is still enforced today."
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3079.828,3093.863,"So you are suggesting that under State law this ordinance, this search was invalid even if the ordinance was, even if the ordinance was valid, even if the arrest was valid, the search was invalid because of 52.4."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3093.863,3095.118,That is correct.
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.118,3097.617,But that isn't what the Court of Appeals held is it?
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3097.617,3113.75,"No, and the reason I believe for that is that the Court of Appeals was correctly holding that under United States versus Robinson, once an arrest is made even for a traffic stop, even for an ordinance violation, this court has held that a full search maybe made --"
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.75,3120.492,Yeah but as far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned but certainly it doesn't say that a state may not restrict the power of its officer.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3120.492,3131.722,That is correct and we believe that under Section 52.4 the city officers actually were restricted from doing anything other than making a Terry type pat-down.
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.722,3142.098,"Well this, the substance for the possession of which he was prosecuted was found on package of cigarettes after he was taken to the station house, wasn't it?"
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3142.098,3154.326,"The tin foil packet was found on the scene, tin foil packet was not searched to determine the presence of Phencyclidine until he got to the station house."
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3154.326,3165.236,"But you think the, do you think the search that found the tin foil went beyond the search that the ordinance authorized for a valid arrest."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3165.236,3166.652,That is correct.
1978.77-1680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3262.135,3281.622,"Well, but there is a difference let's, you are saying that you may, your case has good many familiar names, because I have wrote some of those and wouldn't there be a difference -- let's say a state legislature should say no warrant will ever be required in this state for the arrest or search of anybody."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3286.149,3287.203,That is correct.
1978.77-1680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3287.203,3299.366,"But here, and therefore an arrest without a warrant would still regardless of that statute would still be unconstitutional unless it were with one, under one of the exceptions of the Fourth Amendment."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3320.273,3323.595,I perceive them as being more similar.
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3387.475,3403.136,"Well let's take one that's very specific, speed limit of 55 miles adopted by a State not a Federal and a the car is arrested going 75 miles an hour, is the question of good faith there --"
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3403.136,3403.431,There should not be --
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3403.431,3409.577,This officer is under a mandate to arrest people going over 55 miles an hour isn't it.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3409.577,3410.132,I agree.
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3410.132,3417.391,Now suppose that a search of the car disclosed that the car was loaded with heroin.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3433.851,3453.561,I would think not and the difference being that we will be talking about a statute which I perceive to have been something this court has discussed as a technical violation of the constitution as opposed to what this court talked about in Sibron versus New York being those statutes which themselves trench on Fourth Amendment rights.
1978.77-1680,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3487.485,3491.647,The vagueness and over breath don't have anything to do with the Fourth Amendment -- with due process?
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3491.647,3492.7,Vagueness and over breath can.
1978.77-1680,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3492.7,3494.021,They have to do with due process.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3494.021,3495.936,They are due process arguments.
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3515.693,3524.279,All you are suggesting is that any statute that happen to pick up the standard that Terry announced would be unconstitutionally vague.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3524.279,3532.006,"The standard would not deal with the Terry standard as much as would deal with the identification standard which is the, which is the real problem."
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3532.006,3537.861,You aren't defending the other part then of the Michigan Court of Appeals opinion on vagueness.
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3537.861,3540.363,The vagueness dealing with the fact that the --
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3540.363,3542.146,"Standard, no standard."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3542.146,3549.076,"The standard dealing with, whether the citizen will know when he must provide identification no I do agree with the Michigan Court of Appeals on that."
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3549.674,3554.215,"Well that just must means, that just means that the Terry standard is unconstitutional."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3554.215,3571.815,"I don't know that the Terry standard gave no recognition to the fact that a citizen must answer questions and I have -- we have no objection with the right of the police officer to ask questions of the citizen, it the question of whether the citizen must be compelled to answer."
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3571.815,3588.861,"I might also ask or say that your 52.4 just says, seems to me that if, if you make a kind of a stop, a 52.3 contemplate so you may pat him down if you have reasonable cause to believe that he is dangerous."
1978.77-1680,1,30927,james_c_howarth,,3595.292,3598.467,"Well, we had interpreted it as being the really the arrest --"
1978.77-1680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3598.467,3608.046,"Well, I know apparently you do interpret it that way, but that certainly isn't the way the Court of Appeals interpreted it."
1978.77-1680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3608.046,3608.737,Thank you gentlemen.
