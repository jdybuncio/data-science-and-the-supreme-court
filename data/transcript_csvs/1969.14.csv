1969.14,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,50.667,"Number 14, Wheeler and others against Montgomery and others."
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,50.667,53.2,May it please the Court.
1969.14,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,54.904,58.302,"Mr. Sitkin, you may proceed."
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,58.302,74.589,"This case involves the question of what procedural rights are to be afforded to the most dependent members of our society: the aged, the disabled, the blind, and the children of the poor."
1969.14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,129.446,133.516,Is this a federally part-- federally funded program?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,133.516,134.146,"Yes, it is."
1969.14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,241.632,247.359,"Mr. Sitkin, you said that a person becomes eligible after a full investigation."
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,258.18,260.894,"No, there is no trial type hearing prior to eligibility."
1969.14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,260.894,262.134,What is the procedure?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,262.134,268.984,An individual applies to the Welfare Department and information is provided by that individual.
1969.14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,297.3,301.64,But there’s not an open hearing with confrontation and cross-examination and--
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,301.64,304.403,Not for an individual who’s applying for assistance.
1969.14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,304.403,305.121,No.
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,305.121,314.846,The issue before this Court is whether or not an individual who has already been found eligible prior to the withholding of those benefits should be afforded an opportunity--
1969.14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,314.846,315.826,I understand what the issue is.
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,324.671,325.454,Right.
1969.14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,325.454,331.252,"My question was directed to the how did he become eligible in the first place and that’s, as I understand it, not anything like a trial type hearing."
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,331.252,332.141,There is no hearing.
1969.14,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,351.372,354.12,Who determines the eligibility?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,354.12,355.018,Initially?
1969.14,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,355.018,355.593,Yes.
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,355.593,381.309,"The County Welfare Department in the particular-- in California, the welfare programs are administered locally by County Welfare Departments, although the overall supervision of the program rests with the State Department of Social Welfare, but it is the individual County Welfare Department, usually in the person of the social worker or the social work supervisor who initially approves the application for eligibility."
1969.14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,394.63,395.991,Is that a trial type hearing?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,395.991,398.963,"Yes, that is a trial type hearing."
1969.14,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,398.963,414.775,Is it your contention that once a person has been declared eligible by this county authority that he cannot be cut off without depriving him of a constitutional privilege?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,414.775,439.091,"Yes, it is our position that once a person is found eligible for public assistance, if he is not afforded opportunity to be heard with respect to the reasons for discontinuance, then his rights in the Due Process Clause would be violated since he is not being afforded a fair opportunity to contest the very reasons upon which the governmental agency has made its decision to terminate benefit."
1969.14,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,439.091,446.108,And there never was any contest of that originally of eligibility?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,446.108,452.757,"At the time that the individual applied for aid, he did meet the qualifications for the program."
1969.14,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,452.757,458.699,"He met the qualifications, but was there any trial type procedure?"
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,458.699,460.408,"Well, there would be no need in--"
1969.14,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,460.408,468.668,Was there any-- was there any trial type procedure when he was first declared eligible?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,468.668,478.533,There would only have been a trial type procedure if the Welfare Department had initially found the individual to be ineligible and then he took an appeal from that initial determination.
1969.14,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,478.533,483.198,Is it your answer then that there was no trial type procedure in these cases?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,483.198,487.42,There is no trial type procedure when an individual applies to welfare.
1969.14,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,487.51,497.238,"He is ineligible without any trial type of procedure, and you’re argument is that it’s unconstitutional to cut him off without a trial type procedure."
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,497.238,504.373,That is our position.
1969.14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,658.816,665.532,"The real issue between you and your adversary, I-- unless I’m mistaken, is when this hearing need be given, isn’t it?"
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,665.532,667.074,That is the basic issue in the case.
1969.14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,667.074,674.655,"Because the hearing of the kind and quality that you’re talking about is ultimately given under the law, isn’t it?"
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,674.655,674.796,"Yes, it is."
1969.14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,674.796,675.934,That’s ultimately given.
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,675.934,704.044,"The hearing is ultimately given, but it is our contention that given the injury that occurs to an individual when benefits are withdrawn, that in those relatively few cases, and I underscore that, the relatively few cases where the question of ineligibility is contested, an individual should be given an opportunity to have this type of hearing prior to the withdrawal of benefits."
1969.14,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,779.208,796.53,"With the second, suppose California said after this three-day hearing, we will continue, but if you don’t successfully meet the appeal procedure within 60 days, you’re out."
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,796.53,804.561,That-- if that administrative decision was made by the State of California that would be satisfactory to the appellants in this case.
1969.14,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,805.467,812.077,"So, to make it final, your real criticism is to cut off the money for two months."
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,812.077,815.986,"Yes, if in fact California was adhering to the 60-day requirement."
1969.14,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,815.986,828.107,"Suppose California said you lose in the first instance and you win in the second instance and so, we give you the two months if you win."
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,828.107,848.726,"If-- you’re saying that if we lose in the first instance and we win in the second instance and then we get retroactive benefits, that is not sufficient to fully make whole, if you will, the individuals who were terminated from assistance."
1969.14,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,875.183,877.492,What’s the case you’re referring to?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,877.492,889.109,The case was the case in Florida where an individual was when the Florida law precluded--
1969.14,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,889.109,890.465,Did the case reach this Court?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,890.465,891.126,"Yes, it was."
1969.14,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,891.126,891.698,It was decided.
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,891.698,894.93,Nash versus Florida Industrial Commission.
1969.14,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,894.93,895.806,What’s the citation?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,895.806,910.882,The citation to the case is 389 US 235.
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1013.602,1027.593,"May I ask you of-- suppose a pension has been granted or receipt or whatever you call it, and the Congress or the legislature wants to repeat it."
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1030.691,1032.287,"No, it is not our position."
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1060.229,1075.501,"Has that ever-- question ever been tested with reference to any pension, Revolution War pension, Civil War pension, Spanish-American pension, or the First and Second World War pension?"
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1075.501,1109.176,"I don’t believe that the specific issue before this Court in this case has been tested with respect to the procedural rights that are to be afforded individuals, but there have been cases that have been decided by this Court that have indicated that however one characterizes the interest, that government must act in a fair and reasonable way in the administration of programs where basic interests are involved, whether one characterizes it as a right, as a vested right, or as a privilege."
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1109.176,1123.388,"Well, would it be your position that a pension cannot be cut off where once it’s been decided that a man gets a pension without giving him some kind of hearing before it’s cut off?"
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1123.388,1133.591,"One-- to answer that question directly, one would have to be aware of the circumstances under which the pension was granted."
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1133.591,1135.556,Just the pension?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1142.054,1143.089,"Well, under those--"
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1143.089,1145.882,Of course the government doesn’t have to grant it.
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1145.882,1174.429,"The government does not have to grant it in the first instance, but once it does grant it and assuming that the legislation remains in effect, then the individual should be entitled to continue to receive that pension until he is afford-- unless there’s a determination which is reached after a reasonable opportunity to adjudicate the matter, the individual is no longer eligible for that pension."
1969.14,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1174.429,1183.123,"You’re not suggesting that the legislature would have to consult with anyone if the legislature decided to repeal the entire program, would-- are you?"
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1183.123,1184.048,"No, not at all."
1969.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1215.077,1219.675,How about employment termination?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1230.141,1239.449,My position that you do have a right to have a hearing which ahs the basic elements of due process before termination--
1969.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1239.449,1242.563,What’s this Court said about that?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1242.563,1262.683,"This Court, in the case of Green versus McElroy which, admittedly, was not a constitutional decision but spoken constitutional terms, indicated that basic procedural protections are indeed essential before the right to-- public employment is withdrawn."
1969.14,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1262.683,1269.895,"But in Cafeteria Workers that was not made quite as rigid, was it?"
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1269.895,1270.144,No.
1969.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.56,1323.909,Do you mean that the pay of a federal employee may not be stopped pending a hearing?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1332.528,1346.883,This Court has held in cases where there has not been the overwriting interest of national security that a public employee does have an opportunity to be afforded an opportunity be heard--
1969.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1346.883,1347.656,Before his pay--
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1347.656,1349.012,Before his--
1969.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.012,1351.074,Before his pay is stopped.
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1351.074,1355.473,Before his benefits are-- before his wages are taken.
1969.14,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1355.473,1359.826,In what case did the Court hold that?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1359.826,1362.218,"As I indicated, in the case of Green versus McElroy--"
1969.14,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1362.218,1371.537,"It didn’t deal, did it, with the question of when the pay could be stopped in relation to the time of the hearing?"
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1398.326,1424.714,"In the case of Sloucher versus the City of New York, the individual in that particular case was afforded an opportunity to be heard before his wages were withdrawn."
1969.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1424.714,1428.663,Did the Court hold that the state had to do that?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1428.663,1429.571,Excuse me?
1969.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.571,1432.926,"Did the Court hold that the state had to do that, to afford such a hearing?"
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1432.926,1435.45,I believe so.
1969.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1435.45,1458.785,"Well let’s assume, for example, that there is no constitutional requirement for a trial type hearing before termination of employment and before at least termination of the man’s pay, although he has-- may have ultimately a right to a trial type hearing."
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1468.509,1472.139,I would say that the welfare recipient is entitled to such a hearing.
1969.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1472.139,1474.801,Regardless of what the employee is--
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1474.801,1477.973,Regardless of what the employee is entitled to--
1969.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1477.973,1478.084,"Now, what if--"
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1478.084,1487.546,"Because, again, the individual was on public assistance, really is receiving the last public defense."
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1487.546,1493.265,I’d like the answer to be clear about this part of your argument.
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1519.559,1519.981,Not at all.
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1538.861,1542.978,But then I guess-- maybe I’m-- my question was right.
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1570.353,1578.092,"If there is an individual dispute regarding eligibility, then the individual should be afforded a hearing."
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1581.911,1582.076,Well--
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1582.076,1585.548,We’re not asking for a hearing which has all the--
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1585.548,1588.494,"Well, I’m saying you say they have to have notice before the--"
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1588.494,1588.692,Yes.
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1588.692,1589.312,Government cut it off?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1589.312,1590.362,Right.
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1590.362,1600.911,"Now, after the Civil War, there were large numbers of gratuity given in this country of food and meat and raiment of various kinds."
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1608.023,1609.104,Not to my knowledge.
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1609.104,1625.554,"Has there ever been one before with reference to gratuity where it has been insisted that a pure gratuity, a man has such a right to it after he once gets it, that he must have notice before the government cuts it off?"
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1628.484,1633.289,There is no direct holding with respect to a welfare--
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1633.289,1640.709,Not the wel-- this statute and on any statute in the history of the government.
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1640.709,1648.899,"There-- in the case of Goldsby versus Garfield, which, was decided in 1908--"
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1648.899,1649.897,What was that?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1649.897,1652.504,Goldsby versus Garfield.
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1652.504,1655.617,What report?
1969.14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1655.617,1658.649,Citation.
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1658.649,1660.08,What report is the case?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1660.08,1661.285,I don’t have the citation.
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1664.345,1665.779,And what Court was it?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1665.779,1668.261,It was the United States Supreme Court.
1969.14,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1668.261,1671.41,Is it in your table of cases of you brief?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1671.41,1675.639,"No, it’s in the amicus brief in the companion case."
1969.14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1684.978,1686.614,What’s that about?
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1686.614,1727.132,"In that case, it was a question of the government providing to individuals Indian lands, and Mr. Goldsby in that case was initially found eligible for an allotment of this land provided by the federal government and the Court held in that case that the action of the Secretary in removing Mr. Goldsby from the roles of the individuals who were entitled to that land without affording Mr. Goldsby an opportunity to be heard and notice was a violation of due process."
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1727.132,1732.593,"They held to cut him off from land that he had been legally held on, didn’t he?"
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1732.593,1733.586,"Well, that was the issue."
1969.14,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1736.157,1738.74,They found that he legally own it.
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1738.74,1743.516,"No, the Court did not find that he did or did not legally hold that land."
1969.14,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.369,1766.686,"Mr. Sitkin, I remind you, you’re now cutting into your rebuttal time."
1969.14,0,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,1766.686,1769.943,"Yes, I think I will conclude at this particular point."
1969.14,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1819.388,1823.113,"Thank you, Mr. Sitkin."
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1823.257,1824.721,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1938.645,1952.036,"Mrs. Palmer, how can the recipient test that out as to how reliable it is and how non-hearsay it is and how- how can the recipient test that out?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1952.036,1957.756,"With the assistance of the Office of Economic Opportunity attorneys, Your Honor."
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1957.756,1958.134,I didn’t mean--
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1958.134,1975.885,"I didn’t-- I’m not being facetious, Your Honor, but with counsel as able as my opponent here and with the offices of the Office of Economic Opportunity, they are closely scrutinizing this and, also, Mr. Montgomery--"
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1975.885,1976.077,They didn’t--
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1976.077,1978.018,The appellee is-- I beg your pardon.
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1978.018,1979.19,"Excuse me, Mrs. Palmer."
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1979.19,1979.273,Yes.
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1979.273,1983.389,I’m talking about before the end of this three-day period.
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1985.305,1988.321,"The case record is open, Your Honor."
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1995.298,1996.83,That’s all given to the recipient?
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1996.83,2000.391,There-- the case record is right there to be opened to the recipient.
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2000.391,2000.489,There’s a given--
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2000.489,2004.12,"Any time-- at any time with counsel, Your Honor."
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.12,2006.69,"Well, the recipient without counsel?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2006.69,2011.419,The recipient without counsel can walk in and look at his or her record too.
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2011.419,2013.198,Is it turned over to him?
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2013.198,2013.953,Absolutely.
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2014.066,2018.059,"Or is it handed to him to say that “if you want to look at it, you could look at it.”"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2018.059,2018.907,"I beg your pardon, sir?"
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2018.907,2020.376,Is it just said “here it is.
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2022.917,2023.823,They walk in.
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2036.409,2039.372,"Well, what do they get in writing?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2039.372,2041.153,"In the case record, sir?"
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2041.153,2041.944,"Yes, please."
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2041.944,2044.987,"In the case record, there is the narrative of every--"
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2044.987,2051.9,"No, I mean, what is the recipient handed that tells the recipient this is what is-- you were wrong about."
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2051.9,2052.234,Alright.
1969.14,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2147.971,2150.494,What county was that you said had had a million?
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2150.494,2157.092,"Los Angeles County, Your Honor, with around 11,500 welfare workers."
1969.14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2159.599,2161.0,"11,000 welfare workers?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2161.0,2171.757,"11,500 welfare workers in Los Angeles County and over-half-a million welfare recipients."
1969.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2234.741,2247.107,What happens at the pre-termination stage where there is this conflict and there’s a last conflict of fact?
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2261.28,2266.249,"Well, if it’s a factual situation, Your Honor, then it is a difficult question."
1969.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2275.659,2281.874,"Well, that’s what your adversary is talking about."
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2281.874,2294.855,"Then, if it’s on a policy matter, there is an immediate review by the State Department, not the fair hearing, but on whether, under these facts, this policy should be applicable."
1969.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2294.855,2296.512,I’m not talking about policy.
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2310.403,2330.688,"Your Honor, in-- the Wheeler case is a perfect example of conflicting evidence, but if the State Department had been consulted, there was a misapplication of regulations to the facts even with the dispute."
1969.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2379.899,2383.725,"This case, in fact, involved the kind of factual issue to which my brother Harlan referred to."
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2383.725,2385.066,Yes.
1969.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2385.066,2385.729,Didn’t it?
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2385.729,2386.064,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2386.064,2391.638,This Mrs. Wheeler was the-- received the proceeds of her deceased son’s veteran’s insurance policy.
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2391.638,2391.904,That is true.
1969.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2391.904,2393.725,At least she was the beneficiary under that.
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2393.725,2394.664,That is true.
1969.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2394.664,2412.318,"And the son died, and the department claimed that she had received the proceeds and she claimed that she had transferred the proceeds to a nephew, first, claiming that it was debt of her son to the nephew and then amending her story to say that it was carrying out her son’s--"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2412.318,2412.903,Dying wishes.
1969.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2412.903,2414.317,Dying wish.
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2414.317,2441.375,"And with the obligation to report these funds and not having done so despite conferences with her-- interviews with her case worker, I presume that that had some human element of doubting the story. Getting to the fair hearing and the link of time that it takes for the fair hearing, in appellant’s reply brief, there is set forth a table that I found shocking of the case’s fair hearings that have been pending from one to two years."
1969.14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2618.613,2636.73,"Is there anything in this record, Mrs. Palmer, about what success the State of California has had in recouping of payments improperly made to recipients who were determined not to be eligible?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2636.73,2637.221,No.
1969.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2716.958,2721.055,"But, we’re not-- there-- in this case, there’s no issues about general assistance."
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2721.055,2721.446,No.
1969.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2722.672,2727.71,Is it the amount of it or how one becomes eligible or how one becomes ineligible or anything else?
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2729.154,2729.816,No.
1969.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2729.816,2732.173,Except the federal assisted categorical program?
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2732.173,2740.645,"Yes, and I wanted to make that clear, Your Honor, because I believe that the New York case does involve general relief or home assistance."
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2740.645,2751.549,"May I ask of you what position you take when a person has been put on the program to get the money, the relief."
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2751.549,2751.78,Your Honor--
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2751.78,2754.329,The state wants to terminate it.
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2756.912,2759.681,"Your Honor, we submit that we do give a hearing, but--"
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2759.681,2760.353,You what?
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2760.353,2769.124,"We do, this pre-withholding procedure and hearing satisfies due process under the circumstances of the case."
1969.14,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2789.781,2793.355,"Well, do you mean satisfy the requirement for notice?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2793.355,2794.414,Notice and--
1969.14,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2794.414,2795.086,Hearing?
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2795.086,2801.009,And a hearing or a conference says-- as it is termed.
1969.14,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2801.451,2808.244,There’s no dispute that they are not entitled to it or as to the date in which they are trying to put into effect?
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2808.244,2820.015,"Your Honor, when-- if I understand correctly, on following a fair hearing and the if the decision is in favor of the claimant, it is retroactive to the date of termination."
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2822.556,2831.103,"Mrs. Palmer, part of due process to have a hearing officer that has no interest whatsoever in the matter?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2831.103,2834.478,"It depends upon the circumstances, Your Honor."
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2835.827,2842.664,"Well, is it your idea of due process that the person making the charges should arbitrate it?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2842.664,2851.493,California Supreme Court has held in Griggs against Board of Education that one--
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2851.493,2862.948,"I have great respect of the California Supreme Court, but I still don’t believe the California Supreme Court has ever said that the person making the charge has the right to judge it."
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2863.587,2863.649,It isn’t--
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2863.649,2864.463,I’d like to hear that.
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2864.463,2867.919,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor, it isn’t a charge."
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2880.551,2886.499,"Well, what do you say to Mr. Sitkin’s point that it’s a question of whether the person eats or not?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2888.441,2893.003,"Your Honor, I can’t defend the welfare system, and I don’t think anyone can."
1969.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2918.895,2932.042,"Mrs. Palmer, does the federal law permit a state to terminate benefits pending a full trial type hearing?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2932.042,2934.077,"Yes, Your Honor, they do."
1969.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2934.165,2937.148,Although the federal law requires a fair hearing?
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2937.148,2938.959,That requires a fair hearing and--
1969.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2938.959,2945.428,It’s enough to satisfy the federal law if you grant the fair hearing after the determination of benefits?
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2945.428,2946.7,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1969.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2946.7,2959.274,"But, at the same time, I suppose the federal law would continue to support the state program if the state didn’t terminate pending the--"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2959.274,2960.838,"That is true, Your Honor."
1969.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2963.353,2980.732,"If California wanted to, after the informal conference where termination was decided on, if California wanted to continue benefits pending a full trial type hearing, the federal government would contribute?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2980.732,2982.056,That is correct.
1969.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.056,2987.035,"But, also, if California doesn’t want to do that, which it doesn’t, the federal law--"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,2987.035,2989.912,That is the auction of the state.
1969.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.912,3000.732,"So, under the federal statute, the federal authorities construe the fair hearing provision, I take it, to be satisfied by California system?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,3000.732,3009.44,"Yes, that is correct, Your Honor, and the brief of the Solicitor General confirms that."
1969.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3009.44,3025.534,"Mrs. Palmer, as I understand it, the state’s position is that what is now provided before actual termination satisfies due process?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,3025.534,3026.893,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3026.893,3043.088,"And do I understand that inquisit in that is a concession that, constitutionally, something in the way of due process must be afforded before there may be a termination?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,3043.088,3047.763,"That- yes, Your Honor."
1969.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3059.181,3074.733,"That being so, I gather the issue for us, if that concession states constitutionally the requirement is simply whether what you do provide does satisfy the constitutional conflict--"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,3074.733,3076.875,That is the conflict.
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3108.761,3118.64,"Mrs. Palmer, I draw that if the recipient says “I need more than these three days to get these affidavits,” they would give them that extra time?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,3118.64,3121.134,"I can’t answer that, Your Honor. I’m sorry."
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3121.134,3122.422,"I imagine it would vary, wouldn’t it?"
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,3122.422,3123.429,It would vary.
1969.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3123.429,3127.624,But there’s nothing in the matter before us that says it has its way on it.
1969.14,1,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,3129.118,3150.375,"No, there’s nothing in the record about it, and I was interested in counsel stating that the only time they want the full fair hearing prior to termination is when there are “factual conflicts,” I believe was the statement."
1969.14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3302.019,3305.791,"Thank you, Mrs. Palmer."
1969.14,2,38308,peter_e_sitkin,,3309.432,3310.684,No.
1969.14,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3310.684,3312.08,The case is submitted.
