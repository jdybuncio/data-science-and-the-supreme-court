1989.88-512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.598,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-512, Michigan v. Tyris Lemont Harvey."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,10.298,17.414,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,120.513,121.704,Mr. Baughman.
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,121.704,122.174,Yes.
1989.88-512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,122.174,128.478,I guess you concede that there is a Sixth Amendment violation here.
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,128.478,129.169,Yes.
1989.88-512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.919,145.798,When did the Sixth Amendment violation occur?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,145.798,156.447,I would say that it occurred when the police officer continued to question respondent after the colloquy about whether or not he should talk to his attorney.
1989.88-512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,156.447,165.453,Is the admission of the statements at trial itself a Sixth Amendment violation or not?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,165.453,168.085,Well... yes.
1989.88-512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.689,178.411,You don't think there's a violation even though he didn't use it?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,178.411,184.126,"Well, I would say if... if nothing was used at trial, the issue wouldn't be presented as--"
1989.88-512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.126,188.087,I thought you had told me the violation occurred when the statements were taken.
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,188.087,188.988,--That is correct.
1989.88-512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.295,216.477,"Well, it makes a difference analytically to know whether it is a violation of the Sixth Amendment when the testimony is offered at trial, or whether it's a violation of some prophylactic rule designed to protect Sixth Amendment rights."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,217.428,240.312,"--Well, the right to counsel with regard to custodial interrogation, it seems to me, can only ripen, if I can put it that way, when some evidence taken from the accused is offered in court."
1989.88-512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,251.559,254.611,"Well, that's a rather curious position to take, I think."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,264.967,271.592,"Well, either the Sixth Amendment or a prophylactic rule would be violated when the questions were asked, I suspect."
1989.88-512,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,286.843,301.372,Suppose the district attorney himself or herself had conducted the questioning after appointment of counsel and without a waiver.
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,338.429,347.296,"Well, again, I struggle with the question because it seemed to me that the Sixth Amendment was in essence a trial right."
1989.88-512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,361.184,364.567,"But the language of the Fifth Amendment is different, of course."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,364.567,365.336,That's correct.
1989.88-512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,365.336,367.179,It suggests that result.
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,369.45,381.157,"Well, the Sixth Amendment to me does not suggest on its face any necessary role for counsel at interrogation prior to the attachment of the right."
1989.88-512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,431.19,435.503,And the Michigan Court of Appeals relied on Jackson for its holding?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,435.503,436.573,"Yes, it did."
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,498.913,501.525,"Mr. Baughman, would you just... I was trying to remember this sequence."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,509.822,510.09,--Yes.
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,515.065,518.679,--So the prosecutor and the police knew he was represented and he had a lawyer that they could contact?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,518.679,521.058,I'm sure the police were undoubtedly aware of that.
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,528.734,534.718,Do you think the case would be any different... I'm just thinking of Justice Kennedy's question... if the questioning had been by the prosecutor?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,534.718,544.794,"As to the Sixth Amendment I don't think it would make a difference, but I think we'd be into a different question in the State of Michigan as to the application of the ethical standards."
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,544.794,546.124,"It would be clearly unethical, wouldn't it?"
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,546.124,546.855,"Yes, it would."
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,546.855,550.008,It's not unethical for the prosecutor to use an agent to do it?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,550.609,555.42,"Well, if the prosecutor used an agent, that is, told the police officer to go talk to him, I think that would also be unethical."
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,563.626,564.137,Do you think--
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,564.137,565.068,--did not know this was going on.
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,565.068,570.421,--Do you think the case would be different if the prosecutor had told the police officer to go ahead and see what you can find out?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,570.421,572.232,Under the cannons I think definitely it would be.
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,572.232,573.383,How about constitutionally?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,573.383,575.614,"No, I don't think it would be different constitutionally."
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,580.568,589.885,"But going back again to the constitutional question, you think it would not be a constitutional violation for the prosecutor himself or herself to go ahead and question the--"
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,589.885,593.919,I don't think the constitutional question would turn on who does the asking.
1989.88-512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.919,600.464,--I don't understand why you say that the case wouldn't be here because of the violation of the cannons.
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,604.657,605.076,"Well, no."
1989.88-512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,682.957,699.556,"Well, Counsel, if you take the position that the violation of the Sixth Amendment occurs at the time the evidence is offered at trial, then it seems to me very difficult to argue that it's only a prophylactic rule."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,718.29,720.912,"I think your Honor is correct, and I see your point."
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,741.545,746.387,"But, Counsel, is it not possible that there is a constitutional violation at both times?"
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,764.069,771.215,"Well, I think, for example, it's conceivable that the individual could be questioned and then no prosecution brought or the case dropped."
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.847,779.389,"Not after... after he's been indicted, do you think a police officer can come back and say, I've just asked him some questions and he says he's innocent so we'll drop the--"
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,779.389,780.28,"--No, I don't think so."
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,806.458,816.876,"--It's also true that if a violation... if you acknowledge a violation occurred at that time, then it's quite different from the Miranda situation in which the warning is given in order to avoid a violation."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,816.876,821.747,"Well, I... but I'm not conceding that what was violated in this case was the constitution of the questioning."
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,828.693,830.293,"Well, what is Michigan v. Jackson?"
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,831.355,846.746,"--Michigan v. Jackson states that if the individual has asserted his right to counsel, the police simply may not initiate any questioning with him unless he goes forward first, which is the precise rule of Edwards transposed from the Fifth Amendment into the Sixth Amendment."
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,862.635,865.268,To... To protect to avoid constitutional violation.
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,865.268,865.786,That's... that's correct.
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,865.786,868.48,But here you're saying a constitutional violation has occurred.
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,868.48,871.042,"No, I'm saying a Jackson violation has occurred."
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,881.899,888.143,I think you changed your position from your answer to Justice O'Connor which was that a constitutional violation occurred at the time of questioning.
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,888.143,889.482,"--Well, let me try to make it clear."
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,952.223,965.644,"Well, what if, taking Justice Kennedy's example, the police had taken him up into the courtroom and set him on the witness stand with nobody there except the prosecutor and the police and said, we'd just like to ask you a few questions, and he says, I don't know whether I should or not, and, maybe I ought to talk to my lawyer."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,978.23,981.131,"In other words, if everything that occurred here had occurred but in a different setting?"
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,981.131,991.59,"In a courtroom and the prosecutor himself or herself present and they say, we may not want to use this, but we just want to see how you respond to questions in a courtroom."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,991.59,996.483,"I think it may well be in those circumstances, and it may well be--"
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,996.483,1000.246,The question is would he have a right to have a... could they do that without having a lawyer with him?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1000.246,1008.15,"--Again, if he validly and intelligently and knowingly waived his right to counsel, I don't think the Sixth Amendment would be violated and it would turn on the facts of each case."
1989.88-512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.307,1056.723,"And they ruled that notwithstanding the failure to object to its use in the trial court, they would reach it and reverse the conviction."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1056.723,1057.582,That's correct.
1989.88-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.666,1091.368,Has Massiah got anything to do with this case?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1091.368,1098.962,"Well, if there is a... if there were a Sixth Amendment violation in this case, then it would be a violation of Massiah."
1989.88-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1099.794,1105.376,"Well, how about... is Massiah relevant to deciding whether there was a Sixth Amendment violation?"
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1105.376,1110.759,--I don't think absent Michigan v. Jackson what occurred here would necessarily be a Massiah.
1989.88-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.322,1113.211,Why not?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1113.211,1120.526,--Because the question would be... which has never been resolved... did the respondent validly waive his right to counsel when the police initiated the interrogation.
1989.88-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.03,1141.154,"Yeah, but there was a concern that he had a lawyer."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1141.154,1152.079,"Yes, there was a concern that he had a lawyer and there was a Sixth Amendment violation found because the right had attached and the court held it wasn't validly waived."
1989.88-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1162.966,1168.799,"Well, if he didn't waive it... but absent waiver, there was a Sixth Amendment violation just from the questioning."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1168.799,1170.622,"--That's true, absent waiver."
1989.88-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.257,1178.797,"Well, do--"
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1178.797,1179.799,If you don't find an initiation.
1989.88-512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1179.799,1185.741,--Didn't Massiah have an element of surreptitiousness to it on the part of the government?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1185.741,1186.581,Yes.
1989.88-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.667,1197.029,"So, just answering the questions didn't amount to a waiver?"
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1197.029,1198.01,--That's correct.
1989.88-512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1201.443,1205.817,Was there any doubt here that the defendant knew he was speaking to a police officer?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1205.817,1206.698,"Oh, no."
1989.88-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1278.554,1296.596,"If you have a defendant who has been given counsel and the police know he's got counsel, you think there is no violation of the Sixth Amendment if the police go to him and as if he would like to waive his right to counsel and talk?"
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1296.596,1297.587,That's correct.
1989.88-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1301.747,1311.724,You don't think it's a violation of the Sixth Amendment when the defendant has counsel for the police or the prosecution to approach the defendant?
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1311.724,1313.706,"Again, not necessarily."
1989.88-512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1335.764,1336.472,Excuse me.
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1364.521,1376.539,"Well, I don't know if that's exactly what this Court has done because, again, if you look to the Fifth Amendment, this Court has said the core is this... compelled self-incrimination... and here are some rules, prophylactic rules, to protect that core."
1989.88-512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1382.743,1392.478,"Of course, if there would be a Sixth Amendment violation just by the police approaching him, Jackson wouldn't have been necessary, I suppose."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1392.478,1393.499,That's correct.
1989.88-512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1488.423,1498.329,"Counsel, I thought there was some evidence in this case that the defendant himself told the police officer he'd like to make another statement."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1498.329,1499.479,"That's correct, there is."
1989.88-512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1502.321,1507.014,But you appear to concede that the police approached him.
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1507.904,1515.65,"--No, I... what I'm conceding is... because we conceded it in the trial court... is that when the defendant stated,"
1989.88-512,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1549.864,1558.64,"Well, if we adopt your rule, what's to prevent the police from just dropping by the jail cell every morning and saying,"
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1559.729,1567.195,"Well, I would submit that certainly abuse of police conduct shouldn't be allowed."
1989.88-512,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1568.704,1569.796,"Well, is that abusive?"
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1575.49,1582.114,"--Well, I think the deterrent is any... any evidence so gained can't be used in the case in chief."
1989.88-512,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1584.086,1588.559,"Well, they can't... they don't have that evidence anyway, by hypothesis."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1592.591,1593.543,"--Well, there is--"
1989.88-512,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1593.543,1599.015,"So far as the defendant is concerned, they are finished with him the minute they have... he has counsel."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1610.341,1616.717,--This Court faces the very same question in Haas.
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1662.046,1663.899,That's because the right to counsel hadn't attached.
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1663.899,1665.44,--That's correct.
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1668.452,1669.423,One is not a Fifth Amendment.
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1674.626,1675.387,--That's correct.
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1675.387,1677.888,The other is a consummated Sixth Amendment violation.
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1677.888,1684.233,"That's true, but as to the deterrent effect on the police on exclusion of impeachment evidence, I believe the situations are analogous."
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1723.837,1735.644,"But, Mr. Baughman, don't you recognize that there is... even under your ethical standards you referred to earlier about the prosecutor, if the right had not attached, the prosecutor could go ahead and interrogate the suspect, wouldn't he?"
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1735.644,1736.335,--Yes.
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1736.335,1746.112,"There wouldn't be any ethical violation then, but apparently under Michigan law there is a very sharp distinction between the relationship that arises once a man is charged and has a lawyer."
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1748.915,1749.446,Yes.
1989.88-512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1750.995,1752.027,"You think it shouldn't be, though?"
1989.88-512,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1752.027,1767.557,--I think the deterrent principle as to whether or not there's any deterrence gained or it's significant enough to warrant the detraction from the truth-finding process that happens when you exclude the evidence for impeachment purposes is simply the same in this situation as it is in Haas.
1989.88-512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1787.382,1790.104,"Thank you, Mr. Baughman."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,1791.334,1806.153,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, Respondent submits that this case involves the essence, the absolute unqualified essence of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel."
1989.88-512,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1839.826,1841.376,When did the violation occur?
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,1841.376,1846.321,"--The violation occurred both, Justice Connor--"
1989.88-512,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1846.321,1847.55,O'Connor.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,1847.55,1848.041,--O'Connor.
1989.88-512,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1889.187,1893.492,Can the defendant waive his Sixth Amendment right to counsel?
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,1893.492,1909.843,"A defendant can waive his Sixth Amendment right, certainly, but after assertion of the right then it is respondent's position that counsel has some role in that waiver."
1989.88-512,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1913.436,1920.499,"There was no determination here, I gather, of whether the defendant waive his right."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,1920.499,1922.923,"--There is... and I don't think there could be, frankly."
1989.88-512,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1924.874,1928.056,You don't think the court could have made that determination?
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,1928.056,1933.188,"--No, not on the record because the state also concedes... they concede the Sixth Amendment violation."
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2011.08,2014.854,"Well, wouldn't... wouldn't your argument be just as strong if it were just an Edwards' violation?"
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2014.854,2017.155,"--No, I don't believe so because--"
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2017.155,2029.853,"Well, the... the police would have every... the same... the same possible urge to go ahead and question, knowing that they could use the forbidden statements for impeachment."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2029.853,2031.744,"--Well, I think--"
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2031.744,2037.728,"They would also find out how he responds to questions, what his demeanor is."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2037.728,2042.012,"--I think, thought, Edwards involved a prophylactic rule."
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2045.155,2046.397,No.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2047.946,2048.397,--constitutional amendment.
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.397,2053.071,--That's just a difference in language as far as the possible advantage to the state is concerned.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2053.071,2059.734,"Well, it's a critical difference in language because in Edwards certainly there had been no assertion of the right to counsel."
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.734,2061.446,Well--
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2061.446,2064.447,Edwards is a prophylactic rule which--
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2064.447,2072.492,"--Well, for Edwards to take... for Edwards to take hold at all, there has to be an assertion of the right to counsel."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2076.755,2083.389,--But in Edwards I believe it was an assertion of right to counsel in a Fifth Amendment context.
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2083.389,2084.501,"Well, I know, but the--"
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2084.501,2085.913,And some would say--
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2085.913,2092.206,--but the rights certainly attach then that he had a right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment to--
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2092.206,2092.616,--The right--
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2092.616,2095.978,--to... for the lawyer to be there and the police weren't supposed to talk to him.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2095.978,2096.549,--The right--
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.549,2097.471,But they went ahead and talked to him.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2097.471,2100.492,--The right to counsel in that context attached.
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2113.93,2128.252,Are you saying that the police could not approach a defendant after he has perhaps been assigned counsel and asked him if he wanted to make a statement and the defendant could not waive that right?
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2128.252,2132.623,"--That, we submit, is the essence of the court's holding in Michigan v. Jackson."
1989.88-512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2132.623,2134.115,That's not a prophylactic rule?
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2137.248,2138.978,"That is core Sixth Amendment, that's correct."
1989.88-512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2138.978,2139.98,How do you get that from the text?
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2156.88,2165.325,"Well, because it is... that... you're approaching the defendant in the context of the adversarial process."
1989.88-512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2184.138,2185.097,"No, I don't think it means that."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2208.692,2213.898,It is the presence of counsel at that critical stage which is the core of the Sixth Amendment.
1989.88-512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2226.654,2227.946,That's the core?
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2234.22,2244.626,In Michigan v. Jackson the court uses... makes repeated reference to police-initiated--
1989.88-512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.626,2245.507,Yes.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2245.507,2252.173,"--In this case, though, the state concedes that Michigan v. Jackson is--"
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2252.173,2257.586,"Yes, but... but I thought your position was this right simply could not be waived once it attached."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2268.141,2284.113,--But I think the thrust of Jackson is that waiver in that context must be an exacting waiver and the court speaks of Johnson v. Zerbst.
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2295.489,2297.412,"Well, I'm not talking about a plea proceeding."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2313.832,2322.027,--It raises a troubling contradiction.
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2322.027,2323.599,What's the contradiction?
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2323.599,2361.844,"The notion that... contained in Jackson that in spite of full complete Miranda warnings, in spite of the fact that Jackson evidently made a voluntary statement, in spite of the fact that he made that statement knowingly, intelligently... a voluntary statement in compliance with Miranda... the court still held that because the right to counsel had attached that that waiver was not sufficient."
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2361.844,2369.158,"Yes, but the facts in Michigan against Jackson were that the police had initiated the thing."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2379.745,2385.07,"Well, the defendant is always free to forgo the right to counsel."
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2385.07,2394.357,"And he's... then, in my example, though, he's free to go to the police or ask the police... tell them, I want to make a statement."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2398.929,2409.495,Respondent's position would be that the police have an obligation to provide notice to the defendant's counsel that... that--
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2409.495,2411.508,Who... what case do you rely on for that?
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2411.508,2419.892,--We rely in essence of our reading of Michigan v. Jackson.
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2419.892,2421.933,Does Jackson say that?
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2421.933,2427.657,"Well, it says that there was no valid waiver."
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2433.962,2448.544,Then our Edwards decision and our Michigan against Jackson decision really make little sense because I thought both of those turned on the idea that there is a critical difference whether it's police-initiated or defendant-initiated.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2448.544,2457.048,"--But this Court in Henry, for example, said that within a Sixth Amendment context it is irrelevant who initiated the contact."
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2457.048,2463.243,"Well, there is an element of surreptitiousness that you also had in Massiah."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2463.243,2464.242,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.242,2482.265,"Well,... there is a violation of the Sixth Amendment somewhere in this process you started to argue about why the... why the statement that was taken could not be used for impeachment."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2491.761,2498.575,Because the analogy to the Fourth Amendment is simply inappropriate.
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.434,2548.63,What's the difference between this and the Miranda/Edwards situation?
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2548.63,2568.292,"Because Miranda as a prophylactic rule is just that, judicially crafted as the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule designed as an outer layer of protection not involving a direct violation of the constitutional amendment itself."
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2568.292,2583.322,"Yeah, but in terms of the theory of our cases that... allowing the use of this illegally-taken evidence for impeachment, I don't see why the rationale of those cases... or, maybe you can tell me why the rationale of those cases doesn't apply here."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2583.322,2585.563,Because--
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.563,2600.974,The defendant is testifying on the stand and he... and he testifies quite contrary to some statement he made to the police.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2600.974,2604.126,"--Of course, here it was not quite contrary."
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2605.167,2605.588,I know.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2609.83,2612.083,--My argument would cover--
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2612.083,2612.722,Yes.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2612.722,2626.89,"--that as well because in essence what I think the state is asking the court to do is to look through the wrong end of the telescope, to focus solely on the truth-seeking function to the exclusion of the larger context."
1989.88-512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2633.335,2635.088,So you think the balance should come out differently?
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2635.088,2640.13,"There should be no balancing at all, and that is our position."
1989.88-512,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2695.436,2711.858,"But if Michigan against Jackson is a prophylactic rule, then presumably we would get into a little balancing to determine if that's violated... whether the evidence can be used for impeachment."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2711.858,2725.125,"Assuming Michigan v. Jackson is prophylactic, it's respondent's position that here there was not only a violation of the prophylactic rules conceded by the state but also a substantive violation of the Sixth Amendment itself."
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2731.229,2733.59,But that's not what the Michigan Court of Appeals held.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2739.224,2740.025,That's correct.
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2766.262,2768.713,It sounds like our court.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2817.558,2821.249,"Well, that is the troubling contradiction that I fumbled badly previously."
1989.88-512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2869.571,2871.051,He later recognizes he was wrong.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,2896.549,2907.828,I... I think the lawyer plays a role and ultimately the police don't decide waiver.
1989.88-512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2994.194,3000.617,But the only upside they're asserting is to prevent the defendant from perjuring himself.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3021.011,3032.368,"--In engaging in the offending interrogation, I would not attribute the motive of preventing perjury to the state, frankly."
1989.88-512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3086.284,3087.847,We'd have a different question before us.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3095.092,3100.396,"Well, in this record it does not appear to be perjury."
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3132.305,3142.582,"Part of the reason for the Fifth Amendment rule in cases like Portash has been a feeling on the part of the court, hasn't it, that compelled testimony has an element of unreliability to it?"
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3142.582,3157.451,"I... I don't know if it was ever suggested, frankly, in Portash, who was compelled by virtue of an order to testify before a grand jury under oath."
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3157.451,3165.087,"So, you would distinguish that from cases where there is a suspicion of coercion, of a physical coercion?"
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3165.087,3167.809,They are obviously distinguishable.
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3184.609,3192.875,But hasn't... in the coerced confession cases part of the reasoning there has been that the coerced confession is deemed presumptively unreliable?
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3192.875,3194.096,That's correct.
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3194.096,3195.926,And certainly that wouldn't be true in this case.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3202.551,3213.577,"I don't know if it would lead to a presumption of unreliability, but the record in this case implicates or raises a concern for unreliability."
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3256.057,3258.639,"Well, but the Michigan Court of Appeals treated this as impeachment, didn't it?"
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3258.639,3260.42,They did treat it as an impeachment.
1989.88-512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3260.42,3262.282,"I mean, they didn't say it's not proper impeachment under our law."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3264.823,3278.242,"But my point is, the presence of counsel at that interrogation might have ensured that when respondent told the officer the name, it got into the statement."
1989.88-512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3337.044,3345.82,"Of course, you say it's a constitutional violation even if the police are not trying to prompt this... this statement by the defendant."
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3359.027,3360.019,That's my position.
1989.88-512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3360.019,3360.83,That's your position?
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3360.83,3361.708,"And if the respondent says,--"
1989.88-512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3361.708,3362.058,Yeah.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3362.058,3372.617,"--I want to confess, he can go to confess in open court where there is an exacting standard concerning that waiver, an exacting standard concerning all of the rights."
1989.88-512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3374.798,3378.151,His will by the Sixth Amendment has just maybe been taken over and given to the lawyer.
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3386.426,3390.519,"--Well, if that's his will, his will will overbear the lawyer certainly."
1989.88-512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3403.596,3404.097,[inaudible]
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3404.097,3407.2,Absolutely.
1989.88-512,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3425.912,3439.414,"Counsel, in Michigan I take it the rule is that it's unethical for defense counsel to knowingly introduce a line of perjured testimony?"
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3439.414,3440.632,That's correct.
1989.88-512,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3440.632,3459.666,"But what would happen if the police, after the appointment of counsel, took a statement and gave it to the counsel and it was quite clear from the statement, because it linked up with other evidence, that the client's original story he told to the police was perjured testimony?"
1989.88-512,1,39949,robert_m_morgan,,3462.717,3469.951,I think then we've implicated the court's ruling in Nicks v. Whiteside.
1989.88-512,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3469.951,3476.496,"In other words, you would... the defense counsel would have the obligation to take into consideration the statement?"
