2012.11-1285,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.737,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-1285, US Airways v. McCutchen."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,8.07,11.205,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1285,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,40.208,46.795,"Mr. Katyal, if you go to equity, why aren't you bound by equity?"
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,46.795,50.163,"We certainly are, Justice Sotomayor, bound by equity."
2012.11-1285,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,59.936,66.423,"Well, but that's exactly what your bottom line is, which is, you have someone else do the work for you, and you don't pay them."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,66.423,74.778,"Quite to the contrary, Justice Sotomayor, our position is that the rules of equity bind equitable liens by agreement just as they bind anything else."
2012.11-1285,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,77.23,87.103,So why does your lien have priority to the attorney's lien that is normally created at the commencement of the litigation?
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,94.526,110.035,"--So, our position is that the attorney doesn't -- there is no lien created with the attorney; that once Mr. Sereboff signed -- entered into an agreement with US Air, that agreement said -- provided for 100 percent reimbursement rights."
2012.11-1285,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,149.91,170.942,"With Sereboff, that you -- you referred to, that -- that certainly describes the lien you rely on, but there's a footnote toward the end that leaves open the make-whole doctrine and, I assume, also the common fund doctrine."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,173.676,174.378,--Right.
2012.11-1285,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,257.863,261.517,I -- I recognize that we're talking about a matter of Federal law here.
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,284.263,287.465,That is true in some subrogation States.
2012.11-1285,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,329.411,341.052,"Where is that abrogation -- where is that abrogation in this -- not the plan description, but the plan itself -- what clear language in the plan bars the--"
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,341.052,355.193,"--Justice Ginsburg, the district court at pages 30A to 32A of the petition appendix, had two pages that found the agreement clear and unambiguous with respect to abrogation of the common fund doctrine."
2012.11-1285,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,369.886,370.655,--But that--
2012.11-1285,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,370.655,373.357,That -- that's the summary of the plan that's at 820.
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,374.19,374.473,Yes.
2012.11-1285,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,376.809,381.277,--I'm asking about the plan itself because the plan controls if there's a discrepancy.
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,381.277,381.644,--Exactly.
2012.11-1285,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,387.381,395.453,And I -- and I don't -- you -- you make a distinction between reimbursement clause and the subrogation clause.
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,415.85,422.754,"Your Honor, I suppose that -- that they could have made this an issue when they appealed the district court's finding on this."
2012.11-1285,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,425.64,428.908,"--Well, I mean, you -- you want us to decide a case without looking at the plan?"
2012.11-1285,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,440.049,442.667,I didn't think we took this case to review the plan.
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,448.338,449.738,"--Absolutely not, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1285,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,449.738,452.94,"Had that -- had that point been raised, we would not have taken the case."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,452.94,458.361,"And much to the -- and much to the contrary, Justice Scalia, exactly, this is the way that they framed the brief in opposition."
2012.11-1285,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,470.937,472.187,"Well, simply because of plan language."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,479.626,480.859,"Two things, Justice Kennedy."
2012.11-1285,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,489.232,489.732,"Counsel, are you conceding--"
2012.11-1285,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.732,490.465,I'm sorry.
2012.11-1285,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,490.832,491.517,--the plan doesn't say it?
2012.11-1285,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.517,491.8,--Excuse me.
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,492.35,511.812,"--The second point -- the second point is even if you are concerned about any discrepancy, point -- 4.2 of the actual plan itself, and this is page 22 of the PDF that was submitted by -- lodged by my friends on the other side a few days ago, has essentially an anti-Amara clause in it."
2012.11-1285,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,530.225,534.094,"I'm sorry, the phrase that you just read says that the benefits are the same."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,551.056,554.941,--So the plan has in 4.7 two things.
2012.11-1285,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,593.966,603.338,"So if I were -- if I were Joe Smith, and a plan -- the plan pays me 100 -- I have medical expenses of $100,000."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,655.639,657.139,--All right.
2012.11-1285,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,663.844,665.128,"The -- here, since nobody had the plan."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,665.128,670.748,"--Well, they -- they had the summary plan description, and they did not make an issue."
2012.11-1285,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,673.867,674.25,All right.
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,699.252,703.286,"--Justice Breyer, we absolutely agree that a plan could be written in order to embrace--"
2012.11-1285,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,703.286,705.405,But this is a plan that they wrote and that US Air--
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,705.405,710.642,"--but I think it would be highly unusual for this Court, indeed, I think, procedurally unavailable for this Court to--"
2012.11-1285,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.642,712.609,"Counsel, I guess your opponent could have raised that point."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,712.609,713.092,--Absolutely.
2012.11-1285,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,713.092,714.394,And didn't raise it.
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,714.394,714.911,Absolutely.
2012.11-1285,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.911,719.415,And we took this case on the assumption that there is an issue of law involved--
2012.11-1285,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,719.415,719.831,--All right.
2012.11-1285,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,720.198,722.2,--not -- not on the assumption--
2012.11-1285,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,722.2,723.2,--What is the issue of law?
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,747.815,750.183,"So, again, we're not overriding with the principle of equity."
2012.11-1285,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,793.879,803.152,Was the plan available to the employee at any time before this litigation?
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,803.152,803.852,Sure.
2012.11-1285,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,807.454,809.889,Are they -- are they advised that they can ask for the plan?
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,809.889,813.174,--I'm not quite sure about that.
2012.11-1285,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,816.126,818.912,I thought it took most of the litigation for the plan to be provided.
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,818.912,824.482,"Justice Sotomayor, at the outset, they asked for the summary plan description or the plan."
2012.11-1285,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,826.433,828.635,"--You say, “ they ”."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,830.802,831.587,Their lawyer.
2012.11-1285,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,831.587,837.139,"This is not, you know, an ignorant layman who knows nothing about the law."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,837.139,837.491,That's correct.
2012.11-1285,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,837.491,840.277,"The lawyer, you say, did not ask for the plan."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,840.277,851.066,"And -- and I should say, the minute that US Air found out that a tort -- a plaintiff's lawyer was hired, they sent a letter to that lawyer saying, we assert a right of reimbursement."
2012.11-1285,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,851.066,864.325,"But, Mr. Katyal, could I ask you about the legal argument that you are making, the distinction you are making between reimbursement agreements and subrogation agreements, which you think -- seem to think is critical here."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,871.312,872.129,Yes.
2012.11-1285,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,872.129,879.735,So -- so how do you know whether you have a reimbursement agreement or a subrogation agreement and what follows from that categorization?
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,879.735,882.52,"So, Justice Kagan, there are two very distinct rights."
2012.11-1285,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,911.456,914.491,"So if this were a subrogation agreement, what would follow?"
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,914.491,924.764,"--So if it were a subrogation agreement, I think my friend's case on the other side gets a lot stronger because there are subrogation cases that -- that have different rules."
2012.11-1285,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,937.941,956.502,"So if your friend's argument would get a lot stronger if it were a subrogation agreement, how do we tell that this agreement is a reimbursement agreement rather than -- are we supposed to just take that because that's the way the Court -- it's come to us, or -- or is there an argument about why there is a reimbursement?"
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,956.502,969.043,"--There is an argument, and, indeed, all I think you have to do, Justice Kagan, is look at what happened in Sereboff, because in Sereboff you had essentially the same thing, a plan that had both a reimbursement provision and a subrogation provision."
2012.11-1285,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1011.303,1022.195,Are you in effect asking for a windfall because Mr. McCutchen and his attorneys didn't understand what ERISA means in this context?
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1047.245,1048.428,"Not at all, Justice Alito."
2012.11-1285,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1069.925,1076.912,"Well, perhaps they should have realized it; but, if they realized it, they have no incentive to pursue this litigation or to pursue the tort decision--"
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1076.912,1077.745,--Not so.
2012.11-1285,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1095.79,1104.812,"In this case, he wrote -- the attorney wrote to you any number of times, and finally said, look, unless you come and tell me what your position is, I'm going to go forward."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1110.966,1114.287,"--Your Honor, I don't think that quite is an accurate statement of the facts."
2012.11-1285,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1123.31,1130.814,"Rejected it because it had nothing to do with the agreement, but it didn't reject them as a factual matter, that you were contacted."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1130.814,1137.819,"--I do -- I do think that there were lots -- and this is in Joint Appendix, pages 50 to 64 -- lots of communications between the two."
2012.11-1285,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1149.308,1156.281,"Counsel, were they supposed to -- if the insurance limit was $100,000, are you suggesting that that was a bad faith settlement?"
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1156.281,1170.54,"--I am suggesting that we didn't have the opportunity, Justice Sotomayor, that we typically do in the lion's share of cases, as I was saying to Justice Alito, where you work these things out in agreement -- in advance with clear lines of communication."
2012.11-1285,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1170.54,1173.408,Justice Kagan's question had two parts.
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1198.739,1208.73,"Because the common fund rule -- and this we are in agreement on, the parties -- the common fund rule is a doctrine based in unjust enrichment."
2012.11-1285,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1227.339,1230.208,But you are still in equity pursuant to the statute.
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1230.208,1230.675,Yes.
2012.11-1285,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1230.675,1237.129,And are you saying that there is no discretion in the equitable decrees that the judge made?
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1237.129,1238.214,That is precisely right.
2012.11-1285,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1245.385,1246.17,That's not unusual.
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1254.324,1255.359,That -- that is correct.
2012.11-1285,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.359,1257.977,"Where there is a legal right, equity cannot overcome it."
2012.11-1285,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1257.977,1258.66,That is correct.
2012.11-1285,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1273.404,1274.487,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1285.545,1288.497,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.256,1306.874,Equitable powers to enforce the agreement.
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1306.874,1307.758,Yes.
2012.11-1285,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1336.561,1345.583,"Mr. Palmore, do you agree with Mr. Katyal's view of this distinction between subjugation -- subrogation agreements and reimbursement agreements and which this agreement is?"
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1345.583,1353.003,"I think that's a -- the -- there is certainly a distinction, and the Couch insurance treatise talks about the distinction."
2012.11-1285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.829,1373.083,"Well, I think you can say that about any legal rule, that some courts bollox them up."
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1377.702,1381.956,"--No, I think it's just the fact that the courts do use these terms interchangeably."
2012.11-1285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1381.956,1382.239,What's the rule?
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1383.806,1394.828,"We acknowledge that when there is a -- when there is a contractual plan-based reimbursement provision like this, it is enforceable as an equitable lien by agreement, in the same way that an equitable lien by agreement would have been--"
2012.11-1285,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1394.828,1402.851,"Well, but I think Mr. Katyal said that if this were a subrogation agreement, Mr. McCutchen would have a much better argument because a different set of rules would apply."
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1424.681,1425.633,--Right.
2012.11-1285,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1450.998,1451.866,But that's my exact question.
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1528.783,1536.104,--Because we think the equitable doctrines that apply are the equitable doctrines that would have applied at equity.
2012.11-1285,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1536.104,1536.47,Good.
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1551.447,1554.749,"Well, there is not one authority that is going to give you both -- both answers."
2012.11-1285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1626.614,1628.764,Was there an agreement that contradicted that?
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1628.764,1632.018,There was no agreement in Greenough that contradicted that.
2012.11-1285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1632.018,1635.303,"But we have an agreement here, so how does -- how does that line of authority apply?"
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1647.694,1650.062,"There are two answers, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1661.787,1665.905,But it only has the powers to enforce the agreement.
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1665.905,1667.122,--The powers to enforce--
2012.11-1285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1667.122,1672.726,"There are various equitable powers, and it can use various of them to enforce the agreement."
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1672.726,1673.345,--But we don't think--
2012.11-1285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.345,1677.713,"That's quite different from rewriting the agreement, which is what you are using it for here."
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1677.713,1684.801,"--No, we are saying that Section 502(a)(3) takes the settled powers of the court in equity as it finds them."
2012.11-1285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1695.774,1696.524,Excuse me.
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1707.666,1740.053,"--Not on general unfairness grounds, but it was a settled principle at trust law, and remember, Greenough based the common fund doctrine on trust law that if, for instance, a trust document had said, the trustee shall take his expenses from the trust corpus, not from the income -- or vice-versa, says the trustee shall take his expenses from the income but not from the trust corpus -- if that proved unworkable or unfair and the trustee couldn't discharge his obligations to maintain the trust, the court of equity had broad reformation powers and was not bound by that trust document."
2012.11-1285,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1740.053,1747.809,"Counsel, the position that the United States is advancing today is different from the position that the United States previously advanced."
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1766.271,1769.223,We do have a new secretary under a new administration.
2012.11-1285,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1769.99,1778.162,It would be more candid for your office to tell us when there is a change in position that it's not based on further reflection of the secretary.
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1792.838,1798.259,"--With respect, Mr. Chief Justice, the law has changed since that brief was filed nearly ten years ago in the Court's review."
2012.11-1285,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1798.259,1799.092,Then tell us the law has changed.
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1810.217,1816.537,"Well, I apologize for that, Your Honor, but we do cite in that footnote the Amara case, and that is a key element to our position here."
2012.11-1285,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1832.23,1832.665,We--
2012.11-1285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.665,1834.082,We never doubted that before.
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1841.938,1845.807,--These cases weren't litigated in the way they were now before -- before Sereboff--
2012.11-1285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1845.807,1848.223,It seems to be self-evident that court had all equitable powers.
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1851.96,1865.018,"--And we think the Court has all equitable powers and a plan term can't divest the court of those equitable powers, so among those equitable powers was the ability to enforce an equitable lien by agreement without looking at inapplicable unjust enrichment--"
2012.11-1285,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1865.018,1866.351,--Or not to enforce it.
2012.11-1285,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1881.73,1898.405,"--Well, we do agree with respect to the common fund doctrine, and we think that, to the extent this Court is willing to look at the -- at the -- the purposes of ERISA, that the position that we've advanced strikes the right balance and in particular it avoids the negative recovery scenario that is a particularly harsh result of Petitioner's position."
2012.11-1285,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1898.405,1901.191,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1906.445,1909.063,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1925.656,1929.208,"Your opponent says this is not a subrogation agreement, so that argument goes nowhere."
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1940.831,1944.117,"Your Honor, it is a subrogation agreement."
2012.11-1285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1996.752,1998.552,That's not what I say you've conceded.
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2015.379,2015.863,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.11-1285,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2060.258,2062.194,But doesn't Sereboff suggest not?
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2079.572,2084.191,"They are not beside the point for one reason, and let me -- let me explain why."
2012.11-1285,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2109.508,2112.21,So is that true that in Sereboff there was no agreement?
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2112.21,2117.864,"There was, but what this Court -- there was absolutely an agreement just as there is an agreement in this case."
2012.11-1285,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2149.966,2161.81,"I guess I don't understand that, because it seems to me that when Sereboff said it was beside the point, they were refuting the argument that the insured party was making, that the insured party was saying, hey, look, we have these great defenses."
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2171.249,2187.425,"The Court -- the -- the beneficiary, Your Honor, in Sereboff, argued that the defenses that applied to a -- a freestanding or implied claim for equitable subrogation should control the -- the measure of relief available in the case."
2012.11-1285,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2214.159,2216.11,So what -- what's the difference between the two?
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2235.489,2239.326,"--When it comes to the rules that govern relief, there is no difference."
2012.11-1285,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2247.916,2251.951,So was the Court in an exercise of futility in writing what it did in Sereboff?
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2251.951,2252.651,"--Not so, Your Honor."
2012.11-1285,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2265.377,2267.293,"Counsel, I understand the argument."
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2281.387,2283.589,"--Your Honor, in equity, that was the rule."
2012.11-1285,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2312.358,2315.124,"Isn't there another line after that, that says something--"
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2315.124,2316.16,"--Yes, I'm about to quote that."
2012.11-1285,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2335.022,2340.758,"Is this the part -- I might be mixing this up with something else, but is this the part where he says, unfortunately, the courts don't agree with that?"
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2340.758,2350.114,"He -- he -- he identifies two decisions -- that -- you're correct, Your Honor -- he identifies two decisions which did something contrary to that rule."
2012.11-1285,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2353.935,2357.72,Let's go back to what the -- the simple argument.
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2375.349,2385.37,"Because, Your Honor, these -- these insurance reimbursement cases arose in a very different context from most other equitable lien by agreement cases."
2012.11-1285,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2473.262,2475.13,Why -- why is it so unfair?
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2539.088,2544.958,"--Your Honor, it's unfair because, in equity, parties could not defeat the rules that typically apply."
2012.11-1285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2560.051,2581.898,"So whenever you have a contract that explicitly, although, you know, nowadays when the merged bars, I suppose, you wouldn't even have to say it, but let's assume it explicitly says that rights under this contract can be enforced in law or -- at law or in equity."
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2588.301,2589.837,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-1285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2609.032,2610.317,Why isn't this a legal claim?
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2627.612,2629.928,"It -- it could be either, Your Honor."
2012.11-1285,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2663.619,2666.237,"Well, couldn't that party simply say, I want to go to the other side of the court?"
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2684.549,2685.999,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.11-1285,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2717.186,2728.728,The general rule in equity was that the equity court would not give a specific performance decree to pay a certain amount of money was the general rule.
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2729.761,2731.096,Your Honor--
2012.11-1285,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2731.096,2734.632,"And -- and if so, do those exceptions bear on this case?"
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2734.632,2739.667,"--And there were -- there were exceptions, but we don't view this case as a specific performance case."
2012.11-1285,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2740.869,2742.738,We -- you don't view the case as?
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2742.738,2744.488,--As a specific performance case.
2012.11-1285,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2795.52,2796.888,Enter best case.

2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2856.161,2863.165,"--Well, Your Honor, to be clear, there is not a single equitable lien case that -- that Petitioners have found in which a court has--"

2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2865.65,2869.051,"--So -- so, Your Honor, the Svea case, is -- is, I think, our best example."
2012.11-1285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2958.94,2959.907,What case is this?
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2959.907,2961.742,"--This is the Svea case, Your Honor."
2012.11-1285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2961.742,2963.678,"From what court, what -- what year?"
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2963.678,2965.91,"The highest court in Maryland, I believe from 1901."

2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2996.232,3003.136,I -- I think -- I think that it's fair to say that this did not arise that frequently in courts of equity.
2012.11-1285,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3003.136,3004.153,Why didn't it?
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,3004.153,3006.087,"Be -- for -- for several reasons, Your Honor."
2012.11-1285,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3091.11,3101.382,"Counsel, can -- I want to give you an opportunity to respond to the argument that you've waived, the -- the -- your argument based on the distinction between the summary of the plan and the plan."
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,3163.523,3166.009,"Well, I -- I don't think we waived it, Your Honor."
2012.11-1285,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3169.126,3175.882,"Which was four months after you had the plan, and the plan was lodged with us last week for the first time."

2012.11-1285,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3215.091,3223.113,The problem is that the district court interpreted the plan as precluding the claim you're making here.
2012.11-1285,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,3230.434,3231.317,--That--
2012.11-1285,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3231.317,3235.255,And what the district court does is it defers to the administrator's interpretation of the plan.

2012.11-1285,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3412.352,3412.786,Sure.

2012.11-1285,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3605.329,3605.862,--perceive it as a problem.
2012.11-1285,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3605.862,3608.864,Congress in 1974 set it up this way.
2012.11-1285,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3649.941,3651.941,Suppose the expense weren't to pay the lawyer.
