1969.1066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,37.585,"Number 1066, Phoenix against Kolodziejski."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,37.585,39.2,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.1066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,39.2,42.012,Lee.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,42.012,65.158,"The question in this case is whether the State of Arizona may constitutionally limit the right to participate in general obligation bond elections to real property taxpayers whose property in such an election, the City of Phoenix, will put up as collateral security for the repayment of the bond obligation."
1969.1066,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,211.964,213.781,Could I ask you a preliminary question?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,213.781,215.655,Yes Mr. --
1969.1066,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,215.655,218.739,"Currently, if there is any answer to it."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,228.449,237.528,"Mr. Justice Harlan, in my opinion, the answer to that question is yes, but no one really knows the answer to that question."
1969.1066,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,291.147,292.742,I bet you're not raising it?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,292.742,294.207,"No sir, indeed we're not."
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,295.045,297.341,As suppose the state can waive that you can.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,297.341,301.64,"Yes Mr. Justice White, in opinion we can."
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,301.64,315.917,"You conceded the five-day limit here (Inaudible) but it have five days after the canvas, it could've been July 28 or June 22."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,315.917,318.582,"All right, it would've been June 28, yes Mr. Justice White."
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,318.582,320.426,It would've been --
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,320.426,322.452,Before this action was filed.
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,322.452,332.801,"Yes, well, the Court -- whoever was excluded from the election and if they were included those appearances."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,332.801,334.845,That is correct.
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,335.831,338.306,"So, they really had some time to file."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,338.306,341.081,That is correct and if not filed within the five-day period.
1969.1066,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,535.389,537.104,What do you do in Cipriano?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,537.104,540.276,"That Cipriano, Mr. Justice Harlan, is an enigma."
1969.1066,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,540.276,542.37,Is it in the books.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,542.37,546.15,That it's on the books but it did not overrule.
1969.1066,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,559.491,568.35,Those are these are -- are these some who joined the dissent in Kramer and found it impossible to the dissent in Cipriano?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,568.35,574.388,And the reason that you found it impossible in the dissent in Cipriano Mr. Justice Harlan is this.
1969.1066,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,577.941,579.616,"No, I was joining Justice Stewart."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,579.616,583.556,Yes and I realize you filed a separate one for other reasons.
1969.1066,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,665.93,672.185,(Voice Overlap) a lot of history too when we went to Reynolds and Sims.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,672.185,676.08,"Well, I recognize that Mr. Justice Harlan."
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.286,679.891,Do you intend to reargue that?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,679.891,713.643,"No, I do not intend to reargue Reynolds versus Sims Mr. Justice White but all I'm saying is that accepting Reynolds versus Sims, accepting Kramer for its reasoning, accepting Cipriano versus the City of Houma, this is a different case and for reasons which I have now about to discuss, the Court should go no further than it has gone in Reynolds versus Sims, Kramer and Cipriano and I submit Mr. Justice Harlan because I know of your feelings about stare decisis that this is a different issue, I mean it does not involve the same problem."
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,750.294,753.536,Are there -- are there anything else that is available?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,753.536,757.895,"It's available, that is correct Mr. Justice White."
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.895,760.101,Except some tax that is designated.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,760.101,762.844,Designated that is correct.
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.565,781.727,The only thing that comes to bondholders are property tax.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,781.727,783.971,The property tax must lien on the property.
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,783.971,785.586,What point do they --
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,785.586,793.931,"They promise me and by statute, the City of Phoenix is obligated to tax that property to a sufficient extent to repay the bonds."
1969.1066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,793.931,797.185,"And if they fail to do it, the mandamus is available, isn't it?"
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,797.185,802.602,That is correct and to the point of taking the property and selling it at a tax lien sale.
1969.1066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,870.492,876.009,"When you say it puts up security, it puts up some security of someone else's property."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,876.009,877.314,"Someone else, precisely."
1969.1066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,877.314,878.213,Not its own property.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,878.213,881.365,This property doesn't belong to the City of Phoenix.
1969.1066,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,910.306,912.302,What's the rate of interest?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,912.302,918.926,"The maximum rate of interest, Mr. Justice Black, under the present statutory provisions of State of Arizona is 6%."
1969.1066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1001.007,1004.019,Mr. Lee do you have sales tax in Phoenix?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1004.019,1005.165,"Yes, sir we do."
1969.1066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1005.165,1009.544,Personal property tax?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1009.544,1011.281,Well --
1969.1066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1011.281,1017.926,"Well, it may also assume that some of the property there, the taxes are paid by the people who are renting?"
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1017.926,1019.551,"That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1969.1066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1019.551,1021.974,Is there money involved?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1021.974,1028.73,"Their money is involved, Mr. Justice Marshall in the annual repayment or maybe involved."
1969.1066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1031.952,1033.178,No.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1039.253,1040.23,No.
1969.1066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1040.23,1043.273,That's all I'm on now.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1043.273,1050.537,"Under the decision of the Arizona Supreme Court in Allison versus the City of Phoenix, you can use sales taxes."
1969.1066,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1099.184,1101.969,"Could they do that, those three (Voice Overlap)"
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1101.969,1112.748,Being practical Mr. Justice -- it'll be impractical and the reason it would be impractical is because those things are made articles and those things don't necessarily stay within the City of Phoenix.
1969.1066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1191.762,1201.848,This in -- this is an election by majority votes of voters without reference to (Voice Overlap) -- without reference to the amount of their property.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1201.848,1203.245,That is correct.
1969.1066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1203.245,1208.238,"I mean if I -- if a man owned $10.00 with the real estate, his vote counts as much as the man who owns a million dollars with real estate."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1208.238,1209.493,We don't have a Louisiana problem.
1969.1066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1209.493,1210.641,That was different as Louisiana.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1210.641,1212.987,That is correct.
1969.1066,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1313.544,1317.403,May I ask you what affect that would have in the City of Phoenix.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1317.403,1326.963,"Well, we hope Mr. Justice Black that it would hold them that it would validate these bonds and let me say why I hope that this would be the case."
1969.1066,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1382.027,1389.76,"Mr. Lee, is Cipriano the one in which we drew the line pending on whether the election was still subject to challenge?"
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1389.76,1390.427,Yes sir.
1969.1066,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1390.427,1391.074,That was Cipriano.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1391.074,1394.595,"Yes, sir and I want to discuss that because that fits fine in Louisiana but not in Arizona."
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.595,1402.821,I just wonder how it helped you because by your own confession this election is subject to challenge.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1402.821,1410.134,"Right and it maybe Mr. Justice White, we just don't know it."
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1435.146,1440.394,Why should it be within the period of the election is subject to challenge?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1440.394,1442.927,Because we don't know what that is.
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1442.927,1452.158,"I have to understand that if somebody wants to challenge elections in Arizona, I thought it was five days, five days after the canvass."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1452.158,1456.936,But that's not bond elections or we're not sure whether that's bond election.
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1458.094,1468.201,"You mean -- you mean, there aren't any states that -- you mean it's more general than not the states have no time limit on when you can challenge a bond election."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1468.201,1469.566,"Mr. Justice White, this is set --"
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.566,1475.724,I wouldn't think the bond lawyers would ever -- ever pass it or given opinion on a bond issue.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1475.724,1477.608,We have a great battery of bond lawyers.
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1477.608,1480.003,"I see them here, I just wondered."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1480.003,1488.428,They have informed me and I rely on their opinion that Louisiana stands alone in so far as that degree of protection.
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1492.987,1501.436,"Well how does -- how does anyone know in your state then whether any bond is good, you can apparently challenge an election forever."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1501.436,1515.367,Well you always have the argument obliges and there's always a possibility that there will come a time that it is not an identifiable time such as it was involved in Louisiana.
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1515.367,1517.383,What is that you're contending for Mr. Lee?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1517.383,1518.371,For the date of the election.
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1518.371,1529.457,"You mean -- by that, you mean if I were to say that you lose on the other point that we should also say that only as to elections after the date of this opinion?"
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1529.457,1530.573,Of this court's decision.
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1530.573,1533.645,Yeah and that this one only for the State of Arizona?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1533.645,1535.11,"No, I would hope for all the states."
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1535.11,1537.545,"Well, how would this effect to we said in Cipriano, except --"
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1537.545,1547.374,"It would -- it would, it would simply say that in those states as if Cipriano was where you have an identifiable time grid and that's the point."
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1548.34,1549.566,But we have two rules.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1549.566,1550.452,Have two rules.
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1550.452,1551.58,I see.
1969.1066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1551.58,1553.334,And how it is should be the date of the election?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1553.334,1553.784,The election.
1969.1066,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1671.833,1676.192,"How much of this issue, how much of the total issue has been resolved?"
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1676.192,1677.061,"None, Mr. Justice Harlan."
1969.1066,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1677.061,1677.788,None of it?
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1677.788,1679.622,"None, none."
1969.1066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1679.622,1683.764,I supposed not any purchaser would demand a pretty big discount.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1683.764,1686.833,"Well, the problem is we can't get any detail when to give us an approving in opinion."
1969.1066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1686.833,1689.366,Exactly.
1969.1066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1689.366,1690.761,That's why you want one from us.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1690.761,1694.883,That's right.
1969.1066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1694.883,1698.903,You concede the invalidity of the revenue bonds that were (Voice Overlap).
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1698.903,1705.298,"Well, I keep my (Voice Overlap) on that."
1969.1066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1717.451,1723.058,"Yes, but so I see you save your position with respect to the prospectivity retroactivity."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1723.058,1726.719,"Only, only, other than that we agreed that Cipriano give its revenue bond elections."
1969.1066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1726.719,1729.312,"Makes them valid, that's the future --"
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1729.312,1729.839,Right.
1969.1066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1729.839,1730.106,Election.
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1730.106,1738.393,Well what about in other states Mr. Lee that have held elections since Cipriano.
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1762.49,1777.346,"Well, Mr. Justice White, I hate to use up my time arguing for the other fellows but I do feel, you see in Cipriano, you said, you specifically held open the question of Cipriano's applicability of general obligations."
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.346,1778.314,"Well, I understand that."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1778.314,1784.093,"Yeah, you also said that Cipriano itself would be prospective only."
1969.1066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1793.246,1801.016,"Well, I would think they would -- that recently holding elections, delve on why they worried about with consequences of decision in this case."
1969.1066,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1801.016,1809.768,"Well, I would like to reserve a few moments."
1969.1066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1809.768,1811.075,Mr. Rosenfeld.
1969.1066,1,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,1811.075,1814.109,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.1066,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1859.021,1894.632,"Number 1066, Phoenix against Kolodziejski."
1969.1066,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,1894.632,1896.197,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.1066,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1896.197,1898.969,Lee.
1969.1066,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,1898.969,1927.411,"The question on this case is whether the State of Arizona may constitutionally limit the right to participate in general obligation bond elections to real property taxpayers whose property in such an election, the City of Phoenix will put up as collateral security for the repayment of the bond obligation and whose property is subject to the lien of those bonds during the life of the bonds."
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,2065.42,2095.027,"Another thing to know in the Cipriano decision, the Court appeared as I stated to take the more rigid approach to that election the dissent, Mr. Black -- Justice Black's dissent used what I believed to be the rational basis doctrine or the general test for Fourteenth Amendment -- of the Fourteenth Amendment against the state statute."
1969.1066,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2095.027,2096.216,The dissent of what case?
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,2096.216,2097.141,In Cipriano.
1969.1066,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2097.141,2098.829,There was no dissent in Cipriano.
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,2098.829,2100.065,"Excuse me, concurring opinion."
1969.1066,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2135.18,2151.702,"Well, if it applies to all special elections in Phoenix called an election to decide zoning rules for real property owners and restricted that the real property owners reproduce, what would you say?"
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,2151.702,2162.288,"Well then, then the test would have to apply, the test would be are those who are excluded substantially less interested and thus the exclusion promote a compelling state interest."
1969.1066,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2165.42,2169.24,"Well, I thought you said any special election that would be open to everyone."
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,2169.24,2174.027,"Oh no, I -- that's not my statement at all, the test applies -- excuse me if I did."
1969.1066,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2545.909,2546.818,Is to what?
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,2546.818,2559.041,"Is to carry, that the election will carry nine times out of 10 the purpose will be tailored toward those with the voting power."
1969.1066,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2612.288,2620.524,But what you're really arguing now are those the wisdom of the Arizona structure.
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,2620.524,2622.318,"Well, I'm arguing the interest."
1969.1066,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3164.538,3167.885,That’s why it's still on books.
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,3167.885,3195.89,"Well, I think there is a cut off date insofar attacking, no there is a, there is a cut off date insofar as the application of the doctrine, but if the doctrine is a constitutional and a Federal Constitutional Doctrine then there is in my mind no legislative action that the state can take to deprive the Federal Courts of Jurisdiction and that’s what, that’s -- we would be doing here."
1969.1066,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3196.63,3199.06,That ever been happened.
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,3199.06,3200.032,I don’t know.
1969.1066,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3200.032,3207.552,You mean the State has ever set a time beyond which you couldn’t wait then raising a constitutional challenge.
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,3207.552,3209.576,A Federal constitutional challenge.
1969.1066,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3209.576,3210.397,Is that’s your position?
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,3210.397,3211.749,That’s my position.
1969.1066,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3211.749,3216.552,Well a state could certainly have a statute limitation generally.
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,3216.552,3218.83,It could have general statute limitations.
1969.1066,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3218.83,3226.94,"And why wouldn't that apply to any attack, any lawsuit whether it would be based on statutory or common law or constitutional ground."
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,3226.94,3236.293,You must also note that the five day election contest period in question is a specific type of contest period.
1969.1066,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3253.004,3267.499,"Now you seem to be completely at odds with your colleague here, your opponent on whether there is a cut off date or not, but you speak with that assurance on it, could you give us cases on it, state cases?"
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,3267.499,3272.038,"Well, the only case that it can't be applied is Morgan versus the Board of Supervisor."
1969.1066,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3272.038,3283.238,"Yes, but I thought you said after you said that that whatever cut off date there might be for some purposes you are perfectly clear in your mind that there is not in Arizona on a case like this."
1969.1066,3,24512,fred_h_rosenfeld,,3283.238,3291.488,"On a case like this if the authority, if the canvas I will have to add this if the canvas has passed."
1969.1066,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3350.606,3356.448,Mr. Lee you have about one minute left.
1969.1066,4,39761,rex_e_lee,,3356.448,3367.658,"I don’t really understand what Mr. Rosenfeld just said about whether there is or is not a cut off period, but I submit that my case is now made that there is a confusion on this point in the State of Arizona."
1969.1066,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3430.595,3432.447,"Thank you Mr. Lee, thank you Mr. Rosenfeld."
