1973.72-331,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.566,"We will hear arguments next in number 72-331, Lefkowitz against Turley."
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,49.535,54.108,Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,323.081,340.917,"Is that the same premise that the Government employees, the premise that the taxpayer are going to get the honest performance of their labor in return for the compensation pay for them, isn’t it?"
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,340.917,341.853,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,341.853,345.113,And so why this is different from the Gardner case?
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,345.113,347.888,This is different from the Gardner case in a number of respects.
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,383.929,390.388,I wonder if the New York City policemen and Gardner knew about Section 1123 of the New York City Charter.
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,390.388,390.936,Section --
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,390.936,392.587,Does that appear in the case?
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,392.587,394.175,"It does not appear in the case, Your Honor."
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,471.731,489.27,"But in each case, the basic situation is that the contractor in a one case and the employee in the other case, when called before grand jury, must waive his immunity, correct?"
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,489.27,494.375,He either waives -- the agreement that he makes is either to the contractors makes.
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,507.28,508.46,"i.e., termination."
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,508.46,508.943,"i.e., termination."
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,508.943,512.86,"Suspension of the contractor for period of years, termination of the policeman --"
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,512.86,513.068,That’s right.
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.068,514.155,In his employment
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,514.155,514.587,That is right.
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,531.384,549.415,"Well, then, do I understand you correctly that this case, the question in this case is whether a contractor is sufficiently different from an employee, so that the rule of the Gardner case does not apply."
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,551.01,552.873,"I think that is what it comes down to, Your Honor."
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,558.662,564.553,"Otherwise, we would have to reconsider the Gardner principle, the Gardner constitutional principle, would we not?"
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,564.553,568.136,"Yes, your honor, I think that’s perfectly correct."
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,692.809,698.343,Well the agreement of the contract is in the form of a waiver of immunity?
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,698.343,719.588,"The statute provides that the contract should contain a clause that in the event that the contractor refuses to waive immunity with respect to transactions or contracts had with the State, or to answer relevant questions respecting the contracts then the economic consequences follow."
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,719.588,728.11,"So, he -- So, there is -- if he refuses to sign a contract with that condition in it, then he is not going to get the contract."
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,728.11,729.436,That’s correct.
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,729.436,741.144,"So, there is a condition or a barrier to doing things with the State which amounts to a waiver of immunity."
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,741.144,742.561,"No, I do not think that --"
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,742.561,750.007,"Well, eventually it will amount to that because he can’t get the next contract if he reaches that provision."
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,750.007,760.28,"At the time that he enters the contract, he is under no impermissible coercion to take that contract."
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,778.771,785.089,It must be during the waive of immunity he can’t get more than one contract.
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,785.089,786.149,That’s right.
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,788.373,796.7,"So, sooner or later, it amounts to he either waives of immunity or he doesn’t do business with the State."
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,796.7,806.95,"Either agrees that should it become necessary, he will waive immunity, or he will not for a limited period of time be able to do business with the State."
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,806.95,819.029,When a person does enough business with the State or perhaps when he’s informed enough then you can expect him to have advice of the counsel of what not you should.
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,842.425,883.751,"Where the interests are so severe on the part of the public, where the contractor is well enough informed, I am sorry, where the consequences are not the devastating kind of consequences which occur to a public employee then the balance, and this is always a question of balancing, shifts back toward the interest of the public in being able to know what has happened with its money."
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,896.318,918.391,It can’t really be a balancing process and so far as you can’t -- can you concede that there was a violation of the provision of the Fifth Amendment that’s been held to be incorporated in the fourteenth and then say nonetheless we should just to over look at in the interest of the taxpayers in the State of New York.
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,921.615,922.28,I don't concede a violation.
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,922.28,925.666,And then ask this just to balance that out in the interest of the taxpayers in the State of New York.
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,925.666,928.862,"No, I’m sorry if I even gave that impression."
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,935.408,936.07,There was a violation.
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,936.07,937.291,-- there was a violation;
1973.72-331,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,937.291,938.147,"Well, I have a little difficulty to that."
1973.72-331,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,938.147,939.507,It is what is stated here.
1973.72-331,1,40278,richard_o_robinson,,2127.07,2130.923,"Your Honor, I cannot find any distinction."
1973.72-331,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2190.79,2232.8,"Well, I was speaking of that one paragraph in the Gardner case in which the Court said that, if the appellant, the policeman and refused to answer questions specifically directed and narrowly related to the performance of his official duties without being required to waive immunity in advance then the privilege against self incrimination would not have been a bar to his dismissal but that still in fact is the law and not just a view of collateral question, it would mean that the policeman is penalized for exercising constitutional right, isn’t he?"
1973.72-331,1,40278,richard_o_robinson,,2232.8,2234.848,"We had no argument with that, Your Honor."
