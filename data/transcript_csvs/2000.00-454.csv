2000.00-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.916,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 00-454, the Atkinson Trading Company v. Joe Shirley."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,9.993,13.541,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,51.231,55.196,"What precisely is the incidence of the tax, Mr. Cole?"
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,56.477,59.904,The incidence of the tax is on the guests of the hotel.
2000.00-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,59.904,61.512,And they... what?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,64.816,66.136,Yes.
2000.00-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,73.007,82.4,"What if... what if the tax were imposed, or a tax were imposed on the hotel itself instead of the guests?"
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,82.4,87.313,We believe there would still be no basis for the taxation on these facts.
2000.00-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,90.49,101.264,Is there... does the hotel have to get any license or permission from the tribe to operate under the federal statutes governing Indian traders?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,101.264,110.18,The hotel must have a license from the Federal Government in order to trade with the members of the tribe.
2000.00-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.18,115.382,Even though in conducting the hotel it isn't dealing with members of the tribe?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,115.382,127.353,"It needs that license to deal with members of the tribe, but in dealing with nonmembers of the tribe, the Federal regulatory scheme is not applicable."
2000.00-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.187,137.839,Suppose it didn't deal with members of the tribe.
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,142.381,143.867,"Yes, I think that's right."
2000.00-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,143.867,146.301,You think it... you're not sure that's right?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,146.301,150.182,"Well, I... that's the way I read the regulations, yes."
2000.00-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,150.182,158.561,"Does it have to do with being within the borders of the reservation, because even though it's fee land, it is inside the reservation boundaries."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,158.561,159.759,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.00-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,159.759,170.987,"But you don't know for sure whether an Indian trader's license would be necessary for the hotel, even if it were serving guests from outside the tribe."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,172.102,172.556,No.
2000.00-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.942,189.729,Is there on this hotel... is it subject to an Arizona room tax?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,189.729,191.215,"Yes, it is."
2000.00-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,191.215,194.659,Do you know what... what would that amount to?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,194.659,198.562,"Five point five percent from the state, as I understand the state law."
2000.00-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,207.124,212.68,"So this would be three... three room taxes essentially, then."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,218.253,220.565,"Yes, there are, Your Honor."
2000.00-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,220.565,224.364,"Are they also on fee land, or are they on tribal land?"
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,224.364,231.795,"The record doesn't reflect the kind of land that they're on, and I don't know all those facts."
2000.00-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,231.795,235.26,"It seems to be a... no, please--"
2000.00-454,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,235.26,241.576,"--On that particular thing, it seemed to me quite important, and I seem to be missing a fact."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,264.405,271.647,"Well, I don't think this is decided, Your Honor, on a generic basis across all the hotels."
2000.00-454,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,276.915,292.369,"Well, that's my question, I guess, because suppose that there are a hundred hotels, ninety nine of which use the sewerage systems, the water systems, the police, the hospitals, all kinds of other services provided by the tribe."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,307.956,320.133,"Well, we don't have those facts in the record at all, and I think that the law is still that the individual nonmembers' rights not to be governed by the tribe would be respected."
2000.00-454,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,322.734,325.417,Whose burden is it to provide the facts?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,325.417,340.074,"Well, it's the tribe that's asserting jurisdiction in this instance, and we have provided the facts to show that there are no... there's no consensual relationship that we have with the tribe, and we are not on tribal lands."
2000.00-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,340.074,343.417,"Well, didn't this also go through the tribal court?"
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,343.417,344.448,"Yes, it did."
2000.00-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.225,374.829,"You had an option, didn't you, to get compensated for it, or to trade for land outside the reservation?"
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,374.829,375.944,"--Yes, that's true."
2000.00-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,384.777,387.272,They wouldn't compensate you for what was already built?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,390.35,395.53,"Well, the history here is unusual."
2000.00-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,424.037,430.186,"But that would be... that would be true, too, if this hotel were on tribal land itself."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,434.439,435.098,--Yes.
2000.00-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,435.098,435.925,Would it be different?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,435.925,443.727,"Yes, it does make it different because in building on tribal land they create a relationship with the tribe."
2000.00-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.608,452.272,"Even though they still can't vote, and most of their guests are not members of the tribe."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,452.272,453.015,Right.
2000.00-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,477.99,486.452,"You said that if the building were on tribal land, that there would be a relationship with the tribe by virtue of that."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,492.108,494.708,There are really two relationships.
2000.00-454,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,556.63,568.352,"Well, would the Buster case out of the... I think the Eighth Circuit... figures rather largely in the briefs here."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,579.952,587.195,"Your Honor, the origins of that case, I think, have been a little obscure with time, but here is the background there."
2000.00-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,717.869,719.893,"Buster wasn't one of our cases, anyway."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,720.515,721.462,"No, it wasn't--"
2000.00-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.462,722.743,Eighth Circuit?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,722.743,723.857,"--Eighth Circuit case, Your Honor."
2000.00-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.005,775.998,May I just interrupt this?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,782.064,784.543,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2000.00-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,784.543,790.237,The Jicarilla Merrion case... how do you fit that into this analysis?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,790.237,804.066,"Well Merrion was a case about, as you said, the lease with the tribe, I guess, for drilling on tribal trust lands... that entire reservation was tribal trust lands, and the Court said--"
2000.00-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,804.066,813.604,"Yes, and the outcome is they'd been given a lease to take the oil out, so they did have a property interest in the oil wells."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,813.604,819.094,"--But that... but the lease was with the tribe, so they directly entered into a consensual relation--"
2000.00-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.094,822.188,It was made before the tax was imposed.
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,822.188,826.812,"--Well, that's true, Your Honor, and there was a difference of views in that case."
2000.00-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,826.812,832.097,I'm just wondering how you reconcile the majority's holding with your position here.
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,832.097,842.621,"The majority's holding was simply that in signing that lease, the tribe did not give up its power over... dominion over its own trust land."
2000.00-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,860.166,881.138,"Mr. Cole... no, I was being... Mr. Cole, you spoke a moment ago the fact that we had referred to the possibility of a taxation exception as part of the first Montana exception essentially arising from consensual relationships."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,941.34,954.289,"I would say that the benefits are incidental, Your Honor, that the services are focused on the Navajo population in this part of the reservation, and there can be incidental benefits from that."
2000.00-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,954.827,958.542,The fact that there is generally law and order and that sort of thing?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,958.542,959.08,--Exactly.
2000.00-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,986.406,986.861,"Okay, now--"
2000.00-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,986.861,989.916,--How about... how about water and electricity and that sort of thing?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,990.538,995.86,"Well, in the... in this case, there's no such request being made, Your Honor."
2000.00-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,995.86,998.089,The hotel supplies its own--
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,998.089,1006.8,"It takes the water on its own land from the river and returns it to the river, so it does not receive water from the tribe."
2000.00-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1006.8,1007.832,--What about fire protection?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1007.832,1011.836,"Well, there is a dispute in the record about that."
2000.00-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1040.337,1058.607,"But the same thing is true, it seems to me, in many state relationships in which there is a state police force, there's a county police force, there's a local police force, and a given property tax owner is paying taxes through various taxing mechanisms for all three."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1077.843,1087.768,"Well, each one of those would be a full sovereign in its own right, and would be an entity in which these citizens could participate--"
2000.00-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1087.768,1098.998,"Well, it's true, but the assumption of the question is that the Indian sovereignty is sufficient to give it authority to provide fire services, police services, and so on."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1104.532,1111.63,"--Well, certainly the tribe can provide the services, but the nonmembers cannot participate in tribal government."
2000.00-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1111.63,1113.942,Could the tribe not provide the services?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1140.98,1141.723,Yes.
2000.00-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1143.952,1164.097,"Well, since you say the tax is on the guests at the hotel, and the hotel merely acts as a conduit, then why was the... why did the tribal court say that the hotel owner was liable?"
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1164.097,1175.781,"There is a specific statutory provision which says that if the taxes are assessed against the guests, that the hotel must pay."
2000.00-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1178.298,1181.847,"So it's statutory in the sense of tribal regulation, or--"
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1181.847,1190.475,"There... it appears, I think, on page 105(a) of the petition appendix, if I recall correctly."
2000.00-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.128,1195.1,"--Is it tribal, or Federal, or state?"
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1195.1,1196.336,--It is tribal.
2000.00-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1196.336,1197.412,Thank you.
2000.00-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1197.412,1201.249,"The state tax works the same way, doesn't it?"
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1209.894,1210.825,Yes.
2000.00-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1212.394,1221.106,"So is the legal question here, do the guests have a relationship with the tribe, or does the hotel have a relationship with the tribe."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1221.949,1232.706,"Well, I think that the central question is, do the guests have the relationship, because the incidence of the tax as Your Honor pointed out at the outset falls on the guests."
2000.00-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1232.706,1239.598,"Well, you're not going to win very much if that's what we hold... the tribe will just go back and impose the tax on the hotel."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1239.598,1240.175,And I... and I--
2000.00-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.175,1242.283,You really want us to address that question?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1242.283,1265.028,"--I think that the arguments that have been made by the other side may require this Court to address it, because they have tried to reach the guests through the activities of the hotel, and I think the rationale for why the guests are not taxable is that a transaction between nonmembers on fee land is not one over which the tribe has jurisdiction."
2000.00-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1292.809,1295.243,"Mr. Cole, can I go back to kind of a basic question."
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1311.135,1311.59,--No.
2000.00-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.447,1314.356,Why doesn't it have that power?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1314.356,1320.589,"Because these are roads that are... this is a... it's right on a state highway, at least as for this hotel."
2000.00-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1337.596,1348.62,Does the tribe impose taxes on nontribal members residing on fee land within the reservation?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1353.283,1359.393,"No, it does not impose... it doesn't impose some of those taxes on anybody within the reservation."
2000.00-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.133,1367.074,What about real estate tax?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1368.931,1369.47,No.
2000.00-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.011,1376.323,This sounds pretty good... where is this reservation?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1376.323,1396.468,"--Well, it's... Your Honor, that's a point that... there is a sphere of Federal protection from state taxes that surrounds the reservation so that the members are not being... are not being charged state income taxes... that's the McClanahan decision."
2000.00-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1422.93,1426.106,Is your client paying property taxes and income taxes?
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1426.106,1426.766,To the state?
2000.00-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1494.426,1515.687,Assuming that the hotel rather than the guests are the object of the tax... why isn't the acceptance of fire service... I think it's conceded that on at least one occasion the tribal fire brigade did come to assist the hotel.
2000.00-454,0,18674,charles_g_cole,,1521.176,1525.18,There is some ambiguity about how that was requested.
2000.00-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1559.898,1561.134,"Very well, Mr. Cole."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,1563.529,1571.415,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1590.362,1594.737,"Now, you say they elect to travel onto the Navajo reservation."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,1609.803,1613.108,"--We think... in the area of taxation, we think it is sufficient."
2000.00-454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1634.406,1641.011,Is it any different from what went on in Strate where it was a Federal highway?
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,1649.806,1658.722,"We believe that there is a distinction here between the cases cited by the petitioner, Montana, and in Strate."
2000.00-454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1682.704,1689.308,"I don't follow that distinction, as I would think that the more basic power is the power to tax."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,1718.081,1720.766,--I think in certain areas.
2000.00-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1742.601,1753.308,"But if I remember correctly, Cameron and Cameron trading post are right on the main highway from Flagstaff up to the Grand Canyon."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,1778.722,1778.722,--Yes.
2000.00-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1778.722,1783.075,Without ever being on reservation land.
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,1785.054,1790.034,"That is correct, or they could travel on the state highways which were right of ways granted--"
2000.00-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1790.034,1799.899,"So it may make it a lot closer to Strate... I mean, the hotel itself is owned by a nontribal member and is located on nontribal land."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,1812.242,1820.787,"--Your Honor, I think this would... I think this tax would be upheld under either one of the two Montana exceptions."
2000.00-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1822.273,1829.582,What's... what's the consensual relationship of the hotel guests with the tribe?
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,1829.582,1843.578,--We feel that the consensual relationship that the hotel guests have with the Navajo tribe would be that they travel onto the Navajo reservation and they're receiving the benefits of police and fire protection.
2000.00-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.866,1855.921,"Well, that's not as unfair as one might think."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,1894.354,1898.069,"--It may vary, but I think it may be about two thirds."
2000.00-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1899.183,1901.495,So I don't consider that terribly unfair.
2000.00-454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1916.151,1920.731,How is it different from Strate in that respect?
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,1928.411,1936.501,--I think the distinction here... and I guess I am taking a look at the reason for taxation.
2000.00-454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1939.928,1940.094,But no.
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,1952.354,1957.555,"--I think applying the Strate rule, and then I think we would be in a difficult situation."
2000.00-454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1957.555,1957.821,Okay.
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,1965.812,1967.669,There are nineteen--
2000.00-454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1967.669,1968.784,That's on fee land.
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,1968.784,1969.405,--Okay.
2000.00-454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1974.152,1974.895,All right.
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,1994.214,2006.557,"I think with respect to the other four that are located on fee land, their ownership may be different than here, and that one, maybe two, are owned by tribal members."
2000.00-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2027.901,2031.244,Do all those hotels pay the occupancy tax?
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2031.244,2034.421,--All of the hotels on the Navajo reservation pay this tax.
2000.00-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2041.441,2053.33,"But presumably for the hotels that are not on fee land, at least, they are not... the guests are not paying a state tax or a county tax."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2054.072,2057.417,They... the hotels that are located on trust land?
2000.00-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2057.417,2060.016,On the reservation trust land.
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2060.016,2065.84,It's my understanding those hotel... those guests would also be paying the state and county taxes.
2000.00-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2065.84,2069.804,Do you have... is there anything on the record to tell us about that?
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2082.148,2095.933,It's my understanding that the nonmember owned hotels on trust land collect the Arizona and county taxes that are imposed on the hotel guests because of--
2000.00-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2095.933,2099.61,Nonmember owned hotels on trust land.
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2102.703,2108.936,--Member owned hotels... they may have... it's getting complicated here.
2000.00-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2115.874,2117.732,"Well, let's say it falls on the guest."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2117.732,2124.957,If it falls on the guest and then member owned hotels would be subject to collecting that tax and paying it over to the state.
2000.00-454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2124.957,2129.249,"Well, the incidence would be the same."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2140.395,2144.443,All nineteen... all nineteen pay the tax.
2000.00-454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2146.05,2148.447,Is this the only one that has protested?
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2148.447,2161.45,"This is... this is the only one who has litigated... there is one other hotel, I think, that has filed a... an appeal and they asked to wait until the outcome of this case."
2000.00-454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2161.45,2175.029,"But as far as you know, the hotels that are owned by tribal members on tribal land... trust land... are paying the Arizona and the county tax as well."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2175.029,2177.175,Yes.
2000.00-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2177.175,2180.852,"And the tribal tax, as well."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2180.852,2181.262,Yes.
2000.00-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2185.06,2188.199,And the record somewhere discloses this?
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2188.199,2189.564,--It would be... it would be in the record.
2000.00-454,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2265.436,2276.498,"Well, I think the state has an interest in making sure that owners of fee land are treated fairly and equitably."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2276.498,2278.606,Yes.
2000.00-454,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2278.606,2284.65,"In the state of Arizona, and all of the Arizona citizens who are using the hotel... that's the state's interest."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2284.65,2287.067,That's correct.
2000.00-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2330.413,2335.364,"Mr. Gomez, can I ask you a question about how far your position would extend?"
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2361.787,2368.02,"You know, I think what we're asking for is a rule that applies to the Navajo reservation, and--"
2000.00-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2368.02,2375.989,"This is a specific... Navajo reservation specific case, in other words, not a general rule."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2375.989,2382.016,"--You know, we think that the facts here were more than ninety nine percent of the land is held in trust on the Navajo reservation."
2000.00-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2382.016,2388.637,"And if the next case involves one where eighty five percent is held in trust, what will we do with that case?"
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2388.637,2391.714,I think you have to look at the facts of the case--
2000.00-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.714,2394.481,Each case would be fact specific.
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2394.481,2394.936,--on its merits.
2000.00-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2394.936,2399.106,In a way... in a way that's a better case for the tribe.
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2452.582,2466.245,"We believe that in taxation what the Navajo government has tried to do is it's tried to be as fair as possible so that when they pass a tax, everybody that engages in that business has a responsibility of paying that tax."
2000.00-454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2485.647,2494.581,"But I don't think any of our cases dealing with this issue of, you know, what percentage of the land is held in trust, or what might be fee land?"
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2501.806,2528.101,"The only case that I'm aware of where it seemed where a percentage of fee land was the Brendale closed reservation judgment of this Court, where I think ninety seven percent of the land was held in trust in the closed reservation in Brendale."
2000.00-454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2528.101,2539.884,"Mr. Gomez, may I... may I ask about the weight you put on the Indian trader status that this hotel has had?"
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2562.918,2591.154,"Well, it's my understanding that for this operation to even engage in economic activity within the exterior boundaries of the Navajo reservation, it is required to obtain an Indian trader's license under the Indian trader statutes and regulations... a Navajo business reservation license... and that it cannot engage in business in the absence of acquiring that license."
2000.00-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2591.154,2595.035,But this is like a statute till business... it just couldn't trade with the Indians.
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2608.288,2636.357,"It is my reading that previously this hotel operation or the store... in fact, it's a trading company... challenged the Indian trader... the applicability of the Indian trader regulations in the Ninth Circuit in a previous case, Ashcroft, and in that case it was determined that they were required to obtain an Indian trader's license even though they had just a small amount of sales to tribal members."
2000.00-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2636.357,2639.041,"Oh, I understand that, but suppose they had no tribal members."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2649.072,2650.186,"Well, I--"
2000.00-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2650.186,2650.929,Certainly not.
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2650.929,2653.901,--It seems like the regulations may require--
2000.00-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.901,2655.47,"Well, then everybody is an Indian trader."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2656.751,2661.869,"--Within the exterior boundaries of the Navajo reservation, I think that would be true."
2000.00-454,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2661.869,2665.956,"--Well, but of course in this case it's as if the buyer had to have a license."
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2669.671,2670.043,Yes.
2000.00-454,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2670.043,2676.442,--I've never heard of an Indian trader statute... maybe I'm wrong... where buyers have to have a license?
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2676.442,2677.352,No.
2000.00-454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2709.59,2714.298,"A tax, but do you expect to pay three?"
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2714.298,2718.878,"--I'll look at my bill this evening, but--"
2000.00-454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2718.878,2720.986,You never know.
2000.00-454,1,35910,marcelino_r_gomez,,2720.986,2734.36,--I think that this case is different than Montana in that the demographics are much different.
2000.00-454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2769.654,2771.14,"Thank you, Mr. Gomez."
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2774.113,2783.567,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2805.336,2807.527,I understand... I thought they didn't trade with the reservation.
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2809.877,2814.873,"--Your Honor, the record is clear that, in fact, they do trade with Indians on the reservation."
2000.00-454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2814.873,2818.095,But what percent of their revenue comes from trade on the reservation?
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2818.095,2824.122,I don't believe that's... they say that one or two percent of their... the total sales.
2000.00-454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2824.122,2827.549,"You're saying less than one percent, so it really has nothing to do with it."
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2827.815,2828.121,I don't--
2000.00-454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2828.121,2842.288,"--In other words, if a person opens up a huge shopping mall and he happens to have... he sells one yo yo to somebody on a reservation, that then the reservation could impose any tax they want?"
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2845.093,2847.861,"--No, Your Honor, that's not quite what I'm saying."
2000.00-454,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2897.977,2900.001,This is a Federal regulation?
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2900.001,2900.911,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
2000.00-454,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2905.407,2912.716,"But as Justice Scalia said, it might not... it may be formalistic, but at least in this case the incidence is on the guests."
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2913.663,2915.893,"Yes, Your Honor, and I would say two things."
2000.00-454,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2916.786,2919.758,And they haven't consented to do business with the tribe.
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2919.758,2937.962,"--We think that that makes the consent prong perhaps a more complicated analysis, Your Honor, but we do believe because the guest is engaging in a transaction that cannot exist but for the license that has to be obtained under these regulations--"
2000.00-454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2937.962,2938.434,Why?
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2940.729,2941.235,--Yes.
2000.00-454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2941.235,2945.476,I read the statute... the statute says power to appoint traders with Indians.
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2973.34,2974.166,"Two things, Your Honor."
2000.00-454,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2984.901,2986.387,What sort of regulations?
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2989.609,2990.845,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-454,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2999.845,3001.619,"Well, where is that in the brief?"
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3001.619,3010.536,"Your Honor, I don't believe it's in... the regulations in the statute are, Your Honor... this is simply the authority to promulgate the regulations."
2000.00-454,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3030.659,3033.138,"Well, where's the trade with the Indians in this case?"
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3033.138,3035.533,"--Your Honor, that was the question that was litigated in the Ashcroft case."
2000.00-454,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3035.533,3037.641,"Well, yes, but we're not bound by the Ashcroft decision."
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3037.641,3047.133,"No, I was just explaining, however, that the claim there was that these regulations should not apply because they do not deal primarily with Indians."
2000.00-454,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3047.133,3052.6,But didn't that deal with the trading post... the little markets that sell things?
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3055.655,3060.28,"Well, it was the business which includes all of these operations, we believe Your Honor."
2000.00-454,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3094.393,3097.432,And what is the statutory section again that authorizes it?
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3097.432,3100.526,Section 2 and Section 9.
2000.00-454,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3100.526,3101.807,Twenty five 2... and 2 through 9.
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3101.807,3102.55,Yes.
2000.00-454,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3110.929,3127.73,"And can you quote from them an expressed statement to the effect that the Government is purporting to require the license not merely to trade in the terms that Justice Scalia quoted a moment ago, but to provide non Indian services."
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3127.73,3139.536,The regulations... the statutory authority is to regulate trade with the Indians.
2000.00-454,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3139.536,3139.907,Right.
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3139.99,3144.16,"And to... and to introduce, for example, goods into that area."
2000.00-454,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3144.16,3144.515,--Okay.
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3167.649,3170.211,"Yes, Your Honor, we believe they do."
2000.00-454,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3171.326,3172.601,Can you... can you quote?
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3172.601,3192.663,"--In the regulations governing the Navajo business reservations... in those provisions, it expressly provides that for an Indian trader to apply for a license, it has to include any approval that is required by tribal or Federal regulations."

2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3210.185,3215.303,"--Yes, Your Honor, to the extent that they also trade with Indians."
2000.00-454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3215.303,3215.963,"No, no."
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3226.123,3226.123,The point--
2000.00-454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3226.123,3227.775,It's only for tourists--
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3227.775,3227.775,--The point--
2000.00-454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3227.775,3231.862,"--Knowing now, do you... it is, however, on fee land on the reservation."
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3239.254,3247.094,"--No, Your Honor, because the hotel would not be permitted to deny customers based on their Native American status."
2000.00-454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3247.837,3249.573,You have to be an Indian trader.
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3251.802,3253.66,If you are operating a business--
2000.00-454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3253.66,3254.197,"--My, my."
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3262.826,3264.478,"--Your Honor, that's the history of the Navajo... of the Indian trader statutes."
2000.00-454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.478,3265.677,"Well, that's remarkable."
2000.00-454,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3265.677,3266.048,All right.
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3266.048,3266.214,This was directed--
2000.00-454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3266.214,3268.749,Let's assume you just didn't have the license.
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3275.791,3275.791,--I think--
2000.00-454,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3275.791,3281.158,"By the way, the only people who ever come are people who are not Indians."
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3281.158,3289.416,"--I think then, if you set all of that aside, you also then come back to the analysis under Montana, Your Honor, and I would like to address that."
2000.00-454,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3289.416,3308.363,"No, but before you do, please, is there... I just want to know whether the Secretary has gone so far as to say in so many words that the provision of these kinds of hotel services that we keep describing over and over again requires the Indian trader license."
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3312.905,3319.775,I will read you the definition of reservation business which explains that it governs businesses on reservations that deal with Indians.
2000.00-454,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3320.89,3322.747,That's your best shot?
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3322.747,3323.862,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-454,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3323.862,3324.195,Okay.
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3324.195,3325.97,--And that's the overall scheme--
2000.00-454,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3325.97,3326.629,"Okay, what's--"
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3326.629,3327.001,--This is to regulate--
2000.00-454,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3327.001,3330.716,"--No, but I don't want... you talk about overall schemes."
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3364.485,3372.083,--We believe that the Navajo business reservation regulations at 25 C.F.R. 141 include several provisions that anticipate that.
2000.00-454,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3376.42,3377.284,"Goods, goods."
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3378.11,3382.38,"--For example, there is a bond requirement that every trader must post, and any--"
2000.00-454,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3382.38,3383.561,That every trader must post.
2000.00-454,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3383.561,3389.544,--And any customer that would recover is entitled to go against that bond for the recovery of their judgment.

2000.00-454,3,18674,charles_g_cole,,3398.461,3405.769,I'd like to put this discussion of the Indian trader statute in a somewhat broader context.
2000.00-454,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3449.692,3452.293,"Well, Williams against Lee has held that it did, and it--"
2000.00-454,3,18674,charles_g_cole,,3452.293,3463.893,"--Well, right, but the United States is arguing that these statutes in this regulatory scheme gives the tribes additional powers over nonmembers on fee lands."
2000.00-454,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3584.804,3586.251,"Thank you, Mr. Cole."
