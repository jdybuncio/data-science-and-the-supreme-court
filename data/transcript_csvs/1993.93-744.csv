1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.325,"We'll hear argument now in No. 93-744, the Director of the Office of Workman's Compensation v. The Greenwich Collieries."
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,11.481,15.088,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,84.998,86.701,"How rare is rare, Mr. DuMont?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,90.762,104.053,"Well, I think that we can see that it doesn't happen all the time from the fact that, as the statistics quoted in our brief point out, under current law, black lung claimants are successful in achieving benefits only in about 7 percent of the cases."
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,108.692,112.941,"What percentage of those 7 percent are ""true doubt"" cases, do you know?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,112.941,114.642,"Those are the cases... well, we don't know."
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,136.556,138.087,Was... go ahead.
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,149.942,171.105,"Well, we think that in some of these cases there are reasons why the ALJ... particular reasons why the ALJ's may find equipoise more commonly than normal, particularly because you often have cases such as the early cases under the Longshore Act or the Maher case here, where there's a complicated question of medical causation, you have respectable medical opinions on both sides of the issue."
1993.93-744,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,172.307,179.32,Do you have figures for the rarity under the Longshore Workers' Act comparable to the Black Lung Benefits?
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,179.93,183.351,--There are no comparable compiled or published statistics.
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,191.91,198.533,"Well, and that is your definition of very rare, 7 or 8 percent of the cases."
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,198.533,214.931,"Well, we would simply point out that it's not being applied across the board and indiscriminately by ALJ's to avoid their responsibility to evaluate the evidence and to reach conclusions as to which party has produced preponderance, where one party or the other has produced a preponderance."
1993.93-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,235.782,244.434,"Mr. DuMont, what is the standard of review of the ALJ on whether or not it was correct to say the evidence was in equipoise?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,244.434,252.306,"Both the Benefits Review Board and the court of appeals apply a substantial evidence standard of review, in general, to ALJ decisions."
1993.93-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,263.13,270.533,"Does that mean that, as a practical matter, if the ALJ says there's equipoise and there is some evidence on both sides, that that will be accepted?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,270.533,273.032,Not always.
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,364.447,368.227,"And there was no reliance there, I take it, on any administrative regulation."
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,368.227,370.04,There was no regulation.
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,393.999,397.076,So the court of appeals simply upheld that decision.
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,397.076,398.31,That's correct.
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.31,401.278,Under what legislation was this?
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,401.278,402.604,That was under the Longshore Act.
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.604,406.587,"And who was the suit against, it was against an employer?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,406.587,412.195,The suit was by an employer against the deputy commissioner who had rendered the decision granting benefits.
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.412,418.333,But the pocket was not the Government's pocket; it was an employer's pocket in that case.
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,418.333,418.567,That's correct.
1993.93-744,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,418.567,424.581,Is there a counterpart for any State workers' compensation schemes?
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,440.62,444.321,I am not aware of any State that does.
1993.93-744,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,445.634,449.726,"There was a suggestion, I think, in one of the briefs that no State does."
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,449.726,458.784,"I know there's a wide variety of State rules on these issues, and I'm not aware of whether any State imposes a rule comparable to the ""true doubt"" rule."
1993.93-744,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,458.784,460.159,Thank you.
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,460.159,480.197,"The decision announced in... or the principle announced in F. H. McGraw v. Lowe, this tie-breaking principle resolving doubts in favor of a claimant in doubtful cases, continued to be announced consistently by the courts of appeals in reviewing Longshore Act cases, and it continues to be applied in such cases today."
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.197,480.588,Excuse me.
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,490.225,498.066,In F. H. McGraw v. Lowe there was an administrative enunciation that was accepted by the court of appeals and ratified by the court of appeals.
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.066,498.223,"Right, okay."
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,502.018,506.626,"It's not entirely clear where the... who made the first ""true doubt"" decision."
1993.93-744,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,531.583,535.676,Don't some people attribute it to the D.C. Circuit back in 1932?
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,535.676,549.514,"Well, there's the Burris case back in 1932, and that was certainly one of the early cases that announced the principle that, in terms of statutory interpretation, benefits should... the benefit of the doubt should go to the claimant, that's correct."
1993.93-744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,579.33,593.823,"What is your theory for squaring 718.403 of 20 CFR, which says that the burden of proving a fact alleged in connection with any provision of this part shall rest with the party making the allegation?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,603.46,605.46,"Well, that is one way of reading it."
1993.93-744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,625.422,633.027,It's odd to talk about the burden of going forward in the context of burden of proving effect.
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,642.07,662.391,"I will admit that it seems a little odd until, frankly, you start reading some of the cases in this area and the legislative history of the Administrative Procedure Act, and you realize that the terms ""burden of proving"" and ""burden of proof"" are used quite loosely, and they quite often are used in contexts where it's not clear or not necessary to distinguish whether one is talking about the burden of persuasion or the burden of production."
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.135,676.51,We didn't hold that.
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,679.197,699.001,"Well, respectfully, I would say it's not dictum, because if it were... if the Court had not held that, it would have had to go on to consider the issue raised by the employer in that case, that regardless of the administrative policies under the Labor Board's interpretation, the Administrative Procedure Act, of its own force, required that the general counsel bear the burden on all issues in adjudication."
1993.93-744,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,699.001,706.842,"You don't think we could follow a rule of general application that law is not made in footnotes, that holdings are not stated in footnotes?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,706.842,714.713,"Well, I can say that I think we would feel very reluctant to ignore a flat statement, even in a footnote, in one of this Court's opinion."
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,715.181,718.68,"But if it's so important, why is it in a footnote?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,718.68,726.021,"--Well, because it was not essential... the reason it's important is because the Court decided that it was not essential to reach that issue in Transportation Management."
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.021,730.269,"Well, then... but then doesn't your argument that it was a holding fall apart, if it wasn't essential?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,730.269,730.754,No.
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,752.151,759.82,It seems to me that to draw something out of what is the third sentence in a footnote and say this is what decides the case is extraordinary.
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,759.82,764.13,"Well, we certainly don't rely on simply the fact that the Court has said that before."
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.907,777.312,Which hadn't been cited by the parties.
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,792.259,798.648,"Respectfully, I believe that the employer's brief in Transportation Management did raise that argument, which is why the Court was responding to it in the footnote."
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,798.648,799.929,I don't think they did.
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,809.205,809.409,Exactly.
1993.93-744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,864.044,865.856,"Well, but it does say"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,876.274,884.1,"--Well, the claimant has brought the case to the board and the claimant wants the board to order payment, or wants the ALJ to award benefits."
1993.93-744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,892.033,894.345,Or perhaps he's an opponent of the order.
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,894.345,895.595,--That's possible.
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.688,936.312,But does that language suggest that that's all that it means?
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,944.434,949.23,"I think it's very difficult, after you look at all the cases, to say that it has a normal meaning."
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,953.649,969.408,"It can... it seems to me that the legislative history you refer to can be explained as simply addressing the only part of the first sentence that might be ambiguous, whether it referred, in addition to the burden of proof, also to the burden of persuasion."
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,970.876,990.073,"Well, I will simply point out that if you interpret... if one interprets it to mean burden of production, as the D.C. Circuit did... and this is something the D.C. Circuit pointed out... then it is perfectly consistent to say that both parties, all parties in the litigation have the same burden, which is what the legislative history says."
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,998.178,1009.486,"--And you think it's not incoherent to read section 7(c)... the third sentence, you assert, establishes a preponderance of the evidence rule, right?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1023.293,1026.182,"It certainly speaks to both the quantity and quality of evidence, yes."
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.182,1033.476,So Congress is shaking its finger at the agencies and saying you must... proof must be made by a preponderance of the evidence.
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1042.925,1044.83,Well--
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1044.83,1055.17,"I find that so extraordinary, to think that Congress is going to go to the trouble of establishing a preponderance rule and say anybody in the world can be given the burden of carrying the preponderance."
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1055.17,1057.342,"--Well, with respect, I don't think that's correct."
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.35,1116.13,"Well, but it seems to me ordinarily it does tell you."
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1122.69,1130.251,"--The burden... the party upon whom the burden of persuasion is placed fails, that's exactly right, but that's why you need a burden of persuasion rule which is different from the standard of proof."
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1132.062,1133.935,"Well, where do you get this distinction?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1136.466,1154.677,"Well, I think if you look at the first and third sentences of section 7(c), you can see that there is a distinction between talking about burdens of going forward and burdens of persuasion, which is really covered by the first sentence, and talking about the standard of evidence that whoever bears the burden of persuasion on a particular point has to meet."
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1154.677,1161.144,"When was 718.403 adopted, the regulation that Justice Kennedy inquired about?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1161.144,1166.032,"So far as I know, it was part of the original 718 regulations, which were adopted in 1980, I believe."
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1166.032,1170.688,As a response to the enactment by Congress of the Black Lung Program?
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1170.688,1178.558,"Well, as a response, in general, to the transfer of functions from the Secretary of HHS to the Secretary of Labor."
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1178.558,1184.321,"Well, did it have a predecessor in HHS, the reg, 718.403?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1184.321,1188.538,"I don't believe that there was a specific predecessor to that regulation, no."
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1188.538,1194.49,"And was there any comment in connection with its adoption, by the Secretary at the time of its adoption?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1194.49,1195.692,Yes.
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1200.332,1211.17,"And it's 7... is 718.493, is that the regulation you rely on to say that the Secretary's conduct here was justified, that it supports the ""true doubt"" rule?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1211.17,1212.467,"No, not at all."
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1213.388,1215.044,"Well, what regulation is it?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1215.044,1221.744,"--If you look on the previous page of our brief, on page 1a, the regulation 718.3(c)."
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1221.744,1224.462,718.3(c).
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1224.462,1224.899,Right.
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1224.899,1227.398,And what does that say?
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1227.398,1229.49,That says that... it says two things.
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1242.689,1249.171,"But that doesn't certainly support the use of the ""true doubt"" rule the way it was used in this case, does it?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1249.171,1250.171,"Well, we believe it does."
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1258.416,1263.04,"Well, that's very vague about embodies the intent of the ""true doubt"" rule."
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1270.021,1272.192,"It does not state the ""true doubt"" rule in terms."
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1272.192,1272.567,It certainly doesn't.
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1272.567,1272.989,That's right.
1993.93-744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1309.755,1315.894,"Well, Mr. DuMont, is the burden of proof a matter of substantive law, do you suppose?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1315.894,1318.299,It can be.
1993.93-744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1318.299,1319.033,Yes.
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1319.033,1320.47,The--
1993.93-744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1320.47,1324.468,"So I'm not sure it's even open to regulatory change, is it?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1324.468,1331.185,--It would not be open to regulatory change if the statute itself provided a rule for the burden of persuasion.
1993.93-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.674,1361.171,"Except its incorporation of the APA, if we disagree with you on the meaning of the APA."
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1361.171,1378.4,"If you agree... if you believe that the APA imposes a preponderance standard on all litigation where it applies, then we would still say we win this case, because we think that the APA... section 7(c) in particular, and the APA in general, provide for exceptions."
1993.93-744,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1392.315,1418.789,"But if you're right about your first interpretation, that the statute... assuming the statute doesn't speak to it and 7(c) is only production burden, are you saying that every agency that doesn't have a specific statutory allocation of the persuasion burden can decide for itself whether to have a ""true doubt"" rule or require preponderance, so it's totally the agency's option?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1418.789,1429.487,"Well, we think it puts within the agency's sphere of decision making the same kind of issue it has... the same kind of decision it has on many issues, which is what is consistent with congressional policy and the intent of the statute."
1993.93-744,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1444.872,1458.898,"Do you have any idea how many agencies are in this situation, they have no explicit statutory allocation of the persuasion burden and so they have only 7(c), which you say is only the burden of coming forward?"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1458.898,1461.506,"I'm not aware of exactly what a count would be, no."
1993.93-744,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1461.506,1464.941,"Counselor, your position is that if a statute says"
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1479.779,1484.372,You're speaking in terms of the Black Lung Act and its incorporation.
1993.93-744,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1484.372,1484.685,"Well, yes."
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1491.65,1501.506,"Well, I think it's important to note that when the APA is incorporated in the Black Lung Act, for instance, it's incorporated under a regime which first of all says that the APA doesn't apply except as specifically provided."
1993.93-744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1516.844,1523.73,Do you have any authority for a case which imposes a similar analysis and comes to a similar conclusion?
1993.93-744,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1523.73,1527.682,--I'm not aware of a case that involves quite this kind of statutory structure.
1993.93-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1529.619,1530.869,"Very well, Mr. DuMont."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1532.867,1536.085,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1555.936,1561.45,"Well, they do have something to look at in that footnote in Transportation Management."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1566.183,1571.633,"--Well, I think the footnote in Transportation Management, in their argument, is taken out of its context."
1993.93-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1585.408,1588.969,"Well, for your to prevail do we have to disavow that footnote?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1588.969,1591.28,"No, I don't have to disavow the footnote."
1993.93-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.258,1652.445,"Well, that's just to say that the decision was right in the case."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1665.188,1670.983,"Well, it's easy to explain how you should repudiate it, but they've taken it out of context in making the argument that's based on it."
1993.93-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.545,1688.945,"When you say they've taken it out of context, all you mean is that the case should have been decided that way anyway, but not on the ground... surely not on the ground that the section in question involves only the burden of production, rather than the burden of persuasion."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1688.945,1692.256,--I do not believe that section 7(c) involves only the burden of production.
1993.93-744,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1714.576,1722.916,"We used the same usage... the Court did in the Ward's Cove opinion, didn't it, in describing the so-called burden of proof on the business justification?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1725.211,1726.758,Well--
1993.93-744,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1726.758,1730.225,"So the footnote doesn't seem to be unique, I guess is the point."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1730.225,1736.566,"--No, I don't think that it... it may not be unique, but that's not an Administrative Procedure Act case, as I recall."
1993.93-744,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1736.566,1743.408,"Well, it isn't, but the terms that it's using are common terms and we're still talking about burden of proof."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1743.408,1744.953,Yes.
1993.93-744,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1794.013,1805.352,"Well, would it make much sense for this Court to have interpreted the first sentence when, in the very same section, the ultimate control, as you say, is the third sentence?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1816.721,1818.876,"Justice Ginsburg, you're right."
1993.93-744,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1862.031,1869.013,"But, in any event, we... I think that we can agree that the Government didn't make up its position for this case."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1882.211,1884.241,"Well, I take issue with that."
1993.93-744,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1914.746,1918.573,"Well, that's... in other words, on an issue of statutory interpretation?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1918.573,1918.821,Yes.
1993.93-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1966.708,1975.767,"What practical difference is there between the kind of standard you say the courts did apply and the ""true doubt"" rule?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1975.767,1983.858,"--Well, I think that the standard that the courts did apply in those other cases has nothing to do with tied evidence."
1993.93-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1984.717,1985.202,Nothing to do with what?
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1985.202,1986.577,--Tied evidence.
1993.93-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1986.577,1989.169,"Oh, tied like it counts for running, yes."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1989.169,1989.621,Right.
1993.93-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2034.431,2037.29,"Well, how is it applied and interpreted?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2066.091,2066.543,Almost always.
1993.93-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2066.543,2068.934,Almost always what?
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2068.934,2074.056,"Almost always, deference is given to the finder of fact by the appellate reviewer."
1993.93-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2114.305,2130.315,"How, how could a reviewing court determine that the evidence was, in fact, in equipoise, when it is not even permitted to determine whether there was a preponderance?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2150.338,2167.596,"Justice Scalia, that is... it is as impossible to do that as it is for administrative law judges to repeatedly, in case after case after case, find this complex evidence absolutely tied, but that's what we see in these cases."
1993.93-744,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2167.596,2173.499,"Well, we're told that the figure is under 10 percent, so it's not case after case after case."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2184.495,2187.29,I would dispute that figure.
1993.93-744,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2233.241,2242.332,"But you're not contesting that on these records, the fact finder could have found for the claimant by a preponderance."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2258.606,2263.261,"Well, I think the Third Circuit didn't want to engage in fact finding."
1993.93-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.267,2332.263,"May I ask in that connection, Mr. Solomons, do you contend that 20 CRF 718.3(c) is invalid?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2332.263,2335.199,"--No, I don't think it's invalid."
1993.93-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2408.092,2412.512,"Indeed, if you follow its plain language, they would have to apply a--"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2412.512,2413.106,Criminal standard.
1993.93-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.106,2414.604,--A criminal standard to the employer.
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2417.323,2420.508,And then I think we would ask you to do a rational basis analysis.
1993.93-744,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2422.039,2442.203,"What about the narrow argument under the Black Lung Act that... under 718.403, the issue is an issue of the administer... of the Secretary's interpretation of the Department's own regulations."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2462.976,2489.558,"Well, first, I think you have to deal with the Administrative Procedure Act there, and in the cases that deal with efforts by agencies to alter the Administrative Procedure Act, some very recent ones on the D.C. Circuit and some older ones by this Court, the holdings have uniformly been that the agency may not write a regulation that is inconsistent with one of the minimum basic standards of the Administrative Procedure Act."
1993.93-744,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2491.652,2496.618,"Which turns the argument into the invalidity of the regulation as the Secretary construes it, in other words."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2496.618,2497.821,"--As it is construed, yes, it does."
1993.93-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2533.01,2535.118,"Mr. Solomons, can I go back to the regulation?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2555.265,2559.624,"Well, I suppose that--"
1993.93-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.624,2568.215,"I mean, I suppose that... if the hearing officer just does... can't make up his mind and a reasonable judge couldn't, wouldn't you say that he has reasonable doubt about the outcome?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2568.215,2579.022,"--Well, the hearing officer has got a job to do, and his job is to conduct these proceedings in accordance with the normal rules and the APA rules."
1993.93-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.474,2629.206,"The rest of the regulations require to read burden of proof to mean burden of persuasion which, of course, is not an unreasonable reading."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2632.752,2634.408,"Well, there's more to it than that."
1993.93-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2655.711,2655.961,Indeed.
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2673.689,2675.158,"--Well, and I'm sure the Department--"
1993.93-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2675.158,2678.859,"And it's not a reasonable basis to say, well, we really can't tell whether there's a reasonable basis."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2678.859,2681.686,"--Well, I'm sure the Department would say that a tie is a reasonable basis."
1993.93-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2683.419,2684.372,Because they require a prima facie case.
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2684.372,2685.122,--I think ultimately goes no place.
1993.93-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2685.122,2690.916,"They require a prima facie case, and were only concerned that the employer meets the case with evidence of equal weight."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2696.133,2697.476,And that could be.
1993.93-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2741.068,2744.348,"Are you referring to the so-called ""true doubt"" rule?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2744.348,2744.551,--I'm going back.
1993.93-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2746.675,2754.562,"Where do we first find the words ""true doubt"" used to describe this rule that is being supported here by the Government?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2754.562,2763.371,"In a Benefits Review Board decision in 1978, not so much naming a rule but, I guess, distinguishing it from some other kind of doubt."
1993.93-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2782.13,2784.8,"Can't disagree with that, can you?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2784.8,2789.282,"Well, I do disagree with it."
1993.93-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2833.655,2835.405,Maybe the agency's just being too honest.
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2856.989,2857.255,--None at all.
1993.93-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.255,2859.66,"I mean, you'd have to take it on appeal, and on appeal--"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2859.66,2860.457,We'd lose.
1993.93-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2860.457,2868.796,"--The court would look at it and it would reweigh and it'd just say, well, there's some substantial evidence favoring the claimant and we have a generous decision here; we'll let it stand."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2868.796,2872.233,And that's why this rule engenders such amazing hostility.
1993.93-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2876.841,2880.62,"You're used to getting bad calls, but not used to its being admitted, is that it?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2883.542,2894.132,"Well, if the administrative law judge is held to the rigor of a normal standard of proof, then the administrative law judge is going to be required to carefully review the record."
1993.93-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2939.582,2948.624,But why do you say that... you're saying that if the administrative law judge doesn't like the party.
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2948.624,2954.154,"Well, I think the rule doesn't... the rule discounts the evidence because of the identity of the party."
1993.93-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2976.301,2993.34,"Well, but, you know, supposing that you're talking about a court case and the ordinary rule is that a plaintiff has to prove his side of the case by a preponderance, but Congress steps in and says well in this particular kind of case you've got to prove it by clear and convincing evidence."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,2998.822,2999.697,"No, I don't think so."
1993.93-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.254,3141.874,"May I ask, just to be sure I understand your position before you sit down, on the section 7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act, do you disagree with the interpretation of the Administrative Procedure Act in the footnote?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,3141.874,3149.479,"I think that the footnote is incomplete, and therefore I disagree with it."
1993.93-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3149.479,3163.553,"But, now, do you take the position that in any administrative proceeding in which the defendant or respondent has an affirmative defense, that the agency has the burden of persuasion that the affirmative defense is insufficient?"
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,3163.553,3165.943,"No, I don't think that's the way it works."
1993.93-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3178.765,3184.778,"The statute, if you read it as burden of persuasion, says the proponent of the order has the burden of persuasion."
1993.93-744,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,3187.747,3192.479,"Well, it troubles me, because I think that we don't... I know where my interpretation goes with these statutes."
1993.93-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3207.52,3208.924,"Thank you, Mr. Solomons."
1993.93-744,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3211.361,3212.049,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.93-744,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3230.603,3233.024,"Well, it doesn't mention the word ""true doubt"", does it?"
1993.93-744,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3233.024,3235.617,"--No, it does not use the same words, but I really think that's irrelevant."
1993.93-744,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3235.617,3242.583,"I thought respondent's contention was that the so-called ""true doubt"" rule is kind of putting a label on something that has been going on for a long while."
1993.93-744,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3242.583,3244.41,"Well, it puts a label on it."
1993.93-744,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3286.3,3288.283,"McGraw was before the APA, wasn't it?"
1993.93-744,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3288.283,3289.565,That's correct.
1993.93-744,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3289.565,3293.251,So that rule could... may have been okay before then.
1993.93-744,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3293.251,3302.716,"I think it's equally fair to infer that Congress, when it passed the APA, did not intend to disturb well settled principles of adjudication under preexisting statutes."
1993.93-744,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3302.716,3306.839,Didn't an earlier version of section 7(c) read
1993.93-744,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3314.943,3319.88,"That was changed, and I think the legislative history makes quite clear that change did not import any substantive change."
1993.93-744,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3319.88,3321.535,Did not eliminate the burden of proceeding.
1993.93-744,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3321.535,3323.347,It did not eliminate it.
1993.93-744,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3386.166,3386.807,"Thank you, Mr. DuMont."
