1977.76-1168,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.911,"We will hear arguments next in 1168, Arizona against George Washington."
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,51.038,51.479,Thank you Your Honor.
1977.76-1168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,164.562,169.452,"Was Judge Truman, the trial judge in both cases, both the first trial and the second trial?"
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,169.452,173.68,"No Your Honor, Judge Truman was not and there were --"
1977.76-1168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,173.68,174.917,Two different trial judge.
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,174.917,179.626,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.76-1168,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,374.73,379.014,"The rule of Court that you referred to, is that still a rule of Court that is still in effect?"
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,379.014,379.778,I am sorry Your Honor.
1977.76-1168,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,379.778,383.822,The rule of Court referred to as having them mentioning about the prosecution?
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,383.822,389.95,"Not originally, this is the original case took place --"
1977.76-1168,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,389.95,399.325,"But the statement you just made was, that's what I am addressing my question to, the rule referred to a rule which was at that time still in effect?"
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,399.325,415.135,"Yes, Your Honor and that rule regrading the memorandum opinion is still in effect that they are not considered citation for the purposes of authority, other than within very limited circumstances they have been referred by the Ninth Circuit Your Honor."
1977.76-1168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,531.071,538.047,"When you say that Court you view as it has interchanged, you used Joe for judge Walsh and the other time you are referring to the Superior Court?"
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,538.047,538.651,I apologize Your Honor.
1977.76-1168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,592.61,595.123,Which opinion is controlling?
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,595.123,596.042,Under these circumstances?
1977.76-1168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,596.042,601.257,You had one opinion with two judges and one opinion with one judge and that had trouble?
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,601.257,602.324,You mean the Ninth Circuit's opinion here?
1977.76-1168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,602.324,603.672,Yes.
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,603.672,608.467,I had a great deal of difficultly in understanding the purpose of the concurring opinion.
1977.76-1168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,623.266,625.284,But both of them were against you?
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,625.284,627.517,"That is correct, there is no question about that Your Honor."
1977.76-1168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,627.517,631.764,"I still do not know, which one is here?"
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,640.523,656.79,"Well, I do not think that the impact of the two opinions is substantially different, but I believe that we are properly here on the basis of the original opinion, that was not noted to be a concurring opinion."
1977.76-1168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,656.79,659.941,But the point is that Judge did not evolve three?
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,659.941,666.201,"Yes, Your honor."
1977.76-1168,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,842.879,850.948,"Do you think the, the element question is in case like this whether or not there was a manifest necessity?"
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,862.65,872.106,"Your Honor, I think that the question even more precisely, if I may is whether or not from the record in this case, entire record in this case manifest necessity is apparent."
1977.76-1168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.29,890.444,Is that true if there was some reason in the record to think that judge applied the wrong legal standing?
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,890.444,903.083,"I think, Your Honor that very probably that question be going the way depending upon the facts, but I am inclined to think that the question of what the judge said is far less important than the question what the judge did and what the circumstance dictated."
1977.76-1168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.898,918.528,Well if the judge indicated that he did not think that finding a manifest necessity was necessary at all in this case as he has read the cases and that all he had to do is to find some possible prejudice?
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,918.528,919.373,I think it is very probable.
1977.76-1168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,925.946,932.748,Even though he might canvas a record and find that there was a manifest necessity?
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,932.748,939.227,Had there been any real misconduct in the joint case I think it is really possible that the premise that you stated could have applied there.
1977.76-1168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,939.227,949.882,To what extent is habeas accorded if any obligated to give difference to a state trial court's findings and its implied finding on the subject such as this?
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,949.882,956.235,I do not believe that obligation extends or the extension of that obligation is any great factor.
1977.76-1168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.888,972.444,"When you say State Court, you mean Federal Court?"
1977.76-1168,0,41815,stephen_d_neely,,972.444,984.664,I am sorry Federal Court.
1977.76-1168,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1150.159,1152.654,very well Mr. Neely.
1977.76-1168,1,21974,ed_bolding,,1158.134,1162.247,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1168,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1206.55,1208.967,Did defense counsel had any problem there at on?
1977.76-1168,1,21974,ed_bolding,,1208.967,1210.392,Yes Your Honor.
1977.76-1168,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1210.392,1211.844,It was both sides?
1977.76-1168,1,21974,ed_bolding,,1211.844,1223.318,"Both sides, individual question by the jurors outside of the presence of all of the jurors, that was fully inquired into Your Honor at the request of the prosecutor incidentally."
1977.76-1168,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1271.452,1280.127,"Now, they were -- the jurors would sooner or later find if the transcripts were there that a prior trial had been held, would they not?"
1977.76-1168,1,21974,ed_bolding,,1280.127,1285.822,"Your Honor, in my opinion they knew already, but yes I believe that is correct."
1977.76-1168,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1285.822,1287.49,Do you have any question about it at all?
1977.76-1168,1,21974,ed_bolding,,1295.895,1298.151,I think there is no question at all Your Honor.
1977.76-1168,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1298.151,1304.631,But you seem to be using matters as justification for the conduct of the defense counsel would follow?
1977.76-1168,1,21974,ed_bolding,,1304.631,1314.621,"Your Honor, the -- I do not use that as justification, as that particular part of it as justification for defense counsel."
1977.76-1168,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1314.621,1337.191,"Let me turn one of the things said, after the warning by the trial judge to desist, the statement was made you will hear evidence that will show you that there was another eye witness, then you will hear evidence that, that evidence was suppressed and hidden by the prosecutor, you will hear that the evidence was purposely withheld and so forth --"
1977.76-1168,1,21974,ed_bolding,,1337.191,1337.415,Yes sir.
1977.76-1168,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1337.415,1340.362,How was the jury going to hear about that?
1977.76-1168,1,21974,ed_bolding,,1340.362,1345.582,"From the testimony from the witnesses Your Honor, from testimony of the witnesses."
1977.76-1168,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1359.784,1364.143,And the state paid its penalty for that by having a new trial ordered?
1977.76-1168,1,21974,ed_bolding,,1364.143,1368.069,"Your Honor, that is part of the penalty that they paid, yes sir."
1977.76-1168,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1368.069,1379.095,"Now, in what way would this evidence, these items that I just read that you will hear, how would that be relevant evidence admissible?"
1977.76-1168,1,21974,ed_bolding,,1379.095,1384.188,"Yes, Your Honor that would be admissible for many reasons."
1977.76-1168,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1417.811,1433.72,"But you are representing now to this Court that under Arizona law that kind of evidence would have been received so that the statements made by the defense counsel were correct statements, all of them were correct?"
1977.76-1168,1,21974,ed_bolding,,1433.72,1438.389,"Yes Your Honor, absolutely and for the --"
1977.76-1168,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1438.389,1441.138,"The Supreme Court did not think this was the same, did they?"
1977.76-1168,1,21974,ed_bolding,,1441.138,1444.333,"No sir, Your Honor they did not make the ruling in that area."
1977.76-1168,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1454.41,1457.657,Well the trial Judge certainly did not agree with your reasoning of Arizona law?
1977.76-1168,1,21974,ed_bolding,,1457.657,1462.367,"No Your Honor. Evidently he did not, although I cannot say that for sure."
1977.76-1168,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1535.113,1540.204,"Mr. Bolding, let me, you are free to go back the evidence, I would like to ask you a question first."
1977.76-1168,1,21974,ed_bolding,,1584.357,1586.598,Yes Your Honor.
1977.76-1168,2,41815,stephen_d_neely,,2788.746,2790.532,Just a moment Your Honor.
1977.76-1168,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2928.208,2928.988,Thank you counsel.
