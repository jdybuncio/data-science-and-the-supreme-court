1982.81-2257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.465,We will hear arguments next in Bill Johnson's Restaurants against National Labor Relations Board.
1982.81-2257,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,47.246,65.332,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue before the Court in this case is the extent to which restraints should be placed upon the power of the National Labor Relations Board to interfere with civil proceedings instituted in state court and growing out of a labor dispute."
1982.81-2257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.168,236.806,"Mr. Katz, were these--"
1982.81-2257,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,236.806,237.606,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-2257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.606,241.338,"--questions of federal law, state law, or some of both?"
1982.81-2257,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,241.338,245.896,Questions of defamation arising out of a labor dispute are questions of state law.
1982.81-2257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,249.007,258.331,"Are you saying that the Administrative Law Judge examined issues that were concededly of state law, such as whether there was a publication under the Arizona law of libel?"
1982.81-2257,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,258.331,268.748,"The question of whether there was a publication was not at issue, but other questions decided by the Administrative Law Judge, Justice Rehnquist, were in fact then pending before the state court."
1982.81-2257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,269.515,272.967,A federal question could be pending before the state court.
1982.81-2257,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,287.57,288.677,"--Yes, he did."
1982.81-2257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,289.566,290.881,That is clearly a state law question.
1982.81-2257,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,290.881,291.973,--It is purely a state law question.
1982.81-2257,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,317.479,346.203,"Mr. Katz, would you concede that perhaps the National Labor Relations Board, through its Administrative Law Judge, could still consider issues relating to whether it's an unfair labor practice here to have filed the state suit at least for purposes of giving other remedial relief other than the cease and desist order, for example, requiring payment of costs of suit?"
1982.81-2257,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,346.203,356.79,"--Justice O'Connor, I would say that the responsibility of the National Labor Relations Board in that circumstance would be to wait until the state court had issued its determination on the merits of the lawsuit."
1982.81-2257,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,379.922,388.762,What do you see in the Act that would affect the timing of the Board's jurisdiction in that regard?
1982.81-2257,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,388.762,409.363,"If I understand your question, Justice O'Connor, Section 10(j) of the Act would allow the National Labor Relations Board to file a petition with the United States District Court in order to protect the interests of the Act and the interests of employees against any direct infringement that might occur during the prosecution of that suit."
1982.81-2257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.636,435.041,That's an exception to the Anti-Injunction Act--
1982.81-2257,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,435.041,436.913,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-2257,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,488.036,495.937,--What if the Board had limited its relief to an order that court costs or legal fees be paid?
1982.81-2257,0,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,495.937,498.607,While the state court suit was still pending?
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1755.466,1777.771,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Justice White, the response to that is that the issue before the Board in an unfair labor practice proceeding is whether there has been a violation of the National Labor Relations Act, whether there has, for example, been a coercive interference with protection of rights, employee rights under Section 7."
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.771,1778.3,Yes.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1778.3,1796.418,"The issue that the Board considers in a situation like this one, in which the allegation is that the bringing, the filing and prosecution of the civil suit itself is coercive conduct, and is thus an unfair labor practice, is essentially the motivation of the employer--"
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.418,1796.793,Right.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1796.793,1800.732,--to the... there are a number of different sorts of evidence that can be used.
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.732,1808.71,"So that if he wouldn't have... so that if he has the unlawful motivation, that's... the unfair labor practice is complete at that point."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1808.71,1812.898,The unlawful motivation is the central focus of the inquiry.
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.671,1851.008,"Right, and if they find that his motivation is anti-union or whatever it takes to make an unfair labor practice, it could be that the unfair labor practice would be found even if, even if on any objective basis the lawsuit had... wasn't frivolous, or that it had a foundation in fact."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1851.008,1857.317,"Well, I think that the Board frequently considers many different sorts of evidence."
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.317,1867.155,"I know, and I would suppose it would consider whether or not the suit had a foundation in fact, but even if they found that it had a foundation in fact, it could be an unfair labor practice."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1868.672,1877.466,"I think that is conceivable, but I think the Board looks at many different sorts of evidence, including whether the suit has a reasonable basis in fact."
1982.81-2257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1877.466,1878.09,I know that.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1903.249,1907.764,"Well, I have to say that I don't think there has been a case like that before the Board."
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1910.935,1914.137,"Well, under your brief, the answer would be yes, it would be an unfair labor practice."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1914.137,1920.571,--I... my answer to that is that a case like that has not arisen.
1982.81-2257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1923.523,1925.305,Maybe this is it.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1928.819,1932.753,"Well, I think in this case you have many different sorts of evidence that the Board found."
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.299,1945.937,"Well, let's concede all the anti-union animus there is, but what if there's... what if this case is well grounded in fact?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1945.937,1949.154,I--
1982.81-2257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1949.154,1950.87,And state law.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1950.87,1956.54,--I am simply reluctant to commit the Board at this point to that sort of hypothetical.
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.433,1958.681,I thought you had in your brief already.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1958.681,1964.32,--It seems to me that what the Board does in this area is an accommodation.
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1990.699,2002.788,"Well, it brought a complaint... he pursued a complaint when the District judge, the United States District judge had said that the state court suit was not frivolous, and it had a basis in fact."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2002.788,2005.506,--I think the District--
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2005.506,2013.158,"And the general counsel decided not to pursue that in the court system, but to take it to the Board, and he did."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2013.158,2014.191,--Yes.
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.122,2024.824,"Well, it failed."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2025.327,2025.998,--That's correct.
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.043,2031.34,And it found it right on the point of whether there was a decent basis for the suit.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2031.34,2034.417,--I think that was not the only point in the District Judge's mind.
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2037.432,2038.368,"Well, that was one of them."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2038.368,2044.677,"--Well, I think the transcript reflects that the District judge was quite reluctant to step in at that point."
1982.81-2257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2058.501,2067.435,"Ms. Corwin, how many Administrative Law Judges are there for the National Labor Relations Board, just an order of magnitude?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2067.435,2071.261,"I'm sorry, I don't know the order of magnitude."
1982.81-2257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.348,2088.223,"Are each of them grounded, say, in the libel law of all the 50 states?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2088.223,2095.406,"--Indeed not, and that is not what the Administrative Law Judge attempts to do in a case like that."
1982.81-2257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2106.263,2123.065,"Well, but then we are right back to the hypothetical that Justice White put to you, and it doesn't seem to me... I realize you prefer not to answer the question, and certainly there may be good reasons for it, but if you are now going to again stress motive rather than the merit of the suit, it seems to me you do have to face up to the hypothetical."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2137.56,2141.841,"Well, I don't want to try to evade the question."
1982.81-2257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2153.072,2160.895,"Well, your earlier answer to me was that the 100 Administrative Law Judges don't have to be grounded in state law because all they look at is animus."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2160.895,2161.44,No.
1982.81-2257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2212.185,2213.81,"Well, but was it addressed to a reasonable basis of the suit?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2213.81,2219.138,It was addressed to the reasonable basis of the suit as one indication of the motive of the employer.
1982.81-2257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2219.138,2224.121,"Well, then, to the judge, to that... to the extent he made that sort of a finding, would have to know something about the law of the state."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2224.121,2235.867,I think that the judge may need to know something about whether a particular statement is true or false.
1982.81-2257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2240.441,2242.175,The broad outlines of what?
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2242.175,2248.126,"Of the state... of the components of libel law, for example, the truth or falsity of a statement."
1982.81-2257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2248.126,2250.984,Are you suggesting that libel law is uniform throughout the 50 states?
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2250.984,2271.929,"I'm not suggesting that, but I'm suggesting that the inquiry of the Administrative Law Judge is very limited, and to the extent there is an examination of this reasonable basis concept, it is confined to the sorts of questions like, is the statement true or false, is there any indication that there was malice."
1982.81-2257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2273.411,2277.131,"Well, how do you know when malice is necessary, without turning to the state law?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2277.131,2297.525,"--Well, I think that if one gets into the sort of questions that require further legal analysis or further inquiry into state law, I simply don't think that's the sort of thing the Administrative Law Judge is going to do."
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2300.321,2307.602,"But, Ms. Corwin, in his own findings he did conclude that the respondent did not have a reasonable basis for filing his lawsuit."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2313.006,2326.451,"Well, I think the inquiry of whether there is a reasonable basis for the lawsuit is not the same inquiry as who is going to prevail under the particular state law, and how the merits--"
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2326.451,2331.108,It is a little hard for me to understand a lawsuit that has no reasonable basis succeeding.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2331.108,2356.989,"--Well, I think in this case, for example, you had the employer state that it had a reasonable basis for the lawsuit because on the face of it simply... it simply stated state law claims, and that was the end of that, and you had the employer saying, I filed the lawsuit because I felt that I was personally attacked for filthy restrooms and unwarranted sexual advances."
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2356.989,2360.331,And the Administrative Law Judge looked at the facts and said those attacks were true.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2360.331,2362.72,That's correct.
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2362.72,2365.295,"I mean, you can't say he didn't look at the merits of the case, then."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2365.295,2371.733,"Well, he looked at some very basic facts of the case."
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2371.733,2373.324,They go farther than motive.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2379.945,2383.229,"No, I don't argue that he didn't look at the merits."
1982.81-2257,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2395.847,2411.808,"Well, is it your position that what the Board has to do is to simply find whether the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the alleged facts he is relying on occurred?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2412.572,2414.588,"Well, I think that is one possibility."
1982.81-2257,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2426.505,2428.927,"Well, but what's the Board's standard in these cases?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2432.566,2438.407,"Well, again, I would have to reiterate that the Board is concerned with what the employer's motive is."
1982.81-2257,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2450.386,2462.786,"Well, is the determination of whether the lawsuit has a reasonable basis in fact just a means of assessing whether it was filed for a retaliatory purpose?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2462.786,2463.508,--Yes.
1982.81-2257,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2464.725,2465.224,And that is all?
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2465.224,2476.642,"It is an indication among many of what the employer's motive was, whether it was for the purpose of coercing employees in the exercise of their protected activity."
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.642,2495.445,"Well, it now sounds like you have answered the question you were very reluctant to answer a while ago, if you answered yes to Justice O'Connor's question, that it is only relevant to determination of motive, and it is not an independent factor required to... for the finding of an unfair labor practice."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2495.445,2497.289,"That is correct, and I didn't mean to--"
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2497.289,2498.494,What is correct?
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2501.352,2505.272,"--That's... it only goes to the question of motive, of the employer's motive."
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.272,2506.645,"Well, so you have answered the question."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2522.156,2522.968,"Yes, that's correct."
1982.81-2257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2522.968,2529.651,Then a conclusion of bad motive is enough even though it were decided that the lawsuit had merit.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2529.651,2533.839,My reluctance to address that is--
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.839,2537.618,You have just expressed absolutely no reluctance.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2541.272,2554.815,"--It is certainly relevant to determining motive, but my concern is that I don't know how the Board would weigh the evidence in a suit such as the one that you suggest."
1982.81-2257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2585.77,2586.503,Ms. Corwin?
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2586.503,2587.536,Yes.
1982.81-2257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2587.536,2591.908,"We are not giving you much of an opportunity to argue your case, but I have a couple of questions."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2601.044,2604.12,We have not questioned that.
1982.81-2257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2606.808,2619.192,"And the end result of the Board's decision that was enforced by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is to enjoin the prosecution of that suit, is it not?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2619.192,2619.819,That is correct.
1982.81-2257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2624.41,2624.691,Yes.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2640.842,2657.052,That is the result only after the Board has found that the filing and prosecution of the suit is an unfair labor practice because it was for the purpose of harassing the employees for the exercise of their protected rights.
1982.81-2257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2672.985,2677.388,"Which in effect decides the issue of malice in a libel suit, doesn't it?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2679.139,2683.995,It decides whether the employer has violated the federal statute.
1982.81-2257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2685.651,2687.118,May I ask you one other question?
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2697.458,2701.331,"In fact, yes, that is what occurred in this case."
1982.81-2257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2701.331,2706.44,"Well, was a state suit prosecuted while the labor proceeding was going on?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2706.44,2707.516,"Yes, that's correct."
1982.81-2257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2716.388,2718.31,"Yes, and some depositions were taken."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2718.31,2718.934,That's correct.
1982.81-2257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2720.185,2723.543,"It never went to actual trial, did it?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2723.543,2724.962,It did not go to trial.
1982.81-2257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2745.404,2754.275,Suppose it had gone to trial and a verdict and judgment entered on it for the plaintiff before the Labor Board acted.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2760.241,2772.392,"Well, I think the Board's reaction to that development, had it occurred, which it did not in this case, but had it occurred, I think would depend on the circumstances in which that judgment were entered."
1982.81-2257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2829.403,2833.4,"If there were a final judgment in the state court, do you think the Board would defer to it?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2833.4,2838.289,"Again, I would have to say that it would depend on the circumstances--"
1982.81-2257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2838.289,2839.444,Just on the libel issue.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2841.164,2846.349,"--Well, in this case, there were two causes of action."
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2879.149,2892.829,"Ms. Corwin, would you agree that your theory as you have given it to us in response to Justice White's questions is quite different from the theory of the Court of Appeals, which did rely squarely on the absence of any reasonable basis in fact, and on that finding?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2892.829,2908.138,"Well, I think the Court of Appeals relied not only on the lack of reasonable basis in fact, but I think it recognized that there were other indications, other significant indications, such as the statement about getting even, the statement by a--"
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2908.138,2921.911,"There is additional evidence of improper motive, but I think it was critical to their holding that there was a finding that has not been challenged, as I understand it, in the cert petition, that there was no reasonable basis in fact, which is quite different from your theory."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2928.91,2937.154,--I have tried to suggest that the reasonable basis inquiry is simply an element of the conclusion as to whether the--
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2937.154,2937.922,I understand.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2942.98,2958.585,"--Well, I think the Court of Appeals spent considerable time on the reasonable basis point, but I think it, too, recognized that it goes to whether the motive of the employer is one that violates the federal labor laws."
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2958.585,2980.497,"Well, if we agree with you on that, that that is what the... it seems to me we really ought to remand to the Court of Appeals, because I thought they had relied on... I agree with Justice Stevens, they had relied on the lack of reasonable basis as an independent required element in the proof of the unfair labor practice."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2980.497,2984.873,"Well, I think that the Court of Appeals recognized that that was a significant--"
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2984.873,2991.321,In which event they may have violated Chainery for affirming on a ground that you say the Board doesn't use.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,2991.321,2994.663,--I don't read the Court of Appeals decision that way.
1982.81-2257,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3003.566,3007.798,"Well, what do we do if we read it that way, in your view?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3029.226,3034.286,I simply don't read them as having affirmed on that basis.
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.286,3034.992,All right.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3034.992,3048.75,"It seems to me that they had a lot of things in mind, and that obviously the discussion of the evidence took up more room in the opinion than the statements about the get even and the circumstances of the suit."
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3066.025,3070.209,"Ms. Corwin, Ms. Corwin, you... I don't know whether you were up here for the argument in the Wright-Line case."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3070.209,3071.226,Yes.
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3071.226,3099.12,"And there, the Board eschewed any suggestion that the unfair labor practice was complete upon proof of motivation, that if the employer could come back and prove that a non-discriminatory or a non-biased ground would have caused him to discharge the person anyway, it wasn't an unfair labor practice at all."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3109.431,3109.899,Well--
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.899,3112.163,--even if I had an anti-union bias.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3112.163,3115.63,"--In fact, I think that's what the employer tried to do in this case."
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3115.63,3116.004,I know.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3126.514,3128.343,Indeed not.
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3176.213,3197.348,"Well, if it were found that the lawsuit was well grounded in fact, and in state law, it would be difficult to say, wouldn't it, that part of the motive of filing the lawsuit was to vindicate the employer's reputation?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3197.348,3202.203,"Well, that is part of my reluctance in responding to your hypothetical, because I think the--"
1982.81-2257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3202.203,3204.157,"Well, you have responded well enough."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3204.157,3214.37,"--In a case like that, I think the general counsel might hesitate, and think that the evidence was close, and that the motivation was not as clear as it was in a case such as this one."
1982.81-2257,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3237.299,3254.231,"Ms. Corwin, is there anything in the legislative history of the National Labor Relations Act that would indicate Congress thought about the possibility that an employer or union prosecution of a state court suit could constitute an unfair labor practice?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3254.231,3257.448,I am not aware of anything in the legislative history.
1982.81-2257,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3299.305,3304.039,"Well, my question was whether there was anything in the legislative history, and I thought perhaps you--"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3304.039,3305.63,"Yes, and the answer to that is no."
1982.81-2257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3314.065,3324.733,--When was the first time after 1935 that the Board entered an order such as this requiring the cessation of a state court lawsuit?
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3324.733,3328.965,"Well, I think Mr. Katz referred to the Carter suit, which was quite early on."
1982.81-2257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3339.353,3341.334,I am more interested in the chronology of it.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3347.238,3349.067,--I am simply unaware of any.
1982.81-2257,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3413.089,3422.304,Is there any way to accommodate the parallel interests here short of ordering a cease and desist of the state suit?
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3422.304,3424.004,--Well--
1982.81-2257,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3424.004,3428.769,Is there any middle ground or other means of accommodating these interests?
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3428.769,3436.561,"--Well, to some extent, they have been accommodated already in the general rule that good faith litigation will not be the basis for an unfair labor practice."
1982.81-2257,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3472.92,3483.277,You don't think payment of fees and expenses and letting the state court determine the merits of the action would be an accommodation?
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3483.277,3501.799,"Well, I think reimbursement of legal expenses may get you part of the way there, but it doesn't do anything to solve the question of the employees, these waitresses, who are forced to engage legal counsel, to pay out a lot of expenses on things like depositions and trials and so on."
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3529.852,3536.972,"Of course, I wonder if the suit can really be characterized as that devastating if it is frivolous on its face."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3536.972,3544.035,"Well, I think that the... what occurred in this case is an example of what can happen."
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3565.369,3576.377,"But the bottom line is that once they've got their side presented to the state court judge, he found no significant merit to the complaint, and the risks, it seems to me, were minimal after that point."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3576.377,3577.66,"--Well, I... that's--"
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3577.66,3584.234,"True, they had damned them, and the complaint is for a lot of money, but you know, there are a lot of complaints like that that don't have any merit to them."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3584.234,3586.687,"--Well, I think that is true for part of the litigation here."
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3589.889,3591.39,But there is no basis in fact for it.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3595.465,3597.373,"--Well, I--"
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3597.373,3602.197,"I mean, we have to assume there is no merit to the suit, I believe, in analyzing the case."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3602.197,3604.212,"--Well, I think for purposes of federal law you do."
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3609.914,3610.288,They sure are.
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3611.801,3612.88,I'm sorry?
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3612.88,3617.708,"They certainly must follow that the case is over in the state court, isn't it?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3617.708,3618.862,"No, it is not."
1982.81-2257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3618.862,3619.892,"Oh, I misunderstood."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3620.894,3623.234,"My understanding is, it has been held in abeyance."
1982.81-2257,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3626.279,3626.782,"Oh, I see."
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3627.11,3627.75,--pending the outcome--
1982.81-2257,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3627.75,3632.121,"Well, didn't the state court deny a motion for summary judgment on the libel aspects?"
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3632.121,3632.48,--Yes.
1982.81-2257,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3632.48,3634.028,And isn't that waiting to go to trial?
1982.81-2257,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,3634.028,3636.59,"Yes, that is correct."
1982.81-2257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3636.59,3639.51,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Katz?"
1982.81-2257,2,34699,lawrence_allen_katz,,3639.51,3640.899,"I have nothing further to add, Your Honor."
1982.81-2257,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3640.899,3641.745,Fine.
