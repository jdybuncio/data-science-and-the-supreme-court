1970.40,0,16666,arnold_ordman,,41.32,41.812,Thank you.
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,1737.601,1741.313,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1788.137,1793.981,"But if it’s not in this case, it is not a matter of acute controversy matter in this case."
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,1793.981,1801.844,"No, it is a matter of acute controversy, Mr. Justice Black, with regard to conduct that may be considered secondary."
1970.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.841,1861.197,But how will the Union be affected at this stage by either affirmance or reversal of the case below?
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,1861.197,1864.864,"The Union will be affected, as will all Unions, in the whole area of the law, Mr. Justice White."
1970.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1864.864,1870.169,"I know, but its interest in this project is gone."
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,1870.169,1878.845,"Well as I indicated, Mr. Justice White, the power plant construction by Jersey Central Power and Light has various phases."
1970.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.845,1883.21,"But this-- but all the-- the only remedy against the Unions is a seize and decease order, isn’t it?"
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,1883.21,1885.559,"Yes, Your Honor, that’s the only thing on appeal here."
1970.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.559,1889.915,"And that will-- seize and decease at that project, at that place?"
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,1889.915,1893.028,"No, the secondary boycott order is a very broad order."
1970.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1936.339,1937.998,Is there-- what is it?
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,1942.792,1943.126,"No, sir."
1970.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1944.674,1949.066,"No, I say is-- doesn’t the statute provide for a damage action for secondary--"
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,1949.066,1951.407,"Yes, the statute does provide Section 303 is--"
1970.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1951.407,1955.706,"Now, for Burns & Roe, if this is reversed, would they have such an action against this Union?"
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,1955.706,1959.92,"They could, independently of how this case is decided, Your Honor."
1970.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1971.677,1974.994,"It may not be res judicata, but a bit rather important--"
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,1974.994,1976.608,"Well, I would say so, but there is--"
1970.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1976.608,1982.078,"Afterwards, you would have to bring an action against-- for Burns, against this Union, if we reversed, wouldn’t you?[Attempt to Laughter]"
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,1982.078,1987.63,"Well, let me point out, sir, I have represented Burns & Roe since the inception of this matter."
1970.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1989.938,1991.189,That wasn’t my question.
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,1991.189,1991.917,"Yes, sir?"
1970.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1991.917,1996.983,"My question was, it would be helpful to such a damage suit if this were reversed, wouldn’t it?"
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,1996.983,2000.464,"I think it would be inadmissible in that damage suit, Your Honor."
1970.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2000.464,2006.155,"Maybe inadmissible, but it certainly, as a legal proposition-- I doubt if you--"
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,2006.155,2007.13,Yes.
1970.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2007.13,2011.149,I doubt if you would miss citing the case.[Laughter]
1970.40,1,43542,vincent_j_apruzzese,,2011.149,2016.007,"That’s correct, sir."
1970.40,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2662.484,2673.01,"Do you-- Mr. Aronson, if you’d like to finish today, you may."
1970.40,2,21811,earl_s_aronson,,2673.01,2674.406,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1970.40,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2937.704,2944.401,Would you give us as a hypothesis as to what they were trying to do?
1970.40,2,21811,earl_s_aronson,,2944.401,2945.372,The Board?
1970.40,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2945.372,2947.394,"No, your client."
1970.40,2,21811,earl_s_aronson,,2947.394,2948.395,My client?
1970.40,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3083.084,3086.819,"Well, you’re challenging the findings-- the factual findings of the Board then, aren’t you?"
1970.40,2,21811,earl_s_aronson,,3086.819,3088.124,"Yes, I am, Your Honor."
1970.40,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3201.934,3210.846,"Are you suggesting that, on this record, if that had occurred, it would be an incidental effect which the Union had never intended?"
1970.40,2,21811,earl_s_aronson,,3210.846,3212.48,"Yes, sir."
1970.40,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4019.255,4023.879,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1970.40,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4117.859,4120.703,"Now, that’s been the assumption, as I read the record, all the way through."
1970.40,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4120.703,4121.417,Yes.
1970.40,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4121.417,4122.952,The trial examiner that decided--
1970.40,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4122.952,4123.312,Right.
1970.40,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4123.312,4129.611,"In favor of the Union, nonetheless, seem to not question that White was neutral."
1970.40,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4129.611,4130.633,No.
1970.40,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4132.211,4134.966,And the Third Circuit--
1970.40,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4134.966,4146.27,"By the trial examiner of the Board and the Court below was that this issue, as to primary-secondary, was not in this case, and we briefed the case accordingly."
1970.40,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4163.723,4165.75,Let me ask you just one question.
1970.40,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4175.527,4178.694,"No, Your Honor."
1970.40,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4178.694,4181.328,"If it is aimed at that, it is enough, isn’t it?"
1970.40,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4181.328,4182.506,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.40,4,16666,arnold_ordman,,4895.421,4896.868,"Yes, sir."
1970.40,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4896.868,4897.781,Wish to use it.
1970.40,4,16666,arnold_ordman,,4897.781,4899.861,"Mr. Chief Justice, just one observation."
1970.40,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4973.604,4974.293,Thank you.
