1960.74,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1603.04,1611.153,"And for that it's late, explicit, I assume by the petition, the question presented in the petition for certiorari."
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,1612.868,1622.472,No -- that was the question involved from our point of view that's before this Court.
1960.74,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1626.142,1634.029,"Well, the only question presented in the petition for certiorari is the one in terms of the --"

1960.74,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1647.629,1651.997,"But we only take the questions in the petition to certiorari, don't we?"

1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,1654.588,1657.328,"Well, their brief is slightly different."
1960.74,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1682.104,1688.756,However your phrase it though that it all grows out of the error in the name.
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,1689.808,1692.649,"No, that isn't true, Your Honor, Justice Harlan."

1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,1743.916,1744.615,That's right.
1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1873.682,1879.351,Now in that -- in that proceeding did you raised the question of the misnomer?
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,1879.351,1880.95,I did.
1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1882.863,1885.308,Where -- where is that in the record?
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,1885.308,1892.907,There is nothing -- there is nothing in the record on the meeting on August the 20th between the Regional Director of the 13th Region and myself.

1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,1894.983,1902.889,"Well, Your Honor, on August the 22nd, two days later, I wrote a letter."

1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,1910.676,1911.701,The conversation?
1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1911.701,1915.336,"No, this thing that you're just telling us about now on August 22nd."

1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1918.062,1918.429,Alright.
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,1918.452,1919.627,The counsel referred to.

1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1922.186,1925.768,"Well then, you want us to consider it?"
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,1925.768,1939.276,"Well, it's referred to in the -- it's referred to -- all through the case, the letter of August the 22nd but it's not in there as a piece of evidence."
1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1981.827,1983.094,That was in the letter?
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,1983.094,1984.948,That was in -- in the letter?

1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,2007.082,2008.166,The letter?
1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2422.53,2431.442,Is there any other company by a similar name to that in which the election was called that these people could get confused with?
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,2431.442,2437.547,"I don't -- it isn't our contention that there was a similarity in name and I don't know of any such, Your Honor."

1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,2442.593,2442.827,Well --
1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2442.827,2443.766,What's the prejudice?
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,2443.766,2446.521,"Well, there -- there were 25 abstained from the election."
1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2446.521,2448.477,That -- that doesn't answer it though --
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,2448.477,2457.842,And the confusion lies in the fact that they besiege the personnel manager's office when the notices were posted three days before the election all around the shop.
1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2481.507,2484.544,But was that caused by -- by this misnomer?
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,2484.544,2498.934,"By the mis -- the -- on the bulletin board, it says notice of election and it's addressed to the employees of Mattison Machine Manufacturing Company and I'm working in Matttison Machine Works and I wonder what's going on."
1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2533.795,2551.293,"As I understood, Mr. Counsel, when you made your first objection to the Board, you didn't -- you didn't mention this misnomer at all and it was sent two weeks later that you wrote a letter and said, ""Now, there's another objection to this which is a misnomer."""

1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,2574.357,2575.533,"Yes, sir, that was --"
1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2575.533,2575.585,-- your -- your (Voice Overlap)
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,2575.585,2578.501,-- 29 days to be exact from the date of the election.
1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2578.501,2581.54,You didn't -- you didn't include that.
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,2581.54,2587.699,I objected to the use of the wrong name but I did not say that caused the confusion.
1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2587.724,2594.847,"Why did you write the subsequent letter then, saying that in addition to -- to what you had objected to the --"
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,2594.847,2605.594,"No, the letter only calls attention to the fact that the ballots, specimen ballots, and the notices of election, all employed the wrong name and were addressed to the employees of their own companies."
1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2605.594,2609.616,Where does that one -- where does that appear in the record?
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,2609.616,2643.129,"Well, that's in connection with the appropriate -- well, counsel very kindly called the attention to the fact -- counsel very generously calls attention to page 19 which covers the report and objections and challenges."
1960.74,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2651.954,2658.804,"Now, in that -- in that document, do you -- do you raise objection because of the misnomer?"

1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,2828.743,2830.292,"That is correct, we have such."
1960.74,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2830.292,2832.309,And -- but no motion was made at that year.

1960.74,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2866.631,2874.836,"Well, and you didn't put on the record there that a formal motion, similar to the complaints you had made to her before the hearing."
1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,2874.836,2876.649,I did not make a formal motion.

1960.74,1,31866,j_warren_mccaffrey,,2935.597,2942.211,The most flagrant abuse of the whole case is the denial to the two workers of their right to vote.
