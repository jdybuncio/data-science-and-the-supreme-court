2000.99-7791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.199,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-791, Kestutis Zadvydas v. The INS and John Ashcroft v. Kim Ho Ma."
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,13.831,15.751,I'm sorry--
2000.99-7791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,15.751,17.424,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,17.424,19.795,Mr. Stansell.
2000.99-7791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,108.107,109.829,"We're talking about the language,"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,112.652,128.85,"That's correct, Your Honor, and what Congress has not done is specify how long beyond the... how long, following that, Mr. Chief Justice, they would intend to detain."
2000.99-7791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.85,134.443,"Well, do you think that some reasonable period of time is permitted under that language?"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,134.443,135.435,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
2000.99-7791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.561,145.122,Which circuit court?
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,145.122,145.733,I'm--
2000.99-7791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.733,148.923,Are you talking about the Fifth or the Ninth?
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,148.923,150.165,"--I'm sorry, I'm talking about the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals."
2000.99-7791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,163.982,167.606,What about the construction that the INS has put on it?
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,170.988,200.568,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the Chevron deference simply doesn't apply when you're applying the constitutional avoidance doctrine, because I believe that agencies are not... while they may have expertise at interpreting their own statute, they don't necessarily have expertise in interpreting the Constitution, and even most recently this past term this Court in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County did not grant Chevron deference when there was a constitutional problem indicated."
2000.99-7791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.568,203.34,"Mr. Stansell, what do you mean by a reasonable time?"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,222.573,227.266,"Well, Your Honor, the circuit court did not specifically define what is a reasonable time period."
2000.99-7791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,229.867,231.99,"You mean an absolute time limit at some point, don't you?"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,231.99,247.057,"--Your Honor, our position would be if it's not reasonably perceivable, if deportation is not perceivable, there's not some objective fact that they can point to that this individual is going to be deported, then holding that person beyond that period would not be a reasonable time."
2000.99-7791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.057,270.024,"So even if you're talking about, you know, a real life Hannibal what's his name, you know, a really wicked, evil person who is going to harm people, there's every reason to believe that this person who's been deported because of serial murders, if you can't find a country to send him to, you have to let that person out?"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,270.024,281.504,"That's correct, Your Honor, and that's what we do with any other person, and that's the appropriate term here, any other person who has finished their prison time and--"
2000.99-7791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.504,284.646,"Well, any other person is entitled to be in the United States."
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,323.851,330.614,"--Well, Your Honor, the first part of your hypothetical I think is essentially what the law is."
2000.99-7791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,330.614,331.406,I know.
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,344.994,345.615,"Your Honor, I--"
2000.99-7791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.615,358.064,"--And we will send you back to whatever country you can find that will take you, but if no country will take you, you will not be allowed into the general populace."
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,359.944,371.271,"--Your Honor, I think because the Constitution has the paramount... is the paramount authority under which all statutes have to be gauged, I think that the last portion of your hypothetical would be unconstitutional."
2000.99-7791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,378.506,392.876,"Well, the Government says here that Mr. Kestutis is in the same position as someone, as an entering alien, who we've said has virtually no constitutional rights."
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,392.876,401.412,"Mr. Chief Justice, the... I think you're referring to the Mezei decision and--"
2000.99-7791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,401.412,401.682,Yes.
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,401.682,406.546,--the Mezei decision is a unique and very distinguishable case on its facts.
2000.99-7791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,430.69,432.951,"Well, I... we've never overruled the Mezei case."
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,432.951,433.251,That--
2000.99-7791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,433.251,435.254,We've never questioned it so far as I know.
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,435.254,449.234,"--Mr. Chief Justice, that's entirely correct, but what's important is that on the other hand Mezei never questioned the general rule that it was setting out the narrow delineated exception for--"
2000.99-7791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,449.234,449.574,Well--
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,449.574,459.588,"--and that general rule is that once an alien has passed through our gates, and it is more or less a direct quote, has passed through our gates, even illegally, they're entitled to the protections of the Fifth Amendment."
2000.99-7791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,459.588,470.427,"--You're saying, then, that even though an alien obtains admission to this country illegally, that he's fully protected by our Constitution?"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,470.427,471.576,"Yes, I am, Your Honor."
2000.99-7791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.576,473.739,"Well, but protected in what sense?"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,473.739,483.724,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, he's protected... certainly protected as to his liberty interests, his interest in being free from bodily restraint is protected coequal with--"
2000.99-7791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,483.724,489.277,"You mean, he couldn't be picked up by the immigration authorities and detained because he's there illegally?"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,489.277,498.844,"--Mr. Chief Justice, that is a distinct form of detention that's separate from what... the indefinite post final order detention that we are talking about."
2000.99-7791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,498.844,500.975,"Yes, but will you... answer my question, if you will."
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,500.975,512.913,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think, you know, I perhaps misspoke, that, of course, the Government has countervailing interests that they can detain any individual for a number of reasons."
2000.99-7791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,551.391,555.443,"They're both out, aren't they, and under certain terms and conditions?"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,556.795,557.006,That's exactly correct.
2000.99-7791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,580.64,585.573,"There are new, proposed regulations dealing with this subject."
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,586.364,587.476,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-7791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,587.476,596.161,"And is there some opportunity for judicial review after a period of time under the proposed new regulations, do you know?"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,596.161,604.787,"Your Honor, I believe the judicial review... there's nothing inherent in the regulations themselves that allow for judicial review."
2000.99-7791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,605.946,606.948,Nothing expressed?
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,606.948,608.049,--That's correct.
2000.99-7791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,613.423,615.463,And both these cases are here on habeas--
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,615.463,615.934,--That's correct.
2000.99-7791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,615.934,616.805,--proceedings?
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,616.805,619.399,2241 is the jurisdiction here.
2000.99-7791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.399,626.001,"Mr. Stansell, what if... these people are deportable because of committing felonies, right?"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,635.988,637.32,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-7791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,637.32,664.588,"Then why is it unconstitutional to say to an immigrant, if you commit a felony, we're not going to put you in prison for life, but we are simply not going to let you back into the general populace, and we will deport you if you can find a place to be deported to, but otherwise you will be held under house arrest, not punitive, but you will not be allowed into the general population?"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,685.432,702.685,"Well, Your Honor, it... the hypothetical you lay out would allow somebody through the administrative action of an administrative agency to be put in... to be incarcerated for life, and this Court has never condoned such an extreme civil detention process."
2000.99-7791,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,702.685,729.921,"Well, would you change the hypothetical, then, slightly and say that there is a provision of the United States Code that anyone who is convicted of a... anyone in the immigrant status who is convicted of a felony in the United States will be punished by imprisonment up to life, and the sentence in fact can be terminated upon deportation, if deportation is possible?"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,736.165,739.288,"That would be a different case, Your Honor, and I'm not sure--"
2000.99-7791,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,739.288,740.219,Would that be constitutional?
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,740.219,740.991,--what the constitutional rule would be.
2000.99-7791,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,747.027,760.898,"Well, but that would be the... I presume that would be the issue under the hypothetical that I've raised, so would... on my variation of the hypo, would it be unconstitutional for the Government to imprison?"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,760.898,767.891,--If it was with a judge and a jury and the right to indictment and the grand jury--
2000.99-7791,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,767.891,771.003,Determination of immigrant status is made by a jury.
2000.99-7791,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.086,780.42,"In your view, would it make any difference whether such a law was passed before or after the alien entered the country?"
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,780.42,785.402,"--I'm not sure what I would... how I'd answer that, Your Honor."
2000.99-7791,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,785.402,788.924,You don't think they'd be entitled to notice that that was the consequence of coming into the United States?
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,788.924,817.105,"Well, you know, I think it raises a number of different issues, but what's at the heart of this is the fact that Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas, when they entered the country, they were cloaked with the Constitution, and this Court has delineated a very narrow exception in Mezei, an exception that recognized the general rule set out in Wong Wing in 1896 that has stood... that withstood, has withstood this test of time and has been cited by this Court in modern cases."
2000.99-7791,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,842.065,842.576,Okay--
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,853.455,854.954,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-7791,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,854.954,857.546,--then you must... that's the Ninth Circuit rule.
2000.99-7791,0,32932,jay_w_stansell,,863.088,873.086,"Your Honor, I was speaking to the constitutional test that we think is driven by this Court's civil detention cases."
2000.99-7791,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,873.086,874.606,"Okay, but let's apply it."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1174.31,1183.098,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-7791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1197.936,1213.646,"Are there no ongoing negotiations... I got the impression from the briefs that there had been efforts both to Lithuania and some other country, and neither of them had presently admitted him, but that it was not regarded as completely hopeless."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1213.646,1232.37,"Your Honor, as a factual matter, the only thing that has happened in the last 2 years that I know of is that Mr. Zadvydas wrote a letter to the consulate in Chicago seeking some citizenship papers, or granting him citizenship, and other than that nothing has happened in the last 2 years."
2000.99-7791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1280.482,1281.874,Excuse me.
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1318.779,1319.831,--Well--
2000.99-7791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1319.831,1325.695,So they're not going as far as extending Mezei to these people entirely.
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1325.695,1341.385,"--Well, I think they are, but as far as the constitutional deprivation that's being imposed here, they're confining people indefinitely, potentially for life, based on a finding of dangerousness and/or a finding of a flight risk, and--"
2000.99-7791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1341.385,1344.908,"There have to be those findings, and in Mezei there don't have to be those findings."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1344.908,1355.724,"--But all other persons in this country can be released if the detention is based solely on dangerousness, and so they're treating--"
2000.99-7791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1355.724,1356.505,They're treating them differently--
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1356.505,1358.726,--Differently than the rest of the people in this country--
2000.99-7791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.726,1359.107,--Right.
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1359.107,1361.608,--which is why they are extending Mezei--
2000.99-7791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1361.608,1362.259,I understand--
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1362.259,1363.04,--and Mezei is--
2000.99-7791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.04,1370.605,"--They're extending it, but I think it goes too far to say that the exception has swallowed the rule and that they're just covering everybody with the Mezei rule."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1373.006,1382.023,--This Court in Plasencia had someone who was much more analogous to the person in Mezei.
2000.99-7791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1403.186,1405.149,"Yes, but she hadn't committed any felony."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1405.149,1408.599,"--She was in the process of committing a crime when she entered the country, Your Honor."
2000.99-7791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1408.599,1413.043,"Well, but your clients have committed independent felonies."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1413.043,1425.141,"Yes, and I would get back to the point I made a moment ago, which is that they're being treated differently than any other class of persons under the Constitution in this country."
2000.99-7791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1430.755,1441.184,"Well, but I don't think the Constitution requires you to treat people who have done particular things the same way as people who have not done those things."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1441.184,1462.048,"But what we're saying, Your Honor, is, if you take another person in this country who has a felony conviction, and he's determined to be dangerous, but only dangerous and not some other element, not the other element that we find in Kansas v. Hendricks, a mental abnormality, simply dangerous like the individual in Foucha, that person would be entitled to release."
2000.99-7791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1462.048,1468.301,"But that person is not an alien, and the Government has much more power over aliens than it does over citizens."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1468.301,1481.969,"Which is another reason, perhaps, that release would be more called for in this instance, because the Court... the Government is not without recourse with aliens if they violate their terms of supervision."
2000.99-7791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1504.997,1509.698,"Can they be detained, under your view, for a reasonable time after the 90 day period?"
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1509.698,1510.929,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-7791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1518.986,1519.307,All right.
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1534.327,1537.597,"Yes, I believe you would take that into the consideration."
2000.99-7791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1537.597,1539.219,That's part of the reasonableness--
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1539.219,1540.471,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-7791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1540.471,1540.89,--calculation.
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1540.89,1541.961,But--
2000.99-7791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1541.961,1547.874,"Well, are not those periodic review procedures in place now because of the regulations?"
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1547.874,1553.448,"--Well, they're in place, but all they're really considering are dangerousness and flight risk."
2000.99-7791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1557.781,1562.214,"Well, but that's the basis... that's the rationale for the detention."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1562.214,1575.674,"--I understand that, Your Honor, but... and that's the position of Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas, is that the way the regulation is constructed, it violates a basic... the basic right to substantive due process."
2000.99-7791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1575.674,1584.858,"So you say they can be held for a reasonable period of time, but that an element of the detention is not the fact that they're a danger to the community."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1584.858,1587.291,"Well, that's one of the elements, Your Honor, but--"
2000.99-7791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1587.291,1589.872,It is or is not one of the elements?
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1589.872,1593.145,"--It is one of the elements to be considered, but--"
2000.99-7791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1593.145,1600.058,"Well, if it's one of the elements to be considered, and there's a periodic review, then why isn't that reasonable under the definition we're discussing?"
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1600.058,1604.722,"--Because it doesn't consider the likelihood of deportation or the duration of detention, Your Honor."
2000.99-7791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1610.506,1616.381,"So you could detain a person for, say, 6 extra months because he's dangerous, but not after that, or a year?"
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1616.381,1621.072,"--Well, you could detain him for a reasonable period."
2000.99-7791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1625.537,1633.179,"If the reason for the detention continues, I don't understand the basis on which you say that you're entitled to release."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1633.179,1633.6,Well--
2000.99-7791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1633.6,1644.617,"Either they can't detain him for any period at all because he's dangerous, or they can detain him during the period that he's dangerous, it seems to me, and you're somehow splitting the difference."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1645.689,1657.7,"--What we're saying is, Your Honor, that if you found someone to be dangerous... and the Ninth Circuit says in its opinion that it would depend on the circumstances of each case."
2000.99-7791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1714.236,1724.272,"Under your view, it seems to me that you cannot detain him for even 1 day on the grounds that he's a danger to the community, after the 90 day period--"
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1724.272,1725.794,"--Well, I believe the--"
2000.99-7791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1725.794,1727.304,--and I just don't think you've explained that.
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1727.304,1734.78,"--Well, I believe the Ninth Circuit said it would depend on the circumstances of each case, and the example I would give is the one I just did, that--"
2000.99-7791,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1734.78,1735.651,Mr. Barnard--
2000.99-7791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.651,1749.771,"--If you're appealing to the proposition that you just said you were appealing to, that you can't treat aliens any different from American citizens in this regard, then you... Justice Kennedy has to be right."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1763.529,1764.881,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2000.99-7791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.881,1771.255,So you have to be appealing to something a little less than the proposition that you have to treat aliens like citizens.
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1771.255,1780.692,"--Well, Your Honor, we would submit that the Government is not without recourse in these situations."
2000.99-7791,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1793.37,1802.266,"Mr. Barnard, may I just interrupt you there, because I think that you are now departing from what you said you were adhering to."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1861.084,1873.993,"--All that I can say in answer to your question, Your Honor, is that the Ninth Circuit did say that there could be a period after that, depending on the circumstances of the case, and that's my recollection."
2000.99-7791,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1873.993,1886.232,"I thought one part of the opinion said, if you know that there is no hope of finding somebody to take him, you have to let him out at the end of the 90 day period."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1886.232,1895.659,"I think the opinion is somewhat self contradictory, but I do recall there was language in there that you could hold them for some period after that time."
2000.99-7791,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1895.659,1897.681,"For what purpose, and the purpose was--"
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1897.681,1900.553,To determine if it would... if there was--
2000.99-7791,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1900.553,1902.474,--If there's somebody that could take him.
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1902.474,1920.556,"--If it was reasonably foreseeable that they would be removed, and I think your question comes down to what is reasonable, or what is reasonably foreseeable, and it may vary a little bit from someone who is extremely dangerous to someone who is a shoplifter, but it would not be a lengthy period of time."
2000.99-7791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.556,1928.663,"Mr. Barnard, wouldn't the foreseeability be considerably affected by the rule that you're urging upon us?"
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,1986.962,1996.108,"Well, Your Honor, I believe the statute has some other provisions which were noted in the briefs where we can withhold visas, or take actions of that nature."
2000.99-7791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1996.108,2002.613,"I'm talking about the impact upon the foreign countries that we are trying to extradite these people to, or deport these people to."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2012.801,2028.85,"Well, Your Honor, I would just point out that in every immigration case there's another country involved, but we don't go to the extent of violating a person's rights to further the immigration... and the two examples would be Wong Wing and Witkovich."
2000.99-7791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2044.662,2074.159,"I also assume that one of the things that induces these foreign countries to take them back is lobbying and pressure from the individual himself and from his family, and they have a great incentive to do that if the consequence of Germany's not taking him back is that he's going to remain under restriction, as here, but if that is not the case, what incentive in the world would they have to induce the Federal Republic of Germany to take him back?"
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2078.955,2080.686,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-7791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2099.68,2108.765,"May I ask, just as a matter of clarification, if this... if your client were a German citizen, would Germany have the option to take him or let him stay here, or would they not be obligated to take him?"
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2108.765,2113.179,"--I think under the reduction convention they do not have to take him back, but I'm... obviously--"
2000.99-7791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2113.179,2113.438,Yes.
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2117.521,2121.064,"--If he's stateless, which my client is, there's a special--"
2000.99-7791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2121.064,2124.636,They can define him to be a citizen or not to be a citizen.
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2127.9,2132.341,"--Well, if they find him not to be a citizen, if they find him to be stateless they don't have to take him back."
2000.99-7791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2132.341,2137.915,"Well, you're not assuming that the Germans just do this willy nilly, and they don't have rules that decide whether these people are citizens or not."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2137.915,2138.305,That's correct.
2000.99-7791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2138.305,2141.367,"I assume he either is or he isn't, under the law of that country."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2141.367,2144.01,"Well, I--"
2000.99-7791,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2144.01,2158.33,"If he is with a country with whom we have an expatriation treaty, then there isn't any discretion on that country's side, any more than there would be on our side in the reverse situation, so you're talking about countries with which we have no agreement."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2158.33,2160.992,--Or the person's status is--
2000.99-7791,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2160.992,2161.901,Is stateless.
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2161.901,2162.802,"--Stateless, yes."
2000.99-7791,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2162.802,2163.563,Mr. Barnard--
2000.99-7791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2163.563,2177.452,"--But status depends upon a lot of facts that require to be determined and which may be disputed, which is the case in at least one of these two cases, the facts of how long he was in that country, or what his ancestry was, and so forth."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2180.634,2196.445,"Well, it gets back to what is reasonable and I would just suggest to the Court that the Government at this point is somewhat less than sanguine that he's going to be taken anywhere, because the only effort that's been made in the last 2 years is to have him send a letter, so he is now, the State Department negotiating with countries."
2000.99-7791,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2196.445,2213.055,"Mr. Barnard, would you be making your same argument and seeking release if the Government were holding someone like your client in a detention center as opposed to a prison facility, or were ordered to remain in his own house and not leave it?"
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2213.055,2219.58,"I would not be making the same argument if it was a house, if there was electronic monitoring, if it was a halfway house."
2000.99-7791,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2219.58,2224.022,"How about a detention center of some kind, as opposed to a prison?"
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2224.022,2226.806,I think that would turn on the condition--
2000.99-7791,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2226.806,2228.356,Where it's not a criminal facility.
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2228.356,2232.77,"--Well, I think it would turn on the conditions of detention centers, and being a criminal lawyer--"
2000.99-7791,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2232.77,2234.289,But that would be a very different question--
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2234.289,2234.659,--Well--
2000.99-7791,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2234.659,2235.31,--conditions.
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2235.31,2243.295,"--Well, being a criminal lawyer, I've never seen one that looked particularly appealing to the average person, so I just can't imagine that that would be the case."
2000.99-7791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2293.22,2298.524,"Well, aren't national security concerns always at stake when we're talking about immigration policy?"
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2298.524,2299.815,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2000.99-7791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2306.819,2312.963,"Well, but the whole idea of control of the borders is based on national security."
2000.99-7791,1,38712,robert_f_barnard,,2312.963,2316.325,"No, that's national sovereignty I think you're referring to, Your Honor."
2000.99-7791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2335.757,2336.288,"Very well, Mr. Barnard."
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2338.231,2346.135,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-7791,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.117,2392.596,"Mr. Kneedler, may I ask just one question--"
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2392.596,2392.816,Yes.
2000.99-7791,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2392.816,2393.327,--on that point?
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2401.583,2413.942,"It does not, no, but what I... the important element, though, is that future dangerousness is a legitimate basis on which to detain someone."
2000.99-7791,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2429.631,2430.142,That is not a--
2000.99-7791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2430.142,2431.893,--There's always a plus.
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2438.396,2438.766,--No.
2000.99-7791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2439.397,2442.961,"Not mental abnormality, not a short time until trial."
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2452.387,2458.349,"--No, it is in this important respect, and I think this is a critical factor to understanding this case."
2000.99-7791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2479.877,2480.544,That's the question.
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2480.544,2481.245,Pardon me?
2000.99-7791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2481.245,2482.177,That's the question.
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2495.775,2509.876,"In our submission the detention of the aliens is reasonably related to the basis for detention, as long as there is a basis for concern about threat to the community and removal."
2000.99-7791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2509.876,2522.523,"No, no, I'm just trying to figure out, though... I'm trying to figure out what the issue is in this case, and I'm having some trouble, because I want to know... to separate out the problem that you're just talking about, risk of crime--"
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2522.523,2523.003,Right.
2000.99-7791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2523.003,2525.945,--I'd like to know... think of 90 as beginning--
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2525.945,2527.007,Right.
2000.99-7791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2527.007,2531.329,--And how many extra days before it became clear that no country will take them?
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2531.329,2533.452,It is not clear now.
2000.99-7791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2533.452,2537.462,"If it's not clear now, then what is it that we're supposed to be deciding?"
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2537.462,2537.803,Well--
2000.99-7791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2537.803,2551.943,"Because at that moment, if it's not clear now, there is involved in both of these cases the question of whether it would be reasonable to maintain them simply to be sure they're around if you find a country."
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2551.943,2556.516,"--That, and in addition, because of the potential for dangerousness to the community."
2000.99-7791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2556.516,2562.58,"What I'm trying to figure out is, is that question in front of us?"
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2571.887,2572.437,Well--
2000.99-7791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2572.437,2573.689,You think it does?
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2584.656,2587.658,--I'd like to answer that in two respects.
2000.99-7791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2600.127,2609.553,"All right, so take your second answer, because that has two parts, your first saying we won't hold him beyond a reasonable time, but what do we look at in deciding reasonableness?"
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2609.553,2611.253,"--Well, in this case the attorney--"
2000.99-7791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2611.253,2611.634,Is that... am I right?
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2611.634,2612.255,--Yes.
2000.99-7791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2612.255,2612.763,All right.
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2612.763,2638.783,"The Attorney General has implemented this statute in a way... maybe the Attorney General had broader authority to detain someone permanently without ever releasing someone, but the constitutional question before the court, and the statutory question for that matter, has to be analyzed in terms of what the Attorney General did in the exercise of his discretion in establishing a review procedure under which the alien is subject to periodic review to determine whether he is either dangerous or a risk of flight."
2000.99-7791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2638.783,2646.686,"Are you satisfied with this holding on the merits, this statute means no one should be held beyond a reasonable time."
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2658.033,2661.216,I do not agree with it in this respect.
2000.99-7791,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2674.376,2677.826,"Well, but are you conceding that that is relevant to the--"
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2677.826,2678.777,I'm not.
2000.99-7791,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.298,2694.448,"--I assume you're saying that if another country can't be found, and even once it's certain that another country can't be found, the Attorney General can still refuse to release this person into the general population as long as there is a threat of flight or of--"
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2694.448,2702.243,"That is our position, but I would like to say something about the two aliens in this case, just to show that we're not even near that position."

2000.99-7791,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2804.603,2810.066,How many of those 50 percent had previously been determined to be dangerous to the community?
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2810.066,2818.611,"--I'm not... well, all of them, or almost all of them in the sense that they were convicted of a crime."
2000.99-7791,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2839.265,2842.089,"And they had served their sentences, presumably."
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2842.089,2859.229,"--They have, but as this Court pointed out in the Jones case, which was discussed in Foucha, it is permissible for a State to presume continuing dangerousness from the conviction of a crime, and the fact that someone has served a criminal sentence does not remove the inference of continuing dangerousness."
2000.99-7791,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2859.229,2865.973,What case of ours do you think best supports your position of the validity of this scheme?
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2865.973,2867.935,"Oh, I think there are several."
2000.99-7791,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2869.986,2877.66,But didn't that involve more aliens who can be rejected on entry?
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2877.66,2898.303,"But it is our submission that once an alien has been ordered removed from the country, as both of the aliens here have been... not only have they had a criminal conviction, with all the protection that affords, but they have... are subject to final orders of removal under an administrative process in which that had be proven by clear and convincing evidence."
2000.99-7791,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2903.729,2922.582,"But Mr. Kneedler, isn't there a vast difference between saying, if a person... partly fictional... has never been in the country at all, he has never acquired the protection of the Constitution, isn't that quite different from saying that a person who has acquired that protection, simply because an order of deportation has been entered, he totally loses the protection?"
2000.99-7791,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2924.054,2933.809,"--There's not, and if I may explain why, there is no difference from the point of view of the status or the interests of the alien, there is no difference with respect to the sovereign powers of the United States, and there is no difference--"
