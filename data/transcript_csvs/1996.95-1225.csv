1996.95-1225,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.326,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-1225, United States v. Marian Brockamp."
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,19.215,25.428,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1225,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,120.57,122.232,This is found on page 4?
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,122.232,146.008,"On page 4 of the Government's brief, in the gray covers, and it says that no suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any courts, skipping down, until... for a refund, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Secretary according to the provisions of law in that regard."
1996.95-1225,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,196.01,202.125,"May I ask what might be an irrelevant question on that point, but would help with my understanding of the statute?"
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,217.135,217.525,Yes.
1996.95-1225,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,217.525,219.848,And I've never been able to understand the statute for that reason.
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,219.848,221.158,In the Mundy case.
1996.95-1225,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,221.158,235.269,"And it left those words, was required, out, and then it seems as if you could file a return like, 82 years later, and 82 years later, now, it's not too late, and they start the statute running, but the grab-back only goes back 2 or 3 years."
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,239.289,246.405,"Well, that's not part of the duties that I have--"
1996.95-1225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,246.646,250.748,--but the Government is looking into the possibility of statutory amendment.
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,256.951,259.052,There hasn't actually been a provision offered.
1996.95-1225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.457,263.727,Oh.
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,263.727,266.048,"--for offering, but it still has not been offered."
1996.95-1225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,266.048,268.148,"Is it still being prepared, though?"
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,268.148,271.892,"Well, there are... it's under study."
1996.95-1225,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,287.221,293.797,"Was it just an accident they left out the words, were required, or was required, or is some purpose going on that I can't understand?"
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,293.797,298.569,"--Well, we don't really have an answer to that."
1996.95-1225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,570.767,594.953,"Mr. Wallace, can I ask you a general... assume we agree with every... all of your arguments, and that it's too late to file a claim and the taxpayer, or this person, he's not really a taxpayer, I guess, has no right to get the money back, is there anything in the code that would allow the Internal Revenue Service when presented with facts as extreme as they are in this case to say, we're not entitled to this $7,000, we want to give it back?"
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,599.205,604.457,"There is not, Justice Stevens."
1996.95-1225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,612.464,613.524,"I understand, yes."
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,613.524,618.639,"--if the facts warrant it, which might more--"
1996.95-1225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,618.639,619.29,"Which they probably would in this case, yes."
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,619.29,622.252,"--Well, it depends on which case you're talking about."
1996.95-1225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,622.252,622.923,In one of these cases--
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,622.923,623.985,We have two cases here.
1996.95-1225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,623.985,624.345,--Yes.
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,624.345,626.816,And I'll get into the facts a little bit more.
1996.95-1225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,653.954,660.086,"No, I'm just assuming a case where you really didn't dispute the facts, but you still would have no authority to give the money back?"
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,660.086,666.431,"--Well, looking right now at the provision which seems to preclude authority in the IRS--"
1996.95-1225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.431,666.922,It only speaks in terms of claims.
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,672.535,672.596,--Well--
1996.95-1225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,672.596,676.449,"Just a discovery that we've got $7,000 that obviously doesn't belong to us."
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,676.449,692.75,"--That, if we turn to the top of page 4, that is subsection (C) of the same provision, limited no claim filed, and that says that you still have to meet the time limits of subsections (A) and (B)."
1996.95-1225,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,701.245,701.565,Mr. Wallace--
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,701.565,703.276,--in this situation.
1996.95-1225,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,703.276,713.294,"--may I ask, if this was not a problem that was noticed by the administration, at least there was a press release at the very time that your cert petition was filed."
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,713.294,714.743,That is correct.
1996.95-1225,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,714.743,742.572,"In which I believe the President announced that the law must be followed, but this is a very hard situation for people to be in, that they overpaid and they can't get it back, so wasn't it proposed that there be a study of what legislative solution there might be to help people out in this bind?"
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,742.572,744.613,And that is under study--
1996.95-1225,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,744.613,745.364,Where?
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,745.364,747.574,--just in the Treasury Department.
1996.95-1225,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,747.574,758.662,"Well, would you recommend... assuming the facts are as the petitioner states, or as the respondent states them in Brockamp, the case of the elderly man, would you recommend that a private bill be passed?"
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,758.662,763.847,"Well, I can't... would I personally--"
1996.95-1225,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,763.847,764.776,Would the Justice Department?
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,764.776,768.429,"--Well, I can't say that we've faced up to that."
1996.95-1225,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,769.941,773.33,Because I've noticed you've had two of these bills in 34 years--
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,773.33,775.243,--There have been rather few.
1996.95-1225,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,775.243,776.513,--so apparently you're pretty tough on these.
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,776.513,779.816,"There have been rather few, but these are not instigated by us, after all."
1996.95-1225,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,785.57,786.551,"Well, I just wonder what--"
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,790.695,790.902,Well--
1996.95-1225,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,790.902,792.294,"Well, can you speak for the Department?"
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,792.294,793.546,--We don't know the facts.
1996.95-1225,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,804.873,805.643,"Well, assume everything's correct--"
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,805.643,807.585,--after the events occurred here.
1996.95-1225,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,885.166,897.765,"--Mr. Wallace, may I ask before you do if you can just clarify for me what would be within the universe of possible responses beside a private bill?"
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,906.791,910.075,--There could be something of that sort.
1996.95-1225,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1153.024,1165.273,"As far as the equity is concerned, do you need to go... say anything more than the Court did in its decision in the Dalm case?"
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1165.273,1171.507,"Well, the Dalm case really addresses everything that's at issue here."
1996.95-1225,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1249.599,1254.02,"But the only case we have before us is the Brockamp case, Mr. Wallace."
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1254.02,1257.513,"--No, what... we have both of them together, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1225,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.436,1262.127,I see.
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1262.127,1267.631,The court of appeals decided to put the Brockamp case forward--
1996.95-1225,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1267.631,1268.9,Go ahead.
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1269.491,1278.667,--as one where perhaps the Service's problems were not quite as apparent as they would be in the Scott case from our standpoint.
1996.95-1225,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1382.164,1383.816,What was the expert testimony about?
1996.95-1225,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1383.816,1414.027,"It was about how alcoholism can be incapacitating, but... and there were two doctors, one for the Government and one for the defense, but obviously the Service would have to be very wary, the more a claim of incapacity seems specific only to the capacity to comply with the Internal Revenue laws and leaves the person able to comply with many other laws."
1996.95-1225,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1471.423,1472.785,"Very well, Mr. Wallace."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1474.327,1483.544,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1517.324,1519.057,"Well, he has redress for 3 years."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1521.228,1526.47,He has no redress because he was disabled throughout the statutory period.
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1561.525,1574.842,"Why should we be tugged by the equities here, and undoubtedly these are hard cases, tugged more by these equities than the Court was in the Dalm case, which was also a very sympathetic situation?"
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1574.842,1581.999,"--I am not ask... specifically, Your Honor, I am not asking the Court to be tugged by the equities."
1996.95-1225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1592.624,1601.279,"Well, we have a rather elaborate Internal Revenue Code where presumably Congress has revealed its intent in the sections that are dealt with in the briefs."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1601.279,1604.091,"Yes, that is true."
1996.95-1225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1755.433,1763.447,Would you explain how your interpretation of 6511 apply to the particular facts of your case so as to allow your client to prevail?
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1763.447,1767.859,My client--
1996.95-1225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1767.859,1768.62,Yes.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1772.063,1804.203,"--Well, the point I'm making is that the question that I was addressing in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question is what is there in this statute that leads me to believe that equitable tolling, that this is the type of statute in which equitable tolling might apply, and my answer is that the way that 6511 operates, the statute of limitations, which is what 6511 (a) is, it is a statute of limitations, it can only begin to run after the taxpayer acts."
1996.95-1225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1804.203,1808.037,So would you apply this to the facts of your case?
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1808.037,1822.686,"In our specific case, the statute of limitations on the underlying tax never began to run against Stanley McGill throughout his entire life."
1996.95-1225,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1841.679,1847.192,"Well, I guess the Government takes the position that the money that was paid was payment of the tax."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1847.192,1848.334,--The Government--
1996.95-1225,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1848.334,1850.775,Isn't that the position the Government takes?
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1850.775,1852.586,--If the Government had been--
1996.95-1225,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1852.586,1854.158,A payment was made.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1854.158,1854.406,--Yes.
1996.95-1225,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1854.726,1855.317,By the taxpayer.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1855.317,1860.621,"--If the Government was consistent in that position, the Government would have assessed the tax."
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1867.084,1869.255,"Well, didn't they put the check in an overpayment fund?"
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1869.255,1869.745,That's correct.
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1875.64,1877.923,But you still have a statute that says no matter what it was--
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1877.923,1878.672,--I'm sorry?
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1878.672,1897.595,"--No matter what it was, the payment was, the statute addresses refund, and what you want is a refund, so whatever the character of the payment was, the Treasury has it, and you want it back, and so you are suing for a refund."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1897.595,1897.885,That is correct.
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1897.885,1902.978,"And this is a rather dense statute, is it not?"
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1902.978,1911.693,"This is a... Your Honor, if I might answer that question at perhaps a little bit of length, this is an extremely dense, dark statute."
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1911.693,1920.31,But it's part of a dense code that does have... does have some provisions for equitable litigation.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1920.31,1921.561,Yes.
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1921.561,1940.622,"And those provisions themselves are remarkably dense, so why would one, given the density of the code, given the density of the mitigation provisions, say, but the court, because in other areas there's equitable tolling, ought to apply it here as well?"
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,1940.622,1948.209,"Your Honor, this is a dense, integrated regime of refund claims, that is true."
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2002.703,2009.167,"It didn't have a substantive limitation, as this does, and how do you handle the substantive limitation here?"
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2012.028,2012.359,No--
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.359,2013.29,You have to rewrite it.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2013.29,2015.301,"--No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.672,2019.295,Tell me how your case comes in under (b)(2).
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2021.285,2029.42,"--The direct answer, Your Honor, the way we read (b)(2) is that it is not a substantive limitation."
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2080.556,2082.016,"Fine, but how do you apply (b)(2)?"
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2091.213,2093.494,We are not in (b)(2)(A).
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.395,2094.815,Okay.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2112.907,2113.578,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.578,2114.75,When was your claim filed?
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2114.75,2120.894,"The claim was filed... I can give you the exact date, Your Honor."
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.894,2123.405,It doesn't--
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2123.405,2127.449,The claim was filed in 1991.
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2127.449,2131.13,--There were no taxes paid during the 2 years immediately preceding--
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2131.13,2131.53,"Oh, of course not."

1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2135.793,2136.663,Well--
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2136.663,2138.846,--(b)(2)(B) says you get no money.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2138.846,2139.677,--But the--
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.677,2140.365,And yet you say you ignore it.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2140.365,2142.756,--I don't wish to ignore it.
1996.95-1225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2146.019,2152.874,"You mean, you just read right into the very specific provisions of (b)(2)(B) some kind of equity principle?"
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2152.874,2154.206,"Oh, absolutely."
1996.95-1225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2156.597,2160.671,"Dalm, I mean, Dalm refused to do that in a similar situation."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2170.298,2188.359,"--Well, I believe that Dalm is distinguishable in that the issue of a taxpayer's disability did not arise, number 1, and Dalm limited the application of an equitable principle."
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2208.162,2217.629,But wasn't there some... some not entirely honorable conduct on the Government side in that case in tripping or trapping her?
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2217.629,2218.05,I don't believe so.
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2219.809,2224.363,Wasn't there some line in an opinion about how badly the Government had behaved?
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2224.363,2228.304,"--In the Dalm case I don't recall that at all, Your Honor."
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2228.304,2231.546,"But Mr. Klueger, that was in any event not the basis on which we decided the case."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2238.172,2238.512,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2246.107,2247.198,The... okay.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2247.198,2248.798,Equitable tolling did not come into that case at all.
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2248.798,2253.493,No equitable alteration of the terms of the code.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2253.493,2254.912,Well--
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2254.912,2257.113,Not that there was no equity in the case.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2259.607,2271.645,"--Your Honor, after the Dalm decision, as I read it, I read that the Dalm decision limited this Court's prior decision in Bull but did not overrule it."
1996.95-1225,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2288.405,2289.036,But why?
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2319.704,2321.216,I'm not so sure I understand your question.
1996.95-1225,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2321.216,2326.92,"--I thought the tolling principle, you have a statute of limitation that says file within 3 years."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2332.092,2333.973,"Correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1225,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2333.973,2336.985,"All right, and you want to read those words in (A) the same."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2336.985,2337.817,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1225,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2337.817,2348.703,"And you want to read the words 2 years in (B) shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the 2 years immediately preceding to read, 2 years not counting disability time."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2350.286,2350.796,That is correct.
1996.95-1225,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2350.796,2357.699,"All right, but you started out saying the language is okay, and you started out saying the complexity doesn't matter."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2368.547,2368.838,Correct.
1996.95-1225,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2368.838,2384.98,"And you're right, but their reason is that they think it would create a total nightmare, and therefore Congress couldn't have intended this and, indeed, it's the Internal Revenue Code, not noted for its charity perhaps, but not... and you know, it's the Government."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2404.06,2416.179,"We are certainly not saying, Your Honor, that a disabled taxpayer is exempt from the statutory provisions that are contained in 6511."
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.707,2429.998,"Yes, but what if he died."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2432.791,2433.111,That's correct.
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2433.111,2438.414,And how much... how many years... how long after his death was the claim filed?
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2438.414,2453.214,"I... the claim was... he died in 1989, and I believe it was filed in 1991."

1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2456.977,2461.359,"Your Honor, I apologize--"
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2461.359,2475.367,"Well, that's crucial, because you could not answer Justice Breyer's question yes, as you did, making a reading... reading (b)(2)(B) to say 2 years, you know, not including disability time."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2484.754,2485.605,"--Oh, absolutely, Your Honor."
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2487.037,2488.818,"Well, you said he did it within 2 years here."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2490.07,2498.904,His... I am confident that his competent heirs did file a timely claim.
1996.95-1225,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2498.904,2501.526,Within 2 years after his death?
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2509.231,2522.24,"My memory fails me as to the exact date, Your Honor, but I do recall, and I can represent to the Court that that was the case."
1996.95-1225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2522.24,2528.044,"But see, it could be within 2 years of the time that the heirs discovered that the money had been mistakenly paid."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2572.723,2572.873,No.
1996.95-1225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.478,2605.665,"--Yes, but why isn't the... if the heir, I mean, the administrator of the estate, or whoever it is, doesn't find the records for 2 or 3 years, the administrator was equally disabled."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2618.026,2637.487,"In fairness to the Government, I think that equitable tolling, the grounds on which the Court should apply equitable tolling, the disabilities that should qualify is a narrow one, because the Government does have a legitimate need to--"
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2637.487,2644.603,"But not so narrow that it wouldn't include at least alcoholics and people who are senile, right?"
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2644.603,2660.895,"--Your Honor, if it's an alcoholic, if it is someone who's senile, it should be, the standard should be, what was... was there a disability throughout the statutory period that inhibited the taxpayer from having--"
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2660.895,2662.785,And then you'd have a trial in each case because--
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2662.785,2663.026,--Absolutely.
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2663.026,2672.521,"--as we see in the case of an alcoholic, some of them can carry on a business and function all right, others can't function so well."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2672.521,2673.331,That is absolutely correct.
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2673.331,2684.808,"And somebody who's betwixt and between, say in the first stages of a debilitating disease, there'll be a great variety of... much room for trials, right?"
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2684.808,2687.552,"I don't think so, Your Honor, for this reason."
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2718.821,2719.532,But did--
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2724.105,2725.447,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2725.447,2727.618,The Dalm case and the Irwin case--
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2727.618,2727.998,Yes.
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2727.998,2729.848,--were within a year of each other.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2729.848,2730.448,"Yes, Your Honor."

1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2758.237,2764.222,I don't think that Dalm and Irwin are inconsistent with each other.

1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2860.317,2860.898,--Correct.
1996.95-1225,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2879.739,2883.952,The different principles being equitable tolling versus equitable--
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2883.952,2884.703,Equitable recoupment.
1996.95-1225,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2884.703,2885.031,--Yes.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2885.031,2885.512,Exactly.
1996.95-1225,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2885.512,2900.912,"But if we don't accept that distinction, doesn't the remaining distinction... in other words, if we generalize equity, then aren't you faced with the fact that the title VII considerations would not normally be applicable to a revenue case?"
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2900.912,2901.253,Correct.
1996.95-1225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2912.273,2927.683,"In fact, isn't it true that in the Dalm case that was... at least some of us thought that the Government was guilty of inequitable conduct, and here you don't have any claim of inequitable conduct against the Government, do you, so in a sense the Government's case is perhaps stronger here than it was in Dalm."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2927.683,2934.738,"I don't... I will admit, Your Honor, I did not read the Dalm decision."
1996.95-1225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2934.738,2936.669,"You probably didn't read the dissent, then, I guess."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2936.869,2953.489,"Indeed I did, Your Honor, and I noted that the dissenter in that case indicated that this was a case that would have very narrow applicability."
1996.95-1225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2960.085,2964.436,"Well, do you think the Government is bound by the dissent's view of the opinion in Dalm?"
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2964.626,2965.057,"--No, of course not."
1996.95-1225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2971.941,2978.266,"But I am correct, am I not, that you are not accusing the Government of inequitable conduct in this case?"
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2978.266,2979.636,"Oh, absolutely not, no."
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2984.141,2987.193,May I--
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,2987.193,2987.713,--Of course.
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2987.713,2997.781,--I think that the... in the mitigation rules there is some element of the Government having taken an inconsistent position and it seems to be that you have to have that much.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,3018.455,3019.564,That is correct.
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3034.705,3049.734,"Yes, but maybe what they're saying is that the Government... that Congress was so strict in allowing any mitigation at all, when the... so the notion that they meant it when they didn't say it is a little hard to accept."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,3049.734,3052.997,--I'm afraid I don't understand the thrust of your question.
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3056.75,3057.02,Right.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,3057.02,3072.04,"It was from my reading enacted because equitable recoupment, the cases were going all over the place, and so Congress felt that they should bring some order to this doctrine of equitable recoupment, and so they enacted the mitigation provisions."
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3117.349,3125.943,"If... wouldn't it totally eclipse what's in the code if you could just say, I don't want to deal with that dense stuff, it's so narrow and so technical."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,3129.697,3131.159,"--No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3171.387,3176.45,Why should we be more responsive to getting back a tax paid once than a tax paid twice?
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,3176.45,3183.084,"--Again, Your Honor, two different doctrines here."
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3185.935,3189.649,"But you are making equity your plea, right?"
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,3189.649,3190.548,--That's correct.
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3190.548,3190.928,So--
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,3190.928,3192.31,"Yes, Your Honor, that's certainly correct."
1996.95-1225,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3192.31,3202.426,"--So I'm thinking of different situations where one might be drawn by the equities of the situation, because even in administering a system of equity you have to have a rational basis."
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,3202.426,3202.787,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3213.365,3213.675,Yes.
1996.95-1225,1,39714,robert_f_klueger,,3215.506,3219.95,"In Dalm, the taxpayer had the ability to litigate the case."

1996.95-1225,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3428.574,3429.405,--It--
1996.95-1225,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3429.405,3430.845,How do you file a claim for refund?
