1967.65,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,23.503,"Number 65, Poafpybitty et al.petitioners versus Skelly Oil Company."
1967.65,0,19292,charles_hill_johns,,27.554,32.048,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,746.484,752.7,Mr. Chief Justice and may the Court please.
1967.65,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1373.415,1377.678,"Well, that's not the way the -- that's not the way their complaint reads."
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,1377.678,1379.596,I beg Your Honor's pardon.
1967.65,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1379.596,1382.561,I said that's not what they're complaint says?
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,1382.561,1396.918,"Mr. Justice Fortas, my reason in pointing to the declaration of the petitioner's counsel to the trial court at the time the motion to elect was filed."
1967.65,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1405.524,1421.281,"Well, a complain -- is a complaint is an action for waste and the damages asserted is stated in terms of -- of the lost of royalty."
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,1421.281,1421.868,"Yes, sir."
1967.65,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1421.868,1426.931,"But the action itself is an action for waste, do you dispute that?"
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,1426.931,1445.349,"Well Your Honor, I say that the expressed language of the amended complaint upon which this final judgment would enter and went to the Supreme Court is that the petitioners were seeking to recover royalties due under the lease."
1967.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1820.448,1823.609,Would they made -- made any difference in this case.
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,1835.995,1852.062,I think it would have made this difference Mr. Chief Justice that under the Oklahoma Code if the place had not voluntarily elected to go to the contract route to recover upon the contract.
1967.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1876.693,1879.967,They would have had -- have the stand --
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,1879.967,1893.881,"They could have gone, and then it could have been urged with some propriety under the Heckman decision that they might have been able to have prosecuted that case, if they could have overcome."
1967.65,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1929.27,1934.362,"Well, let's see -- let me see if I understand this."
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2002.682,2006.978,"Mr. Justice Fortas, you are substantially right in the statement."
1967.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2045.352,2048.987,Where do we find that -- where do we find that expressed concession on the part?
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2048.987,2057.656,Your Honor will find it in the record and I have also quoted in the brief.
1967.65,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2080.833,2084.766,If you find it I think you're talking about page 18 of the record.
1967.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2095.949,2096.599,Correct.
1967.65,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2096.599,2114.519,"And the counsel did agree that he was -- his claim was founded upon the provision in the oil and gas lease that prohibits the lessees, Skelly Oil Company respondent here, from committing waste."
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2115.851,2117.764,"Well, it is partially right, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1967.65,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2117.764,2119.659,"Well tell me, where it's partially wrong?"
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2119.659,2124.73,"Well, here is the significance of the court's order."
1967.65,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2150.259,2150.809,"No, sir."
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2178.175,2197.394,One more thing you overlook Mr. Justice Fortas and that is the Oklahoma venue statute which immediately -- would have immediately ousted the District Court of Oklahoma County in any jurisdiction to have heard this case upon any searched ground because the statute is perfectly clear.
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2216.107,2216.237,Yes.
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2225.35,2228.686,"It might be an action on the contract, Mr. Justice White."
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.591,2241.362,"Well, that's just the venue problem."
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2241.362,2242.583,It is a venue problem.
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2249.066,2252.069,"But the state of the question doesn't concern us up here, isn't it?"
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2252.069,2275.242,"I would think that Your Honor, it does concern you to this extent, that in reviewing a decision on the Supreme Court of Oklahoma which in turn reviews their decision of nisi prius court that Your Honors would have to consider yourselves bound by the established procedures of the jurisdiction."
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2275.242,2279.652,But all that you want to get across is that this is an action on a contract?
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2279.652,2280.204,"Yes, it's an action --"
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2280.204,2280.864,That's -- that's your real point --
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2280.864,2284.319,It's an action on the contract which is for royalty --
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.319,2285.435,Well --
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2285.435,2289.564,-- provided for in the regulations which you are a part of the contract.
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.564,2296.336,"Well, isn't that -- you want to get across the point is an action on this contract with the Secretary you claim has control off."
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2296.336,2309.409,As absolute control of and if no one else can exercise any authority over it and it falls neither within any philosophy announced in the Heckman decision or any philosophy ever adopted by the Congress of United States.
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.409,2317.05,"Well, if the company refuses to pay royalty and the Indians who actually -- the Indians signed this lease, didn't they?"
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2317.05,2319.745,"Yes, they signed it accept to say --"
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2319.745,2320.641,They are the lessors.
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2320.641,2320.711,"Yes, sir."
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.711,2323.209,The Indians are the lessor.
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2340.526,2341.539,"No, Mr. Justice White."
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.007,2350.434,You mean in the departmental?
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2350.434,2352.495,Under the regulations.
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2404.246,2404.732,And then what?
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2404.732,2405.931,-- to the Secretary to the court.
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2405.931,2407.43,And then what?
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2407.43,2410.019,And then it would be determined by the merits of the Congress.
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2410.019,2416.083,"Well, I know but what if the Secretary said no?"
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2416.083,2418.419,It went clearly to the Secretary then you go to the courts.
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.419,2420.046,"Well, the Indians go to the Court."
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2420.046,2421.659,They go to the Court -- the losing party goes to the Court.
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.659,2424.7,Who do they sue?
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2424.7,2434.976,Now -- and now Your Honors will bear in mind that there is no allegation anywhere in any pleading filed by the petitioners.
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.968,2442.567,As with whom do they sue if the Secretary turns them down?
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2442.567,2449.995,They -- they -- if they go up to the administrative remedy to the Secretary of the Interior and he turns him down.
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.395,2457.091,Now but whom do they -- whom do they sue?
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2457.091,2460.206,"Well, it's the Secretary."
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.974,2477.045,"Well, he is bound that the lessee -- could the lessee can review his orders too in the same manner?"
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2477.045,2478.724,"Yes, in the same manner."
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.477,2522.476,"Well, apparently the -- apparently the Secretary doesn't believe that this particular administrative scheme was ever intended to be -- have this kind of a consequence to be this exclusive."
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2522.476,2525.158,"Well, Your Honor I think that the Secretary must --"
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.158,2527.617,"-- he gave permission for this suit to be brought, I take it?"
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2527.617,2528.217,"No, Your Honor."
1967.65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2539.993,2544.119,"Well, what about the -- what about the position of the United States in this Court?"
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2546.09,2546.452,Yes.
1967.65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2549.129,2549.48,Would be.
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2550.829,2555.077,That this Court ought to grant certiorari in this case.
1967.65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2556.097,2557.779,"If -- so that we care, haven't we?"
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2557.779,2558.365,"Yes, but I don't --"
1967.65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2558.365,2560.027,Did we apparently agree with the petition?
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2560.027,2561.992,"Well, there is some suggestion that Solicitor General --"
1967.65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2561.992,2564.087,Is that the way you read that?
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2564.087,2565.31,I beg Your Honor's pardon.
1967.65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2565.31,2566.273,You read this is only --
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2566.273,2572.701,I don't find that the opinion there given is very clearly stated Mr. Justice Brennan.
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2708.393,2711.729,This is just the question of whether -- where they would be doing their doubling back.
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2723.347,2724.174,"Yes, sir."
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2724.174,2729.605,-- and I would assume that the -- in that preceding you would be right there.
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2740.752,2741.029,"Yes, sir."
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2741.029,2747.021,So after the lease is over with while the lease is being administered.
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2754.572,2756.429,"Well, no Mr. Justice White."
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2779.927,2780.185,Yes.
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2792.071,2819.099,"Well Your Honor, I merely say that there should be adherence to the time honored and almost universally adopted principle that wherein administrative remedy is provided by and for and through an administrative body which has been plowed with the power, the exclusive power, to provide it by the Congress of the United States, that the Courts themselves should not be the ones to change the law."
1967.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.099,2823.488,I agree with you on if I agreed with your premise.
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2840.008,2856.849,"Well, Your Honor, I doubt very much if that can be said to be the actual fact unless you carry to disregard all of the past history of the operations by the Secretary of the Interior and how it's been handled."
1967.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2862.387,2876.092,"Mr. Cantrell, I understood you to say that if this were strictly in action for a waste that the plaintiffs would be properly in Oklahoma Court."
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2878.978,2879.728,They're in which county.
1967.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2879.728,2880.372,Yes.
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2888.719,2894.123,"Oh, I think so and now that is a sign from the administrative remedy argument."
1967.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2896.625,2900.956,You seem to make a distinction between earlier in your argument between --
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2900.956,2901.722,"Oh, yes sir."
1967.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2901.722,2904.453,-- between whether they were suing under the contracts and suing for waste.
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2904.453,2908.855,But that was before I raised the discussion of the administrator remedy proposition.
1967.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2931.455,2933.609,That I understood you to say yes.
1967.65,1,29459,john_h_cantrell,,2934.062,2935.378,I think my light is on.
1967.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2935.378,2936.293,"Yes, it is."
1967.65,2,19292,charles_hill_johns,,2939.34,2941.242,"Yes, sir."
1967.65,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3026.334,3032.001,Is the only thing the court has decided that the Indian cannot sue?
1967.65,2,19292,charles_hill_johns,,3032.001,3033.168,Sir?
1967.65,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3033.168,3040.001,Is the only thing that the court decided is the fact that the Indians cannot file this lawsuit?
1967.65,2,19292,charles_hill_johns,,3040.001,3040.669,"Yes sir, the Supreme Court --"
1967.65,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3040.669,3044.273,Is that the only issue they have discussed or decided?
1967.65,2,19292,charles_hill_johns,,3044.273,3046.688,Yes sir that is correct sir.
1967.65,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3108.975,3118.174,"Can I presume in the case -- if the case would have go back in be held that the Indian can sue, these people can put up all the defenses they have."
1967.65,2,19292,charles_hill_johns,,3118.174,3143.017,"As far as I am concerned -- I set it out in my reply brief that we are entitled, we submit, to have the Oklahoma Court pass on these questions of venues that Mr. Cantrell argued without determining this Court on federal regulations, federal restrictions alone."
1967.65,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3143.017,3150.486,Is it your belief that if we would have reverse it on the ground that the Indian does have a right to file the lawsuit and try it --
1967.65,2,19292,charles_hill_johns,,3150.486,3151.973,I think that's correct sir.
1967.65,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3151.973,3157.696,-- that all of these things they are setting up here or trying to setup could be defended on this Court?
1967.65,2,19292,charles_hill_johns,,3157.696,3161.292,"Well, if I might suggest, if Your Honor please."
1967.65,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3161.292,3163.303,I'm just asking if that's your view.
1967.65,2,19292,charles_hill_johns,,3163.303,3182.021,"My view is that the Supreme Court, this Court should reverse their case on the ground that an incorrect and erroneous construction of the federal statute by the Oklahoma Supreme Court in --"
1967.65,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3182.021,3183.201,In what?
1967.65,2,19292,charles_hill_johns,,3183.201,3183.805,Sir?
1967.65,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3183.805,3184.685,In what?
1967.65,2,19292,charles_hill_johns,,3186.699,3204.513,"I reverse it, and that they have said, the Oklahoma Court has said that an Indian lessor that have not had the capacity to bring this period for lawsuit anywhere in the State of Oklahoma."
1967.65,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3204.513,3207.485,"And if we reverse it, would we decide anything but that?"
1967.65,2,19292,charles_hill_johns,,3207.485,3208.287,"No, sir."
1967.65,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3233.476,3240.281,Very well.
