1991.90-1342,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.909,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-1342, Immigration & Naturalization Service v. Jairo Jonathan Elias Zacarias."
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,14.382,17.574,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1991.90-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,82.055,83.705,Was this argument made below?
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,83.705,87.238,"--Your Honor, yes, the argument was made."
1991.90-1342,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,127.304,129.637,"You're arguing this almost by implication, aren't you?"
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,129.637,133.107,"Your Honor, no, it was raised."
1991.90-1342,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,163.688,183.961,"Ms. Mahoney, isn't it possible under this statute, that the applicant can demonstrate that he had a well-founded fear of persecution, even though the actual motive of the persecutor may be something he can't prove?"
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,183.961,208.458,"--Your Honor, there is no question that the standard of proof is a well-founded fear, and yes, it is theoretically possible that a guerrilla could in fact have a motive that did not constitute an intent to persecute, but if the objective evidence would support a reasonable inference that that was the motive, then certainly an alien could prevail."
1991.90-1342,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,252.416,258.43,Is it just the initial... is it just the initial approach of the guerrillas that's controlling?
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,271.149,272.328,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-1342,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,272.328,275.57,--And it seems to me that this is the... his situation.
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,279.294,284.086,"I'd like to clarify what this record shows about that issue, Your Honor."
1991.90-1342,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,342.615,347.147,"Well, if he had a well-founded fear that he would be killed, I take it that would be sufficient?"
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,347.147,350.25,"--No, Your Honor, I would not say that it would be sufficient."
1991.90-1342,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,513.955,516.597,Would you clarify something for me?
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,534.64,537.701,"Your Honor, the definition does not say, but again, the pre--"
1991.90-1342,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,537.701,538.753,Then what is your position?
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,538.753,558.054,"--The position is that the preexisting board practice that we presume Congress relied upon when it used these terms was that it could be a group that was not under the control of the government, in other words, that was out of control, that the government couldn't in any way sort of keep from inflicting severe harms on its population."
1991.90-1342,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,558.054,559.787,Could it be a Mafia group in Sicily?
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,559.787,570.564,"Yes, Your Honor, it could be a Mafia group in Sicily if the government is simply incapable of keeping their conduct under control."
1991.90-1342,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,580.451,580.961,Could it--
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,580.961,581.861,--The particular group.
1991.90-1342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,581.861,583.533,--It still has to be on account of political beliefs.
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,583.533,585.925,"Absolutely, Your Honor, or religion, or--"
1991.90-1342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,585.925,590.198,And I'm not sure how much the Mafia is interested in political beliefs.
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,590.198,608.107,"--Well, I'm not sure what the Mafia does, but what... what I would reference there is that if, for instance, they single out a different nationality for adverse treatment that's... that sort of thing, but... but yes, Your Honor, it absolutely has to be for one of the purposes that Congress prohibited."
1991.90-1342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.518,639.138,Didn't the... didn't the immigration judge here find that... that this person refused to join the revolutionaries because he didn't want to go against the current government?
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,639.138,649.286,"No... well, Your Honor, the immigration judge found that he had a fear that he would be harmed if he went against the current government."
1991.90-1342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,652.376,659.311,"Well, isn't that... if he didn't want to disagree with the current government, isn't that a brand of political belief?"
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,659.311,661.763,"--It could be, Your Honor, if what he said--"
1991.90-1342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.763,662.564,"Well, why wasn't it here?"
1991.90-1342,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,662.564,673.96,"--It was not, Your Honor, because he was very explicit in his testimony that the reason he did not want to go against the government was not because he believed in their policies or thought what they were doing was right--"
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1672.534,1683.319,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1342,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1727.758,1734.263,"Well... well, do you have any quarrel with the legal standards that the Solicitor General has set forth here?"
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1734.263,1752.055,"To the extent that the... the Solicitor General requires there to be something more than the inference that this reasonable... that this young man had about his fear, yes, we do quarrel about it, but in theory... in theory the, well--"
1991.90-1342,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1752.055,1757.829,"But Ms.... Ms. Mahoney's interpretation of the statutory requisites, I take it, is satisfactory with you?"
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1761.291,1768.695,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that she... she says that the standard is applied the same way."
1991.90-1342,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1778.552,1783.734,"All right, but it's a matter of application in this case that we're... that we're concerned with, then?"
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1783.734,1786.357,It... it is a matter--
1991.90-1342,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1786.357,1796.715,You will agree with Ms. Mahoney's statements of the legal requisites to show political... a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of political opinion?
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1796.715,1822.7,"--Not, Your Honor, if that standard requires both a specific showing of the political opinion of the applicant and a specific showing that the... that the purpose, the specific purpose of the persecution which is feared, and which, after all, hasn't happened yet, will be specifically to punish the applicant for that political opinion."
1991.90-1342,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1830.995,1834.719,"Well, we deal with inferences and probabilities and likelihoods."
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1834.719,1848.987,"--Well, Your Honor, we do deal with these inferences, and if... and if the standard is expressed in terms of the inferences that can be drawn, yes, we have no problem with the... with the... with the basic... with the basic standard."
1991.90-1342,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.987,1854.651,But he... but he... but his well-founded fear has to be of prosecution on account of his political beliefs?
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1854.651,1860.865,"That's right, Your Honor, and a well-founded fear, reasonable standard--"
1991.90-1342,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1860.865,1861.326,Which--
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1861.326,1862.017,--Runs all the way through this--
1991.90-1342,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.017,1867.13,--Which may be... which in fact may be baseless?
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1867.13,1875.755,"--Well, if it is baseless, Your Honor... if it is baseless, then... then it is not well-founded."
1991.90-1342,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1876.987,1877.398,All right.
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1878.287,1878.888,--The well-founded issue--
1991.90-1342,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.888,1889.944,"--But I... in the... but it may be that he... the fact is that... it may be that the fact is that he would never be prosecuted for anything, let alone his political beliefs."
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1889.944,1893.066,"--It... that is a possibility, Your Honor."
1991.90-1342,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1895.577,1896.028,Yes.
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1896.028,1903.364,"--requires only that he reasonably believe it and that the possibilities, indeed, may be considerably less than 50 percent."
1991.90-1342,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.983,1922.088,What... what about... is there any requirement that he actually have a political opinion?
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1922.088,1923.626,"Your Honor, no."
1991.90-1342,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.626,1932.062,"I mean, it doesn't say well-founded fear of persecution on account of supposed political opinion, but it says, on account of political opinion."
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1932.062,1932.783,It--
1991.90-1342,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1932.783,1934.463,Doesn't he have to have a political opinion?
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1950.515,1954.396,"--Your Honor, the--"
1991.90-1342,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1954.396,1957.658,And she seemingly said that with... with approval.
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1957.658,1970.567,"--There is... there is in the cases... this case does not present these facts, because there is a political opinion on the record of this case, but there are cases--"
1991.90-1342,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.567,1972.307,What... what is the... the political opinion on the record here?
1991.90-1342,1,32737,james_robertson,,1972.307,1980.973,--The political opinion on the record is established by the... by the alien's testimony that he didn't want to be against the government.
1991.90-1342,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3457.17,3465.355,"I'd like to stress that the statute uses motive, not legality, to distinguish between refugee status."
1991.90-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3483.788,3488.48,"Yes, but they might not be persecuted, if you just enforce... enforce a generally applicable law."
1991.90-1342,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3488.48,3493.341,"But, Your Honor, it's the motive, and if the motive is to punish them for the refusal--"
1991.90-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3493.341,3495.735,"Well, the motive goes to the on account of part, but it doesn't go to the word persecution."
1991.90-1342,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3495.735,3499.145,"--It... persecution also has motive within it, Your Honor."
1991.90-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3501.997,3506.111,"Well, what if... what if one of the elements of persecution is acting in conflict with established law?"
1991.90-1342,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3506.111,3509.383,"--No, Your Honor, it is not."
1991.90-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3527.246,3529.116,"Yes, but you have to have... I'm assuming a nondiscriminatory law."
1991.90-1342,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3529.116,3544.476,"Well, if we have a nondiscriminatory law, Your Honor... the point here is that if the refusal to serve is itself the expression of a political opinion, then throwing someone into jail for that would be punishment for political opinion."
1991.90-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3544.476,3545.367,I don't--
1991.90-1342,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3545.367,3548.079,"Why is it... our position is, why is it--"
1991.90-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3548.079,3550.22,"--It wouldn't be persecution on account of political opinion, is what I'm suggesting."
1991.90-1342,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3550.22,3550.69,--Well--
1991.90-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3550.69,3551.441,"It would be punishment, I agree--"
1991.90-1342,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3551.441,3552.16,--But then--
1991.90-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3552.16,3553.582,--But the statute doesn't use the word punishment.
1991.90-1342,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3553.582,3559.406,"--The question then is why is not... why is it persecution for the guerrillas to do it, if the motive is the same?"
1991.90-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3562.819,3569.053,"Because, I say, there's an ingredient of, in accordance with a nondiscriminatory law, and they are not acting in accordance with a nondiscriminatory law."
1991.90-1342,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3569.053,3570.025,Thank you.
1991.90-1342,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3570.025,3571.557,"Thank you, Ms. Mahoney."
