1969.395,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,49.494,Number 395 United States against Seckinger.
1969.395,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,52.722,57.09,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1623.941,1627.272,May it please the Court.
1969.395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1662.051,1666.928,"Would it have been turned off, short time before if the contractor suppressed, wasn't it?"
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1666.928,1675.714,This is not in the record Mr. Justice and where it comes from is unknown to us.
1969.395,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1727.341,1730.095,"Well, does -- does it have to?"
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1730.095,1730.993,"Yes, sir."
1969.395,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1730.993,1732.158,Alright.
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1732.158,1740.896,"We respectfully maintain that to doll up this clause and make it one of indemnity, we don't add the words --"
1969.395,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1740.896,1741.144,What's the magic --
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1741.144,1742.534,We really --
1969.395,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1742.534,1744.447,What's the magic in indemnity?
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1744.447,1748.829,It's the English language for indemnify.
1969.395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1748.829,1751.184,"Well, what did the words say here?"
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1751.307,1751.797,Be responsible.
1969.395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1751.797,1759.011,"-- he shall be responsible for all damages that occur as a result of his fault or negligence, that's pretty plain, isn't it?"
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1759.011,1765.014,Is the way -- it's the way the AIA has done it which might give us some guide.
1969.395,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1765.014,1767.481,"Well, I don't understand responsible."
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1767.481,1771.912,"The responsible is limited, Mr. Justice."
1969.395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1786.173,1788.334,"What is the AIA, the American Institute of Architects?"
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1788.334,1789.378,"Yes, sir."
1969.395,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.632,1832.102,"That is a long, long instance?"
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1832.102,1833.748,"Yes, sir."
1969.395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1859.173,1866.998,Would you think that the word reliable instead of responsible would be different?
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1866.998,1885.87,"I think Your Honor, if a small amount at that time that was consumed in this case from the Government's standpoint were devoted to writing a clause originally, this case would have never happened."
1969.395,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1905.189,1914.197,"Suppose that it -- suppose that they didn't used either one of the words, they just chose to state what they wanted."
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1928.726,1935.53,I think we have -- I think we'd have much less argument Mr. Justice with this particular problem.
1969.395,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1935.53,1939.536,"It hinges around the words, those two words, they're equal."
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1939.536,1940.73,"Yes, sir."
1969.395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1945.024,1973.191,"Mr. Kennedy, I'm -- I understand that this clause has been in hundreds if not thousands if not many, many thousands of Government contracts since the 30s, the Federal Tort Claims Act has been existing since 1946, isn't there, aren't there -- I'm amazed if there are not many, many Court decisions construing this clause in this basic context and are there or are there not?"
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1973.191,1980.5,I think we share your surprise and I think only lately have they started pushing it.
1969.395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1980.586,1986.124,"Well, are there any court decisions, District Courts, Courts of Appeal or state courts?"
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1986.124,1995.857,"In the briefs in the Circuit Courts, you'll find a District Court decision out of Texas which construed this favorably."
1969.395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1996.49,1997.759,Favorably to which side?
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,1997.759,1999.522,To our side.
1969.395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2048.679,2050.443,"You mean, indemnity to the United States?"
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,2050.443,2052.327,"Right, because the --"
1969.395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.327,2054.967,But the United States could not have been held liable.
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,2054.967,2064.8,"Exactly, so how in 1950's fall when this contract was drawn."
1969.395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2077.696,2085.958,"Well, don't we take it from the time it was born and to use your term by the signatures of the two contracting parties?"
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,2088.304,2090.024,"Yes sir, they are true."
1969.395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2090.024,2093.44,And at that time there was a Federal Tort Claims Act.
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,2093.44,2094.341,Very true.
1969.395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2116.089,2136.25,Well it -- it could easily have gone into the contract in the abundance of caution by a Government lawyer who wanted to seal the Government off from any possible responsibility for the negligence of its contractor who might be thought by someone to be its agent.
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,2136.25,2143.363,But it was put in with that abundance in 1938 when indemnity was possible.
1969.395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2196.556,2210.75,"I -- somewhere on these printed briefs or record, is there -- is the context of this clause apparent, all I have is on page 2 here in the Government's brief where they have simply the clause itself."
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,2210.75,2218.847,"Yes, I think that on page 36 --"
1969.395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2218.847,2219.296,Of what?
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,2219.296,2220.738,Of the government's brief --
1969.395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2220.738,2221.262,Thank you.
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,2221.262,2223.019,-- you'll find the whole clause.
1969.395,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2223.019,2223.8,"Thank you, sir."
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,2223.8,2232.31,"It's number 11, Mr. Justice and it says, its titled Permits and Responsibility for Work."
1969.395,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2238.363,2239.066,A little bit of what?
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,2239.066,2244.592,Sneaky.
1969.395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2267.39,2282.812,We'll stop for lunch sir.
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,2286.701,2288.262,Thank you sir.
1969.395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2346.853,2352.017,Would you maintain this or -- let me withdraw that.
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,2367.158,2367.584,"Well, and in general --"
1969.395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2367.584,2369.384,"-- or that you did, which way?"
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,2369.384,2376.641,"In a general sense, we pay workmen's compensation whether we are liable or not."
1969.395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2376.641,2377.659,"No, no."
1969.395,1,31358,john_g_kennedy,,2398.653,2401.891,I think the latter would be closer.
1969.395,2,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3058.394,3060.553,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, just a several small matters."
