1965.9,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,33.824,"Number 9, Swift & Company Incorporated, et al., Appellants versus Don J. Wickham, Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of New York."
1965.9,0,44186,william_j_condon,,35.245,39.472,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4004.532,4010.83,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1965.9,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4011.85,4022.895,"May I ask you before you get into your argument, do you happen know anything about this discussion we've had here whether the Department of Agriculture agrees to the position of the Solicitor General?"
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4022.895,4023.734,No sir.
1965.9,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4023.734,4027.1,"You do not know, right."
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4027.1,4051.151,"We are interested in getting a decision on the merits by this Court, but nevertheless in view of the expression of opinion and the opinion of the District Court about the jurisdictional point, we thought it necessary to brief the point in this Court."
1965.9,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4250.853,4253.851,[Inaudible] square with the first Avocado case.
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4253.851,4265.334,"Yeah, well I was just going to say the only language which disturbed us on that point is language in the first Florida Lime case --"
1965.9,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4265.334,4266.451,Florida Lime Growers against Avocado.
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4266.451,4293.17,"-- which seems to say that the sufficiency of the complaint or the issue is not to be determined by the eventual resolution, but with the case which preceded that the Woolen's case which we cited in our brief and which this Court said that the fact that a three-judge court was assembled and after a hearing rendered a final decree, did not authorize direct appeal to this Court."
1965.9,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4398.537,4407.089,I didn't understand General Hirshowitz that the appellant was making any claim that the New York regulation is unreasonable per se.
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4407.089,4408.875,Well during the course of a --
1965.9,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4408.875,4411.125,But maybe I misunderstood.
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4411.125,4425.917,"Well, during the course of the hearing before the three-judge court efforts were made to show that it would be impracticable to comply with New York law, but the proof as found by the three-judge court does not substantiate it."
1965.9,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4445.719,4457.715,"Were there any attack [Inaudible] against the New York statute on the grounds that was [Inaudible] protect the industry, domestic poultry industry in New York?"
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4457.715,4473.319,"No, Your Honor, but some of the facts I intend to bring out would indicate that the ruling by the lower federal official and Department of Agriculture has at least subject to a great deal of scrutiny."
1965.9,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4473.319,4475.642,A great deal of scrutiny for what reason?
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4475.642,4495.351,"Well, I intend to bring that out because as you will see from the facts developed in the record, it would be difficult to believe that the great doctrine of preemption, which is cited by the appellants would deprive people of New York of their right to have this information, additional to which --"
1965.9,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4495.351,4518.039,"Now, General Hirshowitz what if, instead of the facts we have in this case, what if we had a final determination by the Department of Agriculture affirmed by a court that the Federal Statute prohibited the label which New York says it requires?"
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4521.512,4524.562,"No sir, but as we cite --"
1965.9,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4524.562,4530.571,"Well, certainly the Federal Government would have a right to deprive the people of New York of what the commissioner says they're entitled to, wouldn't it?"
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4530.571,4567.891,"That would be after judicial process and we would naturally have a remedy in Congress to address ourselves to Congress if that were the case, but I just want to point out to you that all the steps that were taken by the two packers, Armour and Swift were without notice to New York and more than that, the individual who presumably caused the disapproval of the labels submitted -- the applications for label approval submitted by Armour and Swift, he knew about the interest of New York State."
1965.9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4586.525,4590.667,"Now, who would have this knowledge General -- who would do you say had this knowledge?"
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4590.667,4591.978,"Mr. Howell, the --"
1965.9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4591.978,4593.864,"Oh, the witness I mentioned earlier."
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4593.864,4597.189,"Yes, the Department of Agriculture official."
1965.9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4597.189,4605.473,What you say is that the record shows that he knew of New York's position of some proceedings involving other practice?
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4605.473,4631.773,"No, no, the interpretation arose as a result of a criminal charge against Swift & Company brought not by the State of New York or by the Commissioner or at their behest, but a prosecution by the City of New York instigated by the Commissioner of Markets who marshaled the evidence and prosecuted by the District Attorney of King's County."
1965.9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4648.532,4650.346,"To get that bill enacted where, in New York --"
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4650.346,4652.538,It would be New York State legislature.
1965.9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5176.156,5182.004,Does your New York regulation precede the federal regulation which you said was 1950 something?
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,5182.004,5190.494,"The New York regulation precedes it, but the interpretation by the Secretary which is under challenge follow the criminal conviction."
1965.9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5190.494,5194.814,"Yes, no, but New York had a regulation before the Federal Government entered this, is that it?"
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,5194.814,5199.78,"They had a regulation, yes, which was -- there is testimony in the record."
1965.9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5251.252,5260.209,"In connection with the Federal Act, did New York appear to represent to the Congress that it already had a regulation?"
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,5260.209,5264.758,"No sir, because there would be no objection by New York state to the passage to the Act."
1965.9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5302.456,5305.808,"Well, did New York appear to support the federal legislative?"
1965.9,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,5305.808,5312.155,I do not know Your Honor.
1965.9,2,44186,william_j_condon,,6900.472,6901.249,Thank you Your Honor.
1965.9,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7134.882,7138.818,"Mr. Condon, can I ask you this question?"
1965.9,2,44186,william_j_condon,,7153.675,7163.872,"Well, they both require a statement of net weight, I think the substantial difference is, the Federal Act calls for the net weight of the product, poultry product."
1965.9,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7183.283,7200.929,"Are you saying that the Federal Statute makes mandatory the ruling that was made in this case, that the administrative official Mr. Howell or whatever his name was, had no discretion."
1965.9,2,44186,william_j_condon,,7200.929,7203.49,"Well, I think that's at least a permissible interpretation."
1965.9,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7211.584,7215.503,"Well, take it my way for a minute so I can get your theory."
1965.9,2,44186,william_j_condon,,7244.333,7245.554,"Yes, yes sir."
1965.9,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7245.554,7246.347,It would be?
1965.9,2,44186,william_j_condon,,7246.347,7246.745,Yes sir.
1965.9,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7246.745,7269.24,"In other words, it's your position that in any area where the Federal Statute provides for labeling and provides for the statement of net weight on the label, and any state statute which provides for a statement of net weight on the label, is constitutionally invalid."
1965.9,2,44186,william_j_condon,,7269.24,7271.67,"As applied certainly to that product, yes sir."
1965.9,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7271.67,7281.964,"[Inaudible] primarily because, in this instance, in this statute required prior approval of the label."
1965.9,2,44186,william_j_condon,,7281.964,7288.524,"I understood, Mr. Justice Fortas to be asking upon that basis, the prior approval."
1965.9,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7288.524,7292.965,"No, I'm glad to have you clarify your views."
1965.9,2,44186,william_j_condon,,7295.045,7302.034,"It did not, I'm sorry sir, without that, and again now you are back to essentially the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act situation."
1965.9,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7310.822,7313.007,This is your preemption end of your argument?
1965.9,2,44186,william_j_condon,,7313.007,7314.453,That's correct.
1965.9,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7314.453,7316.09,May I ask one last question Mr. Condon?
1965.9,2,44186,william_j_condon,,7329.546,7336.132,"I do not, as far as I know, they did not, but I can't say that they for sure."
