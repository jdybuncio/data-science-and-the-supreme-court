1972.72-549,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.664,"-- this morning on number 72-549 and 72-550, School Board of Richmond against the State Board of Education and Bradley against the State Board of Education."
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,21.294,25.631,Good Morning Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-549,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,207.57,210.642,"Id that the School Superintendents, Mr. Coleman, are centrally nominated?"
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,210.642,210.906,Yes.
1972.72-549,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,210.906,211.359,What does that mean?
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,211.359,224.339,"Under Virginia law, it’s provided that the State Board of Education makes up a list of people eligible to be appointed and the school divisions can appoint only from that list."
1972.72-549,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,496.03,496.851,What page did you say?
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,496.851,507.765,"167 A, Mr. Justice Brennan and 168 A and just look at the situation and this is 1970."
1972.72-549,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,678.295,681.328,"The amended complaint was filed, when?"
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,681.328,683.837,"This was filed in 1970, Your Honor"
1972.72-549,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,683.837,685.907,1970 still.
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,685.907,687.744,"Yes, in 1970."
1972.72-549,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,687.744,694.536,Was that done in response to an implicit invitation by the District Court?
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,694.536,703.861,"No sir, that was not done, what happened was, Your Honor, that they were trying to come up with an effective plan."
1972.72-549,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,753.407,755.158,"58A of what, this one --"
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,755.158,761.564,"This once again of the petition, Your Honor, and it's at page 81."
1972.72-549,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,779.021,780.853,So are these formal findings Mr. Coleman?
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,780.853,781.546,Yes sir.
1972.72-549,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,781.546,782.391,What pages?
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,782.391,785.565,"Well, as I go through, I will give them to you."
1972.72-549,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,946.617,950.264,I didn't find anything on page 524.
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,950.264,956.448,It's attached Your Honor to petition -- the appendix to the petition for certiorari.
1972.72-549,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1203.025,1207.636,"Mr. Coleman as I understand that the busing issue was a separate matter, it is not the --"
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1207.636,1213.353,"Well, footnote two of the -- footnote two of the Court of Appeals, says this is not busing case."
1972.72-549,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.729,1222.725,"Well, the question of busing is not in this case?"
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1222.725,1225.755,"No not in this case, that is correct."
1972.72-549,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1225.755,1231.949,And whether there is too much or too little or whether there is any at all or not is irrelevant in this case?
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1231.949,1233.775,It's irrelevant.
1972.72-549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.696,1269.992,Mr. Coleman you referred to 193A Judge Merhige's opinion about prior practice of crossing these lines.
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1281.617,1282.822,It means both.
1972.72-549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1282.822,1283.942,So there were actual pupils --
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1283.942,1303.882,"Yeah there were actual pupils within these three counties and in addition there were, there were cases in other counties where there were regional Black schools and incidentally Mr. Justice Brennan you ought to remember from the Green case that they actually bused Indians across the line too, at one particular time."
1972.72-549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1303.882,1308.977,What was the nature of the exchange between Henrico and Richmond or Chesterfield and Richmond?
1972.72-549,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1308.977,1324.036,"Well the nature was that under the Pupil Placement Law, when a Black person would apply to go to school in Richmond, the White family then had the right to send his child to some other school."
1972.72-549,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1435.305,1443.375,Thank you Mr. Coleman.
1972.72-549,1,25641,george_b_little,,1445.225,1447.566,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-549,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1451.807,1453.721,Oh you may proceed unless you need it at the out set.
1972.72-549,1,25641,george_b_little,,1453.721,1459.72,Alright.
1972.72-549,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2015.853,2018.244,Where do we put our finger on that in the record?
1972.72-549,1,25641,george_b_little,,2018.244,2019.502,Pardon me sir.
1972.72-549,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2019.502,2021.631,Where do we put our finger on that in the appendix here?
1972.72-549,1,25641,george_b_little,,2021.631,2026.547,This is on Richmond School Board exhibit 82.
1972.72-549,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2055.708,2057.261,I am not sure I have got the right one.
1972.72-549,1,25641,george_b_little,,2057.261,2059.493,"I beg your pardon, this is the exhibit appendix."
1972.72-549,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2119.997,2122.056,How many school divisions are there now in Virginia?
1972.72-549,1,25641,george_b_little,,2122.056,2125.529,"Approximately, 130."
1972.72-549,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2125.529,2127.085,And you say there how many in --
1972.72-549,1,25641,george_b_little,,2127.085,2128.181,A 110 --
1972.72-549,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2128.181,2129.056,19 --
1972.72-549,1,25641,george_b_little,,2129.056,2129.483,Right sir.
1972.72-549,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.601,2409.118,Do any students from Henrico go to Kennedy who do not live in Henrico?
1972.72-549,1,25641,george_b_little,,2409.118,2410.303,Not that we know of sir.
1972.72-549,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2593.764,2599.214,"Which part of the city was recently annexed, the part of whole school district?"
1972.72-549,1,25641,george_b_little,,2599.214,2601.236,"Right, quite obvious."
1972.72-549,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2601.236,2602.726,And that was taken from Chesterfield.
1972.72-549,1,25641,george_b_little,,2602.726,2604.758,"Chesterfield county, that is right sir."
1972.72-549,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2623.659,2631.537,"Mr. Little, when an annexation takes place is the school district boundary automatically change with it?"
1972.72-549,1,25641,george_b_little,,2631.537,2633.084,"Automatically changed, yes sir."
1972.72-549,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2678.354,2682.586,Mr. Little what's the formality by which consolidation is affected?
1972.72-549,1,25641,george_b_little,,2682.586,2697.911,"All it requires is the consent of the State Board of Education and I would refer the Court to the detailed framework set out, first it's Section 2230 of the Code, found in the petitioner's appendix on page 617."
1972.72-549,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2963.926,2970.136,Thank you Mr. Little.
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,2972.043,2977.433,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.72-549,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3123.349,3127.334,There seems to be some question about that?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3128.577,3130.281,By definition Your Honor --
1972.72-549,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3130.281,3139.22,You said that now three four times that all three of these systems were desegregated and unitary and were long before this order was entered?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3139.22,3140.497,"Before this order was entered, that is right Your Honor."
1972.72-549,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3140.497,3148.302,"And I gather that there is some disagreement just as a matter of fact at least to -- that the factual – between you and your brothers on the other side, is there not?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3148.302,3151.008,I do not think there is disagreement as to the fact if I may say so Mr. Justice.
1972.72-549,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3151.008,3153.247,"Well, I would like to be know about it --"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3153.247,3155.759,There is disagreement as to conclusion.
1972.72-549,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3179.567,3205.941,"Judge Merhige in his very long opinion and I -- that just wasn't explicitly clear, but I drew from what he said that in his view neither one of these systems was unitary and desegregated, that each one of them showed vestiges of an officially segregated system and I just agree with that, am I wrong about that?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3205.941,3230.603,"No sir, but only factual basis on which Judge Merhige could reach this conclusion was that the percentage, the ratio of whites in the county schools was different from the ratio of whites and blacks in the city schools, the problem that Mr. Little was talking about."
1972.72-549,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3235.404,3236.221,The State University --
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3236.221,3244.441,That's right which is HEW asked be desegregated and was separated from the system.
1972.72-549,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3264.608,3271.48,"When you use the term racially identifiable schools, precisely what do you mean, taking Richmond?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3271.48,3294.784,"What I mean is that within the city, there is no – let me change, in accordance with this Court's mandate the distribution of blacks and whites within these schools in Richmond is such that none can be said to be assigned or identifiable as black as others as well."
1972.72-549,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.837,3317.643,"What would you say Mr. Kurland if the state legislature suddenly consolidated these three counties for purposes of operating schools, say these three school districts were consolidated suddenly?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3317.643,3318.653,What would I say?
1972.72-549,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.653,3325.883,With respect to a suit which charged that there was not unitary school system?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3325.883,3333.374,"If this were one system, distribution of students would not be satisfying to the standards of the school."
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3345.088,3351.083,"Mr. Kurland, in the Richmond's area I did not see any gray spot?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3351.083,3351.839,Any sir?
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3351.839,3360.6,"Gray, according to the chart there and you have a unitary system and not one single gray one?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3360.6,3363.408,You mean 23-39%?
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3367.022,3369.583,Was that -- Is that map correct?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3369.583,3370.827,I cannot tell you whether it is correct.
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3403.554,3406.511,That is a unitary system?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3406.511,3418.506,"To the extent -- if it is not Your Honor, if the distribution of whites and blacks within Richmond is not proper then the order of the District Court should be directed to Richmond to improve that."
1972.72-549,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3418.506,3429.746,"I suppose if you did have a gray spot within – the gray, so called gray school that is 0-19.9% within Richmond that would be evidence of a segregated system within Richmond."
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3429.746,3432.287,You are absolutely right.
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3437.846,3446.898,"Well, I do not care whether you look at it one way or the other, but as I look at it, frankly all of the gray ones are outside and all the black ones are inside, by sheer accident?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3446.898,3448.416,"Well it is not accident, Your Honor."
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3456.896,3462.204,How many of the findings of Judge Merhige were upset with the Court of Appeals?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3462.204,3475.53,The court found that there was no nexus between the alleged wrong doing in the past and the demographic distribution between the counties and the city here --
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3475.53,3476.76,"Well, I am correct – oh!"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3477.347,3485.107,-- which is of the essence of the finding of inadequacy of the Trial Court opinion.
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3485.107,3490.221,"They disagree with opinion, but did they do anything with the findings?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3490.221,3494.068,"Your Honor, the findings did not support the basis for the remedy."
1972.72-549,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3693.335,3695.532,But I thought that busing issue is not in this case?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3695.532,3705.061,The busing issue sir is -- we know that the contention of busing is not an appropriate means of affecting a unitary system.
1972.72-549,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3717.959,3733.418,But you -- am I to understand that you are arguing at a separate ground for sustaining the Court of Appeals' decision is that there is -- it relates to busing?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3733.418,3763.346,"What we have said, Your Honor, is that busing is a perfectly appropriate tool, subject to the limitations expressed by this Court in Swann to effectuate the desegregation of a school system, but we say though that when you measure the remedy that has been offered, the form that this busing takes is a fact that the Court must take into consideration in deciding whether or not the remedies are appropriate --"
1972.72-549,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3763.346,3778.432,"And you are not urging -- and you are not urging there is a separate reason for affirming the Court of Appeals that the District Court, not that it was implementing some racial balance idea."
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3784.872,3790.486,"We are saying that the court was wrong because that was the function and affect of the plan, yes Your Honor."
1972.72-549,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3790.486,3793.536,"Yes, but the the issue that's here is what is the --"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3793.536,3795.106,It's the plan.
1972.72-549,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3795.106,3808.396,"Yeah, the issue here is the plan but the issue as to whether -- is whether or not the Court of Appeal was right in saying that the District Court could not cross these school boundaries?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3808.396,3817.839,"Actually the basic issue is the one I stated, whether it can cross the school boundaries, for the purpose of effectuating a viable racial mix."
1972.72-549,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3828.043,3841.26,"But I thought you said, I want to know if this – if all of these three districts were together, the distribution of Blacks and Whites would not be acceptable?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3841.26,3841.677,That's right.
1972.72-549,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3852.776,3865.394,"If the whole -- if the three school districts were together and were one system, would you will be here attacking this plan?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3865.394,3888.033,"Yes, I would be here attacking this plan, Your Honor, for the reason that this was not an attempt to desegregate the unitary system, but to effectuate a specific thesis which is that in order to have a proper school system you need a ratio of between 60% and 80% white and no more than 40 unless it's 100%."
1972.72-549,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3888.033,3895.1,"That is not the question that is presented in the Petition for Certiorari that you are -- you are urging it as a respondent, is that it?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,3895.1,3902.055,That's right and it is our response for Petition for Certiorari.
1972.72-549,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4610.626,4615.893,"But surely the petitioners have, I mean, the respondents have -- the petitioners have shown more than that."
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4635.441,4636.066,That's right.
1972.72-549,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4636.066,4642.272,"-- throughout the State of Virginia and including specifically and explicitly these three school districts, isn't that true?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4642.272,4642.875,"That's right, Your Honor."
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4651.855,4658.464,You mean that state imposed segregation doesn't bring about segregated housing?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4658.464,4658.728,There is nothing in this record --
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4658.728,4659.969,Isn't that --
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4659.969,4661.25,"Yes, what I am saying here."
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4669.369,4672.146,Well you did have state segregated schools?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4672.146,4673.189,We did have state segregated schools.
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4673.189,4675.854,You did have restrictive covenants?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4675.854,4682.442,"No sir, we have not -- we have restricted covenants which were abolished by this Court way back in 1940 --"
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4682.442,4684.395,But they were there before?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4684.395,4686.922,"That's right, there is nothing in this record."
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4686.922,4691.742,"Are you going to imply, to say the State of Virginia has nothing at all to do with it?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4691.742,4693.266,With this distribution of population?
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4693.266,4693.739,Yes.
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4693.739,4695.642,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4700.415,4703.247,You said the record doesn't show it?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4703.247,4705.33,That is what I assume the basis for judgment (Voice Overlap)
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4705.33,4718.441,"The record does show that despite the decision of this Court, Richmond compelled by the state, defied it for 17 years."
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4718.441,4727.493,"That is right, Your Honor and that defiance came to an end, that defiance came to an end before this order was passed upon."
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4727.493,4730.132,And not before the suit was filed?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4730.132,4736.324,"No sir the suit was filed 1954, certainly not before that."
1972.72-549,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4814.783,4820.064,What's Judge Merhige's finding on that precise point?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4820.064,4826.478,"I don't know that I can help you, Your Honor."
1972.72-549,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4826.478,4842.061,"Well probably you should come back to that later, and not delay now."
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4842.061,4855.385,What we have here is a situation in which the respondents have reached that point spoken off by this Court in Swann.
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4880.586,4890.788,"What about the one on Page 169, where you say the present pattern is the reflection of the past racial discrimination contributed in part by local, state, and federal government."
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4890.788,4892.686,There is not a doubt that I said that Your Honor.
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4906.142,4911.02,"Well, do you think you pulled this out of clear blue?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,4911.02,4918.212,"I don't know whether it came from the blue, I know it did not come from the record."
1972.72-549,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5050.19,5059.168,How about the petitioners contention that there were exchanges of students back and forth across these lines in historical times?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,5059.168,5075.765,"There is no doubt, Your Honor, that during the period of obstruction, there were individual students which crossed state lines."
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5129.118,5130.576,How about Kennedy High School?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,5134.389,5139.346,They don't but probably with the line of the City of Richmond.
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5139.346,5140.936,Is Kennedy outside of it?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,5140.936,5144.796,"Certainly Your Honor, the City of Richmond has the power to place at schools."
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5144.796,5147.854,"Well, they didn't have any trouble with the county line on that, did they?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,5147.854,5153.042,Nobody has any possibility of interfering with it as I understand Your Honor.
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5169.627,5173.109,"Well, I understand the Richmond school board is in favor of this plan?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,5173.109,5175.289,"It's the Richmond School Board's plan, Your Honor."
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5175.289,5176.067,Yeah.
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,5177.613,5185.858,"But they are not asking to bring this area -- this plan brings in the entire, two counties to be joined with --"
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5185.858,5191.97,"No, my only point is I thought you could make – they stressed on we shouldn't cross this county line?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,5191.97,5204.268,"I am saying that we should not separate -- create new school systems, new forms of local government in the city of -- in the state of Virginia or any other state of the union."
1972.72-549,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5204.268,5214.095,"I suppose with respect to the county high school, the Richmond school district acquired the land with its money and built the school?"
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,5214.095,5215.213,"Yes, sir."
1972.72-549,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5220.29,5223.156,Who was the police power over it?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,5223.156,5227.306,Who has the police power?
1972.72-549,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5235.384,5236.479,City of Richmond?
1972.72-549,2,38064,philip_b_kurland,,5236.479,5243.51,City of Richmond.
1972.72-549,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5495.569,5506.189,Mr. Kurland.
1972.72-549,4,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,6621.978,6625.024,I think it will take me twice as long to move as fast as Mr. Solicitor did?
1972.72-549,4,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,6625.024,6626.001,Mr. Coleman?
1972.72-549,4,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,6626.001,6626.136,Yes sir.
1972.72-549,4,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,6626.136,6629.155,Can I ask one question for you to answer it at any time?
1972.72-549,4,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,6629.155,6629.63,Yes sir.
1972.72-549,4,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,6629.63,6633.02,"Suppose this were not Richmond, Virginia."
1972.72-549,4,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,6649.71,6650.006,Oh!
1972.72-549,4,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,6674.873,6678.537,You disagree with the Solicitor General's comment to that effect?
1972.72-549,4,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,6678.537,6678.707,Oh!
