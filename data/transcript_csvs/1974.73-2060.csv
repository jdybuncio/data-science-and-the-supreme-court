1974.73-2060,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,20.731,"We’ll hear arguments next in 73-2060, Austin against New Hampshire."
1974.73-2060,0,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,20.731,23.005,Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-2060,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,23.005,23.433,Yes.
1974.73-2060,0,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,23.433,35.996,"If I may, I do not have reply argument, but Mr. Roddick advised me that I should speak to you concerning our reply brief because this case was accelerated, we would request permission to file our reply brief following argument."
1974.73-2060,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,35.996,40.856,You may do so and of course you'll serve it in the usual course on your friend.
1974.73-2060,0,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,40.856,41.853,"Certainly, thank you."
1974.73-2060,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,41.853,69.746,Very well.
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,139.83,143.926,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-2060,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,245.216,253.493,"Mr. Smith, before you get in to that, if you prevail here what do you gain?"
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,253.493,261.13,"If we prevail here, I presume that what our people gain is the payment of tax in their own state."
1974.73-2060,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,268.609,280.869,"Well, I’m not all worried about the first -- about the question standing, but aren’t you asking whom they to pay the same tax dollar in the State of Maine rather than the State of New Hampshire?"
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,280.869,281.781,"Yes, but we’re asking --"
1974.73-2060,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,281.781,281.988,Therefore --
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,281.988,291.788,"-- that they pay the same tax dollar to the State of Maine rather than the State of New Hampshire because they would get the benefits of the payment of that tax dollar in the State of Maine that they do not get in the State of New Hampshire, may it please the Court."
1974.73-2060,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,291.788,298.809,You say the legislative decision by the Maine legislature?
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,298.809,301.151,"Would you repeat the question, may it please the Court, so that I’ll understand it."
1974.73-2060,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,301.151,305.475,Isn’t that a decision that the Maine legislature itself has made?
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,305.475,317.902,"I do not believe that that’s a question of the Maine legislature and I think we get into what the Privileges and Immunities Clause was designed to prevent, we get into what we call retaliatory legislation."
1974.73-2060,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,324.915,336.635,But hasn’t the Maine statute in effect provided and recognized the propriety of this payment to the State of New Hampshire?
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,336.635,343.638,I do not believe that the Maine statute or the legislature has recognized the propriety of the payment in New Hampshire.
1974.73-2060,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,359.442,363.031,Retaliatory deduction upon a credit or a deduction?
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,363.031,364.524,It’s a credit against the tax.
1974.73-2060,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,364.524,365.446,Yes.
1974.73-2060,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,365.446,373.789,And I guess another way to phrase my question if whether this isn’t just a lawyer's lawsuit?[Attempt to Laughter]
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,373.789,379.502,"No, I think these people feel very strongly about this and this is why we are in this Court."
1974.73-2060,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,379.502,383.642,"Well, the taxpayers may, but their legislature has permitted it by --"
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,383.642,399.219,"Their legislature, I am sure their legislature could change it by doing a way with the credit and then we get in to all the retaliatory legislative processes against one state against another which this Court has said, the Privileges and Immunities Clause was designed to prevent."
1974.73-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,399.219,411.077,"Of course their legislature too might feel that even though they could exact full measure of the Maine tax, there would be an element of unfairness in the eyes of that legislature to this particular solution?"
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,411.077,420.015,"I’m suppose -- I presume that that’s the excessive reasoning or rational behind it, may it please the Court."
1974.73-2060,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,420.387,427.264,"Now, we end up with a proposition however that if you prevail here your clients are out the same amount of dollars?"
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,427.264,440.018,They’re out the same amount of dollars but they’re going to have those amounts of dollars spent in their state under the provisions of this statute where they receive the benefits of those amounts of dollars spent.
1974.73-2060,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,449.427,455.091,"Then the answer to that is that the Maine legislature, if it chooses to do that can change its statute?"
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,455.091,461.438,"If it changes its statute, it’s that -- it could stay -- it could simply do a way with the credit."
1974.73-2060,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,476.438,479.915,A routine that has to go over the country?
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,479.915,489.047,"We have double taxation, I will agree to that, but I think that that would be one of the impositions that results."
1974.73-2060,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,735.405,740.986,"In that respect Mr. Smith, suppose that Maine didn’t have an income tax at all, would that mean that New Hampshire --"
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,740.986,743.579,They would pay no tax in the State of New Hampshire.
1974.73-2060,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,743.579,744.162,They would what?
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,744.162,745.116,They would pay no tax.
1974.73-2060,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,745.116,745.878,Pay no tax.
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,745.878,746.878,In the State of New Hampshire.
1974.73-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,764.618,777.991,Your statement then as to the effect to that purported tax on New Hampshire residents earning income out of the state that it simply categorically doesn’t effect a single person in that class?
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,778.227,782.244,"I would have to make that categorical statement, I can’t conceive of any condition."
1974.73-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,782.244,783.436,A gimmick in other words.
1974.73-2060,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,783.436,785.088,It's a sham.[Attempt to Laughter]
1974.73-2060,1,20032,charles_w_smith,,785.088,789.698,"It’s a sham, it’s exactly what I say, I said it was a pretends but that’s exactly what I say."
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,1787.89,1792.997,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-2060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1902.638,1903.606,Mr. Cleaveland.
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,1903.606,1905.051,Yes sir.
1974.73-2060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.051,1915.682,This Court certainly has gone a long way in saying that you can’t be absolutely equal and that some differences will be tolerated in the sort of thing.
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,1928.136,1930.233,"I don’t think, no."
1974.73-2060,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2035.847,2042.97,"But if you didn't collect from the non-residents, it's the residents that pays up, wouldn’t he?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2042.97,2043.96,"I’m sorry Your Honor, could you rephrase --"
1974.73-2060,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2043.96,2049.107,"Where did you get the $400,000.00 that now you getting the Maine people?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2049.107,2053.835,There’s no question of what the statute accomplishes a diversion of revenue to New Hampshire Your Honor.
1974.73-2060,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2053.835,2057.549,"Now, you said that it wouldn’t change the New Hampshire people, I submit it would."
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2063.13,2070.014,"Well, Your Honor, I think that would be a -- that is -- at least it’s a political decision."
1974.73-2060,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2074.027,2078.938,All the taxpayers -- that’s political move you can make it to tax somebody else other than people that vote for you?[Attempt to Laughter]
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2078.938,2081.016,We’ve been doing it for a long time Your Honor.
1974.73-2060,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2082.541,2091.068,Then I come back then -- isn’t part of your answer that this is a political question which the Maine legislature has resolved?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2091.068,2112.742,"I hasten to point that out Your Honor that would be my next point, to be sure that the -- it is a little bit awkward to see taxpayers in here urging as an injury, a loss of revenue by the State of Maine."
1974.73-2060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.094,2144.537,"You think Maine law would be acceptable politically or constitutionally or any other way if it said we allow credits for all the payments, all income tax payments made in other states except Vermont -- except New Hampshire?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2144.537,2163.108,"I’m not sure that -- I think to answer the question candidly Your Honor, I think the -- if the Maine law were to be phrased in that terms, it maybe subject to a challenge, but it would certainly be -- the answer would be then that the New Hampshire law is being challenged."
1974.73-2060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.108,2171.616,(Voice Overlap) if that isn’t acceptable than the legislative solution requires denying that is to everybody?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2171.616,2173.074,I don’t think that that is the case Your Honor.
1974.73-2060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2210.395,2223.679,I think you can go back to Madison’s notes in the debates in the constitutional convention in the Privileges and Immunities Clause and find that that is just a sort of thing they had in mind that they didn’t want the states to be doing?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2223.679,2234.077,"Well, Your Honor I think the -- I’ll bring this point up then out of order in my argument, I intended to make it last, but it’s just as appropriate now."
1974.73-2060,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2475.518,2476.408,Mr. Cleaveland.
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2476.408,2477.591,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-2060,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2477.591,2480.493,May I ask this question?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2485.772,2486.994,That’s correct Your Honor.
1974.73-2060,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2486.994,2492.114,"And that the Maine tax has been 3%, is that correct?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2492.114,2499.053,"I believe the tax rate in the State of Maine will float with the income, I believe it’s a graduated rate but --"
1974.73-2060,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2499.053,2500.905,At times it’s less than the 4%?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2500.905,2503.526,"That’s correct Your Honor, I understand the point you’re trying to illustrate."
1974.73-2060,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2503.526,2515.291,"Right, would you concede that there is an injury where the Maine resident is -- having his taxes withheld in an amount in excess of what he might ultimately have paid in there?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2515.291,2530.622,"The withholding of the tax creates a situation where for the moment, for the interim, the resident of Maine would have withheld in greater amount than he would ultimately have to pay in tax."
1974.73-2060,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2551.058,2552.485,You didn’t get any interest in this?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2552.485,2554.268,And that -- no that’s correct Your Honor.
1974.73-2060,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2554.268,2557.611,So it’s not like that in --
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2557.611,2565.46,"The laws of the use of the money is without a doubt, it can’t be denied."
1974.73-2060,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2573.532,2575.148,We’ll resume there at 1 o’clock.
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2575.148,2592.673,Thank you Your Honor.[Luncheon Break]
1974.73-2060,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2592.673,2598.245,You may continue Mr. Cleaveland.
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2598.245,2616.102,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may the Court please I believe I was in the middle of discussing, finishing up on the point of the withholding tax and to the extent to which that accomplished an injury, a cognizable injury to the appellants here."
1974.73-2060,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2700.992,2719.499,"To that extent you are making that basic argument Mr. Cleaveland, you are telling us in effect that the Supreme Court of New Hampshire was wrong in finding standing because that’s the traditional and most elementary test of standing as was the plaintiff injured and you said no in this case, the plaintiff is not injured."
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2730.26,2730.943,Your right Your Honor.
1974.73-2060,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2759.566,2762.209,(Voice Overlap) to get business of it?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2762.209,2770.569,"I think maybe in my experience up there, this attitude is beginning to change."
1974.73-2060,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2771.199,2785.301,"It’s true that as you know if you are not sure in our cases that often a state court will say under state law, you have standing and this Court will say well, you don’t have standing from our position and vice versa?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2785.301,2787.367,"Right, I pointed that out in my brief Your Honor."
1974.73-2060,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2943.018,2948.746,"How do you distinguish deprivation from injury, you regard then as two different things?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,2948.746,2974.302,"I think if there is a conduct, for instance an action by a state Your Honor which results in or trespasses upon a constitutional right, I think the conduct in the first place, the action by the state results in say an injury which would be say a tax burden, an increased tax burden, a disproportionate tax burden."
1974.73-2060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3010.171,3031.301,"What about the case in Toomer against Witsell where South Carolina was charging a fee that to non-residents, would it have been a sufficient answer there to tell this man that if he done a shrimping in North Carolina waters if that was where he lived, he would have had to pay a fee which North Carolina charged, so he really wasn’t injured?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3031.301,3041.209,"I think Toomer and Witsell, if I recall it correctly Your Honor, it is just a fee case, a privilege case."
1974.73-2060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3062.013,3064.373,"Of course that’s on the merits, not on the standing?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3064.373,3065.749,Correct.
1974.73-2060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3065.749,3080.29,Do you think it can be seriously maintained that the New Hampshire $10.00 residency tax or whatever else New Hampshire residents pay is really an approximate equivalent of what the other state people pay?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3080.29,3090.044,That’s a starting point Your Honor but this Court in prior decisions has indicated that you need not stop with simply state assessed taxes.
1974.73-2060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3101.353,3106.657,"Well, can you make that argument here that there is rough equality?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3106.657,3112.231,"I can -- the more I have examined this case, the more I think that argument can be made."
1974.73-2060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3134.407,3140.256,Why don’t you do it to all out of state residents who work in New Hampshire?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3140.256,3142.85,"We do Your Honor, if I understand your question correctly."
1974.73-2060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3142.85,3146.377,"Well, not if they don’t have an income tax?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3146.377,3151.306,"No, if the -- well, to that extent, all that reflects is a --"
1974.73-2060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3151.306,3163.203,"Well, you aren’t trying to tax out of staters for equivalently with in staters because you just don’t tax a lot of out of staters?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3163.203,3170.593,"I’m not sure that there are very many out of staters who are working in New Hampshire, who are not hit by this tax."
1974.73-2060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3181.04,3183.299,Or it didn’t give a credit?
1974.73-2060,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3183.299,3192.361,"How long do you have to earn money in the state before you start (Inaudible) how would that to be there three, four, six months to be enough?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3192.361,3195.104,"No Your Honor, the taxable --"
1974.73-2060,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3195.104,3205.031,How about Jersey residents who work summer time and sure reserve a hotel room and that New Jersey doesn’t have any tax unless if they don’t pay any (Inaudible)
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3205.031,3206.435,That’s probably the case Your Honor.
1974.73-2060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3237.676,3240.811,"Do you -- New Hampshire really borders on three states, doesn’t it?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3240.811,3241.652,Correct Your Honor.
1974.73-2060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3241.652,3245.841,"Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts, do all of those have income tax?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3245.841,3251.854,Yes they do Your Honor and that accounts far in a way the bulk of the taxpayers under this tax.
1974.73-2060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3251.854,3260.512,Is there anything in the record that would indicate that people who do not reside in those three states may work in New Hampshire?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3260.512,3262.48,I don’t believe there is any data.
1974.73-2060,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3278.249,3284.192,"Could it be the different country, some could come from Canada presumably which is -- and might --"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3284.192,3284.384,Presumably.
1974.73-2060,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3284.384,3293.708,-- and as my brother Brennan suggests undoubtedly there are good many people who have summer jobs in New Hampshire from other states other than the border states?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3293.708,3299.3,It’s my understanding Your Honor that they would be reached by the withholding provision.
1974.73-2060,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3328.375,3330.418,"No, that no part of your brother's case, is it?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3330.418,3335.151,"No it isn’t, it isn't and moving along the --"
1974.73-2060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3335.151,3342.947,"What if -- correct or fill me in, assume -- what is the tax rate here, 4%?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3342.947,3350.366,It begins at 4% Your Honor but it is automatically reduced to whatever rate the non-residents home state would apply.
1974.73-2060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3350.366,3352.825,So it will never be higher?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3352.825,3353.791,Never be higher.
1974.73-2060,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3369.535,3371.096,There’s nothing --
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3371.096,3371.588,Nothing in excess.
1974.73-2060,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3371.588,3374.103,"-- and against representing withheld, he gets it all back?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3374.103,3380.164,He gets it all back if the withholding is in excess which it maybe in some cases as I have said.
1974.73-2060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.164,3382.734,"So, he takes his money until the end of the year?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3382.734,3384.673,He may take it until the end of the year.
1974.73-2060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3384.673,3391.202,So at least it deprives him of the use of the money during the year?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3391.202,3393.995,I can’t -- may say that Your Honor.
1974.73-2060,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3399.23,3411.213,But there’s the additional injury that your friend mentioned that there’s money going out of Maine and into New Hampshire which never comes back to the State of Maine?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3411.213,3413.691,Which is an injury if anything to the State of Maine Your Honor.
1974.73-2060,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3413.691,3418.809,"Well, who is the State of Maine except all the people in the State of Maine, particularly among the taxpayers?"
1974.73-2060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3418.809,3420.743,It's stolen by the state of Maine itself?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3420.743,3422.673,It is given away Your Honor.
1974.73-2060,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3435.186,3446.71,"Well, the fact that it’s a revolving fund and it’s a circular process doesn’t alter all of the fact that it goes out to the hands of the taxpayer, does it?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3446.71,3452.501,"It goes out of the hands of the taxpayer, but again that part of it is a political question."
1974.73-2060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3467.467,3471.194,Well then you’d be in much tougher shape to sustain your tax?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3471.194,3481.455,"No question, we would fall immediately into an equal protection problem where we could necessarily have to get in to the business of trying to balance the relative burden of taxation."
1974.73-2060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3481.455,3483.142,Or privileges and immunities?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3483.142,3499.697,"And I think my contention is in scope to this argument that privileges and immunities and equal protection in this type of case are so closely entangled, it’s pretty much impossible to take them apart."
1974.73-2060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3499.697,3504.602,You do in fact some non-resident (Inaudible) if they work in Vermont -- they in New Hampshire?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3504.602,3526.829,"If the principle to be applied Your Honor is that the state will not -- our state will not tax a nonresident in excess of the rate which his own state applies to him and if that happens to create an inequality among non-residents, I don’t think that rises to a prosecution."
1974.73-2060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3526.829,3539.196,"Well, yeah but if it has some relevance to your argument at all, all you are trying to do is to equalize the overall tax burden between residents of New Hampshire and non-residents of New Hampshire."
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3544.094,3550.6,I’m not suggesting that we are affirmatively striving for that goal.
1974.73-2060,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3618.055,3632.507,"Mr. Cleaveland, do you have any situation where two people making $20,000.00 a year are taxed on a different percentage basis other than this?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3632.507,3636.514,"Two people, same income both in -- working in New Hampshire?"
1974.73-2060,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3636.514,3638.312,Yeah.
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3638.312,3648.015,"If one of them came from Maine and one of them came from Massachusetts, yes they would be taxed under our tax differently."
1974.73-2060,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3648.015,3656.982,"(Voice Overlap) situation in the world like that, where two people doing exact same job, getting exact same money are taxed differently?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3656.982,3661.294,I think disparate of taxation is the fact of life all over this country Your Honor.
1974.73-2060,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3666.148,3675.589,"Do you know anyone where two people doing the exact same work, in exact same place with the exact same money are taxed differently?"
1974.73-2060,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3675.589,3688.231,"Should I suggest Mr. Cleaveland that two Government employees in this city earning $20,000.00 a piece, one leaving in Maryland and one in Virginia might have different income tax obligations."
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3688.231,3690.706,I think that’s a fair example.
1974.73-2060,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3691.524,3695.347,That’s assessed by two different agencies.
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3705.852,3715.486,Every state Your Honor which has a graduated income tax with for instance part of the graduation of which is --
1974.73-2060,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3715.486,3717.742,"I said they both earning 20,000?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3717.742,3719.116,"Alright, let me finish Your Honor."
1974.73-2060,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3719.116,3719.782,Sure.
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3719.782,3729.936,The part of the graduation of which involves various exemptions or deductions is going to windup taxing disparately.
1974.73-2060,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3729.936,3733.155,"It is not the basic tax, the basic tax --"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3733.155,3736.682,"The rate -- your point is well taken Your Honor, I’m --"
1974.73-2060,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3736.682,3742.002,"So this is unique, isn't it?"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3746.696,3752.93,It maybe indeed unique except I’m not sure whether the States of New Jersey is in the same situation.
1974.73-2060,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3752.93,3759.051,"It’s no more unique than taxing everybody but the resident, it’s no more unique."
1974.73-2060,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3759.051,3770.653,"The real point is that the New Hampshire resident working right along side making the same income doesn’t pay anything and that’s what make this unlike the Maine tax on non-resident, New Hampshire rights --"
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3770.653,3771.163,Precisely there is no --
1974.73-2060,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3771.163,3774.464,-- Maine imposes a tax on its own people?
1974.73-2060,2,18578,charles_g_cleaveland,,3774.464,3778.018,The irritation which the situation creates is obvious Your Honor.
1974.73-2060,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3786.28,3788.665,Do you have anything further Mr. Smith?
1974.73-2060,3,20032,charles_w_smith,,3788.665,3792.069,"I think, unless the Court has some questions to address me, then we don’t have any rebuttal."
1974.73-2060,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3792.069,3793.165,"Very well, thank you gentleman."
