2016.15-1204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.96,"We will hear argument this morning in Case No. 15-1204, Jennings v. Rodriguez. General Gershengorn."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,5.96,45.335,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress provided extensive substantive and procedural protections for aliens whom the government wishes to remove, but at the same time, addressed the real concerns about recidivism and flight risk by providing for mandatory detention during removal proceedings for certain categories of criminal aliens and aliens arriving at our shores. The Ninth Circuit undid that legislative balance, invoking principles of constitutional avoidance to require the government to release those aliens unless the government can prove by a preponderance of the evidence every six months that detention remains necessary. The Ninth Circuit's decision is a serious misuse of the constitutional avoidance canon."
2016.15-1204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,87.915,106.775,"What about 1225(a), that is, aliens who don't fit in either of the categories that you discussed? They are not entrants, and they are not people who have committed qualifying criminal offenses."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,111.97,112.78,"That's right, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,125.17,138.59,"What would be the constitutional entitlement to keeping those people, if they're not a flight risk or a -- a risk to the safety of the country?"
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,138.59,139.04,So --
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,139.04,149.43,"Or to others? However you want to define that danger element. So what's the constitutional entitlement, just arbitrarily, to keep someone who's neither of those two things?"
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,149.43,176.225,"So with respect to the 1225(a)(1) individuals that Justice Ginsburg was talking about, those are individuals who have had bond hearings and had them denied or have been unable to post bond. And the requirement that we are concerned about there is that the government bears the burden of proof to show by clear and convincing evidence every six months that they are not a flight risk or not a -- or not likely to -- to recidivate. And --"
2016.15-1204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,176.225,178.24,Clarify two things.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,197.93,218.585,"So, Your Honor, the -- I think the government's practice with respect to the latter question is to provide bond hearings consistent with the -- consistent with the statute is my understanding, and that -- and so those are people who have had bond hearings and we do provide them there. And, I'm sorry, Your Honor, your first question?"
2016.15-1204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,218.585,220.465,Who would --
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,220.465,239.77,So they may be individuals who have -- who have entered illegally but have not committed the kinds of crimes that would make them inadmissible under 1182(a)(2) or -- or deportable under -- that would subject them -- the types of crimes that would subject you to 1226(c) for the mandatory detention there.
2016.15-1204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,250.2,263.95,"Am I right that in -- in bail hearings, it's clear and convincing to show that there is a public danger, but only by a preponderance of the evidence to show flight risk in regular bail hearings?"
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,263.95,266.16,"So, Your Honor, it does vary by the type of crime."
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,281.17,282.08,May I ask a --
2016.15-1204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,282.08,285.43,I think -- I'll check it. I think not for flight risk.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,285.43,287.19,"That might be right, Your Honor. Yes."
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,287.8,302.39,"Clarifying question. For an alien who is found in the United States illegally, has not been admitted, are they held under 1225(b) or are they held under 1226(a)?"
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,302.39,323.39,"So they are held under -- if they are not -- if they are not detained within 100 miles of the border or within 14 days, so they've been there longer than those two things, then they are under 1220 -- 1226(a) and not 1226(c)."
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,323.39,337.45,"So what happens to -- I don't know how many of these would exist, but an alien who has resided within 14 miles of the border, not 14 -- how many miles?"
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,337.45,338.88,Within a hundred miles of the border and 14 --
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,338.88,345.185,"Hundred miles from the border, that's possible, who has been there for 20 years, they would still be held under 1225?"
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,345.185,346.36,"So I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,359.88,362.14,I'm assuming no criminal alien.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,362.14,362.34,Okay.
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,362.34,373.59,I'm talking about an alien who has come into the United States illegally without being admitted who takes up residence 50 miles from the border.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,373.59,381.91,The answer is they are held under 1226(a) and that they get a bond hearing under -- and this is at page 156a of the appendix.
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,381.91,384.295,Let me finish my -- your question.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,387.82,388.59,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,388.59,398.685,Are you objecting to the concept that prolonged detention without reason is not appropriate for these aliens?
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,398.685,402.48,"So, Your Honor, we believe that they -- and I don't think --"
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,402.48,406.195,And the reasons being flight risk or danger.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,406.195,417.035,"We believe that the -- whatever due process rights that they have are met by the statutory scheme which gives them an initial bond hearing and then allows them, if there are changed circumstances, to seek a redetermination."
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,418.79,428.2,"Except that that bond hearing, that additional regulation says that the length of detention is not one of the factors that justifies reconsideration."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,428.2,429.52,"That's correct, Your Honor, under our --"
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,429.52,444.945,"And so if these are people who have been here for decades, let's say, don't you think due process would require some periodic review to ensure that these people are properly being held?"
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,444.945,447.53,"So, Your Honor, we don't think that."
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,467.17,471.45,Except that regulations are saying that you don't consider the length of detention.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,487.805,488.78,"Your Honor, so if I can --"
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,488.78,490.16,The length of detention becomes unreasonable.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,490.16,490.52,Yeah.
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,538.65,539.68,"May I ask, General -- I'm sorry."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,539.68,541.55,"No, Your Honor, I was going to shift to something else."
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,541.55,543.24,I was going to shift to something else too.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,543.24,545.04,Let's do it.
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,545.04,547.42,Let's -- let's shift to 1226(c).
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,547.42,548.21,Okay.
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,548.21,568.02,"And not focus on the statute so much but focus on the constitutional question, and I think your brief indicates that you think that there are some constitutional bounds, and so I'd like you to talk to me about what those constitutional bounds are and -- and when a judge would find them."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,568.02,607.62,"So, Your Honor, we think the constitutional bound is -- is the standard that Justice Kennedy's concurrence set forth in Demore, and we think it is that where there be, as -- as he said there -- were there to be an unreasonable delay by the government -- he said the INS, but by the government in pursuing and completing deportation proceedings, it could become necessary, then, to inquire whether the purpose of detention is not to facilitate deportation but for some other reason. So it seems to us that the analysis that a court would undertake is, has there been some sort of unusual situation or misconduct on the part of the government or delay on the part of the government that suggests the purpose of detention was not to effectuate removal, but as long as --"
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,607.62,629.765,"What happens if -- what happens if you can't point to any particular evidence of government misconduct, but that you're in a situation where the government just has very, very big backlogs and everything is taking a long time? So let's say the average would be that the government wouldn't make a decision for three years."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,637.97,653.96,"So, Your Honor, I -- I think our position in that -- in that situation would be that as long as the government was diligently -- we -- I mean, if it were 20 years, I mean, we could go on, then, of course, that might be a concern that, in fact, we were no longer trying to effectuate removal."
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,660.23,660.73,Right.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,680.75,682.2,This is 1226(a).
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,682.2,683.99,This is 1226(2)
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,687.145,688.12,I'm sorry --
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,688.12,692.185,"The words that are strongest for you, in my opinion, are those words, ""only if."""
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,692.185,692.71,Yes.
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,692.71,693.54,"""Only if."""
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,693.54,694.15,"Correct, and --"
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,694.15,695.76,Only if the witness program.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,719.98,722.55,"So, Your Honor, I want to be clear about what I'm saying there."
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,728.51,728.59,No.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,729.09,731.18,I think that's a constitutional requirement.
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,741.28,745.22,"It says ""only if."" Only if you go to the witness program."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,745.22,745.69,Correct.
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,745.69,750.475,"But my point was, and you did it accidentally but on purpose."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,752.73,756.09,"I did it -- to be clear, Your Honor, I did it as a matter of constitutional law."
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,756.09,758.34,Why? Why do it as a matter -- why not just say --
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,758.34,758.85,Because we don't --
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,758.85,775.47,"-- like all -- many type same things in the law, words like ""any"" or ""only if"" are always interpreted in light of unusual circumstances, not being absolute and you get something unusual."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,775.47,775.735,Right.
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,775.735,776.46,Okay.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,782.075,783.1,But I think it's important.
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,783.1,783.51,The one -- that's --
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,783.51,783.9,Justice Kagan --
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,783.9,784.54,-- I asked about it.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,784.54,789.19,"I was just going to say, Justice Kagan had asked me to set aside the statute, so it really was a constitutional analysis."
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,789.19,789.47,Yes.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,789.47,805.01,And we don't -- we really think that Congress -- this was a deliberate categorical judgment by Congress based on experience over a long number of years where Congress had tried to deal with the concerns about recidivism and flight for criminal aliens through a number of different mechanisms.
2016.15-1204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,812.99,819.945,"I suppose it's an area where your safety valve, the availability of habeas corpus might come into play.."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,819.945,820.77,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,845.25,848.395,"But if I could go back, General, to the constitutional point."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,892.185,892.47,All right.
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,957.45,966.575,"So I wasn't even blaming you, because I think it was partly the statistics that were provided and partly what the Court did with them. It doesn't really matter who was to blame or who wasn't to blame."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,975.94,1003.25,"So, Your Honor, so I -- the reason why I think Demore still is good is this reason: I think Demore rested on two pillars. First was the judgment that flight risk and recidivism are real problems and that IJ's are really bad at predicting, and that, therefore, Congress could make a categorical judgment in this area of immigration law that mandatory detention was appropriate. And, second, that unlike Zadvydas, the purpose of the detention was still being served."
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1059.52,1060.62,"So when is it, in theory --"
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1060.62,1062.345,-- it's more like 10 to 12 months. I'm sorry.
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1062.345,1075.59,"-- when it's not the alien's fault, and you seem to suggest that if budgetary matters or personnel matters are what are inflicting the delay that that's okay."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1113.915,1116.16,"So, Your Honor, I think the government's behavior --"
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1116.16,1117.41,Intentionally or not.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1123.67,1124.65,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1124.91,1125.44,All right.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1135.985,1141.445,"So, Your Honor, we don't think that the mere date itself is what makes it unconstitutional."
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1142.97,1143.265,No.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1152.125,1152.85,Right.
2016.15-1204,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1204.59,1220.48,"Assuming -- assuming that there is a constitutional limit of the type that's been discussed, is that -- do you think that can be addressed in a class action, or is it something that can be addressed only in individual habeas cases?"
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1220.48,1241.07,"So, Your Honor, we think it's clearly the latter, and we really think that that is one of the major flaws of the Ninth Circuit's decision, is that it adopted a class-wide rigid rule that applies to aliens no matter what is the cause of the delay, no matter whether the alien is a criminal alien or arriving alien, no matter whether the alien is seeking discretionary relief or not discretionary relief."
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1249.48,1251.18,I guess I don't quite understand that.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1279.045,1296.73,"So in theory, Your Honor, the short answer is the Due Process Clause doesn't usually permit that kind of broad-based approach that doesn't take advantage -- take cognizance of the various differences between the aliens on the ground."
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1298.34,1313.75,"Well, wouldn't it be better to set some guideposts that everybody in the country would know to follow rather than having one suit pop up here and one suit pop up here and another in another place and everybody would be treated differently? That does not seem like a good immigration system."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1313.75,1328.18,"So the first thing I would say, Your Honor, is that the one thing that we know shouldn't be the case is what the Ninth Circuit has done, which is the opposite of that, which is apply a single standard to everybody regardless of -- regardless of the cause of the delay."
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1344.42,1348.73,"Well, I wasn't -- I wasn't suggesting a rule that was quite as rigid as that."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1365.77,1366.35,"So, Your Honor --"
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1366.35,1375.25,"-- six months, whatever, something pretty reasonable, but only presumptively if there is some exceptional circumstance that could be extended."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1375.25,1380.1,"So, Your Honor, I think it would be within the Court's power to do that. We don't think that's the way we would approach."
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1381.37,1381.64,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1382.47,1385.13,We do not think that's the way we would advise the Court to approach --
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1385.13,1385.39,"No, no, no."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1385.85,1387.75,We think the Court would have power to do that --
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1387.75,1387.865,Okay.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1388.12,1390.465,-- but we don't think that's the way the Court should do it.
2016.15-1204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1398.97,1399.17,Well --
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1399.17,1401.16,-- given the tremendous variation --
2016.15-1204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1401.16,1405.21,"In a class action, the Court has to grant or deny relief."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1418.91,1422.18,"I agree with that, Your Honor, and that is why we don't think that's what the courts should do."
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1434.47,1438.045,"Well, how about the ABA amicus brief here?"
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1438.045,1438.42,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1439.56,1440.51,Is that -- go ahead.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1440.51,1455.925,"We do suggest in our brief that there are -- there are indicators, you know, that -- that 90 percent of the IJ hearings are done within 14 months, and 90 percent of the BIA proceedings are done within 19 months."
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1479.3,1486.635,We are in an upended world when we think 14 months or 19 months is a reasonable time to detain a person.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1486.635,1488.77,"So, Your Honor, what I -- I totally understand --"
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1488.77,1489.51,-- understand that.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1489.51,1501.65,"But what I'm trying to suggest to Your Honor is that that is part and parcel of an overall scheme that offers tremendous process to the individual alien, and that part of the reason for that delay is the government --"
2016.15-1204,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1501.65,1510.08,"But you would think that that process, at least with respect to 1226(b), is to ensure that the person is not a flight risk or a danger."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1510.08,1522.595,"Your Honor, it is -- it is to effectuate Congress's categorical judgment that those -- either that there -- that they -- is a risk, a flight risk, and a risk of recidivism, and that it's very hard to predict those."
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1522.595,1528.25,"I have a couple of questions I'd like to ask, actually, because it's a complicated statute."
2016.15-1204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1531.275,1531.56,Yeah.
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1535.94,1538.74,We're -- we're talking about three categories.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1561.4,1561.985,Right.
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1561.985,1567.185,"But the more important part, I think, is the criminal part."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1618.345,1618.945,Okay.
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1618.945,1629.275,"Let's look at that statute. As you would like to interpret it, during that first period -- remember, the second period I'm with you, the 90 days."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1644.645,1646.02,I trust you on that.
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1646.02,1646.93,I might be wrong.
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1649.905,1677.29,"So -- so we are in the first part. Now, on that first part, it's a pretty odd statute that can say you don't have -- you -- we can keep you for two years, you know, or three, or four. You've just been out of jail, hey, your term is over. Your punishment's over, but you've got four more years here of punishment while we try to get to stage two, which is called the removal order."
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1711.96,1712.36,Okay.
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1723.7,1723.93,Yeah.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1723.93,1733.56,"-- of the appendix to the petition, the statute starts out 1226(a) that, ""The alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed"" --"
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1733.56,1733.98,May.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1734.04,1745.15,"-- ""from the United States."" But then -- it does say ""may"" there, but then it says, ""Except as provided in Subsection C of the section and pending such decision, the Attorney General may continue"" --"

2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1745.53,1754.19,"But it says ""except for Subsection C,"" and then Subsection C is the one that says, unambiguously, ""Shall be taken into custody and released only if."""
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1754.19,1756.049,C is the criminals.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1758.94,1759.595,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1759.595,1759.86,Okay.
2016.15-1204,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1763.055,1763.96,All right.
2016.15-1204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1765.515,1771.215,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Arulanantham."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,1771.215,1785.945,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I actually think the dispute between the parties is narrower than it seems based on what my friend, Acting Solicitor General, has just said, because we agree that length by itself doesn't make detention unconstitutional."
2016.15-1204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1799.525,1807.82,"Are you making a statutory argument? And the Ninth Circuit's decision was based on the -- an interpretation of the statute, wasn't it?"
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,1807.82,1808.21,Yes.
2016.15-1204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1808.39,1811.68,So are you making a statutory argument or are you making a constitutional argument?
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,1811.68,1814.5,We are making both. Section one makes the constitutional argument.
2016.15-1204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1828.98,1835.19,"Well, I understand that. But to me, at least, it makes a difference whether we're interpreting the statute or whether we're interpreting the Constitution."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,1835.19,1835.79,It -- it --
2016.15-1204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1835.79,1844.335,"And I'll tell you, on the language of the statute, I think you have a pretty tough -- you have a pretty tough argument."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,1844.335,1856.05,"Your Honor, we concede that as to 1226(c), the -- what you're calling the criminal or mandatory detention subclass, we have to win that there is a serious constitutional problem because their interpretation is not -- I mean, they're completely unreasonable --"
2016.15-1204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1856.05,1860.54,"Well, you can't -- you're -- is that a constitutional argument or a statutory argument?"
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,1860.54,1861.03,"Well, if there's an alien --"
2016.15-1204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1861.03,1868.85,"Constitutional avoidance isn't just sort of, well, we really don't think we can interpret the statute this way, but we don't have the guts to say that it's unconstitutional."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,1873.4,1873.89,"Well, I think --"
2016.15-1204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1873.89,1875.83,-- is what it means -- this is what it means.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,1875.83,1882.69,"Understood, Your Honor. But we think that the constitutional -- the statutory interpretation here is no less plausible than the one in Zadvydas."
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1890.74,1892.63,"What do you do with ""only if""?"
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,1892.63,1895.19,"Well, ""only if"" applies to the initial detention."
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1916.96,1921.99,"You've got most -- most -- Zadvydas turned on the ""may,"" you see."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,1949.095,1964.96,"Understood, Your Honor. I -- I only want to say one more thing about the statute, because I -- I don't want to belabor the point. But five months -- four months after the Zadvydas decision, Congress passed the Patriot Act. The Patriot Act didn't only -- it clearly authorized long-term detention in six-month intervals; it said six months."
2016.15-1204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2023.645,2033.67,"So are you saying that 1226(a), the Patriot Act provision, makes the government's interpretation of 1226(c) superfluous?"
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2033.67,2046.57,"Yes, as to terrorism cases, as to all the terrorism cases, that is cases where a person is inadmissible or deportable on a terrorism ground, they already had on their view more authority in 1996 than Congress gave them --"
2016.15-1204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2046.57,2073.56,"Well, there -- there are different -- there are quite noticeable differences between the two provisions, so I don't know how far this argument can go. For one thing, the -- the list of -- in 1226(a) -- (a) -- (a)(3)(A), there are listed one, two, three, four, five, six categories, and four of those are not included in the Patriot Act provision; isn't that right?"
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2073.56,2076.26,"That's true, but the terrorism grounds are invoked."
2016.15-1204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2076.26,2076.62,That's one thing --
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2076.62,2080.715,And the Patriot Act presumably did -- meant to focus on terrorism.
2016.15-1204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2080.715,2081.475,Yes.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2118.41,2118.77,Yes.
2016.15-1204,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2131.97,2135.705,Can I ask about your statutory interpretation on 1225?
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2135.705,2137.05,"Yes, please, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2137.05,2147.98,"That's the one where it says, the alien shall be detained for, and then one provision says, for further consideration of the application for asylum, and the other says, for a removal proceeding."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2158.03,2165.27,It's 1226(a) which says the Attorney General may detain or may release pending a decision on whether the alien --
2016.15-1204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2165.27,2166.14,It's really not interpreting.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2172.995,2174.61,"It does not, Your Honor. I would hope --"
2016.15-1204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2174.61,2176.02,That's your interpretation.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2176.02,2176.55,No.
2016.15-1204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2207.44,2214.66,"As I under -- as I understood, here the -- the authority ends once the proceeding begins, then you go to 1226."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2214.66,2215.99,"That's right, then you go to 1226(a)"
2016.15-1204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2217.91,2220.44,It seems to me that's a very odd interpretation for the statute.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2220.44,2235.4,"Well, Your Honor, the other argument for that interpretation is that the government already provides bond hearings to people detained under cover of that same statute that you're talking about, the one that says, you shall be detained for further consideration of the asylum application."
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2272.31,2275.65,What happens -- what happens if they present themselves at the border --
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2275.65,2276.02,Then --
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2276.02,2282.45,"-- or the desert, and they say, I have a right to live in the United States? You've made a mistake in respect to me."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2284.325,2290.78,"If you're -- if you're crossed in the desert, you get a bond hearing at -- assuming that you establish -- I mean, you could be summarily moved, but if you --"
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.78,2292.55,"But, of course, I say I don't want to leave."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2294.52,2295.11,Right.
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2299.23,2301.39,What happens if you're at the border and you come up and you --
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2301.39,2302.4,You don't get a bond hearing.
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.9,2318.82,"And what's the language of the statute that you believe the government points to, to say you never get a bond hearing?"
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2318.82,2321.39,"I mean, it says, shall be detained for, as Justice Kennedy said."
2016.15-1204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2370.88,2374.77,You mean cannot as a -- as a practical matter as opposed to a legal matter?
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2374.77,2376.16,"Yes, Your Honor, no suspension problem here."
2016.15-1204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2423.33,2424.12,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2429.085,2429.54,No.
2016.15-1204,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2459.52,2464.69,But suppose the Due Process Clause requires something a little bit more complex than a simple date.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2476.75,2481.605,"Well, I still think the vehicle would be this case, and I don't think the fact that it's a class action is a barrier to that."
2016.15-1204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2509.49,2515.28,"Well, that seems to me to be a strong argument against using the class action as a vehicle to resolve these questions."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2522.37,2531.085,"So let me give a procedural and a substantive answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice. The government did not seek cert on class cert."
2016.15-1204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2540.86,2565.53,"Well, but the decision of the Ninth Circuit was based on interpretation of this statute, and you want to go -- you want to -- you want to affirm on an alternative ground, which is that it's unconstitutional, so I don't know how far you can get with that argument. But we could -- if you want to be very strict about what's before us, we could simply say the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the statute is wrong and remand for further proceedings to the Ninth Circuit."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2565.53,2566.0,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2573.48,2578.675,But -- and it would also be consistent with the way the Ninth Circuit interpreted the case and the case that's here.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2582.31,2593.985,"We've argued it in Section I of our brief, but you're correct that the Ninth Circuit didn't rule on a constitutional ground. Absolutely, Your Honor. The second point I want to make, though, is everybody in the class, in our view, is entitled to an inquiry."
2016.15-1204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2613.76,2633.23,"Does that represent a typical remedy in habeas to require inquiries in every case? Perhaps I'm wrong, but I would have thought habeas is either you can be detained or you can't be detained, as opposed to a procedural across-the-board requirement of a hearing."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2633.23,2634.58,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2653.92,2658.97,So tell me why the regulations under 1226(a) are inadequate.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2675.995,2682.77,"I mean, we have very few quarrels with the 1226(a) regulations that govern people who are entitled to bond hearings."
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2689.585,2691.2,"Well, standing on its own --"
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2691.2,2691.29,Right.
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2691.48,2696.095,-- those aliens -- those aliens who have been here for a long time but didn't commit a crime.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2696.095,2696.88,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2738.12,2742.345,Why are those arguments not available in the administrative process?
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2742.345,2744.49,They are available under 1226(a)
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2748.11,2749.765,I'm looking just at that statute.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2749.765,2750.02,Yes.
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2750.02,2757.74,"I know you want to look at 1225 and 1226(c), but I'm looking just at 1226(a)."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2757.74,2759.05,Yes.
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2779.39,2782.83,Periodic review of long-term detentions under 1226(a).
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2782.83,2784.21,"Correct, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2784.21,2792.4,"But you're not -- you're not arguing that they have to be, like the Ninth Circuit said, a court review."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2795.17,2795.86,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2813.07,2818.165,But you're not -- you're not -- you wouldn't be quarrelling if it was an immigration judge.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2818.165,2819.04,"Yeah, absolutely not."
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2822.235,2824.075,And that's not what exists today?
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2824.075,2824.73,Correct.
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2833.84,2836.95,I'm trying to concentrate on 1226(a).
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2836.95,2837.64,"Okay, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2837.64,2840.235,What's wrong with the administrative process?
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2840.235,2840.86,For --
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2840.86,2843.74,As it exists today.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2843.74,2882.65,"Only that the burden of proof, in our view, should be clear and convincing on the government and that there should be a periodic hearing, or, as Your Honor had suggested, if you take -- make them say the length of detention is a relevant factor so that you can get a new hearing just based on the fact that the time has passed, that would help. But to be clear, Your Honor, well over half of this class is not under 1226(a) now; right? So we'd have to win -- for it to be meaningful relief for the vast majority of people, we'd also have to win that when detention becomes prolonged, the regulations that govern 1226(a) then come to govern the -- both the arrivings and the people who --"
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2882.65,2885.8,That -- that's pretty hard to do with 1226(c) --
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2885.8,2887.57,So then --
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2887.57,2891.1,-- when 1226(a) says this applies to everything but.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2892.87,2893.11,Okay.
2016.15-1204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2971.18,2976.06,Do you think that the flight risk and danger to the community are both continuums?
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,2976.06,2985.74,"Yes, Your Honor, but I think it has to be reasonably related to the detention. So -- excuse me, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2985.74,3015.65,"Well, so if you have the situation where the person is litigating in -- for -- in a -- there has been lengthy litigation, but the judge can't say this is done in bad faith or it's dilatory, it's just very lengthy and it keeps going on and on and on and on, and then you have a flight risk that's someplace on this scale and you have a risk to the community that's someplace on this scale, how can you address how something like that can come out -- should come out with any kind of a categorical role?"
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3015.65,3020.15,So we don't advocate how that person -- releasing that person on a categorical rule.
2016.15-1204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3031.855,3039.49,You do say -- or the Ninth Circuit says there has to be clear and convincing evidence which is higher than the flight risk standard in a standard bail case.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3039.49,3042.775,"It is, Your Honor. Although, remember, these are only hearings happening after six months."
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3046.02,3047.58,Is this -- is this -- right.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3075.745,3076.62,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3076.62,3086.29,"Well, how can that -- I don't get that, because what it says is ""may"" throughout, until you get to the word ""shall be detained for a proceeding under Section 1229(a)""; is that right?"
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3086.29,3087.49,That's correct.
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3087.49,3089.17,So I look up Section 1229(a)
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3115.14,3116.28,"I mean, that's --"
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3116.28,3116.915,What did they say?
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3116.915,3118.19,That's our statutory argument.
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3130.82,3133.555,So it's the regulations; it's not the statute.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3155.225,3155.64,"Yes, sir."
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3155.64,3155.73,Okay.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3200.3,3200.66,Yes.
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3200.66,3207.585,But I haven't heard from you yet what I -- I see no way -- if you want to tell me -- I see no way of getting around the 90 days.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3212.74,3215.75,"So, Your Honor, those people -- I won't indulge you with disagreement except --"
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3215.75,3215.91,Good.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3215.91,3218.36,-- on this one point: Those people are not in our class.
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3218.83,3219.81,You are -- you are not worried on a --
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3219.81,3220.29,We are not worried.
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3220.83,3221.02,Okay.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3224.41,3224.78,Correct.
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3224.78,3243.23,"-- the 90 days starts, they say, well, gee, shouldn't we -- shouldn't there be an exception here so that the period between the time they are released from their punishment to the time we have the hearing, if that goes on for 10 years, you know, you can't -- the person was supposed to be punished for six months, not for 10 years."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3243.23,3243.57,Yes.
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3243.84,3245.37,I got your argument.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3245.37,3245.69,That's right.
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3245.69,3248.33,"But I want to know, what do I do with the language?"
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3248.33,3248.61,Right.
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3248.61,3251.45,"And -- and -- and the -- the -- you know, language counts."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3251.45,3251.64,Yes.
2016.15-1204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3251.64,3252.05,So I --
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3252.05,3252.52,Yes.
2016.15-1204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3277.52,3280.9,"Well, the court below didn't reach your constitutional argument, right?"
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3280.9,3281.775,"It did not, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3281.775,3284.385,"Well, do you expect us to do it in the first instance?"
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3284.385,3288.84,"There's a voluminous record, and it's entirely briefed, but certainly the Court could."
2016.15-1204,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3290.51,3301.7,"I'm a little bit surprised that you answered the question that way, because it seems to me that it's quite obvious what the court below thinks as to the constitutional question where did they get this from, except as an understanding of what the Constitution required."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3301.7,3302.57,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3304.18,3307.11,"Well, maybe they didn't have the courage of their convictions."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3314.49,3323.99,"Your Honor, I won't pretend to understand what was in the heads of the -- the Ninth Circuit judges, except that they had seen prolonged detention problems for years."
2016.15-1204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3377.96,3385.71,So why is the Zadvydas -- this went -- the Ninth Circuit remedy went a lot further than Zadvydas did.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3393.725,3397.665,"But, Your Honor, it's requiring -- Zadvydas requires release."
2016.15-1204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3477.78,3482.43,"Of course, the problem is that that looks an awful lot like drafting a statute or a regulation."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3497.625,3512.89,"Your Honor, I think it's not that different from what the Court did in a number of cases, in Riverside v. McLaughlin, in Schnackenberg, where the Court said six months is the maximum time that you can go to prison without a jury trial. Now, here, it's just a similar kind of administrable rule."
2016.15-1204,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3513.88,3516.02,"An administrable constitutional rule, you're saying."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3516.02,3516.16,Yeah.
2016.15-1204,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3517.43,3520.54,We're not making up a statute; we're devising a constitutional limit.
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3520.54,3522.04,"Correct, Your Honor. These are all administrable --"
2016.15-1204,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3522.04,3522.47,So we're beyond --
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3522.47,3523.92,-- rules of the Constitution I'm talking about.
2016.15-1204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3527.44,3528.13,"Well, just let me make sure."
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3546.2,3565.14,"The -- the cases that we cite in our brief are all constitutional administratable rules that have been -- got into effect, the ones that I was mentioning. I actually thought that there was a colorable claim that, because Congress specifically authorized six months of detention, prolonged detention in national security cases, you could actually read the statute that way."
2016.15-1204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3575.72,3578.24,"Well, you get a few extra minutes too. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1204,1,62774,ahilan_t_arulanatham,,3578.24,3578.6,Thank you.
2016.15-1204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3654.785,3658.475,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, General Gershengorn."
2016.15-1204,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3658.475,3660.81,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-1204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3750.22,3753.94,"Well, I wasn't -- I wasn't thinking of necessarily asylum seeker."
2016.15-1204,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3802.455,3827.315,"So, Your Honor, the position of the government is that that individual would have an individualized as-applied challenge in a habeas proceeding, but that is not what should drive the statutory interpretation, which is principally what we are talking about here. And not only is it correct -- is that correct for the reasons Justice Kennedy suggested about his -- his Christmas visit, but that has been the interpretation of the statute -- of -- of that language in the statute since 1917."
2016.15-1204,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3839.65,3841.35,"It's odd language, though, General."
2016.15-1204,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3845.72,3846.16,And that's the --
2016.15-1204,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3846.16,3851.305,And they didn't say that. They said for the consideration of an asylum application.
2016.15-1204,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3854.38,3857.05,"And that's precisely, Your Honor, why I wanted to invoke the history."
2016.15-1204,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3893.82,3898.085,What gives you the right to parole?
2016.15-1204,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3898.085,3904.1,"There is 1182(d)(5) is separate parole authority, and the -- the government's -- I'll just finish up with this."
2016.15-1204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3911.7,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
