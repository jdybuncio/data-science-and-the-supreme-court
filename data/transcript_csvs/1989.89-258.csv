1989.89-258,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.272,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-258, California v. American Stores Company."
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,11.808,14.926,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-258,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.077,228.631,"Well, Mr. Horn, I guess the argument made by the other side in part is that at the time Congress considered this question and adopted the statute we are asked to examine, that there was generally regarded that there was a distinction between prohibitory injunctive relief and injunctive relief that required mandatory action, the so-called affirmative injunction."
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,239.356,247.36,We agree with American Stores that in 1914 the distinction between prohibitory and mandatory injunctive relief was well understood by the Congress.
1989.89-258,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.137,298.645,"Now, Mr. Horn, the... the order here was one to hold and operate the stores separately, in effect."
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,302.863,304.132,"--Well, we don't think so."
1989.89-258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.772,321.76,But that order has no purpose unless the court has the power to order divestiture.
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,337.603,338.736,--It does preserve the divestiture.
1989.89-258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.805,340.822,And has no other purpose.
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,340.822,341.572,I disagree.
1989.89-258,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.026,383.482,But the question you raised in your certiorari petition is whether divestiture is within the provision for injunctive relief in Clayton Act Section 16.
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,383.482,401.026,"That is correct, Justice Rehnquist, and that is the issue that we present because we do agree that one of the purposes of the district court's preliminary injunction was to preserve the divestiture remedy, and we believe that the divestiture remedy falls squarely within the authorizing language of Section 16 of the Clayton Act."
1989.89-258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.128,405.33,Do we know that that was one of the things that the district court had in mind?
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,405.33,433.147,"I think we can fairly assume that because of the district court's discussion of the effect of the Federal Trade Commission's hold separate order from its tentative consent agreement and final approval, because Judge Kenyon said in his opinion that he was... it would be a matter of verbal calisthenics to call this a completed merger which could not be prevented by effective injunctive relief at the permanent injunction stage following trial."
1989.89-258,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,442.103,453.161,"Let me, before you leave this preliminary point, you did preserve a second question in your cert. petition which I thought raised the question whether, on its own merits, the whole separate order could be sustained."
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,467.488,468.038,I think that is right.
1989.89-258,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.414,488.068,"We... you petitioned on two questions, but I had thought we only granted on the first question."
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,497.424,502.078,"--I understand that, Justice Rehnquist, but the petition presented two questions."
1989.89-258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.209,535.299,"Don't you think you should have done that in your first brief, just out of courtesy to the respondents so they could have had a shot at it, too?"
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,548.857,551.624,"--Well, if anyone was misled we certainly apologize."
1989.89-258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.962,561.866,"You don't mention it in your statement of the question presented, and you don't mention it in your... in your principal brief."
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,564.651,581.411,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that it's... that it is also an issue which is fairly subsumed even with the divestiture issue which we did discuss, because the Ninth Circuit, in its opinion in this case, concluded that even the preliminary injunction mandating a temporary hold separate also amounted to divestiture under--"
1989.89-258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.411,587.684,"I agree it is subsumed, but to say it is subsumed is not to say it need not be argued."
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,587.684,600.507,"--Well, I think all of the principles which we will... which we did argue and are arguing today, that divestiture is available or applicable to the indivestiture portion of the Ninth Circuit's holding below and in ITT."
1989.89-258,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,703.809,714.098,"Well, they argue that the language of the statute, of course, is that the relief can be obtained against threatened loss or damages."
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,714.098,715.699,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-258,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,715.699,720.686,Which could be interpreted as looking to the future.
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,720.686,733.328,"Clearly it does look to the future, because it is the future injury, but it is not limited to injury which flows only from future acts or from future violations, which is the next step of American Stores' argument."
1989.89-258,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,793.467,803.09,"One of the arguments that the respondents make is that Section 15, giving authority to the Federal Government, is cast in different and they say broader language than Section 16."
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,804.99,807.876,My first response is that it is not broader language.
1989.89-258,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.395,844.434,So your suggestion is that... what was Congress' purpose in putting the authority of the Federal Government in different language than that of the private people?
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,844.434,854.857,"--The principal reason for it is because Section 16, by conferring a private remedy, needed to import a standing limit, and that is why we have threatened injury."
1989.89-258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.223,973.517,"Excuse me, Mr. Horn, suppose... suppose an acquisition had occurred 20 years ago that forms a new corporation that would be in violation of the Clayton Act."
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,979.754,995.966,"--I think... I think that the answer is there would be a cause of action, but whether... the question whether it could survive the challenges that would be made under recognized equitable principles such as Laches, clean hands and the rest, would be extraordinarily difficult in that case."
1989.89-258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.966,998.167,"Well, it's a monopolized market."
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1006.071,1022.2,"Well, if the specific individual bringing that suit 20 years later could show that he first began to feel the effects of the behavior that that merger conferred on the offending firm, then I think he would be entitled to bring the case at that time."
1989.89-258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1037.377,1050.0,"But you are obliged to argue, in order to sustain your case, that whenever there is an acquisition that violates the act, it is a continuing violation that extends indefinitely into the future."
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1078.37,1080.921,"I don't think it is necessary, but I happen to agree that that is correct."
1989.89-258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.555,1082.138,Why isn't it necessary?
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1096.248,1098.533,--The acquisition has happened.
1989.89-258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1116.612,1125.6,"You, you think that what the court under Section 16 is supposed to enjoin is not the violation but the loss?"
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1138.325,1141.794,"I don't see how you can read the statute that way, Justice Scalia, with respect."
1989.89-258,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1174.331,1198.899,"So, in light of your answer that the period of time that elapses is irrelevant, I take it then it is unimportant, other than for the way it may bear on the equities and the court's discretion, it is unimportant that the operational aspects of this merger had not taken effect?"
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1198.899,1204.802,I think it is unimportant to the specific question whether a district court has the power to decree divestiture.
1989.89-258,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1222.597,1225.882,"Well, how does that aspect of your argument work?"
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1232.203,1234.322,"No, I don't think you do look to the Delaware law."
1989.89-258,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1238.44,1240.726,"Well, it controls when the merger was effective."
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1256.485,1272.078,"I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, because the only thing that the Delaware law did was it enabled American... the short form merger provision under the Delaware law did was it enabled American Stores to acquire the stock which had not been tendered by the Lucky shareholders."
1989.89-258,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1321.994,1330.866,"Suppose there had been no hold separate order, but the operational aspects of the merger just hadn't taken effect yet?"
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1337.27,1338.889,--Yes.
1989.89-258,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1338.889,1340.222,So what is it that we look to?
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1342.774,1346.911,"Well, in the question of whether divestiture is available, I think that is not a relevant inquiry."
1989.89-258,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1355.065,1358.719,"But I am asking, assuming we disagree with you on that point."
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1358.719,1365.288,Then I think they would have had to have complete the operational aspects in order to preclude us from divestiture.
1989.89-258,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1365.288,1369.657,Is there any authority to guide us in that area?
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1369.657,1374.578,I don't think there is any authority which has specifically addressed that question.
1989.89-258,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1439.754,1449.459,"Mr. Horn, what if the merger... a merger has taken place and years later a private plaintiff comes in and seeks divestiture?"
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1449.459,1455.113,"Then I think that is very much like the ITT case, which was the genesis of this rule."
1989.89-258,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1469.856,1476.01,"Well, what are the standards in your view for the private plaintiff to get a divestiture order?"
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1476.01,1484.466,--I think the standards are whether or not divestiture is the relief necessary to prevent the harm caused by the violation.
1989.89-258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1498.459,1507.898,"Mr. Horn, I don't want to take your time looking for it, but when you get back up will you tell me where in your reply brief you preserve the, or you argue the point about a hold separate?"
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1509.948,1510.683,--I'll be glad to do that.
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1510.683,1511.167,Thank you.
1989.89-258,0,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,1511.167,1512.317,Thank you.
1989.89-258,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1512.317,1513.652,"Thank you, Mr. Horn."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1516.421,1522.575,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.193,1633.462,"Yes, but Mr. Lee, the government doesn't have to show injury to itself."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1633.462,1637.531,--But it does have to show some kind of injury.
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1637.531,1642.067,But it doesn't have to show... it doesn't have the standing problem that a private litigant has.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1642.067,1643.083,That is correct.
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1652.023,1656.743,"But you know, the separate language, it was interesting to me that neither side quoted Section 15 in the brief."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1660.612,1661.147,"Oh, but there is."
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.147,1663.264,Section 15 talks about prevent and restrain also.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1663.264,1664.349,The difference is this.
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1669.301,1669.837,Not the whole section.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1669.837,1670.353,That is correct.
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1672.789,1674.489,You just quote the jurisdictional language.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1675.289,1677.741,I guess it was just because we were up against the page limits.
1989.89-258,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1689.464,1691.25,As opposed to injunctive relief.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1691.25,1698.004,"--As opposed to, on the other hand, injunctive relief, and then there are two important qualifiers."
1989.89-258,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1707.843,1713.33,"Well, the private plaintiff has to show antitrust injury, I suppose."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1713.33,1720.852,"--Yes, but the language really goes beyond just requiring that he show antitrust injury."
1989.89-258,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1727.256,1727.823,You are reading at 16 now?
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1727.823,1731.927,"--Yes, in 16, and it is printed in the petitioner's brief."
1989.89-258,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1754.457,1759.327,"Yes, but Mr. Lee, you rely heavily on a distinction between prohibitory and mandatory injunctions."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1765.464,1769.683,Just the fact that the difference in language--
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1769.683,1771.618,The language is to prevent and restrain.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1771.618,1772.518,--That is correct.
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1772.518,1775.654,And you think that clearly authorizes a mandatory injunction?
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1775.654,1779.808,"Well, what it talks about is equitable proceedings or equitable relief."
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1779.808,1783.41,But the relief that can be granted is to prevent and restrain.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1783.41,1784.043,That is correct.
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1784.043,1790.164,"And that is the language you say clearly differentiates one section from the other, and one allows mandatory and the other does not."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1790.164,1791.366,Well--
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1791.366,1794.818,"Well, it may... they may be different, but I am not sure which way it leans."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1804.006,1823.235,"--Well, except that the mandatory-prohibitory distinction also looks toward a difference between conduct, behavior, things that people do, on the one hand, and structure on the other, referring back to Justice Scalia's hypothetical about the corporation that has been in existence."
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1855.689,1865.08,"Well, but does that mean there is no jurisdiction to dissolve a patent pool, for example, or to require the stock exchange to change its regulations and require fair hearings and that sort of thing?"
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1865.08,1867.08,"Let me say two things in that respect, Justice Stevens."
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1989.126,1990.426,Let me just be sure I understand you.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2005.686,2006.252,Excuse me.
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2027.949,2030.282,"Well, what is your position... I am not really sure I understand you."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2046.344,2057.099,"Well, I cannot see any instance in which prohibitory relief would not be adequate to prevent any offenses--"
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.099,2057.9,"Well, that's not an answer to my question."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2057.9,2059.551,--by a patent pool.
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.551,2065.538,"All you're saying is it is prohibitory relief to... you just, you enjoin the continuance of the patent pool."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2065.538,2065.922,That's right.
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.757,2068.524,"Well, that is just a play on words, isn't it?"
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2075.846,2084.036,"--The Ninth Circuit has acknowledged that there is the power to enjoin the actual acts, the symptomatic relief."
1989.89-258,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.821,2090.623,"Excuse me, where--"
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2090.623,2094.141,"In the merger case, to actually dissolve the structure itself."
1989.89-258,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.141,2103.68,"--With a patent pool, Mr. Lee, isn't there a continuing agreement, which is what the... you know, what the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act are ultimately directed against."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2108.151,2109.201,And you simply prohibit--
1989.89-258,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.201,2110.284,That is the violation.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2112.436,2113.053,--That is correct.
1989.89-258,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.053,2118.923,"But when there has been an acquisition of a company, there's no further agreement that is keeping that acquisition in effect."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2120.725,2121.225,Exactly.
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2121.225,2125.779,What about an injunction against continuing to vote the stock of the subsidiary?
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2125.779,2129.148,"Well, as far as... well, I think that is different."
1989.89-258,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2145.507,2146.209,You could.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2156.932,2159.084,That is pretty close to divestiture.
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.084,2175.16,"Well, a year after a merger takes place, a plaintiff who thinks he has been hurt by the merger that he thinks violated antitrust laws can sue and get some damages, I suppose, if he can prove antitrust injury."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2175.16,2175.795,Of course he can.
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.795,2185.151,And I suppose then that the day after the merger there is or was threatened loss or injury.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2185.151,2186.784,"That is correct, and those also can be--"
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.784,2198.809,And you say that he can't get an injunction... he can't sue to get an injunction the day after the merger on account of the threatened loss or injury?
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2198.809,2208.35,"--Well, he can get an injunction to sue against threatened loss of injury, and he can sue on account of conduct."
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2210.067,2230.363,"Well, can't he... I take it you say though that even though he can prove the day after the merger that he is really threatened with loss or injury, you cannot avoid... you cannot get an injunction to avoid that loss or injury by getting a divestiture order."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2230.363,2233.898,--By... strictly from the existence of the--
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2233.898,2234.584,Loss or injury.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2234.584,2235.6,--of the--
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2235.6,2236.917,You have to wait to get hurt.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2236.917,2238.719,--That is correct.
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.171,2245.706,You must wait to be put out of business.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2245.706,2248.158,"--Not wait to be put out of business, but wait for--"
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.158,2250.26,"Well, why, you do have to wait."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2264.186,2274.125,"--What you can get an injunction against is specific practices, such as improper pricing, perhaps even undue concentration in the--"
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2274.125,2286.933,"Well... well on that basis you will say, on that basis you would say the merger just isn't illegal, unless you get some other injury."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2286.933,2289.052,--I am not sure I understand.
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.052,2306.346,"Well, you... I would think if, even a year later then, that he would have some trouble recovering, unless he proves some special practices that occurred from the merger."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2306.346,2307.846,That is correct.
1989.89-258,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2308.382,2316.202,"Could the state have gotten an injunction, a prohibitory injunction before the merger took place?"
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2316.202,2322.106,--Then... then it would have been... then they would have been enjoining conduct.
1989.89-258,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2325.642,2331.312,"But some of these distinctions are really a little bit evanescent, I think."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2355.011,2374.425,"Well, I think both of them, Mr. Chief Justice, are helpful, and the conduct-structure distinction is one that is most clearly demonstrated not only by the language, because it does talk about conduct, but also by the legislative history."
1989.89-258,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2400.308,2412.533,"Well, there is a distinction, perhaps, between dissolution and other divestiture orders, and maybe, maybe you have put your finger on what it was that really bothered the legislators."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2418.354,2422.138,"That is the argument that our opponents make, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-258,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2492.668,2494.937,But that was a massive divestiture in Standard Oil.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2502.174,2503.292,That is correct.
1989.89-258,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2523.054,2535.495,My point was that one could have described the Standard Oil decree as dissolution without feeling it would necessarily embrace a much smaller divestiture.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2535.495,2539.966,"--Possibly, except that though... the only difference was the scale."
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2575.222,2577.841,How was it acquired?
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2577.841,2585.744,"I'm not sure that the opinion discloses that, Justice White, whether it by stock or asset acquisition."
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.744,2586.613,What was it here?
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2586.613,2587.363,Excuse me?
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.363,2589.565,What was it here?
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2592.35,2597.218,"How did... oh, in this case it was a stock acquisition."
1989.89-258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.312,2611.645,All right.
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2611.645,2623.619,And what Judge Hand said was that this simply wasn't an injunction suit within the scope of Section 16.
1989.89-258,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2638.479,2663.196,"Well, Mr. Lee, in your view the acquisition of control that would amount to an antitrust violation of another company, if it has been completed, could never be attacked in court by a private plaintiff or by the state acting under the same statute, if it has already occurred."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2663.196,2663.746,That is correct.
1989.89-258,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2663.746,2673.635,"And, of course, most of these things are handled before the state or a private person would know it is going to take place."
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2677.354,2681.924,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, and let me say a couple of things in that respect."
1989.89-258,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2682.724,2684.543,You don't think that is what Congress had in mind?
1989.89-258,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2684.543,2688.062,"--Oh, I have no... yes, I really do think that's what Congress had in mind."
1989.89-258,2,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,3206.684,3208.484,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-258,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3242.607,3245.392,Very subtle.
1989.89-258,2,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,3245.392,3246.926,Pardon?
1989.89-258,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3246.926,3253.748,That's a very subtle way of making the argument.
1989.89-258,2,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,3253.748,3273.293,"In response to several questions from several justices, I think it is fair to say that American Stores agrees that this Court has decided, in cases like Zenith and Silver, that affirmative injunctive relief is available under Section 16 of the Clayton Act."
1989.89-258,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.188,3353.161,So you think the big debate was just a lot of hot air before the Congress about whether private parties should have the power to dissolve a combination?
1989.89-258,2,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,3353.161,3356.363,"--No, I don't think that was a lot of hot air at all, Justice White."
1989.89-258,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3358.749,3364.236,"Well, you could say well that's a prohibitory injunction, continuing to have the combination."
1989.89-258,2,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,3364.236,3376.777,"--But the debate in the Congress in the early stages of the hearings before the Clayton subcommittee did not speak to the difference between prohibitory and mandatory relief, except with a minor exchange where he was urging that mandatory relief ought to be available."
1989.89-258,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3414.531,3414.967,To dissolve a monopoly.
1989.89-258,2,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,3414.967,3416.017,And that is precisely right.
1989.89-258,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3461.579,3479.307,"Well, that may be... that may be the case, but if you say that Section 16 doesn't give authority to dissolve a trust, how come it gives authority to order divestiture that's in... that violates Section 7?"
1989.89-258,2,27196,h_chester_horn_jr,,3479.307,3482.342,--I don't say that Section 16 doesn't give authority to violate the trust.
1989.89-258,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3491.181,3491.515,Okay.
1989.89-258,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3491.515,3492.098,"Thank you, Mr. Horn."
