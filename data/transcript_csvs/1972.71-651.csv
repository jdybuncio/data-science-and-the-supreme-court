1972.71-651,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.784,"We’ll hear arguments next in 71-651, California against Krivda and Minor."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,37.887,41.412,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-651,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,384.213,386.484,You mean it’s no longer theirs?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,386.484,387.496,It’s no longer theirs.
1972.71-651,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,388.164,391.374,"Well, I thought this was a possession prosecution?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,391.374,408.766,"Well, I think the question of possession -- I think that was raised in the opinion of the California Supreme Court in a footnote in California versus Krivda, but, I think that if we analyze, we are dealing with two separate matters here as to whether there’s sufficient evidence to convict and whether there is probable cause for arrest."
1972.71-651,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,420.28,420.549,We see -- there are many cases like that here.
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,420.549,423.833,-- that the bin with heroin -- yes.
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,505.929,516.563,"Would the case be any different if the barrels had been on the back porch, where the trash collectors had to go through the property across the front lawn to get them?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,516.563,519.442,I think that the case might be fundamentally different under those circumstances.
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,519.442,520.503,"Why, why?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,520.503,530.04,I think there may be a protection with the areas immediately around the house for the protection of the -- these contents.
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,531.187,535.845,In that circumstance putting the trash in the barrel would not be abandonment?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,535.845,545.386,"Well, I think it would be possibly and I think that it would show an abandonment, but I think that there we would have a conflicting situation."
1972.71-651,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,566.433,568.997,That’s because of the protection given to his home.
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,568.997,569.45,That would be correct.
1972.71-651,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,569.45,570.15,Is that correct?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,570.15,570.287,Under --
1972.71-651,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,570.287,583.039,"And it’s adversely true if a -- something in a waste basket inside of his living room, he might have abandon it, conditionally at least, but the reason that’s protected is because his home is protected, does that connect with your point?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,583.039,586.042,"That would be the way I would distinguish the case, yes Your Honor."
1972.71-651,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,595.348,598.588,"That was no longer Abel’s home, because he had given up the room."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,598.588,598.95,That’s -- that is a --
1972.71-651,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,598.95,621.538,"On the other hand, somebody’s property, I suppose, is protected even in such -- in another person’s home, isn’t that right on the Fourth Amendment, if I lend you a chattel -- have I got standing to object to an unlawful search of your home or that chattel is seized?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,621.538,624.838,"Not under the Alderman decision of this Court, I don’t believe Your Honor."
1972.71-651,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,628.48,635.653,"It’s my property, it’s my -- those are my effects that had been unlawfully searched for and seized."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,639.074,645.563,"But, I think there would be a question there as to whether you could raise an objection at that point to the unlawful seizure."
1972.71-651,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,662.037,675.894,"Well, you’ve read to us or you have quoted to us the language of the Fourth Amendment and it talks about a person’s effects and I might -- among my effects, I own three shotguns and I lend them to you to go hunting."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,683.571,702.091,"I would not think so Your Honor, because I think there again we’ve got a -- we have a question of a -- you have -- actually under those circumstances I think it would be the question of have you assumed the risk that possibly there would be an invasion of your privacy, where you would not be there to assert your own personal rights."
1972.71-651,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,702.091,704.154,"Well, this isn’t an invasion of my privacy."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,704.154,704.332,"Well, it’s an --"
1972.71-651,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,704.332,710.777,"It’s a seizure of my effects in an unlawful search and seizure, and that’s covered by the language of the Fourth Amendment, isn’t it?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,710.777,749.523,"Yes, but I think -- I don’t think that that -- that the coverage of your effects in that sense, I think there has to be some closer -- first, I think there’s -- it’s important to look in terms of the -- further of being secure in those effects, I think somehow your personal connection with the effects has to be manifest at the point to someone outside that they are your effects or that they’re likely to be the effects of someone other than the person who is in that particular dwelling and holding those particular chattels."
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,788.404,797.898,"Doesn’t -- didn’t the whole point, the other side that the man assumes that his garbage will not be turned over to the police."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,797.898,799.669,I don’t think that’s a reasonable assumption Mr. Justice Marshall?
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,799.669,800.792,Why not?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,800.792,803.735,Because I think that when a man abandons property --
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,803.735,806.512,"Well, the police was not in the garbage business."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,806.512,826.403,"Well, I don’t believe the police are in the garbage business, but on the other hand, I think the question has to be, does the man -- has the man exposed, as we speak of him as this Court has spoken of him in Katz, where he has exposed this particular material to the public, his privacy interest are in an end."
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,827.533,832.68,"But I would -- well, suppose the can was covered."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,832.68,837.25,I believe the can was in this case were originally covered.
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,837.25,842.902,"Well, don’t you think that he would assume that nobody would get in there?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,842.902,849.868,"I don’t believe so Your Honor, because it’s well-known that the garbage man himself is going to --"
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,849.868,850.251,Well in --
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,850.251,851.891,-- actually empty those cans --
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,851.891,852.449,"Well, where this --"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,852.449,854.303,-- possibly observe the contents.
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,854.303,856.774,"Well, what county this occurred in?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,856.774,858.588,It occurred in the City of Los Angeles.
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,858.588,862.63,"Well, how many times did the police examined garbage in Los Angeles?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,862.63,865.656,I don’t have the statistics and I was unable to locate any statistics on the number of times --
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,865.656,870.605,"Well, would -- I still say, couldn’t I assume that the police would not look into my garbage?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,870.605,882.043,"I don’t think it’s a question of whether you can assume if the police would not look into your garbage, because I think you could also assume that there’s a likelihood that the police would not search your house with or without a warrant."
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,893.62,902.364,I don’t know if any -- there is other act of privacy than have my garbage co-mingle with a thousand other people’s garbage.
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,902.364,910.322,"Well, I think what that proposition ultimately leads to is that we create a constitutional sanctuary for the disposal of evidence."
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,964.707,969.704,I don’t think we can decide this case without allowing somebody to hide a dead body?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,970.001,978.235,"Well, I don’t think that the -- I don’t think that there -- that most -- well, I don’t think --"
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,978.235,982.188,Why didn’t the police just look into the can themselves?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,982.188,993.529,"Well, I think that the police did not look in the can because they felt that perhaps if they were aware of the Edwards decision that that might violate -- well, that -- why did it -- they wanted to get it as far removed --"
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,993.529,994.323,(Inaudible)
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,994.323,1002.057,"Well, I don’t think that -- there is the possibility that if it were still on the curb, there might be a chance of it being within the curtilage."
1972.71-651,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1128.147,1139.823,"But counsel let me bring you back to your concession, I think it was, a little awhile ago that if these cans were on the back porch, the situation would be different."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1139.823,1140.825,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-651,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1141.538,1145.466,Who owns the curb on which these cans were standing?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1145.466,1149.639,"Well, I don’t believe it’s clear from the record in this case."
1972.71-651,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1213.796,1219.318,Are you saying that it is not abandoned on the back porch but it is abandoned on the curb?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1219.318,1223.526,"I am saying that -- yes, Your Honor, I am saying that."
1972.71-651,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1228.271,1243.428,"I thought you had responded to Justice Stewart by saying a -- yes, it’s abandoned even when it’s on the porch, but it’s still, in effect, in his house and therefore, protected by the explicit terms of the Constitution."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1243.428,1259.746,"Yes, I think I’ve made a slip of a tongue here, when I said that it was -- it is abandoned at the point it’s on the back porch, and that is my position, but there maybe some protection from the Fourth Amendment in the area around the house or connected with the house at that point."
1972.71-651,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1259.746,1266.266,"Also, I suppose, just to the factual inference, it might be more conditionally abandoned."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1280.651,1281.221,"Well, I don’t think --"
1972.71-651,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1281.221,1286.323,"Perhaps if it’s put far from the house, it’s unconditional."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1286.323,1295.841,"I would think so, I think that would distinguish the Ward case from this case, where there was an inference, possible inference of hiding something in a can, which differentiated in."
1972.71-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1296.693,1306.971,"Mr. Iungerich, are you going to address yourself sometime during your argument to the basis for the Supreme Court of California’s opinion as to whether it get -- did decide the case on a federal constitutional ground?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1306.971,1308.865,"Yes, Your Honor, I could do that now."
1972.71-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.865,1311.579,Just if you’re going to -- I was hoping you would come to it sometime during your argument.
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1311.579,1321.872,"Well, this question I think is fairly clear from the -- this goes to the argument that the respondent has made -- the certiorari has been improvidently granted, as I would understand you Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1972.71-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1322.947,1323.933,Yes.
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1323.933,1334.615,"Well, I think it’s clear from the opinion that they -- that the California Supreme Court rested its decision on the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and not upon any separate ground."
1972.71-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1368.492,1371.873,"This case came upon a motion to suppress, I take it."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1371.873,1372.465,"Well, --"
1972.71-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1372.465,1372.554,Did it?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1372.554,1375.024,"It was a -- yes, Mr. Justice White."
1972.71-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.024,1378.378,By and -- is a motion in the record?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1378.378,1384.446,The motion to suppress is -- the argument on the motion to suppress is not in the Appendix your Honor.
1972.71-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.446,1388.143,"What is the motion, was it an oral motion, speaking motion?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1388.143,1390.241,"Yes it was, Your Honor."
1972.71-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1390.241,1393.647,Isn’t there a transcript of what kind of a motion was made?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1393.647,1395.395,"Yes, it was a motion to suppress --"
1972.71-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.395,1396.81,On what ground?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1396.81,1400.453,"And, it was made on the ground that this was an unreasonable search and seizure -- there were actually --"
1972.71-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1400.453,1403.006,Under what?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1403.006,1405.726,"Under the Fourth Amendment, I believe."
1972.71-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1406.687,1414.2,"Well, don’t you think that’s rather -- don’t you think that’s rather important to know what issues were presented to the Court?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1414.2,1415.304,"Well, I think Your Honor, the question is --"
1972.71-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1415.304,1424.624,But what -- and what the Court was purporting to a -- State Court might well reach the state ground first if the state ground was presented to it.
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1424.624,1434.751,"Well, I don’t -- I don’t think that that is what Your Honor, what the opinions of this Court, Mr. Justice White, have indicated this Court looks out."
1972.71-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1440.626,1444.108,"Well, (Inaudible) in the motion."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1460.118,1467.676,"Yes, there was no transcript at the proceedings lodged, as far as I know with this Court."
1972.71-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1471.256,1481.838,"But, wouldn’t a typical motion to suppress made by a defense counsel in the Superior Court in California, raise both state federal grounds, if you’re talking about unreasonable search and seizures?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1481.838,1483.911,"Well, I don’t think necessarily they would."
1972.71-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1494.589,1500.921,"Well, the California Supreme Court has decided some search and seizure questions specifically under the California Constitution."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1500.921,1510.737,I don’t think there has ever been a California case that’s decided expressly that the case is determined under the California constitutional article on searches and seizures.
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1511.747,1513.688,Is it identical with the federal one?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1513.688,1522.712,"It’s identical with the federal one, Your Honor, but I don’t think there’s any case that said that specifically, the question --"
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1522.712,1531.877,"So that in this case if we rule the same way and give you all the relief you want, couldn’t California say, “Well, we’re doing on the state one.”"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1531.877,1536.091,"I think California could well predicate it further on state grounds, but I don’t think that’s a ground for --"
1972.71-651,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1536.091,1538.298,And what would you win then?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1538.298,1543.87,"Well, under the circumstances, we would have a clear ruling that it was not required under the Federal Constitution."
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1554.012,1565.407,"Well, didn’t your Supreme Court adopt the exclusionary rule and -- before we ever apply that in Mapp, under the --"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1565.407,1566.314,"Yes, the --"
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1566.314,1569.972,-- and didn't they do it under the -- under your cons -- state constitution --
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1569.972,1571.968,"No, they did not, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1583.566,1595.854,"Well, what about the difference between the standing rules in search and seizure cases that as announced by your Supreme Court and the federal rules?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1595.854,1616.17,"Yes, well most recently in the Caplan decision in 6th Cal 3rd, the California Court expressly relied, expressly stated and there’s a clear footnote in that opinion, which states that they do not reach the question of whether that standing rules required under Article 1, Section 19 of the California Constitution, they avoided the question entirely."
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1617.03,1618.369,What did they predicate it upon?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1618.369,1627.22,"They predicate it on the fact that they were relying on the -- that this rule had continued, since the Kahan days."
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1639.675,1650.744,"Now -- you’re comparable Fourth Amendment provision in the California Constitution, literally tracks it, that’s not identical in phraseology with the Fourth Amendment, isn’t it?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1650.744,1653.709,"It has a one liner difference, they’re virtually identical."
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1656.19,1666.182,"Now, you’re familiar I am sure with your Supreme Court’s opinion in the Serrano case, doesn’t involve this issue, but the tax case?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1666.182,1671.195,I am familiar with the case; I am not familiar with all the facts in the record in that matter Your Honor.
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1671.195,1701.869,"Now, I was thinking of the opinion, I noticed reading the opinion yesterday that while -- like this one, it’s all -- relies upon the federal constitutional decisions, decision of this Court, in reaching the conclusion to unequal protection grounds, you got to drop the footnote, which is said the question under the state constitution was raised and since the state constitution or provision is virtually the same, but we say here for the Federal Constitution goes for the state constitution."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1701.869,1705.426,"Well, I don’t think that that’s clear from the California decisions."
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1705.426,1706.075,In this case?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1706.075,1708.332,In this case and under the search and seizure question.
1972.71-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.858,1718.559,"Well, could I -- could we have the -- would it be possible to get that transcript from -- or some supplement that -- indicating what the motion was?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1718.559,1724.108,"Yes, I certain can, Your Honor, possibly be the end of the week, since it would be --"
1972.71-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1724.108,1724.391,Oh!
1972.71-651,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1725.401,1727.014,"Well, you supply that then?"
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1729.932,1741.73,"Now, and again, last term in the death penalty cases, the California Supreme Court clearly rested its decision in death penalty cases on the California Constitution, and said so, didn’t it?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1741.73,1742.277,"Yes, it did."
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1742.277,1745.8,"Well, is that the practice of that Court when it does it, to say so?"
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1745.8,1747.421,"I think it most certainly is, Your Honor."
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1752.883,1764.081,"And yet, it’s only a few years ago, I can’t remember the name of the case, we had to send one back to the California Supreme Court, because we couldn’t tell, reading its opinion whether it rested on a state or a federal constitutional grounds."
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1771.58,1774.049,"Well, I think we don’t have that ambiguity in this case."
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1774.269,1774.673,Why don’t we?
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1774.673,1777.818,"-- referring Mr. Justice Brennan to the Kirchner opinion, but I don’t think --"
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1777.818,1779.085,Kirchner is what I am referring to in here.
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1779.085,1784.068,"But I don’t think we have that same situation in this case, because there isn’t any ambiguity in this opinion."
1972.71-651,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1785.641,1790.097,It doesn’t read -- it reads to me much as Kirchner opinion did.
1972.71-651,0,39571,russell_iungerich,,1790.097,1803.487,I think the difference here is that the California -- Mr. Justice Burke expressly states in this opinion that he’s relying on California law only to the extent that it is compelled by Katz in the decisions of this Court.
1972.71-651,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1833.65,1835.216,Thank you.
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1838.253,1842.29,"Thank you Your Honor, Chief Justice Burger, may it please the Court."
1972.71-651,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1928.923,1930.692,"And Justice Burke wrote that opinion, did he?"
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1930.692,1935.907,"Yes, Justice Burke wrote that opinion and Justice Burke also wrote the Krivda opinion."
1972.71-651,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1966.877,1973.389,"Mr. Hanson, you contend I take it that’s patent that the Supreme Court of California relied on the state ground."
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1988.631,1990.699,"Well, I don’t think there’s any ambiguity --"
1972.71-651,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1990.699,1994.22,"Well, supposing we should conclude there is?"
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1994.22,1994.967,"Well, I suppose --"
1972.71-651,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1994.967,1996.297,"Well, that’s within Kirchner."
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1996.297,1999.386,That’s within the decisions of this Court but I just don’t see --
1972.71-651,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1999.386,2002.254,"But isn’t it -- Mr. Hanson, that just that we did it Kirchner."
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2002.254,2004.714,"Well, I’m not familiar with Kirchner, Your Honor, I’ll be honest with the Court."
1972.71-651,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2010.671,2018.659,"Well, there’s equally no question, I gather that not as overtly at least, Krivda, the Krivda opinion makes the reference to it."
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2018.659,2026.583,"I disagree with that, because it cites the exact paginations where this decision is found, 1104 and 1105 of 71 Cal 2d 1096."
1972.71-651,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2026.583,2027.385,I see.
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2027.385,2031.465,"I would appreciate the Court parous Pages 91, 92, 93 in my brief."
1972.71-651,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2033.952,2037.592,"And that incorporates those, the very discussion of it."
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2037.592,2038.057,"Very definitely, very definitely."

1972.71-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2043.481,2045.762,It’s the only way.
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2045.762,2046.127,I don’t see I could be --
1972.71-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2046.127,2049.4,"And, that that’s not necessary once that you cite the pages, isnt’ it your position?"
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2049.4,2051.351,"That’s correct, that’s correct."
1972.71-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.351,2052.255,Could I ask you?
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2055.536,2056.87,"Well, I was not trial counsel at that time."
1972.71-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.87,2058.695,Do you know -- have you read the record?
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2058.695,2060.179,"No, I haven’t."
1972.71-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.179,2064.206,You don’t know then whether the state ground was ever presented to the State Court.
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2064.206,2065.556,"No, I do not."
1972.71-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.743,2070.37,Let’s assume it was not.
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2070.37,2076.933,"Well, I don’t think that matters, I think it’s what the California Supreme Court decided in this case, and they decided that was illegal under the state constitution --"
1972.71-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.933,2085.911,"Well, I know you say, let’s -- you’re arguing that they did decide under the state constitution, and yet they didn’t say so expressly."
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2096.534,2097.301,I don’t think so.
1972.71-651,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2157.762,2177.673,"But isn’t that just the situation that obtained in Kirchner and obtained in Minnesota versus National Tea, this Court didn’t question the fact that the state could afford broader protection than the Federal Constitution, but we felt it was unclear, whether or not the state had felt compelled by the Federal Constitution or was acting under it’s own edges."
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2177.673,2193.918,"Well, all I can again certify to this Court is that in the Krivda opinion, it’s cited specifically, Pages 1104 and 1105 of the Edwards decision, which was very explicit on Article 1 or Section 1, Article XIX of California Constitution."
1972.71-651,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2273.259,2278.177,"Well, I thought the theory was only that it was circumstantial evidence of the fact that they did have possession."
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2278.177,2279.573,"Well, surely that’s correct."
1972.71-651,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2279.573,2283.688,Not that they still possessed it when it was in the garbage can.
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2283.688,2289.915,"All right, very well, but the question is, are they concerned as to what happens to it and who thereafter may get a hold of it?"
1972.71-651,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2418.811,2426.932,"I think Mr. Hanson the Supreme Court of California used the word requested, didn’t it, when it spoke of the context between the police and the garbage hollers?"
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2426.932,2435.934,"Well, I don’t know, I’m sure that they probably requested, and they requested or commanded or demanded, there’s something other than -- I suppose it was a friendly confrontation, I don’t know exactly how it --"
1972.71-651,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2435.934,2439.425,Do you think there’s no difference between the word commanded and requested?
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2439.425,2439.636,Oh!
1972.71-651,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2487.219,2491.438,Mr. Hanson let me interrupt you there.

1972.71-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2791.083,2794.517,Did the respondents in this case have anything to do with that picture?
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2794.517,2796.027,Is what?
1972.71-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2796.027,2798.021,The respondents in this case?
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2798.021,2800.461,"No, they did -- the respondents, no they did not."
1972.71-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2800.461,2802.968,"Well, how will that help their position in this case?"
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2802.968,2805.963,"Well, because it’s very typical how it’s done Mr. Justice Marshall."
1972.71-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2805.963,2811.08,"Well, I mean if he thinks its private, does that help him or not?"
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2811.08,2813.551,"Well, it shows, the question again --"
1972.71-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2813.551,2817.63,Does your position that this man knew that all these things have in the garbage?

1972.71-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2824.514,2827.139,Why do you need the movie?
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,2827.139,2833.235,"Well, I thought it would help the Court to confirm my contentions as to how California garbage is picked up."
1972.71-651,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2964.322,2967.492,You say that garbage ultimately goes in Los Angeles?

1972.71-651,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2973.463,2976.426,And frequently is it plowed over by bulldozers?

1972.71-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3025.53,3028.627,What’s the difference between getting rid of something and abandonment?
1972.71-651,1,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3028.627,3036.769,"Well, under the general idea of abandonment as far as I am concerned, abandonment would be just some free will, free desire to get rid of something."
