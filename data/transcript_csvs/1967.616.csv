1967.616,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,17.537,"Number 616, Joint Industry Board of the Electrical Industry et al., petitioner versus United States."
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,18.956,21.106,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1967.616,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,95.156,102.302,"May I ask you, is that precisely the same issue we had here in United States against the Embassy Restaurant?"
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,102.302,105.435,I don't believe it's the same case --
1967.616,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,105.435,107.301,You do not believe it's the same?
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,107.301,115.659,"I think it's -- Very frankly, I don't know whether the Court wants to review the Embassy case."
1967.616,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,150.884,152.631,"That's your distinction, isn't it?"
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,152.631,152.945,Yes.
1967.616,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,152.945,154.04,These are vested rights (Voice Overlap).
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,154.04,155.095,Vested rights and --
1967.616,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,155.095,157.676,"-- that was not include of what is before us in Embassy, is that it?"
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,157.676,158.755,Yes.
1967.616,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,483.997,489.801,Do you remember whether the life insurance was a term insurance or was it straight life?
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,489.801,492.23,"No, it was group life insurance I believe."
1967.616,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,492.23,493.848,"And that was term insurance, was it?"
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,493.848,498.195,"Yes, and that was all contingent."
1967.616,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,576.608,577.712,What was the man worked (Voice Overlap)
1967.616,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,577.712,581.596,What are the differences between the $4 and the $8?
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,581.596,585.376,The $8 is merely a sum which is paid to workmen.
1967.616,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,601.598,602.657,I see.
1967.616,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,602.657,622.9,"Suppose a man works for the company for three to four years and then he is discharged or he resigns not to retire from the industry but go to work for another company, is he entitled to any of these funds?"
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,622.9,630.702,"Your Honor, if he goes to work for another company that is covered by this agreement --"
1967.616,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,630.702,633.354,"Yes, but suppose it's not?"
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,633.354,641.654,"If he's not, if he isn't covered by this agreement, you mean another company, he is entitled to receive moneys at the rate of $60 a month."
1967.616,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,641.654,648.939,"Just be careful, if you were because I want to be precise about this to make sure I understand it."
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,663.155,669.313,He would receive $60 a month just the same as if he went into business for himself.
1967.616,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,669.313,669.76,I see.
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,679.951,682.177,And he leaves the industry?
1967.616,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,682.177,684.174,And he leaves the industry first?
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,684.174,700.866,"If he leaves the industry, the money is credited to his account plus his accumulated interest, which is usually 4% in the last few years, would be paid to him at the rate of $60 a month until the money is credited to his account has been exhausted."
1967.616,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,700.866,706.423,So discharge and voluntary resignation from the same company are treated the same?
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,706.423,707.514,That's right.
1967.616,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,707.514,723.967,Is there any minimum period during which he has to work for the company or under this industry wide agreement before he is entitled to receive payments from the company?
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,723.967,735.871,"The $4 a day, which is paid by the employer, is credited to his account from the first day that he starts employment in is earmarked."
1967.616,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,737.169,746.896,"And if he retires from the industry, let's say at the end of six months, then he is entitled to what has been accumulated?"
1967.616,0,28100,harold_stern,,746.896,778.872,"Yes, and I might say that every single month, and this is not disputed, the annuity plan of the Electrical Industry sends to each participant of the plan a statement like a bankbook which shows how much money he has credited to his account and at the end of the year, the statement contains likewise a crediting of the amount of interest that has been earned and the moneys deposited to his account."
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1314.128,1318.953,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.616,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1538.262,1551.42,"Well here, don't you have a difference here that this -- there's a very close resemblance to wages in the sense that there was $4 per day."
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1590.918,1599.045,"Well, the insurance benefits were credited to the account of the individual workers."
1967.616,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1644.789,1651.792,Well this provision in Embassy are these -- there are these words in Embassy?
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1692.7,1731.059,"As a matter of fact Mr. Justice Fortas, most of the same things can be said about the present contributions, but I think that the essential part of the rationale in Embassy, after an examination of these individual attributes of the contribution and what the Court subsequently have used as the guiding post in such cases as Sulmeyer as to be found on the next page in the opinion on page 33 in the last paragraph that begins on that page."
1967.616,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1754.194,1765.108,"And just before that though the sentence says “the contributions here are not due to workman nor have they, the customary attributes of wages”."
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1771.811,1795.586,"I would say as the Court in Embassy defined the customary attributes of wages as sums immediately due to the workers, it is equally true and it's certainly is true of the Courts view of due to workmen since the sums are paid to the trustees and the workmen are limited in the same way they were in Embassy as to the control that they can exercise over the funds."
1967.616,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1795.586,1817.789,"Well, under Embassy, if a man was in the industry for four years under this agreement, let's say and he either quit or was fired from his employment and went out of the industry, what was he entitled to receive under that contract?"
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1817.789,1819.082,Under Embassy's?
1967.616,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1819.082,1820.027,Embassy.
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1820.027,1833.473,"Yes, he was entitled not to receive benefits under this Welfare Fund that he was entitled to have health and life insurance during the period of his employment if the premiums were paid."
1967.616,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1833.473,1841.727,"No, but I'm talking about after he leaves, is he entitled to anything if he gets out and leaves the industry?"
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1841.727,1848.395,Only on the basis of the contingency that he should become ill or die before the insurance policy expires.
1967.616,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1848.395,1856.97,"Alright, now what is he entitled to under this contract if he is fired and leaves the industry?"
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1856.97,1863.379,"If he leaves the industry, there are benefits payable to him under this contract but that is --"
1967.616,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1863.379,1867.264,Now what benefits is he entitled to?
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1867.264,1872.609,It depends on the extent to which he has built up a claim within the fund.
1967.616,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1872.609,1876.268,Isn't he entitled to $60 a month?
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1876.268,1877.787,In some cases yes.
1967.616,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1882.93,1887.581,"But anyway, it depends on how much he put in?"
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1887.581,1890.891,It depends on how much he put in in part.
1967.616,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1897.668,1902.841,Now how long do those payments exist?
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1902.841,1909.133,"It's a period of some months to those particular payments exist, again varying with --"
1967.616,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1909.133,1915.095,Isn't he entitled to get the return of the total amount that he put in?
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1915.095,1916.122,"Yes, he is."
1967.616,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1922.746,1924.233,"Yes, that's what I'm talking about."
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1930.231,1936.702,"Well, I think it's a variation from the Embassy in the atypical case of the worker who leaves the industry."
1967.616,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1946.973,1956.717,"No, but automation itself brings about attrition doesn't it in employments of that kind?"
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1956.717,1957.766,"It can, of course --"
1967.616,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1957.766,1959.196,"It does, doesn't it?"
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1959.196,1968.656,But the contention of the petitioners is not that the priority should be limited only to those claimants who have left the industry and will receive immediate benefits.
1967.616,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2016.411,2022.351,"Well, that's the question as to bargaining on wages and working conditions, isn't it?"
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2022.351,2034.458,"Well, it's true in both cases that there is collective bargaining as to this union welfare and pension funds, yes sir."
1967.616,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2080.216,2082.179,More immediate --
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2082.179,2084.187,In terms of his having the insurance.
1967.616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.409,2097.429,Do you have -- do you think he has the protection --
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2097.429,2110.43,The protection now of the insurance whereas he does not loss the protection of the moneys in his pension fund during the period in which the contributions are not made to the pension fund.
1967.616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2113.983,2119.763,But in Embassy it was term insurance and money paid for a certain period of protection?
1967.616,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2119.763,2123.265,That's correct.
1967.616,2,28100,harold_stern,,3144.669,3146.089,May I just have a minute?
1967.616,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3146.089,3147.924,"You may have one minute, yes because --"
1967.616,2,28100,harold_stern,,3147.924,3169.943,"I want to point out that I didn't make it clear that the claim in this case does not include any wages, due wages to the point that the man didn't get paid his regular wages at the end of the month, but is limited only to the moneys which were due to the annuity fund."
1967.616,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3218.408,3219.599,Very well.
