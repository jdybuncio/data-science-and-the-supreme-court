2007.06-1431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.004,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 06-1431, CBOCS West v. Humphries."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,9.956,41.41,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Based on the plain terms of section 1981, this Court's interpretation of that statute under Runyon, Patterson, and Domino's Pizza, as well as Congress' recognition of the distinction between discrimination and retaliation and this Court's decision in Burlington Northern, section 1981 does not contain a separate cause of action for retaliation."
2007.06-1431,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,85.606,93.01,Do you see any meaningful difference between the language of 1981 and 1982 in this regard?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,93.01,107.383,"--Justice Alito, I do, and in that context section 1981 was amended in 1991, and with a lot of this Court's precedent in terms of how statutes are viewed, they all have a life."
2007.06-1431,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,112.154,115.189,Do you think that it was narrowed in 1981?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,115.189,121.943,"I think with respect to this issue, Your Honor, of retaliation, that it was."
2007.06-1431,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,151.212,159.652,"Well, wasn't the purpose of the 1991 act to broaden the scope of 1981 rather than narrow it?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,159.652,170.51,"Your Honor, with respect to the '91 act, it was supposed to specifically pick up the post formation contract issues under Patterson."
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.51,174.328,Which is to say it was designed to overrule Patterson.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,174.328,175.664,"Well, Your Honor--"
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.664,176.197,Not overrule.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,178.782,179.682,"--Well, it didn't--"
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.682,182.168,--so that Patterson would no longer be right.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,182.168,183.768,--It didn't change Patterson.
2007.06-1431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.423,190.923,"""EAS-ter-brook""."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,190.923,191.623,"--Or ""E S-ter-brook""."
2007.06-1431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,204.114,210.184,Do you mean Patterson would come out the same under 1981 as amended by the 1991 act.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,210.184,211.084,Yes.
2007.06-1431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,213.953,216.338,I think Congress would have been quite amazed at that rule.
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,216.338,219.057,I think that they would be astounded.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,219.057,219.374,No.
2007.06-1431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,231.447,239.537,Are you saying that before the 1991 amendment retaliation was included?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,239.537,239.887,No.
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.059,252.611,What change did the 1991 amendment make then?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,252.611,253.711,"Well, it wasn't included--"
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,253.711,257.415,You say it was intended to change the outcome of Patterson.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,264.869,267.105,--In respect to the post formation.
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.914,283.916,I don't understand you.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,290.52,290.836,Correct.
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.836,297.64,"Retaliation is one, but just one of many post formation actions, right?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,297.64,298.157,Well Your Honor--
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,298.157,302.644,What other post formation actions were there that--
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,302.644,303.461,--What other post formation--
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.461,306.68,--What was the post formation action that was in action in Patterson?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,306.68,317.637,"--Patterson was dealing with the issue about after you had the relationship could an employer take an adverse discriminatory action against the individual, and the Court said no."
2007.06-1431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,325.326,328.895,And Congress changed that and the case we have is also post formation.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,328.895,341.803,"Well, but Congress changed it to say that it would include, in subsection 1981(b), that it would include certain specified post formation conduct with respect to--"
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.803,343.038,It didn't specify them.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,356.962,358.514,"--It did not change that, that's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-1431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,384.096,390.685,"Under your view, would harassment be prohibited by 1981 as amended?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,390.685,400.374,"--If it is racial harassment, meaning the treating of someone differently than a white citizen because of their race, then it would be."
2007.06-1431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,415.301,420.705,But the term 1981(b).
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,420.705,434.464,"Well, if it's just harassment, Justice Kennedy, in the abstract... I'm harassing somebody because I don't like them... whether they're black or white, that wouldn't be actionable under section 1981."
2007.06-1431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,441.118,442.568,Why isn't that true here?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,453.89,461.446,"Your Honor, if you have a situation where... and I think it's even addressed in some of the Respondent's brief."
2007.06-1431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,483.359,495.517,"What kind of... what kind of right to be free from discrimination would there be if once one complains one can be fired, demoted?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,499.521,504.891,"--Well, Your Honor, I mean there are alternatives for that particular issue."
2007.06-1431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,518.515,523.57,"But one can say the same thing for Title VII and, say, the Equal Pay Act."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,531.74,540.93,"No, but there is precedent for the fact that where one law does cover a particular situation, we don't go about removing that impact."
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,548.101,551.553,Why did they... why did they proceed under Title VII then?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,552.287,562.511,"Well, they did proceed under Title VII, and that was dismissed by the Federal court because he did not pay his proper filing fee on time in compliance with Title VII requirements."
2007.06-1431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,562.511,564.897,"Well, that's... that's often the case, isn't it?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,582.959,588.01,"Well, it can be a use, yes, Your Honor, that people do use it for that very purpose."
2007.06-1431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,588.01,594.666,"So what is the difference between this case... you say, well, there's Title VII and this would erode Title VII."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,600.653,609.609,"No, because they can coexist with respect to those particular issues, and this Court has recognized that those two statutes can coexist."
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,609.609,623.936,"--Does... does the person who is retaliated against, that is the person who complained and is retaliated against, have to be the person who was discriminated against?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,623.936,638.861,"Well, Your Honor, based on a reading of Domino's, it would certainly appear that the individual who is making the complaint to have protection must be the individual who has the contractual right, as opposed to complaining about a third person."
2007.06-1431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,638.861,646.965,"Now, is your position that in that situation a retaliation is not covered by 1981?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,646.965,647.717,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,647.717,652.452,I would have thought that you could argue that it's direct discrimination.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,679.136,690.594,"Well, Your Honor, we take the position that in order to have a retaliation claim under section 1981, it really has to be a discrimination claim."
2007.06-1431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,693.412,694.012,"Well, that's right."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,702.035,721.013,"--Well, Your Honor, they can make... phrase it however they want to in terms of their particular complaint, but the issue in terms of the analysis under the plain text of section 1981 is whether or not a white person in this situation is being treated differently with respect to making a similar complaint."
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.013,729.685,"Surely... surely, you don't mean what you just said a minute ago, that in order to have a retaliation claim you must have a discrimination claim."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,729.685,731.237,Well--
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.237,738.091,"Surely it's your position that even when you have a discrimination claim, you don't have a retaliation claim."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,742.179,746.647,"--There is no retaliation claim in the abstract under this statute, period, correct."
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.647,748.499,Okay.
2007.06-1431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.499,749.665,You practice in this--
2007.06-1431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,749.665,750.432,And you say--
2007.06-1431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,750.432,751.284,--in this area--
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,751.284,751.967,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,751.967,774.9,"--Perhaps you can maybe just tell me based on your experience: After 1981 was amended, did 1981(b) supersede Title VII in run of the mill termination and harassment cases?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,774.9,775.5,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,787.841,788.908,"No, no, not retaliation."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,795.579,797.479,--Did we see a big spurt in those?
2007.06-1431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,797.479,797.879,Yes.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,797.879,798.431,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,798.431,799.548,Why not?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,803.55,810.656,"From our experience, more and more people... there's been a trend to go to State court because more and more States--"
2007.06-1431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,810.656,812.323,"Well, then I have to refine the hypothetical."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,814.241,814.641,--In Federal--
2007.06-1431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,814.641,833.019,"--because it does seem to me that Congress told us: We don't care if there's an overlap between 1981 and Title VII, we don't care if there's a longer statute of limitations, we don't care if there's no cap an damages; we want 1981 to work."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,839.29,840.275,--In the Federal system.
2007.06-1431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,840.275,844.16,"And if that's true, then why do we worry about retaliation?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,846.429,855.118,"Your Honor, in answer to your question, yes, we've seen more adding on section 1981 claims with Title VII claims in Federal court."
2007.06-1431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,856.585,863.155,"--Of course, it's just for race claims, and Title VII covers sex, national origin."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,863.155,864.322,Title VII covers race and retaliation.
2007.06-1431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,864.322,872.628,My point is that 1981 would not be available to other categories.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,874.228,874.73,Correct.
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,874.73,877.248,Any other advantages to 1981?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,878.914,882.933,"Longer statute of limitations, similar attorney's fees, yes."
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.933,884.568,But you get that under Title VII?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,884.568,892.774,"Yes, you do, but it's a longer statute of limitations, and it's uncapped damages because of the caps under Title VII that exists."
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,892.774,895.46,What happens in just a basic employment case?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,930.383,932.783,"Well, it's going to depend upon the State and--"
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,932.783,937.553,"The State law, is there some kind of policy against that from the State law, he couldn't do it?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,937.553,938.103,--That's correct.
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,938.103,945.726,"Well, here we have a Federal statute that says that a black person shall have the same right to make a contract as a white person."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,957.534,965.037,"Well, Justice Breyer, if white individuals are also terminated for making complaints--"
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,965.037,965.337,"Oh, no."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1020.307,1032.115,"--Well, Your Honor, I would go back to the plain, clear terms with their ordinary meaning, and it says equal rights as white citizens and it talks about the same and that--"
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1032.115,1041.304,"Does it say anywhere, by the way, in that statute that a black person who is discriminated against can go to court and file a lawsuit?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1041.304,1043.138,--If they have--
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1043.138,1044.056,Does it say that?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1044.056,1045.289,--If they are not being treated--
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1045.289,1045.773,Yes.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1047.924,1048.71,--Does it have the words
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1049.126,1049.66,"Yes, correct."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1049.66,1050.61,"No, it does not."
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1050.61,1051.412,No.
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.828,1053.745,Is there a Federal common law?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1056.414,1057.482,"No, we're here dealing dealing with Federal statutes."
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.482,1058.499,So State courts can do that.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1059.849,1061.884,State courts develop public policy.
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1062.951,1068.788,And have we developed a policy here in creating a right of action under this 1981?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1068.788,1072.409,"Rights of action have existed under Federal statute, that's correct."
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1072.409,1078.313,Which is the statute that does... is there a statute that specifically gives you a right to sue under 1981?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1078.763,1086.616,"Well, this Court has established that, particularly with respect to section 1981, that an individual does have a right of action."
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1086.616,1087.235,It has established it.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1103.445,1129.612,"Because this Court in a variety of cases such as Russello, West Virginia, University Hospital, Arlington Public School, has said that we look at the text and we examine the text of the statute, and unless it is ambiguous... and I would certainly submit that words like ""same"", ""like"", ""equal"" are not ambiguous terms... that we leave it alone; that that's--"
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1129.612,1130.862,That isn't the word I was looking for.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1138.884,1139.97,"--It's not in there, Your Honor."
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1139.97,1140.486,"No, correct."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1148.19,1148.54,Because--
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1148.54,1150.009,That was my basic question.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1150.009,1165.735,"--Well, in response to it, I would simply say that you have to look to the text as to how you're trying to apply it, and what you're applying it to, and this particular statute protects against different treatment, not specifically with respect to some other--"
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1165.735,1175.393,"Mr. Hawkins, don't we have a whole line of recent cases which say we have set our face against implying causes of action?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1175.393,1175.743,--Yes.
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.743,1180.211,A whole bunch of recent cases saying we're not going to do that any more.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1180.211,1180.961,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1180.961,1184.499,"We used to do it, but we said we're not going to do it any more."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1184.499,1185.632,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.632,1187.284,So why don't you invoke those?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1187.284,1196.057,"Well, I... we... we do invoke those in our brief, and those are all part of what I'm getting at in terms of... I mean Arlington School Board was one of those cases."
2007.06-1431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1196.057,1207.262,"We do have those recent cases, but we also have the Sullivan case interpreting... interpreting 1982, which arose under the prior approach to these questions."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1223.04,1236.632,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, particularly since this Court has Runyon, Patterson, and Domino's interpreting Section 1981, that's what to look at to interpret section 1981, not Sullivan, which interprets a different statute."
2007.06-1431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1237.467,1240.336,But it's a statute that has the same derivation.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1273.673,1295.236,"--Justice Ginsburg, with all due respect, I would think not; and the reason is this Court, when it acted in 1991, had in front of it to look at Patterson, which was saying, we're going to interpret Section 1981 in a straightforward, plain text situation."
2007.06-1431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1347.888,1355.977,Wouldn't you look at what Congress was trying to do in the 1991 amendments?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1378.871,1380.044,Correct.
2007.06-1431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1380.044,1389.945,And it seems to me that we wouldn't be hearing... we wouldn't be grasping that message.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1389.945,1390.967,"But, Your Honor, in--"
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.967,1392.584,Why do you agree with that?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1394.836,1397.471,"--Well, I think that there was some perspective."
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1399.823,1401.29,"Then don't say ""yes""."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1416.365,1417.451,"--I agree, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.451,1418.384,That's all we know for sure.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1418.384,1418.817,Right.
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.817,1420.736,That Congress wanted that disposition.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1429.509,1429.875,No.
2007.06-1431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1430.692,1438.029,There is something to that effect in the legislative history that explains why Congress made the amendments it did in 1991.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1438.029,1441.65,And we could have a whole debate about the legislative history and what--
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1441.65,1442.35,Why not?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1456.826,1457.409,--Justice Breyer--
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1457.409,1469.717,"So when they write that in the House report, isn't that some evidence that they did look back and see Sullivan, and they did think that in 1982 there's a retaliation action, and therefore in 1981 there is one?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1472.886,1476.49,"--Yes, that's evidence that somebody in Congress was thinking that."
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1476.49,1477.223,And that someone--
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1477.223,1485.429,"But I think if we just use an analogy with contract law, if we're negotiating a contract--"
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1485.429,1488.547,Did the committee vote on that committee report?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1488.547,1489.247,"--No, they did not."
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.247,1490.347,So how do you know if anybody in Congress thought that?
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1490.347,1491.332,"Well, somebody wrote it in a report."
2007.06-1431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1491.332,1493.082,It could have been a teenager who wrote the report.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1493.082,1496.467,It doesn't have any significance with respect to this legislation.
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1502.721,1505.057,"--Well, I think we're familiar with that debate."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1521.435,1527.005,"I think the Seventh Circuit is saying we're not making the at will argument in this case, and that's not where we are going."
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1527.005,1527.389,All right.
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1527.389,1528.805,It could be made and it could be developed.
2007.06-1431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1528.805,1530.624,"All right, because I don't think that's is a good argument."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1534.692,1544.384,"Whether it... it may well be a benefit or a privilege, Your Honor, but it isn't shown that there's different treatment than a white employee."
2007.06-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.673,1568.649,"Mr. Hawkins, is it at all relevant on the issue that the several courts of appeals have come out the same way both before the 1991 amendment and since the 1991 amendment, and opinions to the contrary are pretty scarce?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1572.051,1572.434,No.
2007.06-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1580.673,1589.413,"I know, but even under the 1991 the courts of appeals have been fairly uniform on the answer to the very issue we're confronting here."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1590.446,1594.567,"They have, but I would submit, Your Honor, that they haven't been following the text of the statute."
2007.06-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1596.45,1606.958,"My question is, are they entitled to give any stare decisis weight to a consensus among all the courts of appeals both before and after the 1991 amendment."
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1606.958,1609.926,I don't believe the Supreme Court has to give stare decisis--
2007.06-1431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1609.926,1616.663,"Don't have to, but does it make sense in trying to understand the stability of the law generally?"
2007.06-1431,0,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1616.663,1618.348,"--Based on our argument it does not, Your Honor."
2007.06-1431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1621.484,1623.417,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1627.638,1644.131,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address the questions that Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer raised about the effectiveness of section 1981 if there is no right to bring an action for retaliation."
2007.06-1431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.35,1699.917,That's a good argument to Congress.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1742.996,1745.365,"They would in fact have a cause of action, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.531,1753.119,"On your theory, but that has nothing to do with the text of the statute, which requires discrimination on the basis of race."
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1766.379,1778.586,--This Court held in the Jackson case that discrimination on the basis... that retaliation when there was a complaint about sex discrimination constituted discrimination on the basis of sex.
2007.06-1431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.26,1794.062,"Well, you can say that, but it doesn't make any sense."
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1794.062,1795.814,"Well, that's what the Court held in Jackson, Your Honor."
2007.06-1431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.814,1797.198,"It didn't make any sense then, either."
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1799.75,1808.039,"Counsel, if we rule in your favor, why would anyone ever bring a Title VII action if they could bring a 1981 action?"
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1808.039,1810.824,"There's a lot of reasons to bring a Title VII action, Your Honor."
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1822.715,1823.081,All right.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1825.817,1826.15,That's correct.
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1826.15,1829.952,--1981 allows you to get out of the Title VII cap on damages?
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1829.952,1830.721,That's correct.
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1830.721,1836.206,Or isn't that rendering Congress' careful... I mean the 1991 legislation was a careful compromise.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1847.497,1859.638,Congress said specifically in... in the 1991 Civil Rights Act that the damage caps do not apply if an employee has a right under section 1981 and so--
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1859.638,1861.04,"Well, you're just begging the question."
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1864.108,1867.06,"--Well... and we do have the right that's at issue here today, because--"
2007.06-1431,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1867.06,1873.648,"When were... when there damages, as opposed to back pay, added as a remedy for Title VII?"
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1873.648,1878.802,"--Title VII damages were added, compensatory and punitive damages were added, in the 1991 Civil Rights Act."
2007.06-1431,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1878.802,1881.987,"So it wasn't that it was cut back, as the Chief suggested."
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1881.987,1882.52,That's right.
2007.06-1431,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1882.52,1890.943,It's the first time ever Title VII plaintiffs were entitled to get money damages as distinguished from simply back pay?
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1890.943,1891.626,That's absolutely--
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1891.626,1892.712,"Well then, why do they put the caps in?"
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1901.048,1901.498,--That's correct.
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1901.498,1907.471,And you would allow them to completely obliterate that cap under any case that could be brought under 1981.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1907.471,1910.756,And Congress clearly made that... made that choice.
2007.06-1431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1910.756,1916.427,"Well, you say it's clear, but neither you or the government seems to tell me any words in this statute."
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1945.144,1954.785,The words in the statute that provide the basis for this claim is that you are entitled to the same rights to make and enforce contracts as white citizens.
2007.06-1431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1958.904,1961.939,But that was there before... but that was there as of the time of Patterson.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1961.939,1962.472,--That's correct.
2007.06-1431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1962.472,1966.51,So then Congress did nothing by the amendment to help your case.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,1966.51,1987.173,"What the Court did to help our case was that after Patterson was decided and before the section... before the Civil Rights Act of 1991 was passed, the lower courts had interpreted Patterson to restrict retaliation claims because they generally involve post formation conduct."
2007.06-1431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1998.312,2001.214,Patterson was not a retaliation case.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2001.214,2001.933,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-1431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2001.933,2004.416,Patterson was a discharge and harassment case.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2004.416,2005.318,That's correct.
2007.06-1431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2005.318,2008.27,And the words do seem to cover that.
2007.06-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2008.27,2008.553,No.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2016.491,2017.458,"That's absolutely right, Justice--"
2007.06-1431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2017.458,2021.677,Before Patterson they had all thought retaliation was a cause of action.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2021.677,2026.048,--They consistently thought there was a cause of action for retaliation based upon Sullivan.
2007.06-1431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2026.048,2035.52,"But nothing that you argued so far shows that the words of the statute as amended, that is to say new subsection (b), help your case."
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2035.52,2050.547,"The words of the statute that help us establish the cause of action are that it made... that Congress made clear that the entire contractual relationship would be covered from the beginning of the contractual relationship through the end, through termination."
2007.06-1431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2068.158,2071.893,I do not read subsection (c) as giving substantive rights.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2086.503,2088.003,"--Any of those could apply, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.39,2138.352,"I guess those court of appeals cases pre-1991 that found there was a retaliation claim, right, those cases were just wrong as to whether there was any post contract claim?"
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2142.236,2143.219,Patterson said you were wrong.
2007.06-1431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.219,2149.909,"So if they were wrong about whether there's a post contract claim, why wouldn't they be wrong about whether there's a retaliation claim?"
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2149.909,2150.459,There were--
2007.06-1431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.459,2155.577,I don't know why we should give deference to them on the one point when they've been proven wrong on the other one.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2155.577,2158.848,--They based that on... on this Court's reading in Sullivan.
2007.06-1431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2164.669,2170.487,Because it's ironic to say all those cases were wrong when Congress agreed with them and disagreed with Patterson.
2007.06-1431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2170.487,2175.908,But is the rationale of those cases... and it's important to get the right rationale.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2213.683,2216.185,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2216.185,2223.707,And so then we're looking very hard in a place for a word that couldn't be there.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2223.707,2226.04,I would agree with that.
2007.06-1431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2226.04,2236.148,But that was true in Sullivan because a property owner who wants to sell is in a particularly advantageous position to enforce the rights of the buyer.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2243.852,2246.921,"Well, I would disagree with that respectfully, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2262.915,2272.604,"When you agreed with Justice Breyer that we're looking for a word that couldn't be there, you said yes, but it is in fact a word that is there in about 37 other statutes, right?"
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2272.604,2273.271,Those statutes--
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2273.271,2274.39,The word could be there.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2278.108,2280.044,"--The word ""retaliation""."
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2280.044,2280.36,Yes.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2280.36,2281.76,--does not appear in... in those.
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2288.733,2291.685,"But they provide a specific cause of action for retaliation, correct?"
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2291.685,2296.92,"--They do, but there is no specific cause of action provided in section 1981 at all."
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2303.775,2307.294,Is this... the question I asked your friend and I'll ask you as well.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2333.262,2357.31,"--I think you give effect to Sullivan in this situation, and the reason is because at the time that Congress was legislating and amending section 1981, and it was acting against the backdrop of this Court's jurisprudence, it had Patterson in front of it, it had... it knew that Sullivan was still good law."
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2372.904,2376.872,"Of course, by 1991 our new approach to reading statutes was pretty clearly established."
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2376.872,2377.889,That's correct.
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2378.356,2386.745,"So if Congress were looking at both of those bodies of law, then wouldn't the normal care be for it to put in a retaliation provision?"
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2386.745,2391.466,--If they were legislating on a clean slate I might agree with that Justice... Chief Justice Roberts.
2007.06-1431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2424.02,2436.261,You're saying they would have... you're saying they would have added an express retaliation provision in 1981 in 1991 if they had thought that the mode of reasoning in Sullivan was no longer sound?
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2438.111,2440.044,I don't know that that's necessarily true.
2007.06-1431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2448.567,2457.339,"When you say they legislated against the backdrop, you're... are you not relying on something they didn't do, rather than anything that they did?"
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2457.339,2460.457,"I wouldn't necessarily agree with that, Justice Alito."
2007.06-1431,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2462.942,2475.984,"The interpretation was consistent with this... was it 2005, long after those other new approach statutes, decisions were on the books."
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2478.252,2488.125,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg; and at that time this Court said that you look to the language of the statute, and there in Title IX the language was broad."
2007.06-1431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2505.153,2522.031,"What I'm... what I'm taking away from the argument is that if I were to write this opinion in your favor, I would have to say that it's necessary to imply a cause of action prohibiting retaliation in order to make these other words effective."
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2531.404,2534.006,"Well, the Court has already implied a cause of action and the question is whether--"
2007.06-1431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2534.006,2540.926,"I understand that, and... and there certainly is a cause of action as to all the terms in the contract, but you want to add... for me to add a new term."
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2555.836,2565.044,"--Well, the language in this statute that guarantees the same rights to make and enforce contracts by citizens provides that basis, based on this Court's decision in Jackson."
2007.06-1431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2565.044,2568.746,"Now you're making enforcement, as with Patterson."
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2568.746,2569.146,I'm sorry.
2007.06-1431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2571.179,2575.8,Now you're just talking about make or enforce and that brings us right back to where we started.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2575.8,2580.702,But... subsection (b) defines make and enforce more broadly.
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2592.927,2601.866,"To the extent your argument relies so heavily on Sullivan, I went back and read it, and rather than an implied right of action case it looked to me like a third party standing case."
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2601.866,2612.572,"And I know there is some disagreement about that, but the Court in Jackson found that... it did find that Sullivan did stand for the proposition that there was a cause of action for retaliation."
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2612.572,2613.857,But I think... that's right.
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2622.446,2630.366,"Well, if you look at what Sullivan actually said, Chief Justice Roberts, I think you would find that you could read it more expansively that just a third party standing case."
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2660.886,2666.004,"You agree, though, that the language in the opinion focuses on it as a third party standing question."
2007.06-1431,1,19061,cynthia_h_hyndman,,2666.004,2670.592,--The... the Court says that Mr. Sullivan does have standing to bring the action.
2007.06-1431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2715.521,2717.904,"Thank you, Counsel."
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2729.779,2738.034,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has already inferred a private cause of action under section 1981."
2007.06-1431,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2755.079,2756.446,It's a little more complicated than that.
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2787.047,2790.515,"No, Justice Scalia, we're not asking to you to go back to the bad old days."
2007.06-1431,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2819.518,2821.801,Patterson was still the bad old days.
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2824.72,2826.188,Patterson was 1989.
2007.06-1431,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2828.105,2828.54,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2829.24,2831.992,"The bad old days ended when you got on the Court, Mr. Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1431,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2851.754,2857.792,"Are you asking us to infer, to find implied in the words a cause of action against retaliation?"
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2857.792,2858.993,No.
2007.06-1431,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2862.795,2863.478,What words--
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2863.478,2864.547,--to include retaliation.
2007.06-1431,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2864.547,2866.03,--What words in the statute?
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2869.015,2869.951,"Okay, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1431,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2903.22,2906.872,A third reason is that the word isn't in the statute.
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2906.872,2910.024,"--Well... but neither is the word ""harassment"", Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1431,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2912.092,2916.061,"Well, that's a benefit, privilege, and term of the contract--"
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2916.061,2916.48,Is--
2007.06-1431,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2916.48,2919.432,--to me fairly obvious to me to include harassment.
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2928.136,2935.458,"--Sure, but I don't think there's any doubt since Mr. Humphries was fired that he no longer enjoys the benefits and privileges of his contractual relationship."
2007.06-1431,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2950.617,2951.251,"Well, then why were you--"
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2951.251,2951.667,--but he claimed--
2007.06-1431,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2951.667,2953.569,--talking about impairment in your brief?
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2953.569,2961.859,"--We were making a slightly different point, Justice Kennedy, which is we think this case is a fortiori from the Jackson case in a couple of respects."
2007.06-1431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3030.253,3031.136,"So, if you have--"
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3031.136,3032.238,--against someone for exercising their rights.
2007.06-1431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3032.238,3041.227,"--If you have an employer who fires everybody who complains about practices at work, that would not be covered retaliation?"
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3041.227,3042.111,"Mr. Chief Justice, you're right."
2007.06-1431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3060.139,3069.478,"Do you think it's unusual for employers to have a practice that anybody who alleges that I've committed a violation of Federal law, I want to get rid of them?"
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3069.478,3081.788,"--Well, I... I actually do think that's unusual, and I do think if an employer... I mean, just in looking at the cases that are actually decided, you don't see that as the nondiscriminatory defense that many employers resort to."
2007.06-1431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3123.198,3128.767,You don't have any doubt that Sullivan would come out differently today under our current analysis?
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3128.767,3130.452,"--It... I mean, it's hard to say."
2007.06-1431,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3145.244,3149.682,"It would be a tougher Court to make the argument on inferring a cause of action, period."
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3157.802,3160.304,"--And I think that's a very fair point, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3177.933,3179.885,The correct reading of Jackson or of Sullivan?
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3179.885,3182.404,"--Of both, but more to the point, of Sullivan."
2007.06-1431,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3199.029,3206.602,"Well, of course, and you in your brief bracketed that and just made that equivalent to retaliation."
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3219.943,3229.634,"But, Justice Kennedy, if that were the only claim that Sullivan could bring, i.e., if he could only bring the second half of the leasehold claim that Freeman had, I would agree with your reading of Sullivan."
2007.06-1431,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3253.25,3260.77,But a seller is... or a would be seller is always a built in advocate for a buyer if some third person interferes with the contract.
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3260.77,3269.825,"--I agree with that, but I think what's critical is that he was allowed to recover not just for that injury but for his expulsion from the property owner's association."
2007.06-1431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3298.962,3299.512,If we thought--
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3299.512,3300.012,When--
2007.06-1431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3300.012,3304.016,"--If we thought Sullivan was incorrectly decided, what should we do?"
2007.06-1431,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3326.798,3328.564,--I think you have to apply its reasoning.
2007.06-1431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3336.954,3338.087,"Thank you, General."
2007.06-1431,3,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,3340.872,3352.563,Respondent and the government and its amicus arguments are more appropriate on the floor of Congress debating whether or not to amend section 1981 to include retaliation.
2007.06-1431,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3409.535,3411.802,"This is no longer Washington, right?"
2007.06-1431,3,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,3411.802,3412.737,"--I understand, Your Honor."
2007.06-1431,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3413.32,3413.82,Okay.
2007.06-1431,3,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,3420.074,3423.007,The Seventh Circuit's decision should be reversed.
2007.06-1431,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3423.474,3424.074,"Thank you, counsel."
