1997.96-188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.587,"We'll hear argument now in No. 96-188, the General Electric Company v. Robert K. Joiner."
1997.96-188,0,41601,steven_r_kuney,,10.039,14.324,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,117.475,136.372,"Mr. Kuney, even if you're correct, that the abuse of discretion is the standard of review, the Respondents tell us that we still would have to affirm under an abuse of discretion standard, and it doesn't make any difference in this case."
1997.96-188,0,41601,steven_r_kuney,,138.907,140.707,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, I will."
1997.96-188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,169.343,171.212,10a and 11a----
1997.96-188,0,41601,steven_r_kuney,,171.212,171.728,"--Yes, of the--"
1997.96-188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.728,172.712,--of the petition?
1997.96-188,0,41601,steven_r_kuney,,172.712,175.164,--petition to the... the... the appendix to the cert petition.
1997.96-188,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1027.445,1036.019,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-188,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1227.328,1242.837,"Mr. Wallace, when you say more probable than not... and we... we have... we do have a Seventh Amendment, we do have questions of fact that go to a jury... so this gatekeeping function has to be on the law side, otherwise it trenches on the Seventh Amendment."
1997.96-188,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1248.991,1258.164,"Well, I... I... I'm not saying that... that that is the question for the judge to decide in... in determining admissibility."
1997.96-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.856,1300.526,"Yes, but that goes to the summary judgment determination and not to the determination of whether it's properly admissible."
1997.96-188,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1309.481,1310.416,"--Well, the... the--"
1997.96-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.416,1312.0,"And if it does that, it's admitted."
1997.96-188,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1325.908,1326.593,--Well--
1997.96-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1326.593,1329.16,"I mean, if it's good for one, it's good for both, it seems to me."
1997.96-188,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1329.16,1334.931,"--Well, we're not... I... I wouldn't consider what I was referring to as junk science."
1997.96-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.105,1350.792,"It's a summary judgment question, not the admissibility or inadmissibility question."
1997.96-188,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1350.792,1380.912,"--Well, the... but the logical extension of that is that so long as a study can be said to have been published and conducted so far as appears, according to scientific methodology, any study can be admitted in any case, as long as you can find a qualified expert who is willing to say that I would draw a conclusion from this study that relates to this... to the issue before this case."
1997.96-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.985,1425.357,Any other categories of cases besides public health cases and environmental cases... they're one category... and... and private tort cases are another.
1997.96-188,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1425.357,1426.224,"No, not at all."
1997.96-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.043,1428.259,"Are there a third, fourth and fifth categories?"
1997.96-188,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1428.259,1430.161,--That's only part of the context.
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1648.834,1652.969,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1997.96-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1704.519,1705.754,I wondered about that.
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1748.414,1751.55,"--No, I don't think, Your Honor, respectfully, that that is what he meant."
1997.96-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1769.194,1770.463,But I didn't see any... any words.
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1770.463,1770.863,--Well--
1997.96-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1770.863,1773.831,"I just... oh, the only words that I found relevant were the words that I read to you."
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1773.831,1774.281,--Yes.
1997.96-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1774.281,1776.533,"Now, are there some other words there that are relevant?"
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1776.533,1784.021,"Well, let me make clear, the... the Defendants did not move to deny the expert's testimony on all three substances."
1997.96-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1807.886,1808.738,I'll go back and look again.
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1809.771,1810.038,--Yes.
1997.96-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1811.004,1818.427,"And I just found a motion for summary judgment, a motion to exclude testimony, some answers to it, and I didn't see all these fine distinctions being made in those papers."
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1818.427,1819.36,"--Well, I think, if you--"
1997.96-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1819.36,1820.212,But I'll go back and read them again.
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1820.212,1831.252,"--if Your Honor will just look at page 20 of Respond... of Petitioner's reply brief, they expressly say the district court did not rule on the admissibility of the testimony with respect to three chemicals."
1997.96-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1832.27,1834.654,"Well... well, is there something to be... to go the jury still?"
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1834.654,1836.005,"--Pardon... well, absolutely."
1997.96-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1838.757,1839.29,"No, no, no."
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1846.094,1847.029,"--Yes, indeed."
1997.96-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1864.123,1866.425,"Well, but if... if you can't show causation, why... why go to the jury?"
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1869.46,1870.027,"Well, of course--"
1997.96-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1870.027,1872.995,"--that you cannot show causation based on this testimony, isn't that the end of the case?"
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1872.995,1882.802,--But the district court has not ruled that the scientist's testimony is inadmissible if it is assumed that Mr. Joiner was exposed to all three chemicals.
1997.96-188,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.919,1885.821,The district... the district court did grant summary judgment.
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1885.821,1886.388,--Yes.
1997.96-188,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1886.388,1891.725,And so there would have to be some sort of reversal by the court of appeals that would leave something left for the jury?
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1891.725,1892.125,Of course.
1997.96-188,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1892.642,1898.896,And what is it on page 20 that... of the Petitioner's brief that you say is... where they agree with your position?
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1898.896,1899.748,On their reply brief.
1997.96-188,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1924.113,1928.831,"That doesn't strike me as crystal clear, but per... perhaps, in context, it--"
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1928.831,1932.552,"Well, let... let me back up for a minute, because this is just terribly important to us, obviously."
1997.96-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1965.356,1972.86,"--But, I mean, normally, as a... as a reviewing judge in a court of appeals, I'd look at the summary judgment, I'd look at what the motions were below, I'd look at what they actually argued."
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1979.497,1980.383,"Well, Your Honor--"
1997.96-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1980.383,1993.757,"And... where, in other words, they're saying... you... you believe, if I look at those papers again, I'll find that they say, oh, no matter even if we win this in the court of appeals, we concede that we still have to go back and have a trial on the furans and dioxins; that they said that in those papers?"
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1993.757,1995.708,--That the court of appeals expressly--
1997.96-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1995.708,1996.492,I don't know the court of appeals.
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2009.718,2009.884,--That's correct.
1997.96-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2009.884,2010.351,All right.
1997.96-188,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2012.753,2013.22,Yes.
1997.96-188,3,41601,steven_r_kuney,,3475.702,3486.392,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe it is technically correct that in the motion for summary judgment, the only argument Defendants put forward about furans and dioxins was that there had been no exposure."
1997.96-188,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3514.811,3528.486,Then are we... we're supposed to assume for argument's sakes that there is inadmissible... because one of the points you raised is that the court of appeals is wrong on its furans point... there isn't any evidence here that... that there were furans and dioxins.
1997.96-188,3,41601,steven_r_kuney,,3528.486,3529.07,And... and--
1997.96-188,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3529.07,3533.355,"We're supposed to assume, for purposes of this case, that the court of appeals is right on that point."
1997.96-188,3,41601,steven_r_kuney,,3546.282,3547.165,--That's correct.
1997.96-188,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3570.98,3574.032,I didn't see any evidence here on furans and dioxins on either side--
1997.96-188,3,41601,steven_r_kuney,,3574.032,3574.649,"Well, the... the--"
