1964.35,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,38.282,"Number 35, Securities and Exchange Commission, Petitioner, versus American Trailer Rentals Company."
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,39.203,42.691,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1964.35,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,166.691,177.512,"So, you're embedding that category of the public -- the investor creditor or is that pretty well grounded in the cases?"
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,177.512,183.478,"Well, I don't -- Mr. Justice, I don't think we're embedding it, it's a phrase and perhaps it has not appeared before --"
1964.35,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,183.478,183.647,Yes.
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,183.647,184.774,But this --
1964.35,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,184.774,188.217,"But this is embedded, you are distinguishing between one creditor and another there?"
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,188.217,188.633,"Well, yes."
1964.35,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,201.15,207.826,Chapter XI should never be used to conflict an arrangement with the investor creditor?
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,207.826,209.207,That is our position.
1964.35,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,227.236,236.714,"But, this may be the point, investor creditor, is this a widespread phenomenon, is this a unique kind of suit or?"
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,236.714,246.741,"Well, the arrangement in this case is very unique, but investor creditors are quite frequent, public debentures, public bond holders, these are the categories that we mean as investor creditors."
1964.35,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,248.78,258.206,"So, is this is an ordinary unsecured -- this debenture does not, holds no security and this is the kind of thing that would reach."
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,258.206,258.536,That's correct.
1964.35,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,258.536,259.548,Your rule would reach.
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,259.548,259.93,That's right.
1964.35,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,260.269,266.926,Or anytime where they combine -– they sell packages with stock plus a loan when you buy --
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,266.926,277.246,"As long as members of the investing public put their money into a business in a credited position, we think Chapter XI cannot be used."
1964.35,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,277.811,284.191,That's not the only reason I suppose for saying that Chapter XI shouldn't be used here?
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,284.191,286.633,"Well, we have a double position."
1964.35,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,293.286,294.467,For other reasons.
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,294.467,299.126,"For other reasons and in addition to which, we think there is this broader principle, which we are urging."
1964.35,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,408.528,415.101,We'll have our recess.
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,416.457,419.839,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1964.35,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,515.41,517.764,Was that in accordance with the agreement?
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,517.764,519.068,"This was the understanding, yes."
1964.35,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,519.068,519.902,It was the understanding.
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,519.902,521.044,It was the understanding.
1964.35,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,521.044,521.645,Yes.
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,521.645,533.171,"But a very substantial amount was taken out of the purchase price by way of sales commissions, it ranked roughly from 30% to 37%."
1964.35,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,588.693,590.012,Mortgaged because of what?
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,590.012,599.152,"Because DeMar, the company that had gone bankrupt had not transferred the trailers to the debtor, it had mortgaged them and a third person had taken possession of the trailers."
1964.35,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,975.154,984.537,Before you get to that. What happened to the trailer owners who didn't avail themselves in this opportunity to take the stock at $2?
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,984.537,992.221,"-- under the plan is silent as to that but presumably, if someone does not avail himself of this opportunity he has a trailer."
1964.35,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1181.009,1182.25,Is that mandatory?
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1182.25,1182.927,Mandatory.
1964.35,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1182.927,1183.336,Mandatory.
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1183.336,1184.574,Mandatory.
1964.35,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1227.75,1229.428,(Inaudible)
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1229.428,1230.052,Will not --
1964.35,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1230.052,1230.71,Should not --
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1230.71,1232.509,It should not be left to the discretion of the case.
1964.35,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1232.509,1263.661,What are these references (Inaudible)?
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1263.661,1273.364,"The least is the second, we think both are correct but if the Court would disagree with this on the first, we think at least where there is a denial of fair and equitable treatment."
1964.35,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1273.364,1276.745,That was the trial in (Inaudible)
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1276.745,1277.871,Fair and equitable?
1964.35,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1277.871,1278.526,Yes.
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1278.526,1279.199,Well --
1964.35,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1279.199,1289.276,(Inaudible)
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1289.276,1292.752,"Well, put it this way if I may Mr. Justice."
1964.35,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1309.997,1313.106,(Inaudible)
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1313.106,1313.283,Yes.
1964.35,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1313.283,1324.932,(Inaudible)
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1324.932,1337.176,"I wouldn't -- I can't accept that Mr. Justice, because I think inevitably when you have a Section Chapter XI proceeding, they are going to cut down in practically every case."
1964.35,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1345.287,1354.093,"The important thing to remember in this connection is that the phrase fair and equitable in this context has a fixed absolute meaning, meaning absolute priority."
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1354.093,1354.559,That's correct.
1964.35,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1355.156,1357.445,It doesn't mean what those words mean in other context?
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1357.445,1358.382,Not in the colloquial sense --
1964.35,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1358.382,1358.567,Right.
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1358.567,1359.878,This is a very technical rule.
1964.35,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1555.319,1560.552,"Mr. Friedman, is there discretion in the Chapter XI Court to appoint a trustee?"
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1560.552,1561.021,No.
1964.35,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.374,1594.809,I thought the power of the judge was to -- when a petition is filed under -- a voluntary petition is filed that the power of the judge is the same as though there had been a petition of bankruptcy and the company had been adjudicated.
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1594.809,1595.342,"Well, it --"
1964.35,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.342,1598.708,Which means he can appoint either a receiver or a trustee?
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1598.708,1599.108,I don't --
1964.35,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1599.108,1604.039,"And Chapter XI specifically says, either a receiver or a trustee can operate the business?"
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1604.039,1613.419,"Well then, I think that has reference to the fact Mr. Justice, if they had previously -- if the company previously had been adjudicated bankrupt and a trustee had been appointed."
1964.35,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.547,1626.546,On what purpose?
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1626.546,1628.382,It's unclear.
1964.35,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1633.042,1642.22,"All I want to know, if it's unclear then you can't say that the Court has no discretion not to appoint somebody else to operate the business."
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1642.22,1648.148,"Well, it's possible that if the Court deems it appropriate, he may appoint a receiver."
1964.35,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.071,1658.186,"I understand that, that's another point."
1964.35,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1659.252,1662.111,Doing all of these things.
1964.35,1,15473,arthur_w_burke_jr,,3590.586,3595.536,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors."
1964.35,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3942.033,3956.033,"You wouldn't argue then that the -- for the best interest of the creditors in Section 366, Chapter XI, includes the fair and equitable."
1964.35,1,15473,arthur_w_burke_jr,,3956.033,3957.384,That is --
1964.35,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3957.384,3960.322,That is used in Chapter X in which you --
1964.35,1,15473,arthur_w_burke_jr,,3960.322,3960.783,No.
1964.35,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3970.414,3970.849,Yes.
1964.35,1,15473,arthur_w_burke_jr,,3977.074,3978.749,"Yes, preserve its equity."
1964.35,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3985.364,3986.713,That's the end product.
1964.35,1,15473,arthur_w_burke_jr,,3987.562,3989.602,That's not -- and until the plan is complete.
1964.35,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3989.602,3990.057,Yes.
1964.35,1,15473,arthur_w_burke_jr,,3990.057,3994.152,"Yes, that's correct."
1964.35,2,36096,marcien_jenckes,,5957.752,5960.845,"I'm pleased Your Honor, may it please the Court."
1964.35,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6041.533,6043.395,What's that citation?
1964.35,2,36096,marcien_jenckes,,6043.395,6049.594,That is the case of the Crumpton Builders case and it has not yet been published in the federal report.
1964.35,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6049.594,6051.035,What's the name?
1964.35,2,36096,marcien_jenckes,,6051.035,6056.166,"Securities and Exchange Commission against Crumpton Builders, Inc."
1964.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6056.166,6056.66,"I'm sorry, I don't get that."
1964.35,2,36096,marcien_jenckes,,6057.732,6069.943,"Crumpton, CR-U-M-P-T-O-N is cited in the Footnote on page 3 of my brief among the other cases and the decision is dated October 21, 1964."
1964.35,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6069.943,6076.66,Was that the case in which the Court of Appeals simply upset the confirmation or did they say that it should be dismissed and brought on the Chapter X?
1964.35,2,36096,marcien_jenckes,,6076.66,6087.25,They said it should be transferred to the Chapter X under the provisions of Sections 328.
1964.35,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6096.902,6100.091,What's the other case?
1964.35,2,36096,marcien_jenckes,,6100.091,6101.872,It depends on the First Circuit on the --
1964.35,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6101.872,6104.431,"What do you have besides the Fifth Circuit Case, there's another case --"
1964.35,2,36096,marcien_jenckes,,6104.431,6112.772,There's one in the Second Circuit which is on the current list and another one in the First Circuit where I appeared.
1964.35,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6129.926,6133.411,(Inaudible)
1964.35,2,36096,marcien_jenckes,,6133.411,6134.536,Neither of them.
1964.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6173.603,6174.845,229?
1964.35,2,36096,marcien_jenckes,,6174.845,6175.885,"221, Your Honor."
1964.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6175.885,6177.722,221
1964.35,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6177.722,6180.821,The citation at the bottom of page 5 of your brief?
1964.35,2,36096,marcien_jenckes,,6180.821,6182.495,Yes.
1964.35,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6182.495,6183.919,In Re American Guaranteed Corporation?
1964.35,2,36096,marcien_jenckes,,6183.919,6185.327,That's right Your Honor.
1964.35,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6185.327,6195.74,Thank you.
1964.35,2,36096,marcien_jenckes,,6195.74,6206.416,The Fifth Circuit Case as I say is easily understandable because those among other facts come strictly within the amended deposition of Chapter XI.
1964.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6495.21,6497.099,Was that a dissenting --
1964.35,2,36096,marcien_jenckes,,6497.099,6497.672,Your Honor?
1964.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6497.672,6498.923,Was that a dissenting opinion?
1964.35,2,36096,marcien_jenckes,,6498.923,6505.622,It was a dissenting opinion Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Judge Bernstein dissented in the General Stores Case.
1964.35,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7238.638,7255.622,"Mr. Chief Justice, I just have three rather brief points I'd like to make on rebuttal but, if the Court would like, the Government will be happy to furnish copies of the opinion in that case, there had been some minor corrections to the slip opinion as it was issued and we'd be happy to furnish the Court with nine copies of the —"
1964.35,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7255.622,7259.836,"You do it immediately, it'll be fine."
1964.35,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7259.836,7261.587,Three points Mr. Chief Justice.
1964.35,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7455.319,7461.748,We'll recess.
