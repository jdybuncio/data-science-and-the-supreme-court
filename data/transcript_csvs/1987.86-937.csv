1987.86-937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.828,"We'll hear argument in Number 86-937, United States against Thomas O. Robinson, Jr.--"
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,12.93,15.951,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-937,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,394.088,396.339,Can't I adopt that in the rule against you?
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,396.339,397.651,--I'm sorry?
1987.86-937,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,397.651,400.223,Can't I adopt that in the rule against you?
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,400.223,403.204,"I don't see how, Justice Marshall."
1987.86-937,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,413.84,416.512,The lawful purpose was to convict the man.
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,416.512,419.575,"--Well, no."
1987.86-937,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,421.107,425.351,"What other lawful... what is ""lawful""?"
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,425.351,426.062,"Well,--"
1987.86-937,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,426.062,427.271,He was there to convict.
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,427.271,429.424,--His overall purpose--
1987.86-937,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,429.424,431.017,Do you dispute that?
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,431.017,441.024,--I don't dispute that the Government is charged in a prosecution it has brought to try and persuade the jury beyond a reasonable doubt of a defendant's guilt or else they wouldn't be there.
1987.86-937,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,464.849,467.07,Could that have been corrected by instruction?
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,467.07,473.635,"It could have been corrected by instruction, but we don't think that it must be corrected by instruction."
1987.86-937,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,494.558,503.683,"The difference between us is I don't think comment on failure to take stand is ""permissible""."
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,503.683,505.596,"Neither do, but I don't--"
1987.86-937,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,505.596,506.745,You just said so.
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,506.745,509.857,"--I respectfully must disagree, Your Honor."
1987.86-937,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,540.047,545.06,"You say the Government said, oh, by the way, he failed to take the stand?"
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,545.06,545.701,--No.
1987.86-937,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,545.701,546.972,"You know, just in passing?"
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,546.972,550.584,"No, I don't think it was a remark in passing."
1987.86-937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,791.912,794.113,"May I ask one question, Mr. Robbins?"
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,825.223,833.569,"The rebuttal argument may have been improper, but not because it violates Griffin."
1987.86-937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.133,871.624,"Well, supposing the prosecutor said, my opponent made the argument that my client or that the defendant didn't have an opportunity to explain during the claims adjustment process, and maybe that's right, but he has had an opportunity at the trial here to come up with the explanation, he hasn't done so, would that be proper rebuttal?"
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,874.887,883.212,My inclination is to think not.
1987.86-937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,901.474,904.486,And it emphasizes before the jury that the man didn't get on the witness stand.
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,904.486,905.545,--That's correct.
1987.86-937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,908.618,932.944,"Well, to put it another way, would you not agree that the rule of Griffin can be violated by some indirect... by emphasizing the failure to testify in the sort of pre-textual way that you don't affirmatively argue as they did in Griffin, that you can draw this inference, but they just kind of emphasize... would you not agree that some kinds of emphasis on the failure to get on the stand violate the basic rule of Griffin?"
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,932.944,939.6,"--I think I am not willing to defend pre-textual arguments, and I think they can happen."
1987.86-937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,957.07,959.732,Lakeside against Oregon.
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,959.732,967.396,"But let me suggest, Justice Stevens, that there is a danger on the other side of the ledger as well with these indirect references to silence."
1987.86-937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.44,1043.928,"If the prosecutor here had not asked for the judge's permission in advance, it seems to me this would be rather close on the factual question that I give you, because I can read some of the comment."
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1055.425,1063.761,"I am, Justice Stevens, not prepared to assert that the defense counsel's remarks are a model of clarity."
1987.86-937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1182.321,1191.127,Is there now some rule prevailing in the federal courts that the United States Attorney has to clear his closing argument with the trial judge?
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1191.127,1197.982,"No, there is not, Mr. Chief Justice, and we don't think our position would be any different had he not done so in this case."
1987.86-937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1238.657,1240.48,I'd like to place some emphasis on it.
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1254.519,1255.491,We agree.
1987.86-937,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1383.914,1390.078,"Well, Mr. Robbins, I suppose if you're right, that it wasn't error in the first place, we wouldn't reach the plainer problem."
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1390.078,1390.879,Exactly.
1987.86-937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.501,1507.654,"But you would agree, wouldn't you, Mr. Robbins, that the test for harmless error is different, depending on whether it's a constitutional error or non-constitutional error?"
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1507.654,1508.615,No question about it.
1987.86-937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1509.346,1512.659,Doesn't that sound like one of them's maybe a little more important than the other?
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1512.659,1528.958,"--Well, we don't think, Justice Stevens, that the Court is required to treat plain error distinctions in the same way, primarily because the plain error doctrine serves a different function in the trial system than the harmless error doctrine does."
1987.86-937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1547.932,1549.231,Which rule would you change?
1987.86-937,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1552.484,1563.95,"--I am inclined to change Chapman and make it much more like Kotteakus, but I am sure of this much, there's no good reason to apply the same distinction in this case."
1987.86-937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1665.829,1667.659,"Thank you, Mr. Robbins."
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,1669.161,1676.567,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-937,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1721.575,1722.877,Were you counsel below?
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,1722.877,1724.377,"--No, sir, I was not."
1987.86-937,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1724.377,1725.088,Were you counsel at trial?
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,1756.3,1758.029,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-937,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.029,1760.231,Are you husband and wife?
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,1760.231,1760.972,"No, sir."
1987.86-937,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1924.249,1928.721,I am not going to the point of whether there's an objection or not.
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,1965.296,1978.923,"If the Court please, it's the Solicitor General's Office who has framed the question presented, that the Government prevented the defendant from explaining his side of the story."
1987.86-937,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.562,2002.509,Trial judge understood defense counsel's argument to... like the Government.
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,2002.509,2004.85,I'm sorry?
1987.86-937,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2005.811,2010.704,Didn't the trial judge understand defense counsel's argument like the Government did?
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,2010.704,2012.236,If--
1987.86-937,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.236,2017.157,At least he permitted the Government to answer it.
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,2017.157,2027.105,"--If I may quote the prosecutor at the side bench conference, he said,"
1987.86-937,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2035.51,2037.042,"Where are you reading from, Ms. Durham?"
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,2037.042,2037.923,I beg your pardon.
1987.86-937,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2040.806,2041.765,Thank you.
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,2041.765,2045.898,At the bottom of the page.
1987.86-937,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2160.213,2175.664,"Well, Ms. Durham, to get back a moment from what the trial court understood, if you go back to page 25 of the transcript, right after that section that you just read about where the prosecutor, Mr. Washko, says,"
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,2212.068,2213.769,"--Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1987.86-937,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2213.769,2214.34,Why?
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,2214.34,2224.907,"Because immediately before this paragraph in the defense counsel's argument on page 19 of the Joint Appendix, what led up to this statement--"
1987.86-937,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2224.907,2234.392,But you are just asking us to interpret in the abstract what do these bunch of words mean that defense counsel said.
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,2250.713,2256.988,"--Well, I submit to you, Your Honor, that the trial judge was mistaken in his interpretation."
1987.86-937,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2303.768,2318.607,"Ms. Durham, assume you can't persuade us on that and that we sort of think it was to be understood the way the trial court understood it, all right, that's not the end of your case."
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,2323.4,2348.688,"--Your Honor, I would say that if I assumed arguendo that, in fact, the question presented did occur and there was some case in which the defense counsel argued to an American jury that the Government prevented the defendant from taking the witness stand and explaining his side of the story, I submit to you that a group of American jurors already know that."
1987.86-937,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2384.171,2404.064,"Well, now, I'm giving you a situation in which, if you accept the trial judge's interpretation of it, defense counsel has said the Government has prevented my client from testifying and explaining to you what really happened here, now what could have been done to remedy that, if he had said that?"
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,2412.579,2439.226,"Certainly, Your Honor, if the defense... under the Young decision, if the defense counsel were standing there saying that to the jury, the Government has prevented this defendant from explaining his side of the story, at that point, ideally, under the Young decision, the court should interrupt and take jurative measures in the form of instructions to the jury and admonishments to the--"
1987.86-937,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.226,2440.388,This is what your case hangs on.
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,2459.352,2460.671,--I do not believe--
1987.86-937,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2460.671,2461.232,"If the judge tells them,--"
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,2461.232,2465.826,--I believe there is more than the two alternatives you suggest.
1987.86-937,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2490.242,2494.974,"--Why is it okay for the trial judge to do that, but not okay for the United States Attorney to do that?"
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,2516.23,2548.03,"If the trial judge should interrupt defense counsel's argument and call him to the bench and tell them that he's misstating the law or if he simply said it in the presence of the jury, you are misstating the law, counsel, and then counsel, if he doesn't understand, if the judge has interpreted what he's saying as meaning that the defendant wasn't allowed to take the stand, counsel can say, may I approach the bench, and then find out that the judge is interpreting what he's saying in that way."
1987.86-937,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2548.03,2558.268,"To a violation here is that the United States Attorney said what the... the very thing that the trial judge should have said, and that's a constitutional violation."
1987.86-937,1,18801,carolou_perry_durham,,2558.268,2571.424,"Sir, I am not suggesting that either the judge or the United States Attorney should say in the presence of the jury that the defendant could have taken the witness stand and testified and explained himself."
1987.86-937,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2650.996,2652.636,"Thank you, Ms. Durham."
1987.86-937,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2655.898,2657.581,"I have no rebuttal, Your Honor."
1987.86-937,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2657.581,2658.522,Very well.
