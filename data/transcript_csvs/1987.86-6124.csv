1987.86-6124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.772,"We'll hear argument now in Number 86-6124, George S. Bennett v. Arkansas."
1987.86-6124,0,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,12.241,15.176,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-6124,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,138.741,148.679,"Mr. Carpenter, now, is there any money at issue here that would be governed by the passage of the 1983 amendments?"
1987.86-6124,0,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,148.679,149.912,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-6124,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,173.628,178.532,"So, if you prevail, he will get reimbursed eventually, is that what would happen?"
1987.86-6124,0,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,178.532,179.032,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-6124,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.901,186.054,And is Petitioner Shelton a party now?
1987.86-6124,0,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,186.054,186.854,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-6124,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.445,210.42,"So, he's not before us at all, and all we have is the case involving reimbursement to a prisoner with social security benefits, is that right?"
1987.86-6124,0,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,210.42,211.053,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-6124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,214.705,216.407,I guess I still don't understand.
1987.86-6124,0,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,222.245,232.75,"I am at this time, Your Honor, for this reason: the money collected from May 1983 until his release in December of 1984 were social security benefits."
1987.86-6124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.116,267.339,"Well, post-May '83, he shouldn't have received it, and it seems to me your complaint is that the state should not have taken them."
1987.86-6124,0,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,268.506,268.708,That's right.
1987.86-6124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.708,278.147,"--And, therefore, there should be no over-payment charged against his future payments."
1987.86-6124,0,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,284.385,284.985,That's right.
1987.86-6124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,284.985,298.026,"But you're not saying he was entitled to any money after 1983, you're just saying he shouldn't be charged after he was released for payments which he never received post-1983."
1987.86-6124,0,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,298.026,300.295,"Your Honor, I'm not sure that I've made myself clear."
1987.86-6124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,307.333,308.116,Right.
1987.86-6124,0,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,308.116,312.718,That was treated as an over-payment from Social Security to Mr. Bennett.
1987.86-6124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,335.734,343.34,What should go to him is not the money between May of '83 and the time he was released.
1987.86-6124,0,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,361.301,362.718,Not on the basis of the statute.
1987.86-6124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,365.287,374.209,"What will happen if monetarily, if this Court reverses the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas, what will Mr. Bennett get?"
1987.86-6124,0,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,374.209,383.917,"--He will get $3,600 which is currently being held, and under the judgment, he will get the interest that's been accruing on that money since the date of the judgment."
1987.86-6124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.917,388.802,"And if we affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court by Arkansas, the State of Arkansas will get that $3,600?"
1987.86-6124,0,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,388.802,389.82,Plus the interest.
1987.86-6124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,389.82,391.02,Okay.
1987.86-6124,0,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,391.02,402.712,The Supremacy Clause is called into question in this particular case because there's a clear conflict in the text of the state reimbursement statute with the federal pre-emption statute.
1987.86-6124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,674.622,675.772,"Thank you, Mr. Carpenter."
1987.86-6124,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,698.321,701.44,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-6124,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1042.88,1044.262,"Thank you, Mr. Lazarus."
1987.86-6124,2,29766,j_steven_clark,,1049.434,1051.886,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-6124,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1226.883,1238.458,"And since the 1983 amendments, you concede that the state can't get any recoupment or take any portion of the benefits?"
1987.86-6124,2,29766,j_steven_clark,,1238.458,1239.541,"For retirement benefits, yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-6124,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1258.768,1263.422,"I'm glad to hear what you've just said, General Clark, because I couldn't see why this amount should be in dispute at all."
1987.86-6124,2,29766,j_steven_clark,,1265.322,1267.557,"Your Honor, I think it is very cut and dry."
1987.86-6124,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.557,1285.002,"Now, as to the rest of it, suppose I provide... suppose my elderly parents live with me and I provide all their food and lodging, would I be able to obtain their... a right to their social security payments?"
1987.86-6124,2,29766,j_steven_clark,,1285.002,1286.187,"No, Your Honor, I think not."
1987.86-6124,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1286.187,1287.42,And why is that?
1987.86-6124,2,29766,j_steven_clark,,1287.42,1293.258,I think the difference in the hypothetical you have offered and what we have in this case is that you've done that by a matter of choice.
1987.86-6124,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1335.085,1359.467,"Suppose I have obligations under state law to support my spouse and my wife becomes old and unable to take care of herself and I fulfill that obligation, provide her room, lodging, food and everything, am I then entitled to get the social security payment because I have an obligation to support her?"
1987.86-6124,2,29766,j_steven_clark,,1359.467,1361.419,"No, Your Honor, I think not."
1987.86-6124,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1397.009,1413.37,"Really, all you have shown so far, it seems to me, General Clark, is that perhaps if Congress had thought about this, it would have said that Arkansas' situation would be an exception to the anti-assignment statute, but you've got the flat language of the anti-assignment statute."
1987.86-6124,2,29766,j_steven_clark,,1413.37,1424.726,"I think, Your Honor, when you look at the plain language, you have to look at the test that I think is specifically identified in the Solicitor General's brief, which says that you look at... that our case is not barred."
1987.86-6124,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1434.817,1443.407,"But, really, the spoken word, the language, if it's clear that that doesn't leave a whole lot of room for something else."
1987.86-6124,2,29766,j_steven_clark,,1443.407,1448.175,"--Well, Your Honor, this Court in Rose v. Rose could have taken that very same approach but did not."
1987.86-6124,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1562.617,1566.538,"Congress also said you're wrong in thinking you get it, we get it."
1987.86-6124,2,29766,j_steven_clark,,1566.538,1568.071,"--Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-6124,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1834.127,1835.579,"Thank you, General Clark."
1987.86-6124,3,42524,thomas_m_carpenter,,1838.281,1841.067,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-6124,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2034.025,2035.008,"Thank you, Mr. Carpenter."
