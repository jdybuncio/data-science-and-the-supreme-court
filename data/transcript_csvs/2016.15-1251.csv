2016.15-1251,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.91,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 15-1251, National Labor Relations Board v. Southwest General, Incorporated. Mr. Acting Assistant Attorney General."
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,11.91,53.485,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Vacancy Reform Act's limitation on an individual serving as both the nominee and as the acting official for a single office applies only to someone who is currently the first assistant in that office and is acting pursuant to the automatic service rule set forth in Subsection 3345(a)(1). Both the GAO and OLC adopted that interpretation of the Act shortly after its passage. And in the nearly two decades from passage of the Act until the D.C. Circuit decision here, Presidents of both parties have made scores of nominations and designations based on that interpretation of the text without recorded objection from even a single Senator or staff member."
2016.15-1251,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,53.485,68.33,"General Gershengorn, can I ask: As you read this statute, suppose you just took out these words ""notwithstanding Section"" -- ""Subsection (a)(1)."" What would then the effect of the statute be?"
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,68.33,81.94,"So, Your Honor, I think that our textual argument would be much more difficult, and the effect of the statute would be effectively to override (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3). The ""notwithstanding"" clause really is the anchor of our textual interpretation."
2016.15-1251,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,91.19,92.83,But just focusing on text for a minute.
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,92.83,92.92,Sure.
2016.15-1251,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,92.92,109.45,"If that's true, if the entire textual argument really does rest on the ""notwithstanding Subsection (a)(1)"" -- I mean, typically when you have a ""notwithstanding"" clause, it means, you know, take away Subsection (a)(1), not, you know, close your eyes to Subsection (a)(1)"
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,118.105,124.87,"Your Honor, we think that because it's a routine application of the expressio unius canon in the context of the ""notwithstanding"" clause."
2016.15-1251,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,187.84,189.085,But can I give you a hypo?
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,189.085,189.41,Sure.
2016.15-1251,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,189.41,195.63,"So the hypo is, I'm at a restaurant, and I -- I'm talking to my waiter, and I place three orders."
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,222.725,240.19,"So, Your Honor, I think this really is fundamentally different for a number of reasons. First of all, we have before us, in contrast to your -- your waiter hypothetical, we have before us the very history of this clause which suggests an interpretation very much in line with the government's interpretation."
2016.15-1251,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,240.19,258.02,"So I -- I take it, you know, you have some arguments, some strong arguments on -- on history and on practice, but, you know, again, I'm just sort of -- isn't that just a peculiar way to understand the, you know, notwithstanding order number three, no strawberries?"
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,258.02,345.84,"So I don't think it is, Your Honor, and I -- I -- in a footnote, the -- if, for example, you had been a routine -- a regular member of that restaurant -- regular diner at that restaurant and had always understood that you couldn't have strawberries with only one of those things, then the waiter would be justified in interpreting it differently, and we have that contemporaneous practice here. But given Your Honor's textural point only for the moment, I do think that's exactly what this Court held in Preseault, in -- in -- where there was a ""notwithstanding"" clause, that said, notwithstanding the provisions of the Act, funds -- that you have to rely on advance appropriations, and this Court said, no, that doesn't override the existence of the Tucker Act. I point the Court as well to the case cited in our brief, SEC v. Mount Vernon Memorial Park, which is a situation extremely similar to this, if I could just take a sec on that because I think it will help. That was an interpretation of the Investment Company Act, and it said, ""An investment company is an issuer who meets one of the following: (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3)."" And for (a)(3), there was something called a (b)(1) limitation, and it said ""Notwithstanding (a)(3), an issuer is"" -- ""you're not an issuer unless you're in the business of issuing securities."" And what the Court said was that the issuer who fell within that limitation, the same (b)(1) limitation, nonetheless was an investment company under (a)(2) precisely because the introductory limitation was limited to notwithstanding (a)(3), and that case is cited in our brief."
2016.15-1251,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,367.36,387.61,"Isn't there another explanation for why the ""notwithstanding"" clause of (b)(1) refers only to (a)(1)? If it -- without that, there would be a direct conflict between (b)(1) and (a)(1) because (a)(1) says ""shall,"" the first assistant shall perform."
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,407.975,412.28,"So, Your Honor, that is the argument that respondents make, and we simply disagree with that."
2016.15-1251,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,439.3,441.725,But it's not quite the same kind of conflict.
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,463.74,480.68,"So, Your Honor, I do think that there -- I do think there would be, and I think in particular, even apart from the restaurant hypo itself, the whole purpose of (a)(2) is to give the President the power to make a designation when he believes there's a superior official serving elsewhere in the government."
2016.15-1251,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,526.55,530.15,You went into detail without any elaboration.
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,547.08,558.57,"So, Your Honor, I think -- so, two points -- a number of points, but two responding directly to both of those. With respect to OLC, our point is not that this Court should defer to it or defer to the reasoning in it."
2016.15-1251,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,610.665,615.77,"Well, I think you're putting a significant burden on Congress to sort of speak up."
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,659.19,675.67,"So, Your Honor, if -- we're not imposing a burden on the Branch, but we are asking you not to turn a blind eye to what really happened in this context. What lead up to the Vacancy Reform Act was -- was decades of Congress raising exactly the kind of objections that one would expect."
2016.15-1251,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,712.9,725.92,"But you have on the other side -- was it Senator Thompson, you have Senator Byrd who seemed to be putting on it the construction that Respondents do."
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,725.92,746.4,"So, Your Honor, I think that actually Senator Byrd is quite -- is quite vague about that and omits the ""notwithstanding"" language. But even if you thought that was sort of a draw, I would note that Senator Byrd, who again was not shy and had weighed in on these Vacancies Act issues, never raised an objection when the -- when Presidents across three administrations continued it into --"
2016.15-1251,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,746.4,747.09,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,773.76,786.445,"Your Honor, I disagree -- I don't -- I don't disagree with Your Honor. It is merely one, though, of a consistent stream given the OLC and GAO opinion. So I really would like to get back to the Chief Justice's point, if I could."
2016.15-1251,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,806.42,807.13,How is that -- I'm sorry.
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,807.13,808.23,And given the past history --
2016.15-1251,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,808.23,811.29,How is that not -- how is that not an estoppel?
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,811.29,812.24,"It's not an estoppel, Your Honor."
2016.15-1251,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,825.52,831.52,"Sounds like the point I was trying to make, is: You are putting weight on the fact that they didn't do anything."
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,836.74,837.45,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2016.15-1251,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,861.59,873.39,What would be the consequences if we affirm? Your brief didn't list a great parade of horribles.
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,889.08,899.365,"So, Your Honor, I believe there are important consequences. So, first, Congress understood that there are often important positions that don't have first assistants to take over."
2016.15-1251,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,933.715,936.83,Can I ask you about the consequences going backward?
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,936.83,937.17,Yes.
2016.15-1251,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,937.17,949.235,"Your brief did not talk about this, but do you think that if we find against you, that that subjects to some uncertainty actions that these 100-plus officials took?"
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,949.235,949.79,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1251,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,949.79,951.105,"If so, what actions?"
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,951.105,960.18,"So, Your Honor, it does -- and that's the second point to Justice Kennedy's question. It does subject the past officials to substantial uncertainty."
2016.15-1251,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,974.07,981.16,"What did Judge Henderson say about that? This is not going to be a floodgate situation, because you would have to raise it."
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1002.71,1008.835,"So, Your Honor, I'm in a tough position, because I don't want to argue too hard against defenses that we're going to want to assert later."
2016.15-1251,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1021.685,1034.535,"Suppose you didn't have those defenses, because, you know, I'm not sure why you would necessarily, given that the statute says they're void ab initio if people take it as against these procedures."
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1045.505,1051.845,"So, Your Honor, we have, for example, Adam Szubin, who was the Undersecretary For Terrorism and Financial Crimes."
2016.15-1251,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1088.97,1090.04,Can I just press you a little bit?
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1090.04,1090.625,Sure.
2016.15-1251,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1090.625,1103.695,"I mean, those are all very important positions that you named, but it's not absolutely clear to me that those -- that there are categories of decisions that those people take that we should be worried about."
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1107.72,1110.14,"So, Your Honor, I can't list them chapter and verse."
2016.15-1251,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1138.02,1140.94,Does that 100 include or exclude military officers? Do you know?
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1140.94,1143.57,"It is not including military officers, Your Honor."
2016.15-1251,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1304.18,1310.07,"Well, why do you -- why and how do you think that that change was made, then? Because the change clearly was made."
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1326.49,1327.755,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2016.15-1251,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1435.275,1458.86,"If you -- if your -- if your interpretation is the correct one, what is your answer to the horrible that appears in the -- in the Respondent's brief at 33 to 34? They say if you read the statute the way the government does, then you could have somebody in there who has never been read -- approved by Congress, by the Senate."
2016.15-1251,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1465.41,1473.625,"So, Your Honor, the response to that is there's no doubt that someone can serve for that length of time, and that Congress understood that."
2016.15-1251,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1550.485,1557.415,"Thank you, Mr. Gershengorn. Mr. Dvoretzky."
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1557.415,1574.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Four features of the FVRA's text and drafting history compel our interpretation. First, Congress used the broad terms ""a person"" and ""this section."" Second, ""notwithstanding"" is a term of expansion."
2016.15-1251,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1596.99,1615.81,"I -- I agree that ""person"" and ""section"" are very strong arguments for you. Suppose what the statute said is ""notwithstanding (a)(1) and (a)(2)""? And what -- what would then be your argument with respect to whether or not it affected (a)(3)?"
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1615.81,1621.35,"I still think in that circumstance that ""person"" and ""section"" would apply to (a)(3)"
2016.15-1251,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1642.065,1643.96,"I don't get that, Mr. Dvoretzky."
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1685.515,1704.09,"Justice Kagan, the difference is that (a)(1) is a self-executing provision. It automatically places the first assistant into the vacant office, and (b)(1) then takes the person out. (A)(2) and (a)(3) are grants of discretion that has to be understood side by side with --"
2016.15-1251,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1704.09,1718.17,"But those grants of discretion are very broad, and then (b)(1) again takes the person out, takes the person out of the grant of discretion, just as it takes the person out of the self-executing provision before them."
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1718.17,1724.47,"They -- they are broad only if read in isolation, but they can't be read in isolation as a statutory matter."
2016.15-1251,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1758.54,1765.465,"I have to say, I find it a little bit odd to think of this drafter thinking of the kind of distinction you're making."
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1798.51,1854.195,"Well, perhaps one way to think of it, and this goes back to your first question of the argument, what if you had a statute that didn't have any ""notwithstanding"" clause at all at the beginning of (b)(1)? In that situation it would be clear that ""person"" and ""section"" would make (b)(1) applicable to (a)(2) and (a)(3). There would be a question in that situation, though, whether (b)(1) also applied to (a)(1), first of all, because of the starkness of the conflict between (a)(1) and (b)(1), and second of all, the government argues that the general versus specific canon would apply there, but it wouldn't necessarily because the general versus specific canon is typically invoked in order to avoid superfluity where you have one general provision and a specific provision that would be meaningless if not read as an exception to the general. Here, however, in -- in the hypothetical statute without the ""notwithstanding"" clause, you wouldn't have superfluity concern because (b)(1) would apply to (a)(2) and (a)(3)"
2016.15-1251,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1865.65,1872.92,"So what about (c)(1)? Isn't, under your reading, it -- it will never be in effect?"
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1872.92,1873.62,No.
2016.15-1251,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1905.025,1928.375,"So why aren't (a)(2) and (a)(3) functioning separately from (a)(1)? If -- if (c)(1) can function separately, and that was the thought of the drafters, why don't we carry it to its logical conclusion? (a)(1) is separate from -- they are written almost identically."
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1937.745,1944.53,The reason that (c)(1) functions separately is that it describes the work that the official is doing in a different way.
2016.15-1251,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1964.16,1999.855,"Why -- why -- the thing -- I'd like to go back to the Solicitor General's last point, and that's where I'm having -- I have a puzzle. I'd like to hear what you have to say. I mean, for the purposes of this question, I'm assuming all the text, which sounds to me, if a person came from Mars, that's what he would expect a legal argument to be like. The -- the number's all over had the place, and I will also assume that for every chef salad there is a countervailing strawberry shortcake; all right? So -- so everything balances out."
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2035.825,2037.11,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1251,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2037.11,2038.21,I'm using examples.
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2071.944,2073.12,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1251,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.12,2073.72,Okay.
2016.15-1251,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.5,2111.745,"Why is it you're perfectly willing to have stay there and do the acting job the first assistant, if he served 90 days before, but you're not willing to have served the acting job this guy who was a GS-18 in the same department, or the person who was an assistant secretary of the Treasury, number two. Why? I can't think of an answer given your interpretation. I can think of an answer given their interpretation."
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2157.385,2194.13,"So I'd like to respond, first of all, to why it makes sense to treat first assistants differently, and second of all, to Bill Lann Lee and how that is relevant to the statute. The legislative history explains in multiple places that first assistants are particularly well-suited to be the acting official because they represent continuity and regularity in the office. We know from (b)(1) that Congress was concerned with at least some acting service by nominees. And the reason that it created an exception for first assistants, even as nominees, is that they are the least likely to represent change in the agency."
2016.15-1251,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2279.63,2301.375,"If -- if Mr. Solomon had been confirmed, you -- you say that that would be all right, even -- even with the erroneous nomination of him while he was acting. But -- so he's confirmed for the permanent office."
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2311.08,2313.18,"Well, it's not necessarily invalidated."
2016.15-1251,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2325.755,2335.29,So his confirmation would be irrelevant to what happens to what was done prior to the confirmation?
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2335.29,2336.08,That's right.
2016.15-1251,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2342.34,2345.33,If -- there's one other peculiarity of this.
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2392.8,2398.635,Because Senate confirmation for one position is not fungible with Senate confirmation for another.
2016.15-1251,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2430.755,2434.0,You -- you want to respond to Justice Breyer's point about Mr. Lee?
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2434.0,2443.165,"I do want to get back to the point about Mr. Lee. The concern about Mr. Lee was not just that he was brought in from the outside at the last minute, which is what the government emphasizes."
2016.15-1251,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2501.51,2515.47,"Can I ask Mr. Dvoretzky about the post-enactment history? Because, you know, we're generally reluctant to demand that Congress objects to things. But on the other hand, the -- the history here is so strong."
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2542.92,2550.84,"Several points in response to that. First, just identifying these FVRA violations is not an easy thing to do."
2016.15-1251,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2589.94,2590.43,I don't know.
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2599.11,2605.9,"You might add that, but it would be a gratuitous addition to what is really the fundamental concern with the nominee."
2016.15-1251,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2605.9,2608.79,"Seems like it gives it some real extra oomph, right? (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1251,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2608.79,2614.455,It's not just -- it's not just a matter of my preferences versus the government's preferences.
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2623.575,2632.44,Somebody who then was going to be pressed and had to explain the technicalities of why the appointment was illegal. (Laughter.)
2016.15-1251,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2632.44,2642.335,You -- you have been -- and I understand -- you've been concerned about instances in which there is controversy over appointment.
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2733.239,2743.94,The -- the first assistant restriction in (b)(1) reflects that Congress clearly was concerned about some acting officials who are also the permanent nominee.
2016.15-1251,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2892.28,2908.64,"And defeating the efficient running of the department at the same time, because if the person has been running the department, now you're going to put it through a second dislocation of having that person removed and somebody else step in."
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2908.64,2913.205,"Again, in practice, over a third of the time, that doesn't happen."
2016.15-1251,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2914.72,2923.45,It hasn't happened because no one's read it the way you have and invalidated that person's actions so far.
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2923.45,2924.06,"Well, no."
2016.15-1251,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2945.15,2952.555,"The Senate is taking a long time to confirm, even when they're not objecting."
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2952.555,2962.92,"So in -- in this particular case, after Mr. Solomon had served for some two-and-a-half years, when the President put up a permanent nominee, the Senate confirmed him in a matter of months."
2016.15-1251,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3083.74,3088.435,"The way you described that, you sound a bit skeptical of those defenses. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3088.435,3095.82,"Well, skeptical only in the sense that they're not at issue in this case, and they haven't been litigated."
2016.15-1251,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3112.47,3114.74,"So you say that you can bring those cases, too?"
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3114.74,3115.475,I'm sorry?
2016.15-1251,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3115.475,3123.555,"Telling us -- so that -- you can bring those cases, too, or for other people to bring them? They're in a real catch-22 situation."
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3123.555,3139.43,"The fact is, though, it's their burden to show the consequences of their actions. And the government's track record on this shows just the opposite; shows that these officials supposedly are not doing anything that would actually be invalidated."
2016.15-1251,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3139.43,3147.0,"So is Mr. Solomon's case atypical, the general counsel to the NLRB?"
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3147.0,3156.745,"Well, it's atypical in the sense that it is, under 3348(e), the ""no force and effect"" language doesn't apply to the general counsel of the NLRB."
2016.15-1251,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3287.375,3302.24,"Wasn't that the argument, is that language, ""person"" and ""this section,"" were in the prior bill, where it -- it applied only to first -- What do you call it?"
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3302.24,3303.73,Only to first assistants.
2016.15-1251,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3303.73,3304.46,-- first assistants?
2016.15-1251,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3304.46,3319.48,"Because -- because the -- that's true, but the language in the prior bill had an old version of (b)(1) -- this is, again, at 19A of the cert petition -- that made clear that the only persons we were talking about were persons who are serving as first assistants."
