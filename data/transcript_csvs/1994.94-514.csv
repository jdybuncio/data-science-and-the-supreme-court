1994.94-514,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.068,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94 514, the United States v. Michael Gaudin."
1994.94-514,0,39502,richard_a_hansen,,10.609,13.641,"It is, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,13.641,15.821,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-514,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.3,114.376,"If you were deciding it as an original proposition it would make sense to say it was a mixed question of law and fact, wouldn't it?"
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,114.376,138.633,"I think that it might make sense in some cases to describe it as a mixed question of law and fact, Justice O'Connor, but the question of what kinds of facts need to be determined either in a perjury or a prosecution under 1001 is very different from the kinds of historical facts that we usually associate with a jury determination such as, did the defendant do it, and what his intent was."
1994.94-514,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.533,180.628,In prosecutions under 1001 does it depend at all on what the issue is?
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,200.871,232.904,"In a normal 1001 prosecution the ultimate question that the court is asking is, would the particular misstatement have the capability of affecting the decision of the agency, and the proposition to be established is, what are the agency's functions as a matter of law, what is it authorized to carry out and, in some cases, it may go down to a somewhat more refined policy level of what is the agency actually trying to do within the broad scope of its statutory mandate?"
1994.94-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,248.713,259.481,"Now, in this case the trial court held a hearing to determine what effect the agency officials give to these applications?"
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,259.481,262.684,"No, I don't think in this case the judge held a hearing on that."
1994.94-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,293.052,302.168,"In your view, was that testimony significant in helping the judge form his conclusion?"
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,302.168,305.592,"--Well, I don't know, since the judge didn't write an opinion."
1994.94-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.497,328.114,"It seems to me that if I were the trial judge in this case I wouldn't have had the slightest idea of how these forms worked, and that I would have wanted to hear the testimony, and that indicates that it's something that I don't know much about as a matter of law, and that is a jury question."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,328.114,344.397,"--Well, I think that it indicates that the details of any particular program are something that needs to be established to the satisfaction of the court that's hearing the particular case, but that alone, in our view, isn't enough to treat the issue as one that must be resolved by the jury."
1994.94-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,344.397,360.135,"Well, do you think that it might have been proper in a case like this for the judge to hold a hearing outside the presence of the jury in order to make his determination, or her determination, whether or not the agency would reasonably rely on these matters, whether or not it would be material?"
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,360.135,364.279,"Well, the judge could have held a hearing outside the hearing of the jury."
1994.94-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,365.28,366.339,Does that ever occur in any--
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,366.339,367.08,"Yes, it does--"
1994.94-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,367.08,367.471,--other kind of criminal case?
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,367.471,383.132,"--Yes, it does occur in this kind of case as well as in a perjury case where judges want to decide the issue of materiality and for one reason or another the evidence isn't admissible in the case in chief, so that a hearing outside the presence of the jury would be appropriate."
1994.94-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,383.132,386.912,Do we do this in any cases where the issue is something other than materiality?
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,387.332,392.178,"If there are very many issues like that, there aren't too many of them."
1994.94-514,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,443.6,465.526,"--But Mr. Dreeben, you recognize that in the case of material misrepresentations to a private party, for example in the securities area, that those are regarded as questions for the jury, the materiality of a misrepresentation, say, in a proxy statement."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,465.526,466.415,We do concede that.
1994.94-514,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,466.415,469.477,So how... what is the distinction?
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,479.965,499.456,"Well, I think that the line that history has drawn is between the materiality of false statements to private parties and the materiality of false statements to Government bodies, and we accept that line as one that has enough basis in reason to survive the question of whether it violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment."
1994.94-514,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,586.936,593.51,"You're assuming that judges will all agree, so it would be... every judge would agree on what's material."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,593.51,611.209,"I'm not making the factual assumption that every judge would agree, but I do make the assertion that when a question of law is at issue there is only one right answer to the question that judges should reach in determining whether an agency would have viewed particular information--"
1994.94-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,611.209,616.985,"Well, you could say that as to whether particular acts affect interstate commerce under the Hobbs Act, and that always goes to a jury, doesn't it?"
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,616.985,630.694,"--Well, the question of what is proved in a particular case does go to the jury, but I think that judges routinely instruct juries that if certain facts are found they constitute the requisite effect on interstate commerce--"
1994.94-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,630.694,632.134,"Well, we could say the same thing here."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,647.845,661.004,"--Well, I think that there is a substantial potential for disuniformity if you entrust the question of whether an agency would have been capable of being influenced by a particular piece of information to juries."
1994.94-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,661.004,661.983,"Yes, but that's an argument against the jury system."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,670.111,683.859,"Well, the... in our system, the threshold question of deciding whether the jury decides a particular issue is how the court system, the judicial system, classifies it as an issue of law or an issue of fact."
1994.94-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,683.859,688.6,"But that cannot inform our answer, because that would simply involve us in total circularity."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,688.6,691.812,"I don't think it involves the Court in total circularity, Justice Souter."
1994.94-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,702.02,719.212,"All right, but if we do that, it seems to me we could say, well, when the materiality issue is simply a strictly relational issue, if it's strictly an issue of relevance, okay, there's a good common law antecedent for saying it is a question of law and nothing but that."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,781.062,821.998,"I don't dispute, Justice Souter, the inquiry of 1001 does involve a bit more than a strict relational inquiry, but I submit that the core of the inquiry is a relational issue, and the determination of what the fact must relate to... in other words, what the policy actually is... is in most cases one that can be resolved as a pure question of law, and I don't think that the Court should assume that in the typical 1001 case that the issue is whether some individual agency official sitting in some office can dictate whether the Government values or doesn't value particular information based on his testimony."
1994.94-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,821.998,829.174,"Well, that then leaves you with, I suppose, the reasonable official, given the responsibilities that the law imposes."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,829.174,830.473,"That is right, and I think that what--"
1994.94-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,830.473,837.089,"Why doesn't that, therefore, get you right into the analogy with tort law, reasonable person questions, or classic jury questions?"
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,837.089,853.948,"--Well, I think certainly what a reasonable person... a reasonable private person would do is one that tort law has assigned to the jury system, but what a reasonable agency official would do, what a hypothetical reasonable governmental official would do is a categorically different question."
1994.94-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,853.948,862.323,"Well, in the sense that there is a legal fact that is one of the facts that would inform the judgment."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,862.323,867.947,"But I think just to state that proposition, Justice Souter, is to illustrate why it's an appropriate determination for a court."
1994.94-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,879.705,880.005,You're right.
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,895.846,915.218,"--Well, it doesn't, and the reason that I think that the Court doesn't have to make such a sweeping analysis in this case in order to decide it in the Government's favor is that the notion of what constitutes a mixed question of law and fact is one that we commonly use and associate with the standards applicable to appellate review."
1994.94-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,932.392,957.747,"Whenever the question before a trial court is, in the same sense that it is here, one in which facts about the law as well as facts about the world outside the law have to be taken into consideration, I take it your position would be, when that is the sense of the mixed law and fact question, it's always going to be a question... it may constitutionally always be a question reserved for the court?"
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,957.747,960.749,"--No, I would not go that far, and I don't think that I have to go that far."
1994.94-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,987.316,998.253,"Well, but what if the issue involved whether this particular defendant had acted as a reasonable person subject to the legal responsibilities that taxpayers have would have acted?"
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1005.89,1028.703,"--I don't think so, not in a criminal case, and again, what we are primarily talking about there is the difference between private conduct and the conduct of those people who are agents of and who represent the Government, and we're talking about that against the backdrop of a very long tradition in our law, not only in perjury cases but also in cases that arise under section 1001, which is a fairly broad statute."
1994.94-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1028.703,1033.925,"Yes, but how long does that... that goes... takes you back to sometime in the 19th Century, but that's as far as that tradition goes."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1033.925,1053.01,"Well, the... as far as we have been able to ascertain from reviewing all of the legal sources available, although the crime of perjury is a very old crime and it has always included an issue of materiality as a prerequisite for conviction, there doesn't seem to have been very much debate on the issue until the 19th Century."
1994.94-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1070.942,1075.583,But we would be going a step beyond that if we hold your way in this case.
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1075.583,1102.07,"I don't think that... I think the step, if the Court has to take a step further, is a very small step indeed, because it was always recognized, as I said, even in the perjury cases, that there might have to be some limited amount of fact finding to determine what the issues in the prior trial were, and to determine what the testimony is alleged to be, and I think that those really form analogues to what courts have to do in resolving materiality under section 1001."
1994.94-514,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1102.561,1111.908,"Mr. Dreeben, now, the defendant below did not object to the instruction that was given saying it was a question of law, is that right?"
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1111.908,1112.158,--That's correct.
1994.94-514,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1112.499,1116.751,And so the lower courts treated it as a matter of plain error.
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1116.751,1117.912,They did.
1994.94-514,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1117.912,1123.826,And do you think that any so called Winship type error is always plain error?
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1123.826,1124.286,No.
1994.94-514,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1125.186,1126.087,Why should this be?
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1126.087,1128.458,--We do not think this should be plain error.
1994.94-514,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1128.458,1134.713,But you don't quarrel with our resolution of it on the merits.
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1134.713,1135.224,No.
1994.94-514,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1175.729,1177.051,"May I ask you a question, Mr. Dreeben?"
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1180.382,1180.982,--Yes.
1994.94-514,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1180.982,1184.674,"The Sinclair case, the history of perjury trials, and you never got to the third."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1184.674,1209.713,"I think the third one has been brought out in the Court's questions, which is that once the determination that a question before the Court is one that is classifiable as a legal issue, this Court's decisions in In Re Winship, which recognized a principle that antedated In Re Winship and that has been since reaffirmed, namely that the jury must decide the factual components of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, is not implicated."
1994.94-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1238.2,1252.509,"Mr. Dreeben, can you... you gave us one example of a prosecution in which an element would be... an element of the crime would be found by the judge, other than this one, and that was whether particular land is within the territory of the United States."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1253.45,1258.734,"Well, I hesitate to give very many examples, because the issue doesn't arise often enough to generalize."
1994.94-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1258.734,1262.025,"Oh, it would really help me a lot to know that this is a common occurrence."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1262.025,1265.248,I would not be able to give Your Honor that assurance.
1994.94-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1280.208,1294.507,"What about a prosecution under section 1984 for depriving someone of civil rights, a conspiracy to deprive someone of civil rights, and the deprivation is that two law enforcement officers conspire to conduct an unreasonable search and seizure."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1298.05,1300.841,I haven't seen the question put.
1994.94-514,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1325.866,1330.011,Does the principle of judicial notice have any application in criminal cases?
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1330.011,1336.425,"It does, to the extent that the Court is the proper body for resolving the issue."
1994.94-514,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1379.643,1399.785,"Is there an analogy between that, and I'm not sure there is, and the earlier discussion you had with some of the other of my colleagues about an administrative agency, that the judge might well instruct the jury about what the duties of the agency are and what its responsibilities under the law, but then leave the question... with that kind of guidance say the material issues shall be decided in that light?"
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1399.785,1411.693,"--Well, I think that's the strongest analogy that respondent could have in support of his position, but I would return to three reasons why that is not the path this Court should go down in this case."
1994.94-514,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1470.15,1483.08,"Well, but I don't quite follow that, because it might well be true that fact A is terribly important to a certain group of administrators, even administering the same statute, whereas other administrators may say, get on the... say we never pay any attention to fact A.--"
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1483.08,1484.301,But under section 1001--
1994.94-514,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1484.301,1485.39,--That should not matter.
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1485.39,1491.595,"--in contrast to some statutes that does not matter at all, because the ultimate legal issue is whether it could affect the activities of a department or agency."
1994.94-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1511.617,1511.957,Mr. Dreeben--
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1514.839,1515.1,--Whether it's--
1994.94-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1515.1,1516.061,--or whether or not it is likely to?
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1516.061,1521.435,"--Whether it's predictably capable of, or whether it has a natural tendency to affect the agency or--"
1994.94-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1521.435,1526.638,"Well, but that might very well vary from region to region in the country, depending on the way a statute is administered."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1526.638,1528.631,"--Well, as a particular factual matter--"
1994.94-514,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1528.631,1531.923,"Perhaps that ought not to be the case, but perhaps that is in fact the case."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1531.923,1546.382,"--Yes, it can, but it has never been the law that under section 1001 particular agency officials that occupy particular positions are able to nullify what could affect that agency's determination under its overall authority and program to act."
1994.94-514,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1547.671,1549.534,Maybe that's because you never let it go to the jury.
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1549.534,1550.252,"--Well, I think that--"
1994.94-514,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1561.901,1571.037,"Does it have any relationship to special doctrines that apply to actors for the Government, like there's no estoppel against the Government based on the particular agent's... is it--"
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1571.037,1581.626,I think that that strongly supports the position that we're taking that materiality is not something that individual agency officials are in a position to create or destroy by their individual conduct.
1994.94-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1581.626,1586.917,"--But if the inquiry becomes one about what the reasonable agent does, that's no problem."
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1586.917,1596.624,"This Court has never framed the inquiry in terms of a reasonable agency official, and I would further submit that the question of what reasonable governmental actors do is quite different from reasonable private actors."
1994.94-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1597.976,1605.791,Because of the fact that the legal responsibilities inform the judgment.
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1605.791,1606.321,--That's correct.
1994.94-514,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1606.321,1606.662,Yes.
1994.94-514,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1606.662,1608.0,I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
1994.94-514,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1608.0,1608.851,"Very well, Mr. Dreeben."
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,1610.542,1615.046,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.431,1654.913,"You speak of the requirements of Winship, Mr. Hansen."
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,1669.723,1693.058,"It did not revolutionize the criminal law, but it recognized, for example, the broad application of that Fifth Amendment requirement, and the Sixth Amendment cases certainly do recognize that wherever the court is dealing with a fact bound element... and really in Kungys, even, this Court characterized in a footnote the determination of materiality as fact bound, which is why the Ninth Circuit adopted that language."
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1699.913,1701.483,What do you do with the Sinclair case?
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,1704.455,1708.418,"With due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, we can distinguish Sinclair."
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1753.316,1760.152,But does materiality involve the same kind of inquiry every single time you have the word materiality?
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,1764.385,1768.236,"I think that's a very critical issue to examine, and we ask the Court to--"
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1768.236,1769.517,"Well, will you examine it right now?"
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,1769.517,1771.037,"--I certainly will, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1783.265,1790.732,"But whether it's a fact bound inquiry or what the precise element is, you look at the statute for it."
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,1793.223,1797.056,"No, you don't, and in this case, Your Honor, the Court never did look at a single statute."
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1819.86,1820.111,Well--
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,1820.111,1820.571,--et cetera.
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1820.571,1836.271,"--the question presented by the Government's petition for certiorari... in a prosecution under section 1001 for making false statements in a matter within the jurisdiction of a Federal agency, is the materiality of those statements to be resolved by the court rather than the jury +/?"
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,1839.004,1845.938,"You would, and as a matter of statutory interpretation, every court that's examined it has determined that materiality is an essential element."
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1861.799,1868.063,"So in looking at the language of 1001, where do you find the materiality requirement?"
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,1868.063,1871.924,Materiality is stated that... directly in the statute.
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1871.924,1872.455,Material fact?
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,1872.455,1877.978,"Yes, a material fact, and I think it's instructive that the statute itself talks about material facts."
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1880.97,1881.892,"Well, but it says--"
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,1881.892,1882.312,--argue to this Court.
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1882.312,1886.453,"--wilfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up a material fact."
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,1893.288,1894.77,We submit that it does.
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1895.469,1907.768,"You submit that just because the noun, fact, is being modified by the adjective, material, that means that... the adjective means it's a factual thing?"
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,1907.768,1912.202,--There's much more to it that supports my conclusion that it is factual.
1994.94-514,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1928.111,1935.566,"Well, the... couldn't you say the same as... in a... as a matter of relevance to a perjury conviction?"
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,1940.919,1942.141,Correct.
1994.94-514,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1942.141,1947.144,And this judge now doesn't look to what actually would have affected the jury.
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2004.551,2015.288,"I would say that the similarity, the much stronger similarity exists between 1001 prosecutions, which have nothing to do with a court proceeding, as perjury does, or with a congressional proceeding."
1994.94-514,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2015.288,2017.999,"Yes, but you see judges are not only experts on court proceedings."
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2036.852,2045.761,"Justice Breyer, as many of the cases have said, the distinction between law and fact which the Government is resting upon here--"
1994.94-514,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.761,2058.286,"No, no, it's fact, but it's certain facts about how programs work based upon your knowledge of statutes, regulatory things, rather than what actually influences, just as relevance is fact."
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2079.831,2082.784,--I agree that that analogy of law and fact does not help.
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2154.741,2158.272,You're saying that was not an element of the offense in Sinclair?
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2158.272,2160.265,"--In Sinclair the Court uses the term, element."
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2168.169,2173.212,What's the difference between the sense we're speaking of it here and the sense it was used in Sinclair?
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2173.212,2175.746,"--Whether it was a proper question, was the issue in Sinclair."
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2194.155,2196.376,But that's not the way the Court treated it in Sinclair.
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2196.376,2205.593,"No, and it's not the way the courts have treated it under 1001 or under securities fraud cases, where it's clearly, legislatively, an element of the offense that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt."
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2208.735,2208.975,Well--
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2208.975,2209.375,--relevance--
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2209.375,2209.726,"--Yes, but--"
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2209.726,2210.207,--and elements.
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2210.207,2228.839,"--There's also, I think, a great potential for confusion if you can bring in all sorts of witnesses that would say, you know, a reasonable person would have thought this, or a reasonable person would have thought that, about whether an agency official might have... you know, you can probably bring in the whole hierarchy of the agency and get 18 different answers."
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2228.839,2231.471,"But that's not what happens in these cases, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2231.471,2239.906,"Well, it may not be what's happened so far because no circuit agrees with the Ninth Circuit, but if the Ninth Circuit is affirmed I think it will start happening."
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2239.906,2260.28,"Well, I would submit that the same kind of cross examination that has occurred in past cases where the Court has determined it would be the same kind of cross examination that would occur if the jury determined it, namely... in this case was the payment of 38 in closing costs, which is the lowest amount of any of the accounts in a multi 10,000 loan transaction."
1994.94-514,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2285.445,2288.727,What is your position on the perjury statute?
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2288.727,2294.201,My position is that any other statutes need to be examined for legislative extent.
1994.94-514,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2317.465,2321.298,"Well, it is an element, isn't it, in most perjury statutes... materiality?"
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2321.298,2322.61,It certainly is with--
1994.94-514,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2322.61,2328.534,"So what you're saying, then, the whole line of cases, the whole perjury line of cases is incorrectly decided, I guess."
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2328.534,2332.486,"--I wouldn't say the whole line, but I would say that some of them are troubling."
1994.94-514,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2332.486,2333.057,Yes.
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2333.057,2337.481,"And I think the distinction, again, must be, is it an element of the offense?"
1994.94-514,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2353.269,2360.625,Is it open to us to decide this case in your favor without reaching the constitutional determination that would bind the States?
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2360.625,2378.287,"I would urge this Court to reach the constitutional issue and, with all due respect to the Government, I believe that the Government has avoided the constitutional issue because I think there is no good answer to the question, if it's an element of the offense, why shouldn't the jury be deciding it, particularly if it is a fact bound element?"
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2392.415,2401.812,What you're saying now is that we should simply go through the statute books and through all our decided cases and apply this very bright line rule that you're talking about.
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2448.362,2473.957,"I think what the Court needs to do, as other courts that we have discussed in our brief, many of them State supreme courts, the number isn't many, perhaps, but several... State v. Anderson and others, and Judge Posner in the Staniforth case, which we discuss... the Court needs to clarify that there is a difference between relevance, as that term is used in Sinclair, and materiality as that term is used in a false statement to a Government official or in a securities fraud case."
1994.94-514,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2473.957,2475.38,Or as it is used in evidence.
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2483.214,2483.935,Correct.
1994.94-514,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2483.935,2491.25,Does that immaterial mean something different than the materiality concept that you are discussing?
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2491.25,2495.292,"As different as night from day, and I think that's the reason there has been some confusion."
1994.94-514,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2516.886,2524.49,"Why wouldn't we have to... why... just overrule all the relevance, because relevance in a prior trial might well involve a host of factual matters."
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2535.809,2536.84,It's not--
1994.94-514,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2536.84,2541.294,"I know Posner makes that distinction, but I'm not certain I get the clarity of the distinction."
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2541.294,2546.336,"--Justice Breyer, relevance would not be out the window."
1994.94-514,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2586.094,2587.092,"Well, maybe you can define them for us."
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2601.982,2611.528,"In the prior context, Your Honor, immaterial meant, it's not relevant, it's not probative of the issues here in court, and that was an objection that was--"
1994.94-514,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2611.528,2613.489,"Just a synonym for relevant, then."
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2613.489,2618.484,"--I believe it's been subsumed within the objection, it's not relevant, in modern practice."
1994.94-514,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2627.28,2634.052,"Yes, but wasn't traditionally the added feature of materiality something to do with importance?"
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2634.052,2634.913,Yes.
1994.94-514,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2634.913,2644.501,"You're saying it's irrelevant, it's immaterial, when you get to immaterial in effect you're saying well, even if it is logically relevant, it is factually so trivial as to be unimportant here."
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2645.73,2646.09,I think so.
1994.94-514,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2683.364,2685.647,"--But didn't... in Kungys we held the other way, didn't we?"
1994.94-514,2,39502,richard_a_hansen,,2687.308,2696.054,"Only, I submit, because there was no right to a jury trial in Kungys, and the Court in Kungys made clear that it's very much a factual inquiry."
1994.94-514,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2791.806,2793.196,"Thank you, Mr. Hansen."
1994.94-514,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2795.578,2817.042,"Mr. Chief Justice, in our view, there has always been in a perjury case the need to ascertain predicate facts in order to make a determination of materiality, but that has never meant to courts around the country that the ultimate question was a factual one that had to be decided by a jury rather than a determination that the court made."
1994.94-514,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2817.042,2827.1,"What about your opponent's argument that if that is sound, then we should go the other way, I suppose he says in the bank, in the mail, in the securities fraud cases?"
1994.94-514,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2827.1,2836.416,"Well, I think, Justice Souter, that's the same distinction that we were discussing earlier between the effect of the representation on a reasonable private person and the effect of a representation on a Government agent."
1994.94-514,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2869.599,2871.181,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
