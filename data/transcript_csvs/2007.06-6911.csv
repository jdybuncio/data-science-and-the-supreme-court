2007.06-6911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.903,"We'll hear argument next in case 06-6911, Logan v. United States."
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,7.404,19.295,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The provision at issue determines which convictions constitute a prior felony for imposition of the Federal firearms ban and its increased penalties."
2007.06-6911,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,93.76,120.26,"So if you had a statute... a State like, I'm told, Vermont, that doesn't take away any one's civil rights, not even a first degree murderer's, then that first degree murderer would be equated to someone whose civil rights were taken away and then restored."
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,120.26,121.977,That's correct.
2007.06-6911,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,161.301,170.474,"They're not anomalies because the gun prohibition would cover them, even though they never had their civil rights taken away?"
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,171.724,172.107,--Correct.
2007.06-6911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,177.961,185.031,"Mr. Coad, how are... how are civil rights which have been taken away typically restored?"
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,192.184,193.184,--It depends on the State.
2007.06-6911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,208.36,223.037,"Well, but even... even there I assume the law waits for a certain passage of time, and I would assume that there can be no felony committed during that interim period or the person's sentence has to be served or something?"
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,233.927,246.335,"Well, I think that there really isn't a difference between... by operation of law, a State taking away someone's rights and giving it back or allowing a offender to retain civil rights--"
2007.06-6911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,246.335,251.723,"Well, it is of... maybe no difference if the operation of law is 24 hours later."
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,251.723,252.573,--It could be a matter--
2007.06-6911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,252.573,254.341,But I assume that's not the case.
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,260.262,262.364,--It could be as short as 24 hours.
2007.06-6911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,279.373,301.756,"Well, you... you can say, however, that... that in the restoring situation, there is at least a greater individuation of the... of the State's determination of the... the trustworthiness of the individual to be... to be trusted with arms."
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,317.867,319.483,"In a minority of States, yes."
2007.06-6911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,319.483,333.293,"Well, I mean, that's... that's a totally different thing from just a gross determination by a State that everybody who commits this crime does not lose... does not lose firearm rights."
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,353.956,355.556,"I... I don't think they are, Your Honor."
2007.06-6911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,367.931,372.918,"Well, but I'm suggesting... and I haven't done the research... that that's atypical."
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,372.918,375.454,"--No, it's not atypical."
2007.06-6911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,384.01,387.612,I think it's atypical to give a felon one day in jail.
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,387.612,389.88,"--Well, it could be a misdemeanor."
2007.06-6911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,401.187,401.871,But a misdemeanor?
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,402.787,404.823,So there are misdemeanors--
2007.06-6911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,404.823,409.625,I understand that... I understand that it is rare for misdemeanants to lose their civil rights.
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,409.625,414.695,--It... that's the assumption.
2007.06-6911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,433.589,435.256,But certainly the minority approach.
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,440.826,441.595,Absolutely.
2007.06-6911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,441.595,454.57,"So your argument, if accepted, would essentially weed out, or at least for a majority of the States, weed out subdivision (a)(20)(A)(b)... (a)(20)(B)?"
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,466.878,471.663,"Well, in, for example, Maryland, that's not the case."
2007.06-6911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,474.615,480.868,"Well, if I say most misdemeanors aren't going to be covered, it's not an answer to say, well, here's one State where they are covered."
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,483.303,490.159,There really are only 16 States in total that have misdemeanors punishable by more than two years where rights are retained.
2007.06-6911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,494.661,505.85,"Mr. Coad, may I ask you a question that involves the comparison of what, for shorthand purposes I'll call Subsection (20) and Subsection (33)."
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,531.281,532.248,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-6911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,532.248,544.139,"Now that applies as I recall to cases, or primarily to cases, in which there has been a misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence, is that correct?"
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,544.139,545.139,It only applies in that instance.
2007.06-6911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,545.139,545.539,Okay.
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,624.674,626.358,"Well, in part."
2007.06-6911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,662.931,675.989,"But none of them is less serious in the classification of the crime than those covered by 33, because 33 simply covers a misdemeanor of domestic violence."
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,675.989,680.207,--I think what we have to look to here is Congress's clear choice in both.
2007.06-6911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,702.722,708.96,"Yes, but the State's judgment about trustworthiness may very well be the same in each case."
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,717.816,718.066,It is.
2007.06-6911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,742.264,748.835,Isn't there another difficulty for you in this statutory comparison that Justice Souter has noted?
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,774.367,779.854,Our absurdity argument you've identified for (a)(20) is more particular than that.
2007.06-6911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.5,831.718,Are you sure about that?
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,850.596,858.619,"--The difference here, I think, between (a)(20) and (a)(33) is that Congress was legislating under the assumption for a felony you're going to lose your civil rights."
2007.06-6911,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,872.759,900.029,"Well, with respect to the in-State anomaly that you were talking about, the government argues on page 30... 29 and 30 of its brief that there really are only a few States where this exists, and even in those... even in the States where it exists, there are very significant restrictions on the ability of the felon to obtain restoration of civil rights."
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,901.196,915.955,"I think it is incorrect in the sense that when the government sort of narrowed the number of States that we identified as being problem States, what it ignores is that the Armed Career Criminal Act and the prohibition against firearms goes back forever really."
2007.06-6911,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,982.512,990.166,"Well, then, maybe the problem was that Congress included misdemeanants who were subject to over a two-year sentence."
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,1033.528,1036.377,I'm not sure I understand Your Honor's question.
2007.06-6911,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1036.377,1043.215,What was the point of putting that group in the statute as covered by the Career Criminal Act?
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,1043.215,1052.405,"Well, I... I think the point is that... that we can't ignore Congress's clear intent to exempt the... the most trustworthy offenders in a... in a given State."
2007.06-6911,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1053.139,1062.278,But how many would be... take a State that doesn't take civil rights away and gun rights from misdemeanants.
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,1085.358,1094.094,"--Well, certainly, the Federal statute set a two-year floor, if you will."
2007.06-6911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1107.235,1117.793,"But does it make much sense, as... as Justice Ginsburg suggests, to read (a)(20)(B) as covering almost nothing?"
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,1128.649,1134.052,"Well, we're talking about very few States overall."
2007.06-6911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1158.668,1165.821,You phrased Congress's intent as allowing an exemption for people the State has found trustworthy.
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,1192.752,1208.064,"I think that the intent was broad, and Congress was operating under the assumption that rights would generally be lost for those serious types of offenses that it thought it was covering in (a)(20)."
2007.06-6911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1210.897,1215.968,"So it's based on a congressional mistake, in other words, about the breadth, but it still doesn't--"
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,1215.968,1227.626,"--It is an unthought-of application of the statute that... that leads to absurd results, which, if we go with the government's interpretation, we frustrate Congress's intent with passing legislation."
2007.06-6911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.626,1229.56,--Can we rewrite statutes like that?
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,1239.68,1246.203,"In the context of identifying an absurdity, it certainly strengthens the absurdity argument where--"
2007.06-6911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1246.203,1250.838,It's not that absurd if Congress did the same thing in (a)(33).
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,1250.838,1255.309,--It's... it's... it might not be absurd in (a)(33).
2007.06-6911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1271.569,1274.02,--What about securities law violations?
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,1289.947,1300.421,"I think that's different, because that's a separate type of violation; whereas, here we're talking about an area that Congress clearly identified, which is how a State treats the civil rights of its offenders."
2007.06-6911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1316.48,1322.182,That kind of begs the question for you to say Congress is worried about offenders States think are trustworthy.
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,1335.692,1341.428,"Well... and, again, in (a)(33) they did it for a very particular type of offender and a different type of offender."
2007.06-6911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1361.473,1370.846,"Well, isn't... under our precedents, isn't what you just said fatal to your case: In other words, Congress didn't think about this, or they made a mistake in thinking about it?"
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,1374.316,1377.768,I... I think that they did legislate with respect to civil rights.
2007.06-6911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1490.774,1509.486,"Do you know, since you seem to have looked at it: In North Carolina, for the person whose had his civil rights taken away, is... is there any mechanism to get them back earlier by... by applying for clemency or a pardon or--"
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,1509.486,1512.953,"In North Dakota... in North Dakota you can apply for a pardon, I believe."
2007.06-6911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1514.153,1515.739,--That would be about the only way?
2007.06-6911,0,38937,richard_a_coad,,1515.739,1516.322,--Yes.
2007.06-6911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1599.142,1599.508,"Thank you, Mr. Coad."
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1601.441,1608.345,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We just have a two points."
2007.06-6911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1722.47,1714.214,Everyone in this case.
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1728.874,1742.948,"Well, that's true, but my point is just that on the face of the domestic violence statute, and what it says is that the restoration of rights exception is limited to circumstances where the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights."
2007.06-6911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1760.706,1764.925,There are cases in the pipeline that don't think it's as clear as day.
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1764.925,1771.562,--There is... in the context of subsection (33)... in the context of the domestic violence misdemeanor provision--
2007.06-6911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1771.562,1772.098,Yes.
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1772.098,1780.185,"--there is one circuit that has applied... that has basically overlooked the plain language there, not even attempted to deal with the plain language there."
2007.06-6911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.111,1795.646,What court--
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1795.646,1796.196,--of the statutory language.
2007.06-6911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.196,1796.996,--What court of appeals was that?
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1797.813,1801.181,"It was the Sixth Circuit in the Burgin case, I believe it's called."
2007.06-6911,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1818.293,1831.684,"If Congress thought about the problem, what reason could they have for saying that the firearms ban should apply to someone who never lost his or her civil rights, but not... but would not apply to someone who had civil rights restored?"
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1838.187,1840.789,--The reason is that Congress was balancing two policies.
2007.06-6911,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2024.083,2034.091,"I can understand that argument where there's an individualized determination about each... each defendant, but I don't quite understand it when it's a blanket restoration of rights."
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2034.091,2035.108,--Right.
2007.06-6911,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2035.625,2037.377,It's a formal difference matter.
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2039.162,2046.482,"--Well, there's still substance to the fact that rights were, in fact, taken away and were, in fact, restored, as opposed to someone having his rights all the time."
2007.06-6911,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2087.143,2090.844,Louisiana automatically pardons all first-time offenders?
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2090.844,2091.228,Most.
2007.06-6911,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2091.228,2091.811,Most?
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2091.811,2092.463,"Most, and--"
2007.06-6911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2092.463,2094.297,"Not murderers, I assume?"
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2094.297,2097.581,--I don't... I think that they are not automatically pardoned.
2007.06-6911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.581,2098.45,"No, that's--"
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2098.45,2102.168,"In fact, this practice is enshrined in the Louisiana Constitution."
2007.06-6911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2157.655,2164.226,"And in the automatic category, I take it, it's usually after the sentence has been served?"
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2164.226,2166.261,There's some variance.
2007.06-6911,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2198.546,2223.863,"At any time in consideration of these statutes did Congress consider, to your knowledge, perhaps making the test be the length of the actual sentence served rather than eligibility for... it seems to me one normal way of differentiating between those who are most trustworthy and those less trustworthy would be by looking at the actual sentence served."
2007.06-6911,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2223.863,2225.113,I think that's true.
2007.06-6911,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2263.07,2265.356,"Thank you, Mr. Joseffer."
2007.06-6911,2,38937,richard_a_coad,,2270.141,2270.724,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2007.06-6911,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2345.835,2347.251,"Thank you, Mr. Coad."
