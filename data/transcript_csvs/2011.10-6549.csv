2011.10-6549,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.07,"We'll hear argument next in case 10-6549, Reynolds v. United States."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,8.737,12.408,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-6549,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,82.335,85.07,Was the -- is the Wetterling Act retroactive?
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,85.07,92.926,"--The Wetterling Act, Your Honor, was remaining in place for 3 years and had a sort of a sunset provision under--"
2011.10-6549,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,92.926,93.41,"No, no, I know."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,101.282,106.602,"--Your Honor, actually the Wetterling Act was not effective for a year into the future."
2011.10-6549,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,106.602,110.221,So you think it only applied to that year?
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,110.221,111.721,"No, I'm sorry."
2011.10-6549,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,115.458,121.529,"So if the offense were committed in 1994, did that person have to register under the Wetterling Act?"
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,121.529,124.481,"They had to register, but there were no criminal penalties."
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,138.991,141.124,Could you clarify that answer?
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,156.535,165.808,"--Your Honor, the Wetterling Act as it was enacted in 1994 was a registration requirement without criminal penalties."
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,176.514,185.971,And that included all individuals who had -- who had been convicted of sex abuse acts before 1996?
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,185.971,187.487,I don't know.
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,231.583,234.952,"Well, maybe -- maybe the Attorney General doesn't have that power."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,277.045,283.099,"Your Honor, I'm not aware of any, but we don't -- this is not what the Attorney General is doing."
2011.10-6549,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,313.654,318.106,I -- maybe I just don't grasp the core of the case then.
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,337.02,345.09,"Your Honor, actually what we are seeking is the ability to contest the Attorney General's rule."
2011.10-6549,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,346.459,356.981,"I'm asking, isn't this is criminal conviction that resulted from the fact that your client was within the class of persons covered by the statute?"
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,365.787,379.43,"--Well, Your Honor, it is -- failure to register and then travel -- I mean travel and then fail to register after you are obligated under SORNA to register is a crime, yes."
2011.10-6549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,379.43,385.417,"Well, I -- you know, my problem is, that's very strange."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,456.43,463.75,"Well, Your Honor, that's really That what the text says, and our reading -- but--"
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,463.75,467.654,But now we do -- the Attorney General has spoken.
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,512.997,518.885,"--Well, Your Honor, our case does not involve the time period after August of 2008."
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,518.885,527.324,"So -- so this whole case is about what happens between February '07 and August '08, and that's the limit of it."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,527.324,529.026,Right.
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,529.026,537.464,Because there was no rule at all before February '07 and there was a rule August '08?
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,541.166,542.766,Yes.
2011.10-6549,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,544.285,553.891,"It's the period from the enactment of SORNA until the adoption of the SMART guidelines, right?"
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,555.01,559.378,"Well, Your Honor, if the SMART guidelines are deemed valid, yes."
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,574.721,576.423,Excuse me.
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,610.895,627.022,"Your Honor, if the statute applies from Day 1 we would still contest the interim rule for -- the Attorney General took action but did not exclude our client."
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,631.141,633.093,What would be the basis of that challenge?
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,633.093,634.176,--Pardon me?
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,634.176,637.562,What would have obligated him to take your client out of SORNA?
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,637.562,641.966,The exercise of his discretion to not take him out--
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,641.966,646.77,Could you -- could you tell me why?
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,646.77,648.62,--Because--
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,648.62,651.822,What would be an abuse of his discretion if he didn't take your client out?
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,652.288,659.642,--Because he had exercised his discretion under subsection (d) and decided not to exclude our client from the--
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,659.642,661.011,But we're in a circular argument.
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,661.011,661.678,--Statute.
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,661.678,664.713,What would have commanded him to take your client out?
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,664.713,666.832,It would be his discretion.
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,666.832,672.735,You -- you would have to bring some sort of suit that said he abused his discretion.
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,680.655,682.674,"Well, that he would have standing."
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,689.328,692.463,But what impact would the interim rules have had on you?
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,692.463,705.707,"If the statute applied from Day 1 without the interim rule, we still would -- that is what the standing issue is about."
2011.10-6549,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,719.847,722.466,"You have a notice -- notice and comment claim, right?"
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,722.466,723.232,Yes.
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,723.918,729.322,"But what -- but what you're challenging is interim rule, because there was no notice and comment."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,744.498,745.198,That's right.
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,745.198,745.915,Okay.
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,750.569,755.936,"No, but the SORNA would not apply to Mr. Reynolds before then."
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,755.936,761.424,"You might have some other case, but this case is about a challenge to a rule as invalid."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,767.994,769.578,"I'm sorry, I missed the last part."
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,769.578,780.219,"You are challenging the -- the Attorney General's first rule as invalid, the February '07 rule."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,780.752,781.136,That's right.
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,781.136,782.837,--You say it's invalid because there was no notice and comment.
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,814.273,816.725,"That's right, Your Honor."
2011.10-6549,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,817.042,817.525,"No, that's not."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,824.414,825.147,--Right.
2011.10-6549,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,825.147,833.168,"If there had been notice and comment, you would have jumped in with comments that would have convinced the Attorney General not to apply the rule to your client."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,833.168,834.37,That's right.
2011.10-6549,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,834.37,834.803,Okay.
2011.10-6549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,834.803,842.792,"And your argument is further that without the rule, SORNA doesn't exist, right?"
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,842.792,843.976,For our client.
2011.10-6549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.976,844.492,Right.
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,844.492,859.302,"He is unable to comply with the initial registration provision under (b) because he was released from prison a year before SORNA was enacted, so he could not meet either one of the descriptions of initial registration."
2011.10-6549,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,859.302,865.206,"That doesn't mean -- that doesn't mean SORNA doesn't apply, it means 2250 didn't apply."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,865.206,866.372,That's right.
2011.10-6549,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,866.372,867.206,Is it that right.
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,867.206,867.689,Well--
2011.10-6549,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,867.689,894.373,"It might be a metaphysical, but it may be that Congress intended the statute to apply to people like your client, but the question is when the initial registration has to take place, and I took you as saying until the Attorney General acts, we don't know, so 2250 doesn't -- doesn't criminalize a failure until he can know when he's supposed to register."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,894.373,896.658,"--Register under SORNA, that's right."
2011.10-6549,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,896.658,897.058,That's right.
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,897.991,911.818,"The problem is here that the prosecution -- the Attorney General's office is substituting a state registration for the initial registration under SORNA, and that's just not what the text says."
2011.10-6549,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,911.818,915.27,"Ms. Cain, why do you think Congress would have written the text in this way?"
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,935.565,942.135,"Well, even the government agrees in their brief that there are complications."
2011.10-6549,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,942.135,944.568,I was going to ask the What are the government the same question.
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,948.455,963.964,"Some sex offenders, you know, from the various states, there were state laws that were varied amongst each other, and there was a federal Wetterling Act that had its own periods of registration and different requirements."
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1036.727,1040.112,Arrested for a misdemeanor to do what?
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1040.112,1063.711,"Any arrest for a misdemeanor that would bring a previous offender back in the system, if that person was just convicted of a misdemeanor, they would not -- the state would not have to re-register them in order to be deemed substantially compliant with SORNA and get the firm grant money."
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1063.711,1076.887,"I thought Justice Kagan's question was, what would have stopped Congress from just saying: You have to register on the day of passage."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1079.839,1089.944,"They could have done that, but they were concerned about how you get the older conviction, the older pre-enactment people into the new system."
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1089.944,1094.063,That's your reason for why they didn't do that.
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1097.282,1097.65,Right.
2011.10-6549,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1120.464,1128.986,"Well, why is -- Why is it easier for the Attorney General to do that by regulation than for Congress simply to do it by the statute itself?"
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1135.64,1146.798,"--Well, I think that it's more flexible to have a regulation, and takes perhaps less time than legislation to think of all the different permutations."
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1159.173,1178.252,"Well, it seems -- Is this case -- What would compliance entail other than simply telling the Missouri authority that he had to register, was registered in Missouri, telling Missouri authority that he was moving to another state."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1181.121,1184.656,Comply with Missouri's law?
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1185.256,1194.429,"To comply with the SORNA requirement, that he would have to tell the Missouri authority that he was moving to another state."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1198.666,1206.771,"Well, Your Honor, that's -- Your question assumes that state registration would suffice for SORNA."
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1212.323,1219.079,"But I'm talking about SORNA has been enacted, and now he's moving after SORNA is enacted, right?"
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1219.079,1219.663,--Right.
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1220.196,1220.563,Okay.
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1237.208,1243.612,"--Well, he would have to comply with the requirements of initial registration under SORNA."
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1247.147,1253.384,"Well, he can't comply with the initial registration because he committed a crime even before SORNA was enacted."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1253.384,1254.252,--I'm just--
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1254.252,1259.454,"But now, what would he have to do to be in compliance--"
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1259.454,1271.798,"--With Missouri law, with state law, would be to comply with Missouri law tell Missouri he is leaving and then go to Pennsylvania and comply with Pennsylvania law, perhaps."
2011.10-6549,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1299.079,1303.464,"Could you tell me this, Ms. Cain."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1328.479,1336.002,The initial registration under SORNA could be updated.
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1365.854,1389.387,"--Under the current regulation, under the 19 -- I mean the '08 regulations, wouldn't be enough to comply for somebody in his situation, to comply simply by telling his parole officer: I'm moving to the other state, under the regulation that says how this is implemented?"
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1389.387,1391.505,"Actually, Your Honor, no."
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1467.339,1491.87,"Let's -- Is there anything -- If I understand the Solicitor General's position, all your client had to do after SORNA was passed was after a reasonable amount of time, or upon his travel, to tell Missouri, which was his state of conviction, that he was moving."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1492.387,1503.512,"--If you -- They say that he was not part of the people that could register within a normal, I mean, a reasonable amount of time because of the state registration."
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1503.512,1503.845,Right.
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1503.845,1508.297,"But assuming that that wasn't the case, assuming he was, you know, just--"
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1508.297,1509.166,"No, I'm not assuming that."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1509.166,1509.632,--Okay.
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1509.632,1528.293,"Would he have been in compliance with SORNA under the final rules today, the interim rules when they were passed, or on the date that he left if he had when he traveled, or a reasonable time thereafter, told his state of conviction that he had moved?"
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1529.662,1530.295,"No, Your Honor."
2011.10-6549,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1530.295,1537.816,What does he have to do in addition to that under the interim or final rules?
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1537.816,1538.768,We don't know.
2011.10-6549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1562.301,1573.608,"That was the answer that you gave to my question, which was the same thing: Why isn't it sufficient now for him simply to tell his parole officer he's moving."
2011.10-6549,0,18625,candace_cain,,1573.608,1574.424,"--Oh, sorry."
2011.10-6549,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1605.294,1606.245,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1617.518,1620.653,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-6549,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1650.358,1651.358,Post what?
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1651.358,1653.643,--Post-implementation by the States.
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1696.987,1697.453,So why--
2011.10-6549,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1697.453,1698.272,But then as I indicated.
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1706.945,1710.647,"In our view, what subsection (d) was, essentially, was a safety valve."
2011.10-6549,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1720.436,1750.288,"What would happen in -- in this situation: Someone is convicted of a sex offense before SORNA is enacted; the shortly after the statute is enacted the person moves to a new State, does not register; then after that the Attorney General exercising the authority that you say he has under -- exercising -- excuse me, exercising the authority under subsection (d), determines that SORNA shouldn't apply to people who were convicted of offenses before its enactment?"
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1752.838,1756.025,"I think at the -- at the time he acted, yes."
2011.10-6549,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1785.225,1803.137,"Well, if Congress wasn't sure whether it wanted -- whether it was appropriate to apply SORNA retroactively, and -- I just -- and therefore was willing to leave that to the Attorney General, then I don't understand why it would have made the Act applicable immediately upon enactment--"
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1803.137,1803.387,--Our--
2011.10-6549,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1803.387,1805.62,--pending a determination by the Attorney General.
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1805.62,1829.318,"--Our understanding is that Congress did know that it wanted to include as a general matter all pre-enactment -- and again, not pre-enactment but pre-implementation offenders as -- offenders as well, and I think we know that because when you look to the provisions that actually speak to what a sex offender was required to do under the Act -- and there are six such provisions -- they all start the same way; they say that the sex offender shall do something."
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.451,1855.803,"--Well, so--"
2011.10-6549,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1855.803,1857.203,So how do they know where to register?
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1864.909,1868.11,"No, they don't have to register under SORNA."
2011.10-6549,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1868.11,1873.228,So how were they supposed to know when or how they would register until the Attorney General acted?
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1873.228,1875.18,"So, if I could break it up into a few classes."
2011.10-6549,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1886.755,1887.822,I'm not talking about those people.
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1887.822,1888.088,Okay.
2011.10-6549,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1888.088,1889.774,Not the people who can comply with (b).
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1889.774,1890.107,Okay.
2011.10-6549,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1890.107,1890.99,I'm talking about the people--
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1890.99,1897.13,"The people in the second group I was going to talk about are offenders like Reynolds, who have already registered before SORNA was enacted."
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1961.785,2001.446,"So your -- your argument is that requirements in the heading for 42 U.S.C. 16913, Registration Requirements For Sex Offenders, means something different than requirements in subsection (d), which the Attorney General can issue rules about, because you are saying although there is the requirement that they register and comply with (c) and all those other things, when it says that the Attorney General can issue regulations specifying the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter, that only meant the administration -- you know, provisions, not the general requirement that you register and keep current and all that?"
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2001.446,2003.731,"No, I don't think that that is what we are saying."
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2013.919,2016.705,It's a safety valve to release what?
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2016.705,2022.692,--To release sex offenders if needed to -- to perhaps suspend certain registration requirements.
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2024.394,2029.513,"You are talking about sort of in the weeds, the little details, not the underlying requirement of registration, right?"
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2029.513,2032.231,"No, I think it -- I think arguably it could be both."
2011.10-6549,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2038.885,2049.61,"But does that mean, Ms. Sherry, that -- that the Attorney General could if he wanted to, for whatever reason, could exempt all pre-enactment offenders from SORNA?"
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2049.61,2056.43,"I think as a theoretical matter, on its face, the delegation of authority in (d) is -- is quite broad and plenary."
2011.10-6549,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2056.763,2057.496,It would allow that.
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2071.19,2081.728,"--Again, I say in theory because I think like all delegations of authority, the Attorney General is certainly limited to acting in furtherance of the purpose of Congress, and here we know the--"
2011.10-6549,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2081.728,2087.699,"We had a case involving the meaning of modify, and it doesn't -- doesn't mean repeal."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2091.667,2095.721,"--I -- I -- I do know what case you are talking about and I have read it, and that's certainly true."
2011.10-6549,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2095.721,2096.105,To confirm--
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2096.105,2097.071,You want to share it with the rest of us?
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2097.071,2099.757,I'm not saying I definitely remember the name.
2011.10-6549,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2108.213,2121.788,"It authorized the FCC to modify the requirement to post rates, and the FCC simply eliminated the requirement to post rates, and we said that that was no good."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2121.788,2126.74,--And -- and I -- I suppose a similar argument could be made with respect to specify.
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2128.276,2132.311,"--Leaving the language aside, I would like to go back to what Justice Sotomayor was asking."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2161.644,2164.096,--He was convicted a year ago.
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2164.096,2164.496,"Yes, correct."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2164.496,2165.379,--of a sex offense?
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2165.379,2165.813,"Yes, correct."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2165.813,2168.248,In our view the statute does apply.
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2168.248,2168.981,Of course it does.
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2177.987,2178.773,He has not.
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2178.773,2179.256,No?
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2259.225,2264.129,"If I could start with 2250 and then go back to subsection (d), that is not our position."
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.914,2269.347,I thought he was convicted of a crime.
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2298.766,2299.985,--Let me make an important distinction.
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2322.881,2327.619,That says -- subsection (c) says he has to -- not later than 90 days--
2011.10-6549,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2327.619,2328.152,Where is this?
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2328.802,2329.154,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-6549,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2330.754,2332.606,It's very helpful to know what you're talking about.
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2332.606,2332.989,--Absolutely.
2011.10-6549,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2332.989,2351.735,"--But you're suggesting, Ms. Sherry, that (b) and (c) have nothing to do with each other, and in fact, one can read (a), (b), and (c) as all integrally linked and referring only to postenactment offenders, so (a) is the umbrella provision; it says"
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2376.468,2378.368,"Again, I don't think that's right."
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2473.04,2493.137,"--In other words, you were reading (c) as saying, to go back to my example, the person who was convicted last year and has four more years to do his initial registration -- nonetheless, if he changes his name, if he stops being a student while in prison, he has to register tomorrow or the day after."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2500.275,2502.06,--That is not my reading of the--
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2502.06,2502.61,"Alright, then."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2540.685,2542.352,--Two points on that.
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2606.994,2621.47,"Why isn't part of your answer to Justice Breyer's question that the one person who doesn't have to register for four years is in prison already, so presumably, he doesn't present the same type of threat that led to the enactment of these registration laws in the first place."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2621.47,2623.089,--That's absolutely right.
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2644.752,2649.323,Your view is that they have to register initially when?
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2649.323,2651.173,If they have not?
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2651.173,2653.358,"No, no, I'm saying -- take my example."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2668.035,2670.368,He is to register within a reasonable time.
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2670.368,2672.753,"Oh, reasonable time and what is a reasonable time."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2672.753,2680.489,Given the rest of the requirements something probably along the lines of give or take three business days.
2011.10-6549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2680.489,2695.582,"Three business days he's supposed to go out and do that and if he doesn't do that he has committed a federal crime which makes no mention of it, no mention at all, and he's just supposed to guess that that's three business days because he's a lawyer, is that why?"
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2695.582,2703.022,"No, actually it's not unique with respect to the statute, it's quite common for status offenses, and let me try to give one example."
2011.10-6549,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2780.431,2783.966,Those were under Missouri law not under federal statute.
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2783.966,2790.703,"They were -- they were under Missouri law, but the important point for SORNA purposes is that he knew he had a registration requirement."
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2814.7,2817.752,And providing criminal penalties that weren't always there.
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2817.752,2819.22,"--Well, the criminal penalties--"
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2819.22,2819.72,That's a big change.
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2819.72,2824.924,--The criminal penalties -- the Federal felony criminal penalties were not there before.
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2857.312,2866.834,"Your theory -- your theory of what the Attorney General did here, as you put in your -- I forget what, the regulations, or the -- was confirm the applicability of SORNA, right?"
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2866.834,2867.834,Our--
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2867.834,2871.822,"That's the word you used, I think, on page 12 of your brief."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2871.822,2872.605,--We did.
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2880.761,2881.094,Right.
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2886.23,2888.998,I don't know if I would say confirm.
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2900.639,2901.205,"No, that's different."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2914.399,2915.632,"Oh, well--"
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2915.632,2921.469,The law says this and I -- I think it means -- I think it means what you say it means.
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2921.469,2927.873,"--I think there are a number of examples where for example, agencies do little more than restate what the statute says."
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2967.117,2972.52,"So I get back to my question, which -- what's your best example of an Attorney General doing something like that?"
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2972.52,2973.57,Confirming?
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3018.049,3019.584,"Well, here it says shall."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3024.953,3026.572,But it says shall have the authority.
2011.10-6549,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3063.495,3081.123,"--But the question -- you are starting from a proposition, counsel, it seems to me, that Congress necessarily and under all circumstances thought that it had to include pre-SORNA convictions."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3146.767,3148.551,"--I don't think so, and for two reasons."
2011.10-6549,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3241.394,3253.602,"I guess my problem is that you make an assumption, you continue to make an assumption that if the Attorney General hadn't acted -- that the Attorney General was incapable of acting quickly."
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3278.502,3287.525,"--If -- if the -- if Congress had wanted the Attorney General to act and to act quickly, presumably Congress would have told the Attorney General that he had to do something."
2011.10-6549,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3290.477,3306.819,"And why did -- the Attorney General didn't try to act very quickly, and if the Attorney General thought that SORNA applied from day 1, why is the Attorney General trying to go through regulation that said nothing more than SORNA applies?"
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3306.819,3342.259,"Because when the Attorney General issued the interim rule, what he said was that reading it on the face, I do think it applies to everybody, but I recognize the defendants are making an alternative argument and I think it's incredibly important that it apply to everybody, and that it apply to everyone quickly, because we are talking about protecting our communities; we're talking about protecting the public and protecting our children from sex offenders, and having this uncertainty out there is -- is not only not good for protecting the public, but it's not good for sex offenders; it's not good for jurisdictions that are trying to work towards substantial implementation of SORNA."
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3381.467,3386.585,What if -- what if we think Congress left it to the Attorney General is because they just didn't want to decide?
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3401.095,3401.611,--that's what Congress did.
2011.10-6549,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3420.907,3426.293,It would strengthen your case if you at least acknowledged that it would be constitutionally doubtful.
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3432.78,3435.047,strengthen our case here--
2011.10-6549,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3435.047,3442.469,"But it would also work That is -- that might against your own interpretation, because your own interpretation allows you to exempt anybody you want from the statute; isn't that right?"
2011.10-6549,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3442.469,3444.588,"--It does, but we do think there's a different starting point."
2011.10-6549,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3457.813,3458.848,"Thank you, Counsel."
