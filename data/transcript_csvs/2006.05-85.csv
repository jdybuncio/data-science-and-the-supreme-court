2006.05-85,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.077,"We'll hear argument first this morning in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,9.199,13.911,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-85,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,95.363,99.367,"Mr. Frederick, are you going to get to the 1447(d) problem?"
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,99.367,99.907,Yes.
2006.05-85,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,109.471,119.559,"The district court thought it was and when we did, the district court said I have no authority in... under... over any of these people."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,120.761,129.537,"The district court made two mutually exclusive statements, that remand was proper and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction."
2006.05-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,133.789,134.199,Removal.
2006.05-85,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,134.94,138.232,--talking that... where are these statements?
2006.05-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.232,139.033,--You said remand was proper.
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,139.354,139.885,--Sorry.
2006.05-85,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,151.182,165.11,"But at the point it was acting it was remanding, and its basis for remanding was not that it thought the removal had been proper; the basis for its remanding was that it said it lacked jurisdiction over three of the other cross defendants."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,165.11,171.164,But immunity was the basis of the district court's thinking that it had to remand.
2006.05-85,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,171.164,175.899,"It may have been, leaving aside the question of whether it was right or wrong, it may have been wrong."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,181.482,188.856,"And what this Court's cases say, Justice Souter, is that the remand has to be a ground cognizable under 1447(c)."
2006.05-85,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,188.856,192.549,Those cases are all... all based on Thermtron.
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,197.391,198.182,I certainly do--
2006.05-85,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,198.182,201.765,"--in light of, in light of the statutory language as it exists now?"
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,201.765,209.799,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the Thermtron rule has been reaffirmed no less than four times by this Court, notwithstanding two statutory amendments."
2006.05-85,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,217.936,223.219,But stare decisis on the basis of statute is kind of a weak basis when the statute's been changed.
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,223.219,236.568,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the Thermtron rule was reaffirmed earlier this term in the Osborn case, has been reaffirmed in prior cases lead... from the time it was decided even through statutory amendments."
2006.05-85,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,255.481,259.011,But Thermtron was such a far cry from this case.
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,267.229,284.669,"But here, Justice Ginsburg, the court did have jurisdiction because removal was properly effectuated once the entities that we moved were identified correctly as sovereigns, either foreign sovereigns in the case of BC Hydro, or Federal sovereigns in the case of BPA."
2006.05-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,284.669,290.215,"--But we go into that question all the time, 1447(d) is a nullity."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,299.77,301.913,"No, you're not, Justice Scalia, and here's why."
2006.05-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.531,331.99,"That would be fine if 1447(d) said that there is no appeal so long as the basis for removal was proper, but that's not what it says."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,331.99,346.22,"But if in Thermtron the court, the district court had said my docket is too busy, I therefore lack subject matter jurisdiction and remand under 1447(c), I don't think there's any doubt that the courts would look beyond the label given."
2006.05-85,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,346.22,350.202,"I don't think the court said in Thermtron, so therefore, I have no subject matter jurisdiction."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,350.202,351.914,"I'm speaking hypothetically, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-85,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,359.468,359.859,Why?
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,373.267,389.358,"--Because it is inconsistent with the notion that remand orders have no preclusive effect to remand a case on the ground that the sovereigns are immune, and force them to relitigate their immune status in State court."
2006.05-85,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,394.822,410.432,"Then what you are really arguing for is, in effect, a separate rule, and that is that 1447(d) has an exception when we are dealing with foreign sovereign immunities."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,410.432,411.722,"That's our backup submission, Justice Souter."
2006.05-85,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,415.645,427.823,"But the trouble with the principal submission, it seems to me, is that we have said that even if the district court has come to an erroneous conclusion about jurisdiction, if it understands that it is making a jurisdictional ruling, that is not appealable."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,427.823,429.743,"--But Justice Souter, it did so."
2006.05-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.801,470.961,"Well, you're into your backup argument now."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,470.961,471.361,--No.
2006.05-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.361,474.834,"The backup argument that you're now making, that not your principal argument."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,474.834,476.624,"No, Justice Scalia, that's not our backup argument."
2006.05-85,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,515.149,537.105,"Did you request... when the question of Powerex... authority over Powerex was before the district court, did you request that the district court give you a 1292(b) order before the court remanded the case, so that you could have gotten the case... the question up on appeal?"
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,537.105,540.398,"I don't believe that we did, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-85,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,552.766,563.462,Because that would have taken care of it if the district judge agreed to delay the remand to allow this question of law to be determined by the court of appeals.
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,563.462,576.031,"It is certainly the case that in searching through the docket entries, you'll discover that there was a holding by the district court of the remand, which is in itself an unusual procedure."
2006.05-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.505,617.288,They don't care whether it had subject matter jurisdiction or not.
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,626.004,631.516,"Their submission in this Court, however, is that there was no subject matter jurisdiction."
2006.05-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.516,634.358,"That's their backup argument, I think."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,634.358,638.682,"Well, their backup argument should be rejected by the Court as wrong."
2006.05-85,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,638.682,654.532,"If in fact it goes back to the State court and you litigate it, you lost, can you raise as a point of appeal that you did not receive two things the statute guaranteed you?"
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,663.087,665.911,"Justice Breyer, there's no provision--"
2006.05-85,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,665.911,666.43,"No, but could you?"
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,666.43,673.293,"--By the time the appeals in the State court would have been exhausted, the very benefits--"
2006.05-85,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,673.293,675.474,"No, I'm just asking could you, yes or no."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,675.765,677.167,--We would certainly make the argument.
2006.05-85,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,677.167,677.438,"--Yes, okay."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,693.938,710.871,"Justice Breyer, I would not want to foreclose any arguments that we might try to make; but let me point out to you that in the years that it would take to march through the State court system, Powerex, as a sovereign, would be denied its right to have a bench trial--"
2006.05-85,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,710.871,718.124,"See, what I'm getting at is whenever there's an erroneous remand, the practical problems that you raise are present."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,729.504,732.523,"--I do think foreign sovereigns are different, and Congress intended to treat--"
2006.05-85,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,732.523,742.942,"In terms of the legal right to get the trial to which the law entitles you on your view of the law, there is no difference."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,742.942,746.164,--The foreign sovereign is entitled to a bench trial.
2006.05-85,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,752.689,755.741,"And you would get those eventually, it would just have to happen."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,755.741,757.1,--It would be after... it would be--
2006.05-85,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,757.1,759.571,But that's purely... pure question begging.
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,788.512,802.801,"--But Mr. Chief Justice, the point of having Congress enact these removal provisions and to ensure jurisdiction in the federal court for sovereigns on the basis of their status is entirely to vindicate those rights and interests."
2006.05-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,804.551,808.034,It's... it's the same with diversity jurisdiction.
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,836.724,839.595,"--Diversity is different, Justice Scalia, and here's why."
2006.05-85,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,863.522,866.875,"Mr. Frederick, may I just follow up on Justice Breyer's question?"
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,880.962,890.159,"Justice Stevens, I don't think we would win at all in that circumstance because we would be forced as a foreign State to litigate in State court contrary to Congress's will."
2006.05-85,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.159,890.858,"Yes, but--"
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,890.858,892.701,Whatever arguments that may be preserved--
2006.05-85,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,892.701,894.651,--But you might win that litigation.
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,896.732,899.666,"--It is certainly not impossible, but the point--"
2006.05-85,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,899.666,902.827,"And if you lose, you always have a point on appeal and may start all over again later on."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,902.827,915.695,"--It is unclear to me, and I'm not sure that I've seen any of this Court's cases that would suggest that the denial of that kind of procedural right would be grounds for reversing a State court judgment."
2006.05-85,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,926.043,933.607,Did anybody in this case... did any of the Defendants in this case request a trial by jury?
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,933.607,942.333,"--I don't recall whether the Defendants do, but it is clear that the Plaintiffs would be entitled to a jury trial--"
2006.05-85,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,942.333,943.695,And have they asked for it?
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,948.808,958.904,"--Well, the case has settled, Justice Ginsburg, prior to the formal invocation of trial procedures, and so--"
2006.05-85,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,958.904,960.174,The case is settled?
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,960.174,973.484,"--As explained in the cert petition papers, the case is on appeal in the State court system on objections to the settlement, and it will not be mooted during the course of this Court's action on the case."
2006.05-85,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,981.589,983.7,"Well, that's different than it is in the Federal courts."
2006.05-85,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,987.493,998.339,"Well, what the Plaintiffs here assert is that they would be denied their right to jury trial, and I presume that that means they intend to ask for one and to perpetuate that request."
2006.05-85,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1037.175,1038.256,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1048.212,1050.833,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-85,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1081.073,1089.989,Osborn made it very clear that was an extraordinary case where Congress had explicitly ordered two conflicting things.
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1109.153,1111.344,Your Honor is absolutely correct.
2006.05-85,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1197.928,1198.949,One technical question.
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1225.097,1225.758,Yes.
2006.05-85,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1225.758,1226.579,What happened?
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1226.579,1236.595,"The Missouri Pacific Railway case holds that even this Court, on review of a State court judgment following remand cannot review the remand order itself."
2006.05-85,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1241.919,1244.02,"And it is called, the case, Missouri--"
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1244.02,1246.151,--Missouri Pacific Railway case.
2006.05-85,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1246.151,1261.522,"Counsel, what... what do you do about 1447(e) which says that if after removal joinder might defeat subject matter jurisdiction, the court can deny joinder or permit joinder and remand the action."
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1291.49,1300.416,"What, what's notable is that Congress enacted 1447(e) at the same time that it amended 1447(c)."
2006.05-85,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1372.775,1379.708,"But you don't have any doubt that a remand under 1447(e) would be covered by 1447(d), do you?"
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1379.708,1381.939,No.
2006.05-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1437.714,1438.486,How is that relevant here?
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1440.589,1447.382,The post-removal event here is the recognition of the defendant's sovereign immunity.
2006.05-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1447.382,1448.413,"Well, that's not an event."
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1453.438,1461.062,"Well, according... well, apparently the district court viewed it as a post-removal event that deprived it, or defeated, divested--"
2006.05-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1461.062,1463.753,Very strange meaning of event.
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1463.753,1465.423,"--Well, I... Your Honor--"
2006.05-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.423,1468.315,I mean the sovereign immunity didn't exist from the outset.
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1469.397,1473.23,--But... but the district court's order is clear.
2006.05-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1502.81,1503.969,When did it say that?
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1513.596,1517.4,"--Well, the Court has to go back to the history of the statute, how it's evolved."
2006.05-85,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1532.529,1540.543,"Under the... under the district court's view, would there have been original jurisdiction against Powerex?"
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1540.543,1542.123,"--No, it would not have."
2006.05-85,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1565.221,1566.04,Then can you--
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1566.04,1568.922,"Likewise in 1442(a), which was about the Federal--"
2006.05-85,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1568.922,1574.796,"--Can, can you tell me, if the Petitioner does not prevail here, the case goes back to the State court."
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1578.409,1581.871,--The immunity argument could be raised in State court.
2006.05-85,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1596.2,1603.446,"In other words the State court couldn't say well you know, this district court was wrong; there's really immunity under the Federal statute."
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1605.447,1606.508,--The State--
2006.05-85,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1606.508,1610.929,"Because then you'd have constant... eternal shuttling back and forth, that's why."
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1610.929,1626.66,"--The State court could reconsider Powerex's status as a foreign sovereign, but it wouldn't have many, if any, implications in the State court because Powerex isn't claiming immunity in this case."
2006.05-85,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1645.862,1646.563,"Well, we don't know--"
2006.05-85,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1646.563,1655.229,"In other words, the... the Federal determination bars the State court from redetermining that there's immunity?"
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1657.38,1662.315,--The issue of immunity of Powerex was never raised in this case.
2006.05-85,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1675.663,1676.694,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.05-85,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1676.694,1684.658,Mr. Simon.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1684.658,1688.191,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1828.704,1839.801,"Well, what, what reason would Congress have for wanting a system that says... and there are many, many, many people in the United States who would like to sue Pakistan."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1877.427,1878.036,It--
2006.05-85,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.036,1881.608,"Can I,... I'm not sure it is even that he made a mistake."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1886.46,1887.812,--Let me try to answer it--
2006.05-85,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.812,1889.104,--you can go back to State court.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1892.464,1894.397,--Let me try to answer both questions.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1912.529,1914.349,They were saying they were an organ of--
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1914.349,1915.952,They were saying they were an organ.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.952,1920.074,"--Yeah, and therefore they are immune unless... unless they fall within an exception."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1921.876,1922.065,No.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1924.017,1925.207,"Well, I'm saying, that's how the statute works."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1925.207,1925.447,Right.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1925.447,1933.002,"But I take it if you win this, it's precisely the same, in respect to a person who has total immunity."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1933.002,1933.273,No.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1933.273,1934.212,Why not?
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1934.212,1935.123,I would disagree Your Honor.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1935.123,1935.604,Why not?
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1935.604,1936.764,A party who has total immunity--
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1936.764,1937.224,Yeah.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1937.224,1939.876,--Would have removed the case the same way--
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1939.876,1940.176,Yeah.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1940.176,1943.729,--And it would have presented two arguments to the district court.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1951.516,1952.157,Yes.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1952.157,1972.169,"There is a solid line of cases that suggests the decision on immunity... first of all let me say, I think it is somewhat far-fetched that a party that would actually be immune, say the King of Saudi Arabia, would end up being in this third lowest category of foreign... purported foreign sovereigns and end up in the position Powerex is in."
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1988.211,1990.542,And a Judge makes a big mistake--
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1990.542,1990.972,--Makes a big mistake.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1990.972,1992.054,--China comes in--
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1992.054,1992.304,Right.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1992.304,1994.585,--And says of course you're China.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,1996.725,2000.318,"I would submit, Your Honor, the question has never been addressed by this Court."
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2008.413,2008.864,No.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2013.759,2014.507,The immunity--
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2014.507,2015.819,"Is it or not, in your view?"
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2015.819,2020.642,"--In my view, the immunity issue, but not the remand is reviewable on appeal--"
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.642,2020.912,Fine.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2024.716,2025.354,--Right.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2026.306,2028.158,And what's the difference between the one and the other?
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2028.158,2049.1,"--The difference is that the immunity issue is reviewed on appeal because there is a line of court of appeal cases... a majority, not a unanimous majority, never blessed by this Court... which suggests that immunity is so important, don't need a lawyer, you don't go to court, you don't say a word, you don't spend a dollar, you walk away... so important that you are entitled to an immediate--"
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2049.1,2050.532,"Okay, and you agree with that?"
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2050.532,2051.992,--And I agree with that.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.992,2052.411,Fine.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2064.389,2069.505,"Well, I want to come back non-jury trial and answer Justice Ginsburg's question because I don't think she got the right answer."
2006.05-85,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2104.929,2110.452,You're saying this all turns on our assessment of the strength of the interest in remaining in Federal court?
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2111.952,2116.216,"No, it turns on the strength of getting an immediate decision on the immunity question."
2006.05-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2122.46,2142.122,"The immunity question, the immunity question is the same in State or Federal court, because the statute as it's written, any foreign sovereign, China, whatever, is as immune from State court jurisdiction as it is from Federal court jurisdiction because Congress said so."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2154.991,2156.391,--That's correct.
2006.05-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2189.663,2194.918,There was a sovereign party who said: I'm out of this; I have suit immunity.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2197.07,2198.321,B.C. Hydro.
2006.05-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2198.321,2199.663,--What happened to B.C. Hydro?
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2204.626,2228.0,"The district court found that they were immune, properly followed the law, but determined because it believed it had no subject matter jurisdiction that it should then stop at that point, that it should just walk away from the case and remand it, over the vehement disagreement of B.C. Hydro and the parallel vehement disagreement of the Bonneville Power Administration."
2006.05-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2238.178,2244.182,"Yes, but it couldn't... if you are right, then the Ninth Circuit never should have touched this case."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2251.696,2272.57,"Well, what's happened so far is nothing, which might tell us that in the practical world when a Federal district judge says that B.C. Hydro is immune and then remands a multi-plaintiff, multi-defendant, multi-cross defendant case to San Diego Superior Court, it is exceedingly that the San Diego Superior Court will reconsider the immunity."
2006.05-85,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2273.201,2275.972,But could it?
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2275.972,2284.578,"--I suppose it could, but if it did that matter is subject to appeal and subject to ultimate certiorari review in this Court."
2006.05-85,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2287.072,2299.249,"I thought the argument you were making a few minutes ago, if I understood it correctly, was that B.C. Hydro would not have been barred by 1447(d) from taking an appeal to contest the remand; is that correct or not."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2299.249,2303.613,"I think B.C. Hydro could have taken a collateral order, a collateral order appeal."
2006.05-85,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2303.613,2307.877,Whether it's a collateral order or not just goes to whether it falls under 1291.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2310.618,2320.276,B.C. Hydro could have attempted to appeal the immunity decision under a series of decisions which suggest that immunity is so important that it ought to be decided right then.
2006.05-85,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2320.276,2324.076,The difference between that immunity and Powerex's status is what?
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2338.546,2340.188,Among several other things.
2006.05-85,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2355.366,2366.284,"If we think that Powerex, that there's a strong interest in having Powerex remain in Federal court if it's entitled To that under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, that would be suffer to get around 1447(d)?"
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2366.284,2374.228,I think Justice Scalia was correct to say there is just as strong an interest in a diversity case in having a New York corporation trying to escape--
2006.05-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2374.228,2378.983,"But I'm having, I'm having the same problem as Justice Alito and Justice Breyer."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2392.391,2393.723,"--Yes, if I could--"
2006.05-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2393.723,2399.355,"You're telling us that one is more important than the other, but there's no textual basis in the statute for us to make that distinction."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2399.355,2401.126,"--I think there are two differences, so if I could."
2006.05-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2489.614,2501.113,"I'm asking why is denial of immunity for sovereign status different from denial of organ status giving you a right to a bench trial, etcetera?"
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2501.113,2504.195,"--Possibly, possibly this court would decide that question the other way."
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2504.485,2508.659,We have this very old judge like me.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2538.569,2540.229,--Yes.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2540.229,2540.79,All right.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2540.79,2541.791,But not the remand.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2541.791,2542.72,What?
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2542.72,2543.852,But not the remand.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2543.852,2550.577,"All they want is a definitive appeal that this is really China, all right."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2568.979,2576.503,The first difference is what I said in response to Your Honor's question was I think they could do that under some cases from the courts of appeal.
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2582.049,2582.768,I don't care.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2592.235,2593.066,"--Well, Justice Breyer--"
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.066,2594.957,"That would make them just as happy, I believe."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2594.957,2599.171,"--Justice Breyer, think about a multi-party case and maybe my answer will be clearer to you."
2006.05-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2627.557,2641.827,"Regardless of how they would get up on it, assuming they could get up on the immunity question, our series of questions is why do we draw or why should we draw a distinction between immunity and federal bench trial?"
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2647.213,2665.852,Immunity is dispositive and Federal bench trial is not... and is no different from the day to day decisions district courts make all the time about the choice between a State court and a Federal court in the area of remands and removals.
2006.05-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2665.852,2675.419,"Immunity, suit immunity, is you can't be sued anyplace, not in State court, not in Federal court; you can't be sued, period."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2682.184,2683.136,That's correct.
2006.05-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2683.136,2685.737,So the only question is where.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2685.737,2688.059,And that is my core--
2006.05-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2688.059,2688.349,The question is if--
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2688.349,2689.479,--Excuse me.
2006.05-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2699.006,2699.216,Can you help me with--
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2699.216,2703.63,"I would like to answer your question about a jury, but I think I interrupted Justice Stevens."
2006.05-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2703.63,2705.439,--I just want to be sure your position.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2732.659,2743.363,"Other than the jury question, I think the answer would be no because of 1447(d), because I think 1447(d) would suggest that that's an appeal of a remand."
2006.05-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2750.379,2751.35,I'm just wondering what your position is.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2751.35,2763.409,"A clever enough lawyer I suppose could argue that at that point that we're no longer challenging the remand, the remand has happened and been completed and the trial has taken place; we're now simply challenging the results."
2006.05-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2765.469,2772.653,"And in effect he would say... I mean, I assume what the clever lawyer would say is, you, State court, cannot try me at all."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2781.952,2788.054,"Oh, I think in State court a clever litigant could argue all these points over again, because 1447(d)--"
2006.05-85,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2788.054,2789.476,But his clever opponent would say--
2006.05-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2798.572,2812.513,"And ultimately when the two clever parties got to the State supreme court, they would have these two opposing issues and ultimately if we granted cert this Court would decide it, wouldn't it."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2812.513,2820.928,"--This Court would ultimately decide it and they would ultimately decide questions such as whether the jury or, to put it the other, the bench trial issue has been preserved."
2006.05-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2820.928,2847.615,"Why not say, depending on the clever lawyers, or non-clever as the case may be, why not just say Congress intended that you do get an underlying appeal in the Federal system, for what is at stake is not simply where the case will be tried, but rather significant and important rights attach in the Federal court that do not attach in the State court."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2861.894,2864.448,"Well, Congress has said... Congress has said the contrary."
2006.05-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2967.994,2972.658,--But there is still the question of Federal forum over State forum.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,2972.658,2983.535,"--There is, and that's the issue that I think Congress has clearly and definitively said, the State courts have pretty good judges, pretty good juries, pretty good systems and certiorari procedures to this Court."
2006.05-85,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3143.0,3150.126,"Well, the reason why they may have done that is because they've seen case after case where absolute power corrupts absolutely."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,3172.612,3172.932,No.
2006.05-85,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3172.932,3173.583,--That's not--
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,3173.583,3174.184,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-85,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3202.862,3208.155,"Counsel, it's a good thing you've got a lot of fallback arguments because you fall back very quickly."
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,3221.566,3227.199,"--That would be my first answer, and the Chief Justice said it much better than mine, than I have."
2006.05-85,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3283.798,3285.108,That certainly changes the argument.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,3297.106,3304.262,"--If the court wants to adopt Justice Scalia's view in the prior case, in the Kircher case, my clients would be pleased with the results--"
2006.05-85,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3304.262,3305.261,I recommend that.
2006.05-85,2,35140,leonard_b_simon,,3305.551,3311.706,"--But I think, Justice Roberts... I think, Mr. Chief Justice... I apologize."
2006.05-85,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3352.092,3354.105,"Thank you, Mr. Simon."
2006.05-85,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3356.896,3375.038,"Mr. Chief Justice, a non-jury trial is an aspect of sovereign immunity."
2006.05-85,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3439.941,3451.347,"And Congress said, those entities don't get any immunity, they get two things: They get a federal forum and they get a judge trial."
2006.05-85,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3454.239,3455.909,"--That's not all that's at stake, Justice Ginsburg."
