2003.02-1809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.182,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1809, J. Elliott Hibbs v. Kathleen Winn."
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,88.793,91.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.559,141.139,Where is the assessment here that... that supposedly is being enjoined?
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,141.139,148.569,"Your Honor, the assessment is the calculation of a tax by the... for the taxpayer."
2003.02-1809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,160.995,162.027,It's... it's a self-assessment?
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,165.908,167.971,"--Your Honor, I'm not talking about a self-assessment."
2003.02-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,191.832,192.741,Mr. Goddard--
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,192.741,193.568,--after you've done all the credits.
2003.02-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,193.568,204.547,"--Mr. Goddard, I thought that in a self-assessment system, such as the one we have, the Federal Government, Arizona, that assessment is associated with assertion of a deficiency."
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,212.532,220.772,"Your Honor, every taxpayer in Arizona has their form calculated by the government."
2003.02-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,223.04,225.147,You... you audit everyone in the State?
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,225.147,226.755,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,242.359,245.125,Which the Government does when it wants to assert a deficiency.
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,270.76,282.566,"Your Honor, it is... it is our position that the State of Arizona under our State tax system assesses all taxes in the State and that--"
2003.02-1809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,282.566,284.961,When... when does that happen?
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,288.017,292.104,--It... it returns during... excuse me.
2003.02-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,322.818,326.283,"But that's not the assessment that you... I mean, you used the Internal Revenue Code provision."
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,345.564,351.919,"Your Honor, I'm not saying that every taxpayer has a... a specific entry next to their name."
2003.02-1809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,373.261,381.369,Because I... I assume that assessment is... is... the assessment that we're concerned with is... is within the meaning of Federal law.
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,406.881,412.166,"Your Honor, I... I can't say that we have that specific word in our statute."
2003.02-1809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,413.485,423.062,"Well, then... then isn't your problem this, that... that there... that that specific word is used in the Federal statutes, quite apart from the Tax Injunction Act?"
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,449.689,458.893,"--Your Honor, I don't believe so because the... the first step... and... and the three words in the statute I think are... are certainly helpful: assessment, levy, collection."
2003.02-1809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,461.122,466.489,"Well, there's no issue of a levy going on here, and they're not trying to stop you from collecting anything."
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,494.93,497.038,"--Yes, Your Honor, we believe that--"
2003.02-1809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,497.038,497.902,And it didn't think it did.
2003.02-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,504.69,510.245,The technical assessment that's made tied to a deficiency you don't fit.
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,562.136,573.093,"--No, Your Honor, but... but what we're asking for is that the... the director, Mr. Hibbs, be able to... as the statute says, to implement the... the tax system under State law."
2003.02-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,573.093,612.291,"Well, is it the case, though, that other courts of appeal at the Federal level have concluded that the Tax Injunction Act does not bar suits that would increase State revenues rather than reduce them, that the purpose of the Tax Injunction Act was to prevent reduction of State tax revenues, specifically by corporations coming in and getting injunctions and preventing the State from receiving revenues, but that it doesn't apply where the effect of the... the suit would be to increase the State's coffers?"
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,612.291,618.485,"Your Honor, if I could deal with... there... there are two questions, one, the legislative history and... and the... as this Court has noted--"
2003.02-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,618.485,624.18,"First of all, with the courts of appeal, the majority have so held, I guess, who have addressed it."
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,624.18,624.718,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,627.197,628.312,Only the Fifth Circuit has gone the other way.
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,628.312,631.55,The Fifth Circuit in ACLU Foundation v. Bridges has... has very convincingly--
2003.02-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,631.55,634.112,"Yes, but the others went the other way on it."
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,634.112,635.227,"--Your Honor, I could--"
2003.02-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.227,636.879,"The Seventh, the Eighth, and the Ninth."
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,637.827,647.487,"--Your Honor, there is... is language in the Seventh Circuit opinion which speaks about this, but it is in a very limited sense in... in Dunn v. Kerry."
2003.02-1809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,684.04,690.461,"I don't know about that, but a... a challenge to a tax credit I think is what we're talking about."
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,690.711,696.117,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't believe there's any logical distinction between a deduction, an exclusion, an exemption, and a credit."
2003.02-1809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,697.232,705.942,"Well, I suppose you could... I suppose you could make the argument that it... it's wrong to say the State is only interested in increasing revenue."
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,716.074,717.294,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,725.096,734.467,"General Goddard, the... what we've been talking about is this section of 1341 that talks about assessment, levy, or collection of any debt."
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,750.442,755.355,"--Yes, Your Honor, and that distinction... the cases I'm referring to involve both."
2003.02-1809,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,803.652,806.503,You were going to go to the history or something else.
2003.02-1809,0,41396,samuel_goddard,,813.85,815.048,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,815.048,816.534,"--that could be... well, I mean, it could."
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1077.618,1094.131,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1107.15,1111.508,May I ask you if you think the language is so plain that we should not even look at the legislative history?
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1111.508,1113.2,--We think it's... yes.
2003.02-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.085,1126.658,And Judge Easterbrook was just dead wrong in looking at the legislative history and he also interpreted it dead wrong.
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1126.658,1130.827,"Judge... the case before Judge Easterbrook, Justice Stevens, was quite different from this case."
2003.02-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1161.642,1165.29,Does... does that... were you finished your answer?
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1165.29,1165.767,Yes.
2003.02-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1165.767,1176.336,"The... the... if you use the word enjoin to mean command, which it can mean, can you say that they are commanding the collection of a tax, contrary to the words of the statute?"
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1176.336,1176.602,Yes.
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1203.047,1203.928,Do we have a self-assessment?
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1203.928,1205.869,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1205.869,1206.052,We don't.
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1206.052,1206.424,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1206.424,1208.531,Is every... every taxpayer is assessed?
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1208.531,1209.107,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1209.645,1213.444,Every taxpayer is assessed even when no deficiency is sought?
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1213.444,1213.899,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1226.826,1230.169,That every taxpayer is assessed even when there's no deficiency.
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1230.169,1230.707,--Correct.
2003.02-1809,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1253.658,1257.911,"You don't have to send them a notice of... in other words, I file my income tax."
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1274.751,1276.609,The assessment is a particular thing.
2003.02-1809,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1282.182,1287.755,But you just said to Justice Ginsburg that if nothing happens... like I try to pay my taxes accurately.
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1309.43,1311.698,--26 U.S.C. 6201.
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1338.12,1345.179,"--But... but nobody... nobody here is contesting, as far as I can tell, what we were told Monday is a mere bookkeeping entry."
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1351.328,1354.3,Not if the taxpayer has conceded the amount of liability.
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1358.449,1362.786,So why is anybody trying to enjoin a bookkeeping entry that nobody knows anything about?
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1362.786,1366.501,--Because assessment is the formal determination by the... by the--
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1366.501,1371.081,But I don't see that there's any effort to stop a bookkeeping entry from being made--
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1371.081,1371.618,"--There is, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1371.618,1377.396,"--that nobody gets any notice of and doesn't... is... is, we were told, just a mere bookkeeping entry."
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1383.135,1386.479,"But the statute, Justice Ginsburg, doesn't say anything about notice."
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1392.878,1395.478,But nobody is seeking to enjoin any assessment.
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1395.478,1396.693,They... they are.
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1397.519,1402.72,They... as assessment being a bookkeeping entry that nobody knows anything about.
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1413.289,1415.684,"--If I may answer, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1437.315,1438.141,May I ask you--
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1438.141,1439.134,That's exactly what the act precludes.
2003.02-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1439.134,1445.117,--does the Arizona tax code have a provision in it comparable to the one that you read us... to us from the Federal code?
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1445.117,1446.497,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1448.892,1449.841,"Then it's hardly relevant, is it?"
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1449.841,1471.183,"--is that the... is that the tax collector there, the Department of Revenue, makes a determination or reviews the returns and ultimately either determines that that amount will be accepted, that... that the amount of tax shown on the return is the... going to be accepted as the amount of tax due from the tax collector, or that they're going to try to require some... you know, assess a deficiency or whatever it may be."
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1495.227,1502.929,"Suppose they clarify that they're not trying to stop a bookkeeping entry from being made in Arizona, even though Arizona law doesn't require it, just like the Feds."
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1502.929,1507.388,"Your Honor, the assessment under State law in Arizona includes the tax credit."
2003.02-1809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.982,1517.131,"If they couldn't stop a bookkeeping entry, I assume they couldn't stop the acceptance of the tax in accordance with a bookkeeping entry."
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1517.586,1517.957,That's correct.
2003.02-1809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1517.957,1524.811,I... I assume it's essential to their case that they stop that ultimate bookkeeping entry which determines how much the taxpayer owes.
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1524.811,1525.637,Exactly.
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1527.289,1531.581,"Although we were told that there isn't that bookkeeping entry in Arizona, that they don't have it."
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1531.581,1535.751,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'm obviously no expert in Arizona tax law."
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1543.06,1545.0,But that's not what you described as the assessment.
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1545.0,1549.292,The assessment is the tax collector's recorded determination of the amount due.
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1549.292,1550.612,Which we were told they don't have in Arizona.
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1550.612,1561.758,"Well, it... again, I think for purposes of Federal law, it... it is not unreasonable to assume that the tax collector in Arizona decides whether they're going to accept the amount of return shown on the tax as--"
2003.02-1809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.758,1562.379,And keeps a record of it.
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1562.379,1563.66,--And keeps a record of it.
2003.02-1809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.032,1564.941,"I mean, he must keep a record of it for--"
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1564.941,1565.23,"Exactly, exactly."
2003.02-1809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1570.514,1574.684,"--Isn't the case just simpler if we say you cannot command the collection of a tax, which is what's happening here?"
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1574.684,1575.511,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-1809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1598.461,1601.722,But those were all taxpayers trying to stop the collection of tax from them.
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1601.722,1609.607,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but the Court did not say that the purpose and scope of the act is limited to that context, nor is the language limited to that context."
2003.02-1809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1618.235,1621.762,But wouldn't you agree that the primary purpose of the statute was to protect the State's fisc?
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1621.762,1624.157,That is certainly a primary purpose of the statute.
2003.02-1809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1624.157,1627.872,"And insofar as that purpose is relevant, you lose on that purpose."
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1627.872,1644.303,"It's... it's not applicable here, although I think it is important to recognize that it would be quite extraordinary for Federal courts to be in the business of ordering State tax collectors to collect... to collect taxes from their citizens that the legislature of the State had deemed should not be collected."
2003.02-1809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1644.303,1662.341,It's curious that the Moore's Federal Practice and Wright and Miller and Hart and Wechsler all suggest that the Tax Injunction Act does not prevent a challenge in Federal court to the constitutionality of State tax credits.
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1664.82,1676.132,"Well, I think some of those quotes, if I recall correctly, Justice O'Connor, deal with... they say the... the Tax Injunction Act does not apply to suits to collect taxes, which is a different situation than here."
2003.02-1809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1676.132,1676.959,"Well, they speak in terms of tax credits."
2003.02-1809,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1687.111,1696.937,This Court in two or three cases identified by respondents has not addressed the Tax Injunction Act where it might be... it might be relevant.
2003.02-1809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1697.514,1698.794,"Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,1702.488,1707.793,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1790.931,1809.301,"Mr. Cohen, going back to the language, assessment, levy, or collection of any tax, which was the subject of questions to your... your opponent, you don't question, do you, that the statute applies to income taxes as well as to property taxes?"
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,1809.301,1811.448,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we don't question that."
2003.02-1809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1811.448,1824.989,And would you question its applicability if the... the State could not point to a particular act of assessment or levy or collection in its procedures?
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,1824.989,1835.679,"Your Honor, we view the phrase, enjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment, levy, or collection, as a phrase."
2003.02-1809,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1853.679,1861.481,You mean I... I can't read this statute to say that the district court shall not enjoin the collection of a tax?
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,1867.713,1878.199,"Justice Kennedy, the... let's take a... I... I believe the idea was that there is a process."
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1944.701,1945.694,Let's assume--
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,1945.694,1946.437,--but it didn't go farther than that.
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1946.437,1947.18,--Let's assume it means just that.
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,1947.18,1947.635,Yes.
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.635,1957.09,And... and let's assume that... that you get your injunction in a Federal district court against the Secretary of State's collection of this tax.
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,1996.182,1998.7,Justice Scalia--
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1998.7,2000.019,Why isn't that so?
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2000.019,2004.931,"--The... two... two answers, if... if you allow me."
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2014.013,2015.749,"Well, then the statute wouldn't apply I suppose."
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2037.463,2038.988,"--Justice Scalia, the statute does not say interfere."
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2044.727,2045.636,You have a much narrower position.
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2057.319,2058.35,"--Justice Scalia, I'm not saying that."
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2058.804,2059.797,--I thought that's what--
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2059.797,2067.6,--I must have misspoke myself because what I am saying is that they can't stop the collection of taxes and that this would not stop the collection.
2003.02-1809,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2067.6,2069.252,--But the statute doesn't say stop.
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2072.308,2073.505,In Jefferson--
2003.02-1809,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2073.505,2074.248,And that's exactly what you're doing.
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2076.106,2085.577,"--Justice Kennedy, in Jefferson County, this Court unanimously interpreted the statute to say stop the collection."
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.026,2101.991,Can I bring you... can I bring you back to my question which I don't think I got an answer to?
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2120.938,2126.511,"Justice Scalia, he obeys the order of the court and he's... he's only enjoined from--"
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.511,2126.627,"Well, that means--"
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2126.627,2129.277,--He's only enjoined with regard to the tax credit.
2003.02-1809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2135.222,2153.981,"--And I take that... I take it that's the answer to... to Justice Kennedy's question, that his obligation to collect the tax is an obligation under State law, and once he is enjoined from recognizing the credit, he simply follows State law and collects the tax without reference to the credit."
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2162.676,2164.366,"Yes, absolutely."
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.366,2168.659,"He believes the district court decision is wrong, and let's assume it is wrong."
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2172.003,2178.569,"Unless it... Your Honor, unless it is stayed, he is to obey it, and--"
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2178.569,2179.683,And that does not--
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2179.683,2189.425,"--It does not interfere with the collection... with the flow... it does not interfere with the flow of revenue to the State, and that's what the Tax Injunction Act is basically about."
2003.02-1809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2189.425,2197.599,--He... he obeys the injunction and he obeys State law except with respect to the credit which he is enjoined from giving.
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2197.599,2199.457,"I agree, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2199.457,2201.936,And the result is that he collects the... the full tax.
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2203.255,2204.62,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.62,2217.827,"Suppose... suppose the State law says if these tax credits are invalidated, all other taxpayers shall be assessed an additional 2 percent to make up for... I'm sorry."
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2243.008,2246.351,"Your Honor, I believe--"
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2246.351,2258.983,"In other words, he is prevented from collecting the additional amount that he would have had to collect from other taxpayers had this tax credit been acknowledged."
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2278.402,2286.187,"--Your Honor, if... if the tax credit is struck down, the State gets more money."
2003.02-1809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2300.47,2300.636,All right.
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2377.724,2393.721,"Your Honor, Justice Breyer, it's interesting about the Internal Revenue Code and the... the Federal income tax law because there is a corollary to the Tax Injunction Act: the Anti-Injunction Act of 1867."
2003.02-1809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2402.515,2403.713,That's not an answer for the reason--
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2403.713,2404.084,--May I--
2003.02-1809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2404.084,2409.285,"--that they're saying they're wrong, just as they say we were wrong in five cases not to notice this."
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2410.854,2411.071,--Yes.
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.604,2430.173,But it isn't and; it's or.
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2430.712,2445.777,"The... Justice Scalia, it... it is or for purposes of saying that you can't restrain any of those because if you restrain any of those in the context of creating the stream of revenue, you have stopped the stream of revenue."
2003.02-1809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2449.864,2450.401,So your answer is this.
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2478.515,2479.834,"That's our position, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2479.834,2480.373,That's your view.
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2484.087,2484.542,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2484.542,2484.847,All right.
2003.02-1809,2,35554,marvin_s_cohen,,2485.407,2504.976,I... I would like to also point out to the Court that this use of a tax credit as a mechanism could also to... that is to funnel money to school tuition organizations could just as well have been an appropriation of dollars and vouchers.
2003.02-1809,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2523.013,2524.128,But it wasn't done that way.
2003.02-1809,3,41396,samuel_goddard,,3022.267,3024.124,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2003.02-1809,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3053.929,3055.581,What... what happened in... in Nyquist and Mueller?
2003.02-1809,3,41396,samuel_goddard,,3057.356,3079.358,"Your... Your Honor, the Court did not deal in any way with the issue of... of section 1341 in either Nyquist or Mueller, and I believe under... under your decision in DeBuono there is... which also deals with 1341 and the failure to raise it, there can be a presumption that the escape clause was exercised."
2003.02-1809,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3086.046,3089.473,"But there... one sees plain, speedy, and effective--"
2003.02-1809,3,41396,samuel_goddard,,3089.473,3089.844,Efficient.
2003.02-1809,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3089.844,3092.073,--that's a taxpayer who has to go through the system.
2003.02-1809,3,41396,samuel_goddard,,3117.048,3123.281,"Your Honor, in... in the Anti-Injunction Act, that creates a serious problem."
2003.02-1809,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3153.008,3161.47,"I meant within the meaning of the Injunction Act, it seems that swift, whatever, remedy was referring to the taxpayer's remedy under State law--"
2003.02-1809,3,41396,samuel_goddard,,3161.47,3162.092,--Yes.
2003.02-1809,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3162.092,3162.873,--could take care of--
2003.02-1809,3,41396,samuel_goddard,,3162.873,3167.497,"Yes, Your Honor, and under the Federal law there's a problem because you can't pay a tax and get it refunded if you're a third party."
2003.02-1809,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3182.979,3183.062,--The same plaintiffs?
2003.02-1809,3,41396,samuel_goddard,,3185.374,3193.382,"--Your Honor, I... I didn't mean to imply they were the same plaintiffs, but they were exactly the same issues in turning a constitutional violation."
2003.02-1809,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3216.582,3222.172,--We have that same problem in habeas sometimes too when the State Supreme Court disagrees with the Federal district court.
2003.02-1809,3,41396,samuel_goddard,,3222.172,3225.766,"Yes, Your Honor, but in the situation in habeas, we don't have the Tax Injunction Act."
2003.02-1809,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3244.546,3246.282,"Thank you, General Goddard."
