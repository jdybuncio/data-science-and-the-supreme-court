1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,17.846,20.906,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,194.539,196.411,"Corrected as to future, you mean?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,196.411,198.743,It’s been corrected for some time Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,198.743,200.198,Two years approximately or --
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,200.198,206.029,"In 70 -- 1972, the last correction took place in November, I believe."
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,206.029,218.675,"Mr. Solicitor General, is it the fact in each of these cases, what was told that the judge, any chances was not quite accurate?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,218.675,219.242,In every one of these --
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,219.242,221.035,What happened?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,221.035,237.48,"In every one of these cases, there was a letter authorizing an application which went out over the signature of Mr. Will Wilson, then head of the Criminal Division."
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,278.693,280.487,"Now, that wasn’t my question."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,288.988,292.721,"He had accurate information as to everything except, Mr. Wilson’s name."
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,292.721,295.513,"Well that’s [Laughter] rather important, isn't it?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,295.513,296.438,Well --
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,296.438,297.668,Under the statute?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,297.668,299.514,"I think it has, I think it has importance under the statute."
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,493.623,498.564,What if he hadn’t approved that after he got back from a month's trip?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,498.564,503.762,"Well, I -- if he hadn’t approve, I assume that the interception would have terminated."
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,504.556,506.618,The interception would have taken place.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,506.618,509.388,"For the month, Mr. Justice Stewart, correct."
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,541.757,548.168,"Well, but also the Court, not have determined it, that the -- that Will Wilson had approved it too when he hadn’t?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,548.168,548.615,That is correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,548.615,553.19,And that Will Wilson had been specifically designated and had in fact approved it?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,553.19,553.708,That is correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,553.708,566.993,If that a fact it would have been approved by under my hypothetical case by Mr. Lindenbaum who was orally authorized to do it and but then on the return of the Attorney General had been disapproved.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,566.993,567.561,Under your hypothetical --
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,567.561,567.837,[Voice Overlap]
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,567.837,570.954,"Well, under your hypothetical that would be true."
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,598.048,600.184,Is that beginning in April 1970?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,600.184,600.922,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,600.922,602.431,"And for how long, about a period?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,602.431,610.749,"In the 1971 when these practice was first questioned in Court because the Department of Justice said no inkling, anybody, they're being troublesome about this practice."
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,899.329,911.867,"Mr. Solicitor General, the order would name in this sequence at that time the Assistant Attorney General of the civil, of the Criminal Division or who would be the named person?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,911.867,925.325,"The -- in every one of these wire intercept order, some 500 of them, Mr. Wilson’s name appears, Criminal Division, because of this memorandum and forums that were used in the department."
1973.72-1057,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,942.237,945.007,Well how did this happen Mr. Solicitor General?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,950.274,950.983,Nobody caught it.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,970.817,971.829,Mr. Will Wilson?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,971.829,975.264,Right.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,984.301,986.709,"It turned out that your department, hasn’t it?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,986.709,991.699,"The -- some of this relevant positions had been propositions, had been, yes, Mr. Stewart."
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,991.699,995.352,"Mr. Solicitor, I see if I get this clearly."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1001.379,1001.685,Yes.
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1001.685,1005.14,"That each application, that means the application to the judge, does it not?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1005.14,1006.033,That is correct Mr. Justice Brennan.
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1006.033,1023.392,"And that shall include, shall include the following information: (a) the identity of the investigative or law enforcement officer making the application and do I understand that none of these applications accurately identified the investigative or law enforcement officer making the application?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1023.392,1029.541,"No Mr. Justice Brennan, they did identify that man, that was the trial attorney, or the investigator."
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1029.541,1029.944,Right.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1029.944,1032.65,But they did not invest -- they did not correctly identify the officer --
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1032.65,1033.498,Officer authorizing.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1033.498,1034.351,Authorizing the application.
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1034.351,1035.541,None of them did?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1035.541,1035.994,That is correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1035.994,1042.898,"So that at least on the face of the statute, none of these applications complied with that provision of the statute."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1042.898,1043.553,That is correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1043.553,1044.276,Right.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1044.276,1054.663,"In other words, the facts are that Will Wilson never authorized one of these and never signed the letter."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1054.663,1079.624,"Will Wilson certainly never signed the letter and the best that can be said about the authorization procedure is that if delegation is permissible in this area, point that I would come to, he had delegated on the way up the power to approve the application to his deputies, two deputies, Mr. Peterson and Mr. Shapiro and they did approve them on the way up."
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1085.517,1091.877,"Well, one or the other -- the deputies would put his signature on it with a rubber stamp or make some [Inaudible]"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1091.877,1096.388,"I don’t - - I think whether the -- used the stamp or facsimile, I don’t know, but they did put on --"
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1096.388,1099.377,Or write out his name as over his signature?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1099.377,1101.943,That’s correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1101.943,1113.94,In effect this was following the practice that is routinely done with ordinary letters every -- day-to-day as distinguished from applications to a court?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1113.94,1114.033,Oh!
1973.72-1057,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1144.41,1151.8,It is hardly ministerial to describe the issue in some of the [Inaudible]
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1151.8,1161.915,"No, I only meant with that Mr. Justice Douglas was that the fact that somebody else signed Mr. Wilson’s signature, I think was ministerial."
1973.72-1057,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1172.386,1191.698,"Because what you said brought me up rather sharply because in -- when I was in the executive branch, this was a recurring problem that we never dreamed to delegate anybody, deciding the subpoenas in your name?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1191.698,1195.868,"Mr. Justice Douglas, I don’t think there was any delegation of a signing of subpoenas."
1973.72-1057,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1195.868,1198.705,Well this is -- we’re getting at the same thing.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1198.705,1199.454,Had the --
1973.72-1057,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1199.454,1200.822,They're collecting evidence.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1200.822,1218.551,"Had the letter said, this letter was only notifying the trial attorney, had the letter said, the Attorney General has authorized this as was the case and had Mr. Peterson signed Mr. Wilson’s name to a statement that the Attorney General authorized it, I don’t think there would have been any problem, that would have been a ministerial act."
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1219.296,1221.166,If the Attorney General had authorized?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1221.166,1223.035,That’s correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1230.359,1236.205,"So the order that came back down from the Attorney General actually did say, you are authorized to notify it, didn’t it -- isn’t it?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1236.205,1246.216,It said Mr. Justice White that you are specially designated to act in this matter for the purpose of authorizing the application.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1259.923,1263.45,And that was a communication from the Attorney General to Attorney General Wilson.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1263.45,1264.039,That is correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1264.039,1264.944,And the --
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1264.944,1265.411,They were --
1973.72-1057,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1265.411,1279.611,"The fact was that at stage, the Attorney General has already approved it and in effect it was an order to Wilson to go ahead and approve it himself, I suppose?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1279.611,1280.853,That’s correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1280.853,1288.632,Is there any way in the world that the judge could know that Mr. Lindenbaum had approved it and not the Attorney General?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1288.632,1291.019,Not unless inquiry was made Mr. Justice Marshall as it --
1973.72-1057,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1291.019,1293.009,But there was a reason for them to make that --
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1293.009,1294.867,"No, they would not."
1973.72-1057,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1295.612,1304.518,"What you’re actually doing, you were telling the judge that either Mr. Wilson or the Attorney General approved this."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1304.518,1304.748,"Well, the fact --"
1973.72-1057,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1304.748,1308.573,And in fact the executive assistant was doing it.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1308.573,1311.143,"Well, in some cases the executive assistant was doing it, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1973.72-1057,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1311.143,1313.52,That’s the one -- those are the ones I’m talking about.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1313.52,1317.14,But the -- in no case was the judge told that the Attorney General did it.
1973.72-1057,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1319.122,1321.137,It would -- Mr. Wilson wasn’t doing it?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1321.137,1321.372,No.
1973.72-1057,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1322.916,1330.4,Mr. Wilson was doing what Mr. Lindenbaum told him to do with Mr. Mitchell’s signature.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1330.4,1332.19,That is correct Mr. -- that is correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1362.081,1365.148,"Well, I don’t know whether that happens so often."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1372.527,1376.971,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, I intend to discuss at some length of fact."
1973.72-1057,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1376.971,1378.03,"Okay, go ahead."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1378.03,1381.87,"No, I won’t answer it now, to -- I didn’t mean to put a -- I didn’t mean to put it off."
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1407.989,1432.735,"And yet I suppose Mr. Solicitor General what this will come down to, is being as you opened in the statement a statutory matter is what significance did the Congress attach to that provision requiring that the application identify the officer authorizing the application, doesn’t it?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1442.022,1442.255,"Well, --"
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1442.255,1450.117,"-- depending on everything you’ve said that I spoke -- I expect to – it is still a statutory violation, isn’t it?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1450.117,1451.639,No.
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1451.639,1454.209,"Well, I mean it doesn’t -- you may not concede it but that’s what the issue comes down to?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1454.209,1456.23,"The issue comes down to that, certainly Mr. Justice Brennan."
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1465.889,1466.317,"Well, I gather --"
1973.72-1057,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.317,1468.209,When even if it’s a statutory violation.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1468.209,1469.047,That is correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1469.047,1486.573,"But I gather, when you get to whether or not it was a statutory violation, you will address don’t you that report of the -- the Senate report in which -- in the dealing with this requirement, the emphasis was on the lines of responsibility leading to an unidentifiable person?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1486.573,1486.938,I think --
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1486.938,1493.476,(Inaudible) this provision itself should go a long way for guaranteeing that no abuses will happen?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1493.476,1506.604,"I think indeed -- I will come to that and indeed in terms of the delegation by Mr. Mitchell to Mr. Lindenbaum, I would contend that the statutory purposes are carried out precisely."
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1519.85,1523.012,"It may not but behind the scenes, that’s quite true."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1529.613,1535.474,"That -- yes sir, Mr. Justice Brennan, that is the 2518 (1) and (4) (d) question."
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1536.587,1536.861,I beg your pardon?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1536.861,1538.09,-- 2516 question but --
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1538.09,1541.301,To the effect of the court.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1541.301,1554.607,"Let me come to the -- I suppose since these cases are so general in their impact, I need not perhaps detail particular facts of this case and how it happened in the Giordano case."
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1618.065,1620.783,Are those neutrally exclusive or is the --
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1620.783,1622.52,"No, they overlap Mr. Justice Stewart, I was about to say all of the Mitchell, --"
1973.72-1057,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1622.52,1624.069,And the latter include the former?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1624.069,1624.648,Yes.
1973.72-1057,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1744.476,1746.409,"Well, the statute provides for it, doesn't it?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1746.409,1749.662,I think not Mr. Justice Douglas.
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1754.044,1772.562,"Well, what does that provision 2515, whenever any wire or oral communication is intercepted, no part of the content of self-communication and no evidence derived there from, may be received in evidence in any trial before any court, disclosure of that information would be in violation to this chapter."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1772.562,1773.007,That is quite --
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1773.007,1774.316,"That’s the provision, isn’t it?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1774.316,1775.881,I don’t think that’s the operative provision.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1776.527,1778.365,"2518 can, the other --"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1778.365,1780.583,That is correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1887.123,1888.395,Which of these cases is that?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1888.395,1889.737,"This is in Giordano, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1889.737,1891.186,Thank you.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1891.908,1892.489,39.
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2057.554,2067.871,Are you saying that that test must be made by assuming the truth and accuracy of everything that’s in the paper -- on the paper.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2076.797,2078.188,That’s right Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2113.339,2115.31,"The three, no Court has held the three, isn’t out here?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2115.31,2115.805,"No, no."
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2205.889,2229.513,Probably there are good many other provisions in the statute which are restrictions and limitations and conditions limiting the circumstances under which wiretapping can be or -- can be lawfully carried on in addition to the ones we’re talking about here.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2290.143,2290.417,No.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2303.368,2306.795,"Well, I’m talking about -- I’m really not talking about supervisory powers."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2330.022,2331.269,I think so Mr. Justice Stewart.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2332.282,2332.316,Right.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2332.316,2340.755,That would not exclude the possibility of that in a case where the investigator you mentioned --
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2340.755,2344.897,Just had been exhausted although he said he did but that -- then it became clear --
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2344.897,2345.228,They did an intention --
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2345.228,2348.956,One or another that he hadn’t. Let's say he was in good faith.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2360.0,2365.64,"If it was in good faith Mr. Justice Stewart, I think I would -- I think I have to say that --"
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2365.64,2366.193,Your argument --
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2366.193,2368.328,The suppression provisions do not apply to it.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2368.328,2370.821,That’s what I thought your argument would lead to.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2371.561,2373.054,Congress could apply them at any time.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2373.054,2373.227,Oh!
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2381.639,2382.06,"In terms of the statute, Mr. Justice Stewart --"
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2382.06,2386.706,It may apply 2518 (10) (a) (1).
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2386.706,2389.882,In terms of the statute I think Mr. Justice Stewart that is probably correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2406.718,2410.407,"Well, my question was directed to one, to the statute."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2410.407,2411.888,I think I would like.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2419.234,2421.019,Or you must lead the Court --
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2421.019,2424.027,"Yes, to achieve a result that couldn't otherwise be achieved."
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2424.824,2430.011,To get the issuance of a warrant that otherwise have -- wouldn’t and could’ve had issued.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2430.011,2430.502,That’s correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2430.502,2431.532,Knowingly.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2431.532,2432.447,That’s correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2432.447,2448.475,"As to number one Mr. Solicitor General, would that embrace a situation where the United States Attorney in the field or his assistant just went out and placed the tap without any authority from anybody, would that be --"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2448.475,2448.588,Oh!
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2450.552,2452.088,Now the -- yes.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2456.557,2458.855,Or a case in which the probable cause was absent.
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2458.855,2460.158,No authority whatever.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2462.731,2465.141,"Yes, certainly Mr. Chief Justice that is certainly true."
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2465.141,2470.898,And then there would be a spectrum of situations --
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2470.898,2472.234,"Well, there are wide varieties of situation in which this would apply."
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2472.234,2475.027,-- under -- this would all fall under number one.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2475.027,2476.007,Correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2505.13,2506.682,What were these -- what are the sanctions then?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2516.238,2522.31,"Well, I think they lie primarily with Congress."
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2522.31,2526.349,"Well, Congress has enacted this law and said what they’d wanted to take place."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2526.349,2526.511,That’s correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2526.511,2528.833,That the Congress has done its job.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2528.833,2535.468,"Mr. Justice Stewart, what I meant by that was that if the Congress wishes to add a sanction that’s where the sanction should come from."
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2563.287,2568.736,"Well, Congress here wasn’t concerned really with the -- with good faith."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2575.905,2576.473,That is correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2576.473,2580.264,And these are just dead letters that if there’s no sanction.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2580.264,2581.5,Mr. Justice Stewart I don’t think --
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2581.5,2616.586,"Even if they’re -- even if the violations are in all good faith, whether the violations of the kind involved in the cases now before us or the violation of the kind that I suggested under 2510, whatever it is -- 2518 (1) (a) -- (1) (c), no exhaustion, Congress said there cannot be even if it should -- must not be wire interceptions until all other means have failed for example and under your view, they're -- they're just -- will continue to be such interceptions if you get --"
1973.72-1057,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2616.586,2642.548,"In that connection, when cases come here from the state courts it’s traditionally been the argument that the remedy, the sanctions are [Inaudible] and prosecute the policemen, or the man, criminal for doing this unlawful taps or secondly the citizen who send your -- sue under 1983 for damages, do you think if those alternatives would be available here?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2642.548,2649.13,"If as a willful disclosure of a kind that the statute forbids Mr. Justice Douglas, there isn’t."
1973.72-1057,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2649.13,2654.766,"How about violations of a procedure, for generating the search?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2654.766,2669.908,No I doubt Mr. Justice Douglas that I would think that the delegation from this -- I’m sure I would think that the delegation from Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Lindenbaum does not generate either criminal or civil liability and I think the misidentification of Mr. Wilson does not generate either of those varieties --
1973.72-1057,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2669.908,2673.975,Then Justice Stewart was right to get down to those sanctions and unless its suppressed.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2673.975,2684.703,"Well Mr. Justice Stewart -- I mean Mr. Justice Douglas, if I may say -- I may say the sanctions have been specified by Congress and the fact that they did not specify this sanction, I think ought to mean something as well as the --"
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2684.703,2687.946,"Well, it means these words are just precatory?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2687.946,2693.106,"They are precatory with, if I may say, one exception."
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2709.258,2715.68,Then you -- your argument is the statute would not have been -- it would not be under a one or two?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2715.68,2716.089,That is correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2716.089,2716.814,Right.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2717.568,2719.288,That is correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2719.288,2737.545,"Do you think the statute would have a different meaning Mr. Solicitor General if now calling your attention first to 2518 where all the language is mandatory shall be made in writing, shall the state the applicant’s authority, shall include the following."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2779.412,2781.504,"No Mr. Chief Justice, I do not."
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2785.636,2792.528,"Now, but this does not anywhere in the statute to say anything about what the Court shall do."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2813.184,2821.723,"In my view Mr. Chief Justice, if a communication was unlawfully intercepted in the sense that we’ve been talking about, I doubt that the judge has any discretion."
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2821.723,2824.227,"Well, then how about number two?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2824.227,2824.388,Oh!
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2841.489,2844.59,Therefore it would have been an unconstitutional tap?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2844.59,2845.096,"Well, that is correct."
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2845.096,2850.152,With an insufficient warrant?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2850.152,2855.22,"And if he doesn’t follow the terms of the order, I think it must be suppressed as well."
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2855.22,2862.816,"Well, Mr. Solicitor General, do you -- are you suggesting that 2518 is to be read without reference to 2515?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2862.816,2882.66,"No Mr. Justice Brennan, I think if 2518 (10) (a) as we just read in the Senate Report here a moment ago on page 39, was it -- its -- what they say -- the Senate said that 2515 must be read in the light of Section 2518 (10) (a)."
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2886.183,2890.634,"But 2515 is certainly explicit, isn’t it?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2890.634,2892.635,Not terribly Mr. Justice Brennan.
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2892.635,2905.244,"Well, I don’t think this statute is certainly is a model of clarity by any means, and like any of us who had to wrestle with it, but we think so but at least 2515 is susceptible, isn’t it?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2916.049,2922.599,"Well, one has to discover then Mr. Justice Brennan what disclosure would be in violation of this chapter and then you get back to the suppression provisions."
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2922.599,2931.489,"But it does incorporate into the statute, the judicially constructed exclusionary rule, does it not?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2931.489,2931.628,Oh!
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2932.477,2933.627,No question about that.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2933.627,2944.405,"No question Mr. Chief Justice but I think the 2515 point is important because you only know what disclosure Mr. Justice Brennan, is in violation of the statute by knowing what may not be disclosed."
1973.72-1057,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.902,2954.984,"Well, once you decide what that is, what is unlawful then you get to your point that the -- if you decide it’s unlawful, there's no discretion."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2956.669,2957.804,I think so.
1973.72-1057,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.804,2961.588,Under -- because 2515 said so.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2961.588,2963.163,That is correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2963.163,2968.334,"Your argument is not 2518, 2515 says, it must be suppressed, right?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2968.334,2969.456,I think that’s correct.
1973.72-1057,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2969.456,2977.776,"Your Argument Solicitor General it seems to me that if the man is is not in the prison, it has echoes of the harmless error argument."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2985.93,2996.568,"Well, Mr. Justice Douglas I think there is an echo in that particularly as to the Will Wilson misidentification issue."
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3052.174,3071.204,"In this respect do you, distinguish it all between what we might call this, the Lindenbaum authorizations and those actually made by the Attorney General but which Mr. Wilson did not in fact act upon."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,3073.948,3077.958,I don’t think in this connection Mr. Chief Justice that I would make any.
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3098.566,3100.472,Before you do for a moment.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,3125.06,3171.205,"Mr. Chief Justice, essentially that if the Attorney General himself made the decision and through this confusion about memorandum, Mr. Wilson’s name got sent out when it shouldn’t have, it seems to me that that’s error, it seems to be that it shouldn’t happen, but I certainly if anything is harmless error that is -- there is certainly no reason to say that a judge who has found all the constitutional elements, probable cause, need for wire interception, failure of other techniques and so forth would have turned down the application had he been told that the Attorney General, rather than the Assistant Attorney General has authorized it."
1973.72-1057,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3420.559,3427.218,Your argument would be very convincing if the sta -- if this statute now before us had simply said the Attorney General.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,3439.331,3443.977,I think it does Mr. Justice Stewart and I think to this extent.
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3560.814,3567.915,"Didn't the draft of this statute, Mr. Solicitor General would have authorized the United States Attorney to make the application?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,3567.915,3569.312,It was a draft of that sort.
1973.72-1057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3569.312,3578.687,"And I gather the -- it was justice that came in and said, it was Mr. Miller wasn’t it that preferred it limit to the Attorney General or an assistant designated by him?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,3578.687,3579.409,That’s correct.

1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,3620.297,3634.655,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it seems to me that that would be a very curious result in the state in that way because what that would mean is that Congress was really not terribly concerned about unitary policies of any kind."
1973.72-1057,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3664.858,3681.841,"Well of course then it's virtually an abandonment of the notion that you don’t -- that you want to identify the man, to say so, he can delegate it so long as his signature appears because presumably in the most elaborate bureaucracy in the world, the headman signature appears on the thing before it goes out?"
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,3681.841,3712.446,"No, no, when I said delegation Mr. Justice Rehnquist, what I meant was this statutes says to the Attorney General, unless you designate an Assistant Attorney General, you are the man to be held responsible and we want uniformity of policy and that is accomplished when he takes a man as executive assistant whom -- who has done 50 or 60 of these applications and says now you know my policy, when I’m unavailable, act, tell me when I get back."

1973.72-1057,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3739.098,3743.211,Why he didn’t give Will Wilson an authority while he was out of town?

1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,3752.369,3753.515,That is correct Mr. Justice Marshall.

1973.72-1057,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3823.094,3823.905,Of course he did.

1973.72-1057,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3830.602,3831.445,Who did?
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,3833.196,3839.875,"His deputies were Mr. Peterson, Mr. Shapiro were greatly involved as the memorandum were going up, they approved them."

1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,3864.368,3864.756,Oh!
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3877.076,3879.884,You spoke of a special unit handling these matters.
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,3883.756,3886.971,Within the organized crime section of the Criminal Division.
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3886.971,3896.652,Well now is that -- are you suggesting that that had a certain autonomy and that they were functioning in this special field on their --
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,3896.652,3899.045,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, they didn’t have any autonomy in that sense."
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3899.045,3906.579,"Autonomy, I’m speaking, autonomy from the regular staff line of command of the Criminal Division."
1973.72-1057,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,3906.579,3920.934,"No, not autonomy Mr. Chief Justice, they were specialized and it was their specialized function to make the initial review of these matters before sending it up the hierarchy through the Criminal Division but they had no autonomy."
1973.72-1057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3926.834,3928.468,Mr. Smouse.
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,3928.468,3932.231,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1057,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4296.506,4299.776,"And all of the -- excuse me, go ahead."
1973.72-1057,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4299.776,4302.192,"I just want to know, are any Court of Appeals, the other way?"
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4302.192,4319.477,"The Pisacano case Mr. Justice Brennan, in the Second Circuit which was later followed although I must say I don’t feel embraced by the opinion in the Becker case, Judge Friendly wrote -- Chief Judge Friendly wrote the opinion in Pisacano, Judge Mansfield wrote the Becker opinion."
1973.72-1057,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4319.477,4319.606,But it’s only the Second Circuit.
1973.72-1057,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4319.606,4320.658,Did it happen --
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4320.658,4324.478,"The Second Circuit, is the only Circuit that I am aware of Mr. Justice Brennan to the contrary."
1973.72-1057,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4324.478,4327.901,Did Robinson ever come out en banc from the Fifth Circuit?
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4327.901,4330.52,"It did Mr. Justice, not en banc."
1973.72-1057,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4345.867,4351.102,"But there was an appeal of the Court of Appeals, the Fifth Circuit en banc in Robinson?"
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4351.102,4355.299,The original opinion resulted in a petition for rehearing.
1973.72-1057,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4362.911,4373.559,"My question was, we’ve just -- we’ve just -- while you’re already interrupted, you said that all of these courts with the exceptions you’ve now noticed -- noted have decreed suppression."
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4383.715,4387.863,In reliance on 2515 and 2518 (10) (a).
1973.72-1057,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4387.863,4394.349,"So they’ve held, more accurately they’ve held that the statute compels suppression, correct?"
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4394.349,4398.189,That is precisely correct.
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4410.716,4423.744,"In other words, your case, to be sure I have it absolutely clear, withstand independent -- independently even if there was no such thing as the doctrine of exclusion of evidence."
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4423.744,4426.885,"Yes Your Honor, we feel that the remedy here --"
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4426.885,4430.235,"The Statute has prescribed the remedy, is your case --"
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4430.235,4432.377,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4558.322,4560.113,"Well, let me get that last."
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4563.284,4564.486,I submit it does not Your Honor.
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4567.907,4576.749,"Well, the incumbent, whoever is the incumbent of that office is the identifiable person, is he not?"
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4576.749,4576.803,He is --
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4576.803,4577.82,"Whoever is, the Attorney General --?"
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4577.82,4579.157,"Yes, he is Mr. Chief Justice, the Attorney General."
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4579.157,4592.553,"So it’s an identifiable office in terms of which changes, in terms of the incumbency from time to time."
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4592.553,4594.341,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4622.645,4633.138,Could the Attorney General have under this statute lawfully designated all of the Assistant Attorneys General?
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4633.138,4633.981,He could Your Honor.
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4633.981,4638.585,And Acting Assistant Attorneys General?
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4638.585,4643.299,"I cannot speak to acting Assistants, I’m not sure that they receive, they have gone through the --"
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4643.299,4643.831,They do not.
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4643.831,4647.217,They have not gone through the confirmation process I would say no to that Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4647.217,4652.873,Where in the statute do you find this limited to those confirmed by the Senate?
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4652.873,4678.88,"In the legislative history, actually Senate Report 1097, where it speaks to official subject to the political process and I submit that means the confirmation process, that is the rationale really of the Fifth Circuit in the Robinson case wherein that court noted by expressing its intention that only a publicly responsible official subject to the political process could initiate a wiretap application."
1973.72-1057,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4688.047,4694.432,Then you would also exclude an acting Attorney General?
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4694.432,4703.113,"I would Your Honor unless he had as I believe Mr. Clinding has been confirmed, I believed he had been confirmed as deputy."
1973.72-1057,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4703.113,4706.869,"Well, how about the last acting Attorney General, Mr --"
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4706.869,4709.385,The present Solicitor General.
1973.72-1057,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4709.385,4716.935,Who was confirmed as Solicitor General but not as Attorney General.
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4716.935,4722.472,He has been tested by the political process.[Laughter]
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4722.472,4729.963,"Mr. Smouse, is it essential to your case that that be that -- the standard."
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4759.613,4762.456,"Yes Mr. Chief Justice, they are involved in the political process --"
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4762.456,4762.585,Only the --
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4762.585,4766.794,But they have not been Senatorially confirmed and I feel that Senate meant --
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4766.794,4771.367,"No, the statute doesn’t say anything about Senatorially confirmed."
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4773.542,4775.061,I do Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4775.061,4800.37,"But you got it from the language, the political language but surely a Deputy Assistant Attorney General selected whether by the Assistant Attorney General himself or by the Attorney General, but in fact appointed by the Attorney General is politically responsive is the sense of that legislative history, is he not?"
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4800.37,4805.912,I submit Mr. Chief Justice that that confirmation is what the senate had in mind.
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4805.912,4808.148,Where do they particularly say that?
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4808.148,4808.948,They do not say it.
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4821.083,4832.17,"Each division of the Department of Justice has one, two or possibly three exempt positions at the top echelon, does it not?"
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4832.17,4835.257,I believe that is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4835.257,4842.552,And you say they are not embraced within this political process?
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4846.975,4859.433,A stamp of approval has not been placed on them by the Senate in an area where the Senate wanted great care exercise in the authorization of wiretap surveillance.
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4859.433,4878.05,"Then, to pursue Mr. Justice Blackmun’s inquiry a few moments ago, if you had a period where you had an acting Attorney General appointed under a recess appointment, who might act for quite a while as some have, you would be immobilized under the statute."
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4878.05,4888.36,That would easily be met Mr. Chief Justice had his predecessor designated an Assistant Attorney General to exercise authorization in this area and the Congress --
1973.72-1057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4888.36,4898.997,Wouldn’t you -- wouldn’t the Government immediately run under the proposition that when a principal ceased to hold the power all his agents fell with him?
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,4898.997,4920.124,"I think not Mr. Chief Justice, I feel that if the Attorney General had exercised the foresight here to designate the man chosen to head the Criminal Division to authorize wiretap applications obviously, there would not be this host of cases before the Courts."
1973.72-1057,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5218.181,5226.207,You rely on the 2518 (10) (a) (1) or (2) or I guess the answer is you rely on both?
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,5226.207,5227.581,I would rely on both Your Honor.

1973.72-1057,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5331.906,5335.33,"That’s already been done, hasn’t it?"
1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,5339.026,5344.788,They have changed and apparently corrected their procedures.

1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,5346.969,5349.214,No Mr. Justice.

1973.72-1057,1,28072,h_russel_smouse,,5363.568,5367.632,"That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart, there is no such language in Burger and Katz."

1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,5866.804,5872.295,"Well, I’m appointed to represent the respondent Apodaca but I’m appearing on behalf of the other respondents also."
1973.72-1057,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5872.295,5875.692,Even though your brief is restricted to George Apodaca?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,5875.692,5876.332,That’s correct Your Honor.
1973.72-1057,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5879.255,5883.032,But you are positioning yourself as representing all of them here?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,5883.032,5884.488,Yes Your Honor.
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5954.741,5961.313,Is it essential to your case Mr. Hewitt that the Court was in fact misled?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,5961.313,5966.79,"No, I don’t believe so Your Honor because the statute wasn’t complied with if the wrong person was placed in."
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5966.79,5969.086,That’s the end if isn’t it?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,5976.006,5980.361,"It is unnecessary, but it certainly makes the violation certainly more --"
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5980.361,5996.244,"But even if you stopped before you got to what the Judge believed or what he thought he was acting on or what he relied on, you think you’d have your case in the same posture you have it now?"
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,5996.244,5997.996,"Yes, we would Your Honor."
1973.72-1057,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5998.429,6006.795,"And if the audit said that it was done by Will Wilson and a matter of fact, it had been done by John Mitchell?"
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6006.795,6010.641,It would be bad Your Honor because it identifies the wrong person.
1973.72-1057,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6020.791,6022.382,And they would do what to Wilson?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6022.382,6025.935,"They might say, “Wilson how dare you authorize this improper wiretap.”"
1973.72-1057,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6032.179,6034.534,"I know, it’s not what I said."
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6050.374,6054.882,"This is the position in the Chavez case Your Honor, that pretty much the status of the facts."
1973.72-1057,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6054.882,6057.807,And that’s wrong for what reason?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6057.807,6061.408,Because the order must identify the person who actually approved the wiretap.
1973.72-1057,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6061.408,6067.441,"Even though the subordinate signed it, the boss decided it?"
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6067.441,6069.14,Yes Your Honor.
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6144.247,6170.084,"And if an application were presented to a District Judge Mr. Hewitt, which recited the correct facts, that is that this in detail, that this application was signed by Mr. Sol Lindenbaum on behalf of, note that Mr. Sol Lindenbaum acting for the Attorney General authorized Mr. Will Wilson to make this application."
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6170.084,6170.31,I don’t know --
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6170.31,6172.578,Do you think -- you think that would not comply with the statute?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6172.578,6173.089,I don’t think so.
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6173.089,6183.598,"And the District Judge might look at the statute and say, “You can’t do this with Mr. Lindenbaum, whoever he may be,” says the District Judge out in California."
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6183.598,6186.042,Yes.
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6186.042,6209.443,"Now, on the other hand, if it correctly recited, this application was authorized by the Attorney General of the United States by his designation of Mr. Will Wilson, would you think the District Judge would be misled in the same way?"
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6209.443,6209.626,If the --
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6209.626,6215.928,Or does not the greater authority of the Attorney General swallow the lesser authority of any Assistant Attorney General?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6215.928,6218.533,"No, and for this reason Your Honor."
1973.72-1057,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,6380.789,6382.322,Have you cited that on your brief?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6382.322,6384.956,"No, I haven’t Your Honor, I found it just the other day."
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6384.956,6386.386,Could you make that available?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6386.386,6387.156,Yes I will Your Honor.
1973.72-1057,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6538.706,6540.831,Were there pen registers involved in your case?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6540.831,6543.021,Yes Your Honor.
1973.72-1057,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6543.021,6547.596,And do they require as I understand that all that they reveal is the numbers called from a particular phone?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6547.596,6548.185,Yes Your Honor.
1973.72-1057,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6550.319,6551.638,And not covered by the statute?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6551.638,6551.877,That’s correct.
1973.72-1057,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6551.877,6556.859,"That they are -- on the other hand that you needed the cover by the constitution in the Fourth Amendment, are they not?"
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6556.859,6563.233,"Yes Your Honor, I think the statutory scheme for pen registers is adequate in this particular case."
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6602.07,6617.791,"I don’t recall now Mr. Hewitt too clearly, did Judge Duniway of the -- for the Ninth Circuit would rely on both 1 and 2 of Section 10?"
1973.72-1057,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6617.791,6619.491,Did he rely on a confirmation?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6619.491,6620.118,It’s a little unclear.
1973.72-1057,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6620.118,6622.506,2515 and --
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6622.506,6623.496,And 2518?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6623.496,6625.411,"Yes, and --"
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6625.411,6630.028,But I’m talking now about the subdivisions of --
1973.72-1057,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6630.028,6632.592,"1, 2 and 3?"
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6632.592,6637.65,"1, 2 and 3 that the communication was unlawfully intercepted."
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6650.752,6650.896,Yes.
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6650.896,6655.173,"And I’m just wondering, did Judge Duniway have a bracket to whole area?"
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6655.173,6657.882,"No, I think Judge Duniway was considering that probably it applied to both --"
1973.72-1057,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6657.882,6658.681,Both unlawful.
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6658.681,6661.039,-- both unlawfully intercepted and perhaps --
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6661.039,6661.632,And --
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6661.632,6662.635,-- valid on its face.
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6662.635,6664.109,1 and 2.
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6664.109,6665.941,Two.
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6697.981,6713.831,"Well, assuming hypothetically that 2518 (10) (a) (1), (2) and (3) did not by implication cover this; certainly, Section 2515 is explicit, is it not?"
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6713.831,6715.588,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1973.72-1057,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6742.181,6744.629,"To suppress what, if the Court has the power?"
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6744.629,6751.149,A search warrant affidavit that misidentifies the affiant.
1973.72-1057,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6752.898,6756.461,"Well, you -- but you're suggesting that some kind of a McNabb-Mallory --"
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6756.461,6760.517,"Yes Your Honor, some type of supervisory rule that would -- that would get the -- some sanction for non-compliance."
1973.72-1057,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6760.517,6762.713,Even if we find its -- this isn’t covered by the statute?
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6762.713,6768.857,"Yes, I think the statute covers it, but I’m not sure that that would be crucial to uphold the Ninth Circuit's decision."
1973.72-1057,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6788.479,6810.889,"Do you think your case is stronger or weaker on respect to a judge made exclusionary rule in a situation like this where Congress has laid down statutory qualifications and then itself provided the circumstances under which there should be suppression or in a case like McNabb where simply Congress has enacted a statutory prohibition, has said nothing about suppression."
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6813.64,6828.404,I think the judges would be freer in this case because they can interpret the statute unlawfully intercepted in a broad fashion to include those same traditional defects that the Court would consider defect -- consider controlling in a typical search and seizure.
1973.72-1057,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6828.404,6833.98,"Well, then there really wouldn’t be any of our supervisory power, or just be a statutory interpretation."
1973.72-1057,2,30764,james_f_hewitt,,6833.98,6838.224,Yes Your Honor.
1973.72-1057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6839.232,6839.965,Thank you gentlemen.
