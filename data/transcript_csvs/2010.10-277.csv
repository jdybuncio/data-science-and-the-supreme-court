2010.10-277,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.32,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-277, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes."
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,7.387,9.606,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-277,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,76.147,103.548,"I suppose if corporate headquarters had learned that the subjective decisionmaking or the delegation of decisionmaking to the field was resulting in several discriminatory practices or a pattern of discrimination -- in other words, the decentralized process was leading to discrimination -- then I suppose the company -- that that could be attributed to the policy adopted by -- at headquarters?"
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,103.548,104.816,"No, Your Honor."
2010.10-277,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,111.053,119.993,"No, I'm talking about -- so, they've got thousands of stores, and, you know, every week they get a report from another store saying that, you know, there's an allegation of gender discrimination."
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,128.932,130.915,"--That -- I think that would be an inquiry, Your Honor."
2010.10-277,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,178.096,178.448,Did--
2010.10-277,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,178.448,189.987,The Chief Justice's question reminds me somewhat of our rule in Monell under 1983: A city is not liable for a -- a constitutional violation unless it has a policy.
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,198.843,199.878,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-277,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,221.042,228.878,"Suppose, following the Monell analogue, there's -- it's a -- there's a showing of deliberate indifference to the violation."
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,230.397,234.115,"Your Honor, I think deliberate indifference raises a different question."
2010.10-277,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,247.109,254.513,--Is there any responsibility if you -- the numbers are what has been left out so far.
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,294.673,302.594,"Your Honor, yes, there is an obligation to ensure -- for a company to do its best to ensure there are not wage gaps and discrimination."
2010.10-277,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,337.063,341.349,"Counsel, I thought their expert didn't aggregate them together."
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,396.417,402.888,"--Justice Sotomayor, first, plaintiffs' expert did a national regression and then simply estimated the regional results."
2010.10-277,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,414.129,418.349,"Well, that begs the legal question, which is -- you're right."
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,453.254,456.64,"--Your Honor, the district judge did not discount Wal-Mart's expert."
2010.10-277,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,531.789,549.067,What do you think is the difference between the standard that the district court was required to apply at the certification stage on the question whether there was a company-wide policy and the -- the standard that would be applied on the merits?
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,549.067,568.195,"At the certification stage, Justice Alito, the plaintiffs did not have to prove that there was an actual policy of discrimination and that that was the company's policy, but they at least needed to point to a policy that was common and that linked all of these disparate individuals and disparate locations and different people together."
2010.10-277,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,578.337,579.687,"I don't think that's quite fair, Mr. Boutrous."
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,605.568,609.872,"Justice Kagan, they do not argue that it was an entirely subjective process."
2010.10-277,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,637.701,650.128,I -- I guess I'm just a little -- a little bit confused as to why excessive subjectivity is not a policy that can be alleged in a Title VII pattern and practice suit or in a Title VII disparate impact suit.
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,650.128,665.888,"Your Honor, in Watson, the Court did suggest -- did state and -- and hold that subjective decisionmaking could be challenged in a disparate impact case, but Justice O'Connor's opinion went on to say there needs to be the identification of a specific practice within that policy."
2010.10-277,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,695.638,708.612,"Mr. Boutrous, there was a case, it was in the '70s, and it was a class action against AT&T for, I think, promotion into middle management."
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,777.772,802.454,"--Your Honor, this -- this is not like the total person test, but I think that is a very good example of something that could be a -- a practice inside the -- the overarching policies, and if you had a case where a particular decisionmaking unit applied the total practice test, and you had disparate results in that particular unit, that group of people could -- could -- would have a much stronger case for a class action."
2010.10-277,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,847.899,858.022,"Mr. Boutrous, I think that that suggests that the plaintiffs would have to demonstrate discrimination in every individual case, and that's never been the law."
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,877.502,878.768,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.10-277,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,944.778,957.454,What -- what happens to the damages claim of an individual woman who is part of this class if that class prevails?
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,957.454,966.06,"If the class prevails, then the -- the claim would be resolved in this manner under -- it's very unclear what the District Court had in mind."
2010.10-277,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,966.06,972.38,Would -- would she be eligible for only back pay or compensatory damages as well?
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,972.38,975.582,"Yes, Your Honor, she would only be eligible for back pay."
2010.10-277,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,977.784,978.301,I'm sorry.
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,978.968,988.14,"--their compensatory damage claims for themselves but waived those for the class members in order to get a class certified, which I think is a fundamental, crucial violation."
2010.10-277,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,988.14,988.44,All right.
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,995.746,1000.547,Our view is that she would not be because that would have been part of the core nucleus of facts in the case.
2010.10-277,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1000.547,1006.785,Even -- even though she could have not received notice and not had an opportunity to opt out?
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1006.785,1017.326,"That's the -- that's the problem -- that goes to the problem with this (b)(2) certification, that this case, if it -- if it were going to be certified at all, needed to be looked at under Rule 23(b)(3)."
2010.10-277,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1033.955,1034.338,"Counsel, would--"
2010.10-277,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1034.338,1039.524,"I thought your position was that this could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(3), either; is that correct?"
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1039.524,1051.499,"Our view is the plaintiffs will -- will not be able to satisfy those -- those provisions, but that's why they brought it under Rule 23(b)(2), to circumvent the procedural protections of superiority, predominance, and the like."
2010.10-277,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1051.499,1055.201,--Would that bar the (b)(2) class?
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1089.957,1095.611,There certainly could be a benefit from an injunction if -- if the plaintiffs met all the standards.
2010.10-277,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1103.932,1122.262,"Even if they did, why couldn't you separate out the (b)(2) issue from the (b)(3) question of whether monetary damages have enough common facts and law to warrant a certification under (b)(3)?"
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1122.262,1128.582,"--Your Honor, some courts have done that, looked at the injunctive relief claims under -- under the (b)(2) standard and the monetary reliefs under a (b)(3) standard."
2010.10-277,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1141.057,1154.215,"So, would you address the -- address them separately for me, and tell me why a (b)(2) class couldn't exist only on injunctive relief?"
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1176.147,1184.419,"Your Honor, our view is that the injunctive relief claim still has significant problems concerning cohesion, adequacy, typicality, commonality."
2010.10-277,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1226.977,1241.837,"I thought that -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that this district judge said that -- that the absent class members would get notice and have an opportunity to -- to opt out."
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1252.108,1258.512,"The district court, Justice Ginsburg, limited that ruling to the punitive damage claim, and the Ninth Circuit made clear it was viewing it that way."
2010.10-277,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1297.654,1300.523,That begs my question.
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1309.195,1310.397,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-277,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1310.397,1319.27,The Fifth Circuit has described a test where it doesn't use the predominant question; it uses the incidental test.
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1321.003,1324.055,That test is much better than the test that was applied below.
2010.10-277,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1343.515,1345.749,I -- that's where I'm going to.
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1354.99,1358.525,"Your Honor, the text of Rule 23(b)(2) is very clear."
2010.10-277,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1470.115,1475.15,What if the class does -- does not prevail; it loses?
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1480.737,1481.153,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-277,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1515.141,1519.195,"But you're not suggesting that they would be precluded on individual discrimination claims, are you?"
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1519.195,1525.016,"No, Your Honor, if they had individual claims that were separate from the nucleus of operative facts here, that might pose a different question."
2010.10-277,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1525.016,1532.586,"But what if it were the same theory, that the reason this person was able to discriminate was because he had total subjective discretion in his hiring?"
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1532.586,1536.906,"Then I -- then there would be a real problem of collateral estoppel or res judicata, Your Honor."
2010.10-277,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1539.858,1540.975,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-277,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1540.975,1541.558,Thank you.
2010.10-277,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1541.558,1551.749,Mr. Sellers.
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1551.749,1553.133,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2010.10-277,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1570.278,1572.497,What would the injunction look like in this case?
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1572.497,1589.439,--The injunction would look like a series of remedial measures that would direct Wal-Mart to provide for detailed criteria by which to make pay and promotion decisions that are job-related in a way that hasn't been true up until now.
2010.10-277,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1619.025,1619.643,All right.
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1628.047,1630.166,"No, not at all, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.10-277,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1630.166,1633.635,"So, if this were -- how many stores are we talking about, a thousand stores?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1633.635,1634.403,Several thousand stores.
2010.10-277,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1634.403,1636.403,Several thousand stores.
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1651.996,1656.448,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we have some examples in the record."
2010.10-277,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1657.566,1658.932,"No, I know there are examples."
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1660.434,1660.984,--I--
2010.10-277,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1660.984,1669.874,"Surely it won't be -- if somebody sends one letter in saying the guy at this plant -- is -- plant -- this store is discriminating, that can't be enough to support your theory."
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1669.874,1670.49,--That's correct.
2010.10-277,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1709.832,1715.503,Is it -- is it true that Wal-Mart's pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1715.503,1722.259,"Mr. Chief Justice, the position -- I don't know that that's a fair comparison."
2010.10-277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1753.861,1762.05,"It's not clear to me: What is the unlawful policy that Wal-Mart has adopted, under your theory of the case?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1762.05,1792.086,"Justice Kennedy, our theory is that Wal-Mart provided to its managers unchecked discretion in the way that this Court's Watson decision addressed that was used to pay women less than men who were doing the same work in the same -- the same facilities at the same time, even though -- though those women had more seniority and higher performance, and provided fewer opportunities for promotion than women because of sex."
2010.10-277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1792.086,1797.307,It's -- it's hard for me to see that the -- your complaint faces in two directions.
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1813.083,1821.688,"Well, Justice Kennedy, there is no inconsistency any more than it's inconsistent within Wal-Mart's own personnel procedures."
2010.10-277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1880.442,1881.81,"Well, is that disparate treatment?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1881.81,1884.079,--It is disparate treatment.
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.97,1899.506,I don't -- I'm getting whipsawed here.
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1919.669,1924.204,"--Well, Justice Scalia, there is this broad discretion given the managers."
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1924.204,1924.62,Right.
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1924.62,1927.672,But they do not make these decisions in a vacuum.
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.024,1932.424,"So, there's no discretion; is that what you're saying?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1932.424,1933.393,"--No, I'm not."
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.48,1944.95,"If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion, you don't have discretion."
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1944.95,1946.283,"--Well, all right."
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.973,1975.653,"What do you know about -- about the unchallenged fact that the central company had a policy, an announced policy, against sex discrimination, so that it wasn't totally subjective at the managerial level?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1983.74,1985.676,That was a written policy.
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.727,1991.745,"Now, how was -- how was that established?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,1991.745,2009.224,"Well, what we have, as I said before, is evidence of -- for instance, at the -- at the Sam Walton Institute, where every manager has to be trained before they become a manager, they provide as a question -- a response to a standard question: Why are women so underrepresented, or so few women in management?"
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2028.519,2032.322,And that causes them intentionally to discriminate on the basis of sex?
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2032.322,2033.922,That's -- that is--
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.922,2038.909,That causes -- how could that possibly cause them to intentionally discriminate on the basis of sex?
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2038.909,2056.937,"--Well, they -- they have -- they have an intent to take sex into account in making their decisions; that is -- that is, they apply a stereotype about that women are less aggressive when it comes to assessing their suitability for promotions."
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2056.937,2062.691,That -- that's just an assessment of why the percentage is different.
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2079.101,2079.553,Right.
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2079.553,2082.921,"If you have an aggressive woman, promote her."
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2082.921,2086.973,"I understand that, and there were -- there have been women promoted."
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2129.3,2151.898,"Have you sufficiently shown -- despite the fact of an explicit written central policy of no discrimination against women, do you think you've adequately shown that that policy is a fraud, and that what's really going on is that there is a central -- a central policy that promotes discrimination against women?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2153.065,2160.421,--We -- we have testimony in the record from the vice president of the company that that policy was lip service at the company.
2010.10-277,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2164.373,2170.36,"Isn't this something that would be -- I mean, this -- we're not just talking about getting your foot in the door."
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2190.44,2191.023,--That is--
2010.10-277,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2191.023,2192.556,--that dominates at that--
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2192.556,2194.908,--I'm sorry.
2010.10-277,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2194.908,2202.998,--But what seems to me is a very serious problem in this case is: How do you work out the back pay?
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2225.411,2273.158,"Well, the -- the approach that the District Court endorsed, an approach we recommended, and which has been endorsed by seven circuits over a period of 40 years, is in circumstances here -- like here, which are, admittedly, the exception to the rule, where the company had no standards by which to make promotion and pay decisions, they had kept no records of who -- the reasons for people being promoted and the reasons why they pay people certain amounts, that as a consequence of that, the Albemarle decision and the Teamsters decision make clear that the obligation of the District Court upon finding of liability is to attempt to reconstruct the decisions that would have been made in the absence of discrimination."
2010.10-277,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2307.815,2318.456,What if you had a situation where you had a company with a very clear policy in favor of equal treatment of men and women?
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2345.106,2356.229,"Well, I think if the -- if there were -- as clear as your hypothetical suggest, that the company had a policy of that sort, it would be appropriate for it to seek summary judgment."
2010.10-277,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2356.229,2361.283,"No, no, no, they still -- well, then you're saying it is not enough that it be a subjective decision."
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2383.398,2397.373,You could bring a class case on behalf -- if I understand your hypothetical -- on behalf of women -- I'm sorry -- who were subject to discrimination as a consequence of that unchecked discretion.

2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2416.369,2416.802,Right.
2010.10-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2416.802,2438.55,"--given the facts about what people say and how they behave, many of which central management knew, and given the results which central management knew or should have known, should central management under the law have withdrawn some of the subjective discretion in order to stop these results?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2438.55,2440.335,That -- that is a fair way to put it.
2010.10-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2440.335,2445.722,"If that is a fair way to put it, is that a question that every one of the women in this class shares in common?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2445.722,2454.495,"I -- I believe so, Justice Breyer, because they've all been the subject in every one of these stores to this very broad discretion."
2010.10-277,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2454.495,2456.312,The district judge didn't think so.
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2465.885,2470.02,"Actually, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I think the district judge did not find that."
2010.10-277,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2495.136,2530.911,"I thought -- I thought his point was not simply that some women were not underpaid, but women, if you had an individual case, the employer might show this person could have been fired, disciplined, and wasn't owed any back pay, not that she compares favorably to a -- a male peer, but that she wouldn't have gotten any pay at all."
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2530.911,2543.301,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, the kind of factors that are entered into this -- this economic model, performance in particular, should capture whether somebody should have been fired."

2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.667,2570.036,Is that commonality?

2010.10-277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2591.033,2598.12,"Well, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought the Teamsters case was an action by the government that wasn't a class action case."
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2598.12,2606.642,"That -- that is correct, but it -- it -- it is the paradigm we use for determining what you need to establish a pattern or practice of discrimination."
2010.10-277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2606.642,2608.244,"Pattern or practice, that's correct."

2010.10-277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2655.475,2659.427,"--society wide, but the company does have a policy against discrimination."
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2659.427,2659.644,Right.
2010.10-277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2692.815,2696.184,Would that be true even if you could not show deliberate indifference?
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2696.184,2701.754,"Well, I don't know that the -- the respect that the standard is deliberate indifference."
2010.10-277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2705.492,2712.562,"Suppose there's no deliberate indifference and a specific policy prohibiting the discrimination, can you still proceed?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2712.562,2714.562,"--I -- well, I would submit you still can proceed."
2010.10-277,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2731.607,2738.51,I understand your answer to Justice Kennedy's question to be that this typical company would be in violation of Title VII; is that correct?
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2738.51,2739.129,That's correct.
2010.10-277,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2739.129,2745.699,That's what the -- and that's what the academic literature on which your theory is based includes; isn't that right?

2010.10-277,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2761.893,2769.482,"So, you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American workforce, and let's say every single -- there weren't any variations."
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2776.302,2777.92,It -- that could very well be the case.
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2802.703,2814.76,"What -- what -- what -- what's -- what's your answer assumes is if there is a disparity between the advancement of women and the advancement of men, it can only be attributed to sex discrimination--"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2814.76,2815.178,No.
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2815.178,2824.818,"--Well, otherwise, how could you say that all -- all of the companies are -- are -- are presumptively engaging in sex discrimination?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2824.818,2832.322,"Well, Justice Scalia, I -- I -- I want to deal with the -- in this instance, we have -- it's not just any old analysis that we're -- that we're using."
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2840.828,2842.228,"See, I wasn't talking about this case."
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2844.03,2844.313,I'm sorry.

2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2888.892,2889.209,Yes.
2010.10-277,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2889.209,2894.213,--and when you think it is that individualized hearings are required?
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2904.001,2927.867,"Well, I think it's a -- it's a call that, of course, we leave -- we should leave to the district court in the first instance, but factors that could weigh in the balance would include whether or not you have available the kind of information that we do here from database with which to be able to more reliably construct the -- the kinds of decisions that would have been made in the absence of discrimination."
2010.10-277,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2955.184,2969.194,"I thought, didn't the district judge say because of the numbers we couldn't -- couldn't possibly have the hearing in each case on whether the particular woman was owed back pay?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2971.31,2981.599,"The district -- I'm sorry, the district court did make the comment that the sheer number of class members would make the administration of individual hearings difficult, but the district court went on, very importantly--"
2010.10-277,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2981.599,2982.999,"I thought he said ""impossible""."

2010.10-277,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2983.701,2985.518,I thought he said more than difficult.
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,2985.518,3004.197,"Well, he may have said impossible, but the important point is that he went -- the district court went ahead and made specific findings about the extent to which the -- the particular record here shows that the use of a formula would be more reliable than individualized hearings."
2010.10-277,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3004.197,3006.514,"--Counsel, I'm -- I'm a little confused, all right?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,3006.514,3006.816,Okay.
2010.10-277,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3006.816,3015.32,"Because you're saying an individualized hearing is impossible, but that's exactly what you're saying you're going to do, only through statistics."
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,3015.32,3015.922,That's--

2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,3038.335,3038.685,--Right.
2010.10-277,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3038.685,3056.38,"Because you're -- are you suggesting that the district court would appropriately bar a defendant where there's no proof of intentionality with respect to not keeping records, that it was intended to stop these women from collecting money, et cetera?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,3058.082,3058.482,Well--

2010.10-277,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3127.227,3131.529,--because otherwise it's going to be too hard to have individual hearings.

2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3154.358,3179.426,"This -- this takes evidence, to establish that -- that it's more reliable to have a hearing with evidence on the particular promotion or dismissal of the individual, that that is more reliable than using -- I don't care how admirable a statistical guess you make; I mean is that really a question?"
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,3179.426,3182.378,"I think it is, Justice Scalia, because the--"
2010.10-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3182.378,3184.478,We must have a pretty bad judicial system then.
2010.10-277,1,32775,joseph_m_sellers,,3184.478,3202.339,"--Well, I think it's not the judicial system, it's the recordkeeping of the company, and the standardlessness of its -- of the pay and promotion processes that basically mean 10 years later, these managers are going to be coming forward to speculate about what they did 10 years earlier, with no records to cross-examine them on."
