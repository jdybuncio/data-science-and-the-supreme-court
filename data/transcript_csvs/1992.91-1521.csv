1992.91-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,22.786,"We'll hear argument next in number 91-1521, United States against Lowell Green."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,53.375,56.708,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,152.871,167.992,You'd be making the same argument I suppose if the officers went back to him a day after he had invoked his right to counsel as long as it was about a different crime?
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,167.992,169.672,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,173.506,175.616,"Well, where is your line then?"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,175.616,185.112,"--Well, the first line... our basic submission this morning is that the guilty plea is a dramatic change in circumstances that justifies lifting the presumption."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,212.949,218.914,Would it make any difference if he had counsel?
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,222.416,226.509,"He had counsel, of course, in entering the guilty plea and had consulted with his attorney."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,226.509,228.38,"Yes, and then he was going to have counsel I suppose at sentencing."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,228.38,228.88,Yes.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,230.31,243.801,"Suppose the counsel had said to the government and, by the way, I don't want you talking... going back and quizzing my client about anything."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,243.801,248.172,"--Well, he didn't even have to say that, of course, with respect to the drug charge."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,261.661,262.123,Yes.
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,262.123,267.366,"And there it seems to us that the invocation is respected, as it was here."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,287.491,288.282,"Well, it's strange."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,298.096,301.078,"--Well, I don't know what his reasoning was."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,304.411,305.863,"Well, he had been in custody all this time, hadn't he?"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,305.863,307.263,--He had been in custody.
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,326.206,335.313,"You say it has been resolved, and there's a dramatic change in circumstances, but a moment ago you said the Government still could not question him after the guilty plea."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,335.313,340.635,--On... and use that material in enhancing his sentence on the drug charge.
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,340.635,343.197,Because he is still represented by counsel on the drug charge.
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,343.197,346.449,"On the drug charge, and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches."
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,353.335,358.937,"But what is the dramatic change other than the fact that if you win this case, there will be a dramatic change?"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,361.769,363.309,The investigative process--
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,363.309,367.162,"In terms of rights to talk to people and rights to have access to counsel, what's the difference?"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,367.162,374.699,"--The difference is that the investigative process on the drug charge, which is of course what Miranda was centrally concerned about, is over."
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,374.699,376.589,"No, it isn't because he hadn't been sentenced yet."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,376.589,380.68,"The police are unlikely to continue an investigation on sentencing, and if they do, his attorney--"
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,380.68,386.754,"No, but aren't matters relevant to the drug charge, even though he has pleaded guilty, still relevant to the sentencing decision that is yet to be made?"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,386.754,387.946,--And if he is questioned--
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,387.946,389.658,And isn't that why they can't talk to him?
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,392.0,395.152,--As to the drug charge and sentencing on the drug charge.
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,396.962,398.452,I still don't see what's so dramatically different.
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,399.454,404.566,"--What's dramatically different is that when he invoked his right to counsel, he was a suspect on a drug charge."
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,409.571,409.962,--Right.
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,409.962,417.546,It is reasonable to assume that that dramatic change in circumstances might alter his judgment about whether to talk to the police without a lawyer.
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,417.546,420.959,It seems to me that argument would justify questioning about the drug charge as well.
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,420.959,423.92,"No, it would not because the Sixth Amendment protects him there."
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,432.556,447.645,"Well, presumably, if he were allowed to be questioned about the murder charge and confessed it, couldn't that be used at the sentencing then on the drug charge to augment his sentence in some way?"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,447.645,451.258,"I think not, because again, his lawyer wasn't present at that proceeding."
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,459.283,482.238,"I mean, I'm wondering whether the cutoff time might not be the sentencing on the drug charge rather than the entry of the plea, because it isn't clear to me how the information you would learn on questioning him after the plea and before sentencing wouldn't somehow be used at the sentencing on the drug charge."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,482.238,487.022,"Well, it's not how guilty pleas have been treated elsewhere, for example, in the Federal Rules of Evidence."
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,503.432,511.937,Do you agree that there should be some bright line test for any cutoff of the duration of the Edwards rule?
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,511.937,517.311,"No, Your Honor, I don't think that the brightness of the line is absolutely paramount to all other factors."
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,518.631,523.936,You'd have us apply a totality of the circumstances test?
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,523.936,525.556,--I don't think it goes that far.
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,579.151,581.194,And so would sentencing be.
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,581.194,583.215,--Sentencing would be another bright line.
1992.91-1521,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,594.902,606.84,"Well, but after a guilty plea and before sentencing, the defendant may feel very real pressure to cooperate with the police in order to obtain lenient treatment on his sentencing."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,606.84,608.039,And if he's--
1992.91-1521,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,608.039,615.686,"And it seems to me that's... if we're going to draw this line, sentencing is a much more sensible place to draw it if this is how we're going to do it."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,615.686,622.33,"--Well, I don't think so, Your Honor, because sentencing isn't directed to the concern of Miranda, which is investigation."
1992.91-1521,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,629.243,630.945,"Well, it's a question of coercive pressures."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,635.477,639.621,"Well, Miranda applies to coercive pressures in custodial interrogation."
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,674.473,676.855,"May I just be sure I understand your position, Mr. Roberts?"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,691.234,696.587,"It's... that is what the probation officer does, not the prosecutor's office."
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.587,696.888,"That's what your rule would allow, isn't it?"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,698.891,700.751,"Well, it would because--"
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.751,702.022,"Of course, you have to give Miranda warnings--"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,702.022,709.115,"--Assuming there's no Sixth Amendment right in the probation process... and that's an issue on which the courts have split, yes."
1992.91-1521,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,768.014,769.867,--Did the Government take a position in Roberson?
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,769.867,771.737,"--Yes, Your Honor, we did."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.018,849.539,I would think your argument so far would cover going back to the defendant asking him about another crime.
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,867.601,870.403,"Yes, they certainly could do that."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,878.408,881.48,What if he's in jail?
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,881.48,885.043,"--If he's in jail, we think with a sufficient passage of time, yes, they can."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,886.124,888.806,Even though he hasn't been tried on the drug charge.
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,888.806,889.246,--Yes.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,891.538,905.726,"So, your argument would... there has been a sufficient passage of time to justify going back to him contrary to Edwards or that Edwards just wears out after 2 or 3 months?"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,905.726,913.453,"--We think that if the presumption is no longer justified by its purpose, then there's no basis for the imposition of the prophylactic rule that this Court has imposed."
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,944.332,947.053,"Well, it isn't clear to me what you would say."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,956.509,958.27,"Yes, it is, and--"
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,958.27,959.171,2 months?
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,959.171,960.463,--2 months is enough and--
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,960.463,961.252,1 month?
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,961.252,962.313,--1 month is enough.
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,962.313,963.946,2 days?
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,963.946,966.147,2 days is probably not enough.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,969.309,971.84,"It isn't even a line, is it?"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,971.84,977.424,"Well, it is a line that looks... first of all, as I'll reiterate, our principal submission is the finding of guilt."
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,983.638,985.568,"Well, it's one concern certainly."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,985.568,992.814,"--Well, then the guilty plea, the finding of guilt, is of course a very sharp and bright line, and that is our principal submission."
1992.91-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1030.939,1037.124,"Mr. Roberts, can I ask about a provision that I didn't even know about?"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1052.203,1055.486,"Well, I don't know why it has never been cited."
1992.91-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1060.318,1076.667,"It says that voluntary confessions shall be admissible and that voluntariness shall be decided on the basis of the totality of circumstances and that no single item, such as whether the defendant was advised or knew that he was required to make a statement, shall alone be determinative."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1076.667,1077.118,Yes.
1992.91-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1077.489,1080.421,"It's certainly very relevant to this case, very relevant to a lot of other cases."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1081.522,1086.685,"--Well, we didn't rely on it below in this case, and so we're not in a position to rely upon it here."
1992.91-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.685,1090.769,Is this sort of executive nullification of a congressional statute?
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1090.769,1095.551,I can't explain why it hasn't been repeatedly cited other than perhaps some concern--
1992.91-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1095.551,1097.001,Repeatedly or ever cited?
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1097.001,1099.024,"--Well, I'm not aware that it ever has been."
1992.91-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1105.319,1109.049,Does the Government not rely on that statute in any lower court?
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1109.049,1116.114,--I'm not aware that we have taken the position that the statute does overrule the need for the Miranda warnings.
1992.91-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1116.114,1122.129,"Well, but don't... does the Government not feel any duty to call the statute to the attention of lower courts?"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1124.56,1128.013,I'm not aware that we have relied on it at any point.
1992.91-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1128.013,1132.306,"Well, do you feel no obligation to call the statute to the attention of this Court?"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1132.306,1144.773,"Well, I think in this case I'm not sure... and in cases like this where we're arguing that the confession should be admitted, it's because we believe it's consistent with Miranda and the other cases as we believe this one is."
1992.91-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1154.929,1161.915,"Well, ordinarily we prefer to decide a case on a statutory basis rather than a constitutional basis."
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1161.915,1164.935,"Well, yes, and of course, it's open to the Court to decide it on that basis."
1992.91-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1373.513,1375.546,"Very well, Mr. Roberts."
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1379.048,1381.2,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1455.548,1458.41,"Well, do you think Edwards has no time limits at all?"
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1458.41,1459.932,That's correct.
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1459.932,1460.982,None.
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1460.982,1462.183,"No, and--"
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1462.183,1484.449,"So, if the defendant is sentenced, let's say, to a life sentence in connection with the drug charge, at no time then would the Government ever be able to go back and ask him if he had waived... give him his Miranda rights and talk to him about the murder."
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1484.449,1487.552,"--That's correct, and if I may explain."
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1524.835,1533.12,"Well, I would have thought that the Edwards rule might expire at some point, certainly after he is sentenced under the drug charge."
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1533.12,1545.639,"Well, he... at the point where he's arrested, he says, I do not feel that I am capable of talking to the police without an attorney present."
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1549.67,1552.632,What if--
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1576.707,1589.306,"Certainly there... the risk of badgering decreases over time, and certainly after sentencing, the person is in a much stronger psychological position to deal with the authorities."
1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1649.096,1663.555,"Do you know the answer to Justice Scalia's question about why the statute, 18 U.S. Code 3501, does not bear on this question?"

1992.91-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1696.09,1705.674,But that statute says something to the effect of the presence or absence of the various factors is not conclusive.
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1705.674,1720.613,They still rely on the opinions given by this Court in the Miranda and the Edwards line of cases and not on section 3501 of the criminal code.
1992.91-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1752.754,1756.828,"You say there's nothing to be gained by a reversal here, Mr. Conte."
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1764.893,1773.701,"--When I said nothing to be gained, I was speaking in terms of the bright line rule that this Court has established in Edwards and Roberson."
1992.91-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1793.672,1809.892,"Well, but you've certainly got a good deal of assurance with, first, the Miranda prophylactic rule and then the Edwards prophylactic rule that any coercive pressure that might... even if it had existed at one time, would have been attenuated by then."
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1809.892,1824.582,"Well, if we're talking... in this... in Mr. Green's case, in this case, we're talking about eliminating or carving an exception out of the bright line rule."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.309,1842.704,"Well, would you say... what if we agree with the Government?"
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1852.301,1862.357,"If you apply it after the guilty plea, you still have a bright line, but one of the purposes of the bright line is to ensure that these things are not the result of coercive pressure."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1866.811,1868.291,What about after sentencing?
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1868.291,1870.284,"--After sentencing, I think you would have that assurance."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1875.024,1878.537,"So, you don't... you say Edwards wouldn't last forever, but after sentencing?"
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1878.537,1890.886,"I still think it should last forever, but after sentencing would certainly be a better break if this Court was going to end it than it would be after a plea and before sentencing."
1992.91-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.886,1895.338,"Nothing lasts forever, Mr. Conte."
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1895.639,1896.66,"That's true, Your Honor."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1896.66,1906.627,"In your experience, what is the usual time between a conviction and sentencing or a plea of guilty and sentencing?"
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1906.627,1911.021,"In the District of Columbia Superior Court, it's 6 weeks to prepare a presentence report."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.489,1925.591,"That's just because of the load, I suppose."
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1925.591,1930.172,And the... and certainly the load in Superior Court.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.096,1942.051,"In preparing a presentence report, is it characteristic to talk to the defendant?"
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1942.051,1942.992,--Yes.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.992,1945.593,With his lawyer?
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1945.593,1949.397,It can be done with his lawyer.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.138,1954.118,"Well, if the defendant requests--"
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1954.118,1957.752,"If the defendant requests, it can be done in the District of Columbia."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1962.223,1967.576,--What goes into the presentence report if the defendant refuses to talk to the probation officer?
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1967.576,1972.501,"They still put his background in, whatever they can gain from his family from the--"
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1972.501,1976.433,But there... but all they say is he refused to talk?
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,1976.433,1990.783,"--Yes, and some reports... the person will talk about his background, but not about the offense itself, in which case his background is there, but the offense conduct is missing."
1992.91-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1990.783,2000.588,"That... I suppose if he refuses to talk about the offense itself, that would prevent him from getting any points for accepting responsibility under the guidelines."
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2000.588,2013.007,"Well, the guidelines changed as of November 1 of this year so that a plea of guilty automatically entitles him to two points off and possibly three if he does it at an early time."
1992.91-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2013.007,2014.188,Because he admits his--
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2014.188,2015.811,Just because he stands up in court and says I'm guilty.
1992.91-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2022.034,2026.606,--Can he get any more points off if he talks about it as well as pleads guilty?
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2026.606,2039.295,The only way he can get any further points off is for him to cooperate with the United States and receive a letter under section 5k.1 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.
1992.91-1521,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2041.185,2044.768,And would that cooperation extend to other offenses and other investigations?
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2044.768,2049.721,--Almost exclusively they're not interested in somebody who has already pled guilty.
1992.91-1521,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2057.297,2068.385,"Well, I take it that if the defendant cooperated as to other investigations with reference to other crimes, including those that he might have committed, that would be grounds for these additional points and for the letter?"
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2068.385,2070.856,--For the letter.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.699,2088.397,Where is the interview... where does the interview normally take place with the probation officer in... for the purpose of preparing the presentence report?
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2088.397,2092.581,"--In the District of Columbia, they take place at the District of Columbia jail."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.911,2104.158,"So, why doesn't Edwards apply at that juncture?"
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2104.158,2106.79,--Edwards does apply.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.79,2112.704,"Well, you mean it's violating his rights for the probation officer to go to the jail and approach him?"
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2112.704,2115.278,"Well, the probation officer isn't law enforcement."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.278,2116.436,Isn't what?
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2116.436,2118.877,I wouldn't consider the probation officer--
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2118.877,2119.188,He's part of the government.
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2119.989,2120.249,--He's part of the government.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.249,2121.879,--He's a law enforcement officer.
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2121.879,2124.223,He's part of the court system.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.223,2124.992,Well--
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2124.992,2130.686,And he's only talking in the context of the one offense when he talks to the probation officer.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.686,2137.731,"--Well, he talks... he approaches him and talks to him."

1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2141.074,2155.983,"So, he talks to them and he... the defendant says a lot of things that is going to harm him at sentencing."
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2155.983,2158.735,He can.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2161.026,2163.137,"So, why doesn't Edwards apply at that juncture?"
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2163.137,2168.931,He has the right not to answer the questions of the probation officer--
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2168.931,2170.423,"I know, but he isn't told that he does."
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2170.423,2171.114,--Pardon me?
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.114,2173.017,He isn't told that he does.
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2173.017,2180.521,"His attorney... at that time, he should have a Sixth... he has an attorney at that time who could tell him to cooperate or not to cooperate."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.394,2215.145,"Well, it's just a different context I suppose that you don't say... you don't tell the probation officer, now, remember, don't go near him unless he asks you to come."
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2217.035,2218.076,No.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.076,2219.227,--to the probation officer.
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2219.898,2222.318,It's--
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.318,2223.209,It's just different.
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2223.209,2224.011,--Yes.
1992.91-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.181,2385.337,"And yet, at this most vulnerable time, when the probation officer comes to him, you say that the practice is not to give any renewed Miranda warning."
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2385.337,2387.558,--That's correct.
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2402.899,2412.055,"Mr. Conte, is it the practice in the probation interview to give the defendant's lawyer notice of when the interview is going to take place so the lawyer can be present if he wants to?"
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2412.055,2413.037,Not in my experience.
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2413.037,2414.176,It's not.
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2414.176,2429.686,"There are judges I am aware of who require the lawyers to be present during the interview, and that's all occurred since they passed the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, and those would be district court cases, Federal court cases."
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2429.686,2433.429,Is it characteristic of lawyers to try to find out when the interview is going to take place?
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2433.429,2433.92,Yes.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2436.382,2441.234,And the... I don't suppose the probation officer... who do they ask?
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2442.185,2443.735,Yes.
1992.91-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.735,2447.738,"And he rarely says it's none of your business, I suppose."
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2447.738,2448.719,No.
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2452.28,2452.621,Yes.
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2458.695,2459.407,They just walk in.
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.407,2460.738,They just walk in.
1992.91-1521,0,29726,joseph_r_conte,,2460.738,2466.933,If there's no further questions.
1992.91-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.933,2468.723,"Thank you, Mr. Conte."

1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2571.873,2583.42,"Are there cases in the lower courts, Mr. Roberts, involving admissions of statements made to the probation officers that inculpate the defendant in other crimes?"
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2583.42,2585.431,I'm not aware of those.
1992.91-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2596.718,2603.624,Is counsel correct that the probation officer does not routinely give Miranda warnings when other crimes are to be discussed?
1992.91-1521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2603.624,2614.041,"That's my understanding, yes, that a probation officer does not give Miranda warnings and, we submit, is not required to because that's not custodial interrogation."
