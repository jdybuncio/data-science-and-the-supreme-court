2014.13-1034,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.17,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 131034, Mellouli v. Holder."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,7.204,10.289,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1034,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,82.654,83.204,Can I--
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,83.204,86.406,Can we begin by looking at the text of the statute?
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,92.143,109.771,Relating to serves the function of connecting the very broad range of offenses that Congress wants to make deportable to the list of substances that -- that the -- that Congress has specified.
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,109.771,114.156,"Well, let's say we were let's say we're back in high school and we have to diagram this sentence."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,114.156,114.723,Yes.
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,114.723,118.627,"We could start out that way, and maybe we'll get beyond it, but let's start out that way."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,126.647,134.237,“ Relating to ” would modify -- would modify “ law ” or “ regulation ”.
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,138.372,140.306,"If it modifies “ law ”, then I think you've lost the case."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,140.306,145.277,"--But if -- if you diagram the sentence, though, everything in that whole phrase,"
2014.13-1034,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,169.91,173.362,--If you -- if you -- I think Justice Alito is right.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,181.8,192.173,"Well, again, given the text and the context of this statute and the history of its application over decades and decades, there's--"
2014.13-1034,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,192.173,193.941,That's an argument that they're arbitrary and capricious.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,193.941,213.339,"--Well, it -- it's also part of the analysis that goes into determining the Chevron, the question that you allude to, Justice Sotomayor, because Chevron should be approached after applying the usual principles of statutory interpretation, and that's -- that's what Chevron says."
2014.13-1034,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,213.339,215.505,"Wait, wait."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,220.557,221.575,Well--
2014.13-1034,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,221.575,229.946,"I mean, I -- I assume that -- I assumed as you said -- what -- what are you fighting here?"
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,233.633,233.799,"Well, that was my question."
2014.13-1034,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,233.799,241.053,--relating a controlled substance as defined in Section 102 concern any law or regulation.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,242.738,243.371,--And that's only--
2014.13-1034,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,243.371,244.021,--You deny that?
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,244.021,246.887,--Well -- and -- but that's only part of the analysis.
2014.13-1034,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,246.887,247.903,I understand that it's not.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,265.949,266.865,Yes.
2014.13-1034,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,271.683,271.849,All right.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,285.94,287.025,Yes.
2014.13-1034,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,287.025,294.278,And both of these statutes contain the 36 that are in Section 802.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,302.284,311.071,This goes to the application of the categorical approach and the modified categorical approach.
2014.13-1034,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,341.256,341.956,Okay.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,360.252,360.735,Yes.
2014.13-1034,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,360.735,362.052,"If it doesn't, we don't know."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,363.537,364.437,Yes.
2014.13-1034,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,365.703,366.253,Okay.
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,366.253,373.773,"Well, that -- that might be sensible, but I -- I really do need to start with the text of the statute and understand what you make of the text of the statute."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,398.055,405.978,The Kansas statute in this instance relates to Federally controlled substance sometimes.
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,408.93,411.715,But the law -- the law relates to what it relates to.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,436.827,461.295,"--When it's in the context that it's in, in -- in this sentence, again, with the focus on convicted, a -- a law that -- or I'm sorry, a word that Congress has put -- has used in our immigration statutes for decades with this particular meaning, convicted is the statutory hook, as the Court said in Moncrieffe, for the categorical approach."
2014.13-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,461.729,467.449,Suppose -- suppose the State's list was identical to the Federal list.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,472.503,472.753,--Yes.
2014.13-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,472.753,475.954,So Kansas has an identical list.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,475.954,479.173,"If it's identical or narrower, the person is deportable."
2014.13-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,480.84,484.394,"And if it has one that's different, not deportable?"
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,484.394,485.81,--No.
2014.13-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,498.235,500.337,"Well, we don't know what substance -- in this case, we don't."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,500.337,500.937,--If you don't--
2014.13-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,500.937,501.856,It's not charged.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,502.756,504.372,--That's--
2014.13-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,504.372,506.841,So it's not -- it's the difference that--
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,506.841,507.458,--It's not in the record of conviction.
2014.13-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,507.458,521.299,"--It it doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to say deportable if the lists are identical, but if Kansas has one more on the list not deportable."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,521.299,533.356,"This Court has -- well, this Court has -- has applied the categorical approach in just that way, as have many of the courts of appeals."
2014.13-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.705,562.526,"I mean, that's lovely, but it doesn't get you around the question that Justice Alito asked, what is the law?"
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,565.578,567.347,"Certainly, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.347,584.807,"Perhaps the law -- if you ask somebody what law did Mellouli violate here, it would be perfectly natural to respond by reciting one -- the elements of the law that he violated."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,622.582,623.767,Yes.
2014.13-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,624.367,625.65,Is that a good suggestion?
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,627.302,628.086,"--Yes, your Honor."
2014.13-1034,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,636.341,636.874,Mr. Laramore--
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,636.874,637.591,That's the framework.
2014.13-1034,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,637.591,650.499,"--that one way of looking at it, but might I suggest that you gave in a little bit too fast to Justice Alito that the phrase “ relating to a controlled substance ” has to modify “ law ”."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,657.336,657.769,Yes.
2014.13-1034,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,657.769,658.754,--which this case is “ law ”.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,697.896,698.246,Violation.
2014.13-1034,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,698.246,699.997,--other than a marijuana offense.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,715.524,716.124,Yes.
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,729.101,732.986,It certainly is possible for “ relating to ” to modify “ violation ”.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,750.177,752.429,I think that's right.
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,752.429,752.879,Is that right?
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,752.879,753.681,I believe so.
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,753.681,767.521,"So what then happens if the alien's conduct relates to a Federally controlled substance, but the conviction is under a law that does not relate to a Federally controlled substance?"
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,776.794,778.146,It--
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,778.146,783.033,"The law doesn't relate to a controlled substance, but the conduct does relate to a controlled substance."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,783.033,784.266,--Right.
2014.13-1034,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,789.084,789.334,Yes.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,795.085,809.678,"I certainly didn't mean to say conduct if I did, and I know that conviction is the key concept here and it always has been the key concept as we've applied this set of laws to -- to our immigration, to noncitizens."
2014.13-1034,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,809.678,822.419,"A few moments ago, I understood you to concede when Justice Ginsburg asked the question that if there is an exact parallel between the State law and the Federal law, your client would be deportable."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,822.419,823.004,Yes.
2014.13-1034,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,823.004,830.191,So the fact that there's a -- it's a drug paraphernalia conviction has nothing to do with the -- the issue before us?
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,830.191,846.953,"Well, the -- the -- the drug paraphernalia statute under which he's convicted requires that the conduct be associated with a controlled -- a Kansas controlled substance."
2014.13-1034,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,855.14,859.527,"So, so long as the drug offense is related to, then the paraphernalia offense is related to?"
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,863.496,877.489,"I -- I think I understand your question, and I think that the answer to your question is yes, because the paraphernalia statute specifically incorporates the controlled substance schedule from Kansas."
2014.13-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,877.489,892.916,"So you don't get any help by what seems to be the case, that this sock would not count as drug paraphernalia if we were -- if we were dealing with a Federal prosecution."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,892.916,896.719,You are absolutely right that it would not.
2014.13-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,905.489,907.508,But the question I wanted to ask--
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,907.508,908.008,But that--
2014.13-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,908.008,914.678,--is a sock considered drug paraphernalia under Federal law?
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,914.678,931.706,"--It would not, be because the Federal statute says that -- I don't have the language in my head, but the concept is that to be paraphernalia it -- its usual purpose has to be to facilitate drug sales or drug use or one of those things that paraphernalia does."
2014.13-1034,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,947.816,954.487,"Well, that's why I would have thought your answers to me would have been different because you would want to say that the paraphernalia is an additional hurdle."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,961.993,963.909,That's correct.
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,980.869,994.011,"What if the -- what if someone was convicted of possession of a pipe that is very well designed to smoke crack, but maybe conceivably could be used to smoke a little bit of tobacco."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1000.598,1003.716,--The question is what the person is convicted of and--
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1003.716,1006.585,He's convicted of possessing a crack pipe.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1006.585,1009.152,--If he is convicted of possessing--
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1009.152,1012.237,It's necessary to show that -- that there was crack in the pipe?
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1012.237,1015.858,--Not under the Kansas statute.
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1022.194,1032.733,"Well, in your view, in order to make -- in order to make this count as a -- as a deportable offense, it would be necessary to show that there actually was crack in the pipe or that he actually used the pipe to smoke crack."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1032.733,1034.602,--Not the way we read the statute.
2014.13-1034,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1044.96,1049.512,It has to involve a controlled -- a Federally controlled substance.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1049.512,1052.38,"It has to involve a Federally controlled, Section 802 controlled substance, yes."
2014.13-1034,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1052.38,1053.58,That -- that's the linchpin.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1053.58,1054.566,Yes.
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1054.566,1056.566,"Well, crack is a Federally controlled substance."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1056.566,1057.351,Yes.
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1057.351,1059.803,So I didn't understand the answer to your question.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1065.873,1077.431,"The crack pipe itself would be enough, as long as there was proof or a pleading to its use with, at some point, or its intention to be used with crack."
2014.13-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.481,1080.549,"Well, well, well, wait."
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1096.309,1097.225,--That is correct.
2014.13-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1097.225,1099.777,"--that alone would not support the conviction, would it?"
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1099.777,1100.694,That is--
2014.13-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1100.694,1103.979,You -- you'd have to go to look to see what he was actually convicted of.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1103.979,1104.312,--Right.
2014.13-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1325.536,1327.636,Nobody's disagreeing with the categorical approach.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1332.637,1333.723,"--Well, let me--"
2014.13-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.723,1336.089,The question is categorical to what?
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1338.294,1358.957,"--Well -- and just to differentiate our -- what we're saying from the government's position, which they also argue, is a species of the categorical approach, we're talking about the categorical approach as it has traditionally been applied, where the elements of -- of the conviction have to be compared to the generic Federal statute or to the statute of--"
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1358.957,1364.442,"When you say “ categorical approach ”, you mean the modified categorical approach, do you not?"
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1364.442,1365.611,--Well--
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1365.611,1383.923,"In -- in a jurisdiction like Kansas or in any foreign jurisdiction that has a list of controlled substances that is a little bit broader than the Federal list, lists at least one or two that are broader than the Federal list, the pure categorical approach would never result in -- in removal; am I right?"
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1383.923,1384.606,--No--
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1384.606,1385.239,In a removable offense.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1385.239,1385.941,--That's not correct.
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1385.941,1386.758,How would it?
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1397.63,1399.149,But--
2014.13-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1399.149,1402.601,So you would have to look beyond that to see which particular drug.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1404.384,1409.952,"--Many States, including Kansas, have some statutes that don't invoke their entire schedule."
2014.13-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.625,1419.31,--That's not his hypothetical.
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1425.297,1426.23,I misunderstood.
2014.13-1034,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1504.246,1528.796,"Counsel, if we -- just to move you along, if we -- do you agree with the government that if we find the government's distinction between drug trade offenses like the paraphernalia statute and drug possession and distribution offenses unreasonable, do we remand to the board?"
2014.13-1034,0,31384,jon_laramore,,1533.081,1547.258,"--Well, I think that the -- the BIA has had its chance to state its position and it has carved out -- this drug trade exception is really a drug paraphernalia exception."
2014.13-1034,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1568.087,1568.904,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1578.544,1580.927,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1605.112,1612.182,What -- what if the State law covers controlled substances entirely different from the Federal law?
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1620.204,1621.904,We would say it does not relate to
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1627.206,1630.174,"I'm sorry, I don't understand that."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1641.397,1653.305,"It -- we would concede, along the lines of Justice Breyer's hypothetical, that if you have a State law that controls 6,000 State-controlled substances and one federally controlled--"
2014.13-1034,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1653.305,1654.105,How about half and half?
2014.13-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1654.105,1655.621,"Wait, what was the answer?"
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1657.839,1666.278,--That -- that law has the kind of tenuous relationship to federally controlled drugs that the Court has said is not a relating to -- relation--
2014.13-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1666.278,1668.797,It doesn't say more than tenuously related to.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1672.182,1674.982,--I'm taking it from this Court's cases.
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1682.488,1695.711,"Well, that's how you get to drug paraphernalia, meaning, as Justice Kagan said, the drug paraphernalia comes in only because it relates to drug possession and distribution--"
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1695.711,1697.08,--That's right.
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1697.08,1699.082,--of a controlled substance under 801.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1699.082,1699.865,We think that--
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1699.865,1701.482,"Or 802, what is it -- whatever it is."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1701.482,1702.384,--That's right.
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1708.538,1710.904,You keep leaving out the 802.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1722.596,1731.567,"--We think that, as Your Honor correctly notes, these are laws that relate to controlled substances as defined in Section 802."
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1749.296,1752.148,And -- difficult -- now answer.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1752.148,1752.667,--Yes.
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1752.667,1758.052,How many of the laws -- how many of the controlled substances have to be on the State list?
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1763.189,1765.055,We think that--
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1765.055,1768.757,"--I mean, what -- what's the -- how many have to be on the list?"
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1768.757,1775.261,--We think that all the State laws that currently exist are laws that relate to federally controlled substances.
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1776.027,1779.312,But that's not true of foreign laws and this relates to foreign laws.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1790.87,1808.848,"--Your Honor, we acknowledge there might be a case involving a foreign law or involving if in the future a State decided to take a very different approach, where you would have a literal relating to relationship, but there would be a question of whether the law was so far beyond what existed at the time and what Congress could have imagined that it no longer relates to."
2014.13-1034,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1812.466,1814.249,But what second -- second--
2014.13-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.249,1825.874,"Do you, please do you think that if we apply a modified categorical approach and focus in on the conviction here which was for a sock?"
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1832.878,1835.412,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.501,1843.901,Right.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1854.957,1858.159,"We do, because he wasn't exactly convicted of having a sock."
2014.13-1034,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1879.407,1881.374,"--What about, you said second?"
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1879.407,1886.144,Yes.
2014.13-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.144,1887.211,"You said the second, didn't you?"
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1887.211,1889.113,"There is an additional reason, Your Honor."
2014.13-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.113,1891.129,She said it.
2014.13-1034,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1891.129,1891.646,She didn't.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1891.646,1904.289,"The BIA has reasoned -- the BIA has reasoned, in a conclusion that entitled to Chevron deference, that paraphernalia statutes are statutes that attack the drug trade in general."
2014.13-1034,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1975.066,1904.289,Okay.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2029.548,2031.433,Let me give two responses.
2014.13-1034,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2098.308,2107.081,"But if I understand the way the law works, right, Ms. Kovner, that's -- that is true of paraphernalia drugs, that they're indivisible with respect to the controlled substance."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2148.408,2150.86,"--Your Honor, I think two points about that."
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2172.121,2181.327,"Well, right now even your brief admits that the BIA is applying a different standard to possession and distribution offenses."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2185.598,2186.7,Your--
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2186.7,2188.883,And it's trying to draw a difference.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2199.755,2201.607,"--Your Honor, I'm not sure that that's true."
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2205.642,2208.177,"Yeah, what you're hoping for is that they will change that one, too."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2211.979,2212.363,--Yes.
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2220.283,2221.302,Because they have discretion.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2239.097,2240.414,"--I don't think that's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2257.04,2267.397,"A couple of sentences ago you said that a sock, when it's used in connection with the drug activity, is sufficiently related to the Federal Controlled Substances Law."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2280.722,2298.101,"Your Honor, I think this would be a -- a difficult question on either of our sides, which is to say, for -- for both parties there would be some set of statutes that are related to -- that have some connection to drugs indirectly and there would be a question of whether those statutes count."
2014.13-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2305.856,2306.122,"Well, yes."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2308.472,2311.674,"--Well, here, Your Honor, it's not a statute addressing socks."
2014.13-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2312.424,2314.876,It was addressing socks when used in connection with drug activity.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2317.192,2317.778,--Oh.
2014.13-1034,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2338.691,2347.963,"Under your definition -- under your understanding of this, what practical work is done by the phrase as defined in Section 802 of Title XXI?"
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2347.963,2348.797,Your Honor--
2014.13-1034,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2348.797,2366.173,"You said a couple of minutes ago, and I had assumed this to be true, that under the laws of all the States, the great majority of controlled substances are on the Federal list, and there -- in some instances -- are a few additional ones and you said that all of those laws would be covered."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2377.145,2389.371,"--Your Honor, we think that this parenthetical clarifies that -- the meaning of controlled substance, the thing that it has to relate to are the substances as defined in Federal law."
2014.13-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2401.262,2401.995,Would it have to be drugs?
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2411.318,2422.54,"That would not be a statute under the law of a State relating to a controlled substance as defined in Section 802, because it wouldn't be regulated under a State's direct statutes that also include the Section 802 substances."
2014.13-1034,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2472.723,2476.943,"Well, that's -- it wouldn't make that law a nullity."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2537.981,2540.517,"--But Congress didn't want that result, Justice Breyer."
2014.13-1034,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2541.183,2558.309,"Well, I want a lot of people but they can't control the State charging practices and the States are likely, for reasons of information, to put in the charge the whole thing, including the correct reference on the schedule."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2576.27,2577.037,--That--
2014.13-1034,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2577.037,2577.453,Any other?
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2577.453,2587.058,"--Your Honor, that's a significant practical problem that's going to introduce widespread variation in the deportability of people who have committed crimes involving Federally controlled substances."
2014.13-1034,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2587.058,2595.598,"But -- but as Ms. -- as Justice Sotomayor suggested, it's a significant practical problem that's implicated in the current practice of the BIA."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2595.598,2598.131,I -- I'm -- I don't think that's correct.
2014.13-1034,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2603.702,2607.154,It at least might be implicated in the current practice of the BIA.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2607.154,2611.291,--We think that the BIA's precedent on this point is unclear.
2014.13-1034,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2623.596,2624.681,You have to choose.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2662.403,2663.103,--I agree.
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2678.546,2680.998,It's -- it's exactly like it.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2702.161,2702.944,--Your Honor 10--
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2702.944,2705.477,So it knows how to differentiate the two.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2705.477,2719.22,"--The textual contrast that we find most revealing here is that there are provisions of the INA that talk about being removable for a crime related to controlled substances, and then you would do the categorical approach just as you're proposing."
2014.13-1034,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2744.519,2754.225,"But, Ms. Kovner, I would think that the history works against you in the following way: Because the prior statute here was a statute that listed all these Federally controlled substances."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2794.885,2797.904,"--Your Honor, I don't think that's correct."
2014.13-1034,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2818.316,2818.566,No.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2851.803,2858.207,"--Your Honor, the -- the “ relating to ” language, which is very broad language, is within the prior statute, and it's within the statute now."
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2887.141,2891.093,Espinoza came out when?
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2891.093,2907.136,"--The case I'm thinking of is Martinez-Gomez from 1972, which talks about opening a drug essentially, opening a drug den, and they say that's a crime that doesn't necessarily relate just to any individual substance; it bears a relationship to all substances."
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2910.504,2912.356,"That was a Federal crime, though."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2918.526,2929.901,"--Your Honor, the reasoning of Martinez-Gomez and then the reasoning of Martinez Espinoza is that these are crimes that don't necessarily have to bear a relationship to a single substance."
2014.13-1034,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2946.427,2947.012,But a -- a sock.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2999.811,3008.667,"--Your Honor, I agree that I think a strange feature of this case is that it involves an item that's not usually thought of as drug paraphernalia."
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3030.182,3033.968,I don't think that's the important point that Justice Ginsburg's making.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3054.048,3056.048,--For possessing the sock.
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3057.433,3062.47,With the -- with that particular unscheduled item.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3062.47,3083.984,"--And I think it's easiest to see why the BIA drew this conclusion when you talk about the more classical tools of paraphernalia, which is, if somebody possesses scales and distribution baggies and cut in connection with a State-controlled substance -- say it's synthetic marijuana, an item that's not Federally controlled at the time -- those are tools that could be used in connection with a Federal drug as well."
2014.13-1034,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3093.09,3103.879,"Do we -- do we even know that this is a -- a proper conviction under Kansas law, that the Kansas statute actually means what it's been interpreted here to mean?"
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3159.113,3159.647,That's right.
2014.13-1034,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3189.181,3193.55,"If he had cocaine in his sock, he would probably be convicted of possession of cocaine."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3193.55,3194.05,--But--
2014.13-1034,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3194.05,3205.272,"He was convicted of paraphernalia here because he had four pills of Adderall, which if you go to half the colleges in America, people you know, and just randomly pick somebody, there would be a decent chance--"
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3206.358,3211.845,--I think -- I think Justice Alito's explanation of this case explains why that's not so.
2014.13-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3230.239,3232.072,"Well, I would have thought the opposite inference."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3241.678,3245.063,"Your Honor, we don't think that Congress viewed drug crimes that way."
2014.13-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3261.455,3277.617,"Well, but, I mean, the only -- it's because you give “ relating to ” such a broad construction that you get the -- what I think is the unusual situation that I talked about, which is that the State thinks it's a very minor offense and yet it can become so significant that the person's deported."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3277.617,3283.355,--But Petitioner's approach is a poor way of reading a crime severity distinction into the statute.
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3288.159,3289.159,Why is it a poor way?
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3316.992,3325.782,"--Your Honor, it's a bad way because serious drug crimes involving Federally controlled substances will not be removable under Petitioner's view."
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3326.482,3327.6,"No, no, no, no, no."
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3340.841,3342.074,--Your--
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3342.074,3345.728,And so they haven't found it impossible in thousands of those cases.
2014.13-1034,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3363.873,3365.223,--It would--
2014.13-1034,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3365.223,3368.108,--Does it call for changing the natural reading of the sentence?
