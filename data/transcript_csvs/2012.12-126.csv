2012.12-126,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.92,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-126, McQuiggin v. Perkins."
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,8.02,10.789,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,53.48,75.593,"Mr. Bursch, I thought that -- that Perkins -- didn't he say that -- that you could take into account -- I'm looking for the brief -- you could take into account delay as a factor in whether his actual-innocence gateway plea should be heard."
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,75.593,83.849,"Well, he -- he does say that, and we read that as a concession that sometimes if you wait too long, that can actually trump a claim of actual innocence."
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,87.634,88.986,That -- that's not quite what he's saying.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,120.538,121.707,"Well, we think it--"
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,121.707,126.942,What he says is it -- it really puts into question the validity of your claim.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,126.942,133.348,"--But, Justice Sotomayor, it -- it represents the same kind of principle, you've got to act quickly or adverse consequences can happen."
2012.12-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,157.813,174.257,"It's -- it's a small point and doesn't go to the general issues you have to discuss with us, but just on the small point, he gets -- I forget exactly the detail -- he gets an affidavit that Jones did it within a year."
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,175.023,175.773,Yes.
2012.12-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,175.773,178.559,"Now, if I were the prisoner, I'd say, you know, this one might not work."
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,200.155,200.622,Yes.
2012.12-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,225.44,236.413,I'm not quite -- excuse me -- I'm not quite sure that wouldn't mean that you have a whole raft of -- of petition-protective decisions waiting on the shelf in the district court.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,240.882,241.715,Two thoughts on that.
2012.12-126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,302.287,305.156,What did -- what would it take to -- what would it take to show diligence?
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,312.493,313.676,--Sure.
2012.12-126,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,354.253,359.288,I have some difficulty understanding what the Sixth Circuit was doing.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,411.257,413.624,"Well, we're very confused about that, too."
2012.12-126,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,429.384,441.459,"Well, that may be what they're contemplating, but they can't get to the issue of whether the district court adequately addressed the issue of adequate innocence -- of actual innocence unless that issue is before them."
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,450.732,452.75,"--We agree with that 100 percent, so--"
2012.12-126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,452.75,455.535,Was that -- was that argued to the -- to the Sixth Circuit?
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,466.076,472.23,"--I believe that is the position of the State of Michigan, that because he confessed to his friends both before and after--"
2012.12-126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,472.23,475.849,That it was explicitly made to the Sixth Circuit?
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,475.849,479.834,--I believe that the Sixth Circuit argument did focus on the question of diligence.
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,504.701,506.217,Where does that leave us?
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,506.217,507.653,I--
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,507.653,508.186,Let's assume--
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,508.186,513.055,"--Well, that leaves you with a reversal in any of those three instances."
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,522.413,525.096,--It's sort of an advisory opinion in your judgment.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,525.096,527.047,"Oh, no, it wouldn't be an advisory opinion."
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,527.047,530.849,"Sure, it would be, because you're telling us that there is no proof of actual innocence."
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,530.849,531.699,I'm saying that--
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,531.699,533.032,So why don't we just say that?
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,533.032,535.734,--I'm saying that's an alternative ground to get to the same place.
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,544.757,555.147,"It might be its holding, but, as Justice Alito just proved, there's no basis for it because they didn't grant a COA on the substantive merits question."
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,555.147,555.88,Right.
2012.12-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,656.125,658.794,"Your -- your -- your three-way classification, you began with Herrera?"
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,658.794,659.527,--Correct.
2012.12-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,659.527,671.368,"And -- and in a way, you're saying that you're three loops back in the Herrera a bit, because here the innocence is the factual predicate."
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,671.368,671.87,Right.
2012.12-126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,774.652,776.585,Before you present the argument--
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,776.585,777.102,--Yes.
2012.12-126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,777.102,782.672,--you are saying that Congress overruled Schlup; is that what -- the point you're making?
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,782.672,798.181,"The -- the contextual point that I was making was that Congress knew about Schlup, it was brought up in the debate that this was essentially changing the Schlup rule and allowing someone who claims actual innocence not to present their claim, and Congress swept those objections aside by a 91 to 8 vote."
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,798.181,801.219,With respect to successive petitions.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,801.219,808.306,"No, they were talking in the -- the legislative record just generally about actual innocence and claims of miscarriage of justice."
2012.12-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,848.197,849.397,Where -- where -- where is that in the text?
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,852.316,856.97,"I'm relying on 2244(b), which is the successive petition provision."
2012.12-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,886.739,890.107,"You -- you don't have 2244(b) in your brief, do you?"
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,890.107,892.209,"--Unfortunately, the text is not there, no."
2012.12-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.209,894.659,That is unfortunate.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,894.659,895.161,Yes.
2012.12-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,896.677,897.694,"If you're relying on it, I mean."
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,897.694,900.729,"--Well, as we explained in the briefs, both parties rely on that."
2012.12-126,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,910.771,911.687,I'm sorry.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,912.037,928.816,"--Which is simply that Congress considered the -- the instance where you establish a statutory actual-innocence gateway in (b)(2), the successive petition, and still require that it be timely filed, because the State's interest in having notice and an opportunity to investigate is so important."
2012.12-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,928.816,935.57,"Are -- are you saying that this case is a fortiori from a successive petition, because this isn't a successive petition."
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,935.57,936.003,"No, this is not."
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,946.975,947.659,You don't see a difference--
2012.12-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,947.659,949.427,"Well, you're saying that Congress knows how to write--"
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,949.427,950.727,"--Yes, I am--"
2012.12-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,950.727,952.079,--an exception if they want it.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,959.449,976.228,"--Well, my -- my point is that if Congress anticipated that actual innocence could be a gateway to circumvent the limitations period, then certainly they would have put that exception in the successive petition of (b)(2) where they said, all right, if you establish actual innocence, we're still going to make you comply with the limitations period."
2012.12-126,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,976.228,990.221,"Well, now, your friend on the other side I think argues that that -- they put that in expressly because they limited what would be the otherwise applicable miscarriage of justice provision in the question that's before us now."
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,990.221,990.637,Right.
2012.12-126,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,991.154,992.654,What is your -- what is your answer to that?
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,992.654,1003.462,"--If he was right about that, then in (B), you would also see another provision that says and anyone who satisfies this statutory actual-innocence standard doesn't have to apply with the limitations period."
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1007.314,1008.247,--I'm sorry.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1033.295,1038.433,"--Well, Justice Sotomayor, the history of this statute and of the case law isn't quite that way."
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1062.396,1063.496,I'm not talking about that presumption.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1063.496,1063.962,--Right.
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1063.962,1064.545,I'm talking about--
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1064.545,1065.445,Now I'm going to move to miscarriage of justice.
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1065.445,0.0,--our cause and effect and manifest injustice.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1067.711,0.0,Yes.
2012.12-126,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1098.93,1107.186,"But you're creating a world in which this would function as an exception to a State time limit, but not to the AEDPA time limit."
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1107.186,1107.852,That's correct.
2012.12-126,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1107.852,1108.752,Why does that make any sense?
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1108.752,1113.34,Because it was the Court itself that created the judicial exception to the State filing.
2012.12-126,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1134.936,1157.532,"But I thought we said in Missouri v. Holland that AEDPA was -- was enacted against a background rule which stated that normal equitable principles, such as this one, which had been applied everywhere to all procedural bars, that AEDPA suggested that those would -- wouldn't fit -- AEDPA was against a background that those would continue to apply."
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1157.532,1165.805,"Well, it was a very short background, one with no Irwin-like presumption and one that, again, had never ever been applied to a Federal statute of limitations."
2012.12-126,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1165.805,1168.84,And why is a Federal statute of limitations any different?
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1168.84,1173.744,Because it's Congress and Congress is the one that's handcuffing the Court with respect to the scope of--
2012.12-126,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1173.744,1185.05,"Yes, but again, it's Congress that we said in Holland, that it's Congress and AEDPA has -- has -- was drafted against this presumption that normal equitable principles would apply."
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1185.05,1186.419,--But here's another way to think about it.
2012.12-126,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1219.64,1225.125,"But again, why would Congress have thought that there would be any difference in -- with respect to a statute of limitations?"
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1225.125,1231.781,"Well, the biggest reason is because of the State interest in notice and investigating the evidence."
2012.12-126,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1234.081,1235.333,But that applies to States as well.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1235.333,1239.635,"--Well, no, there -- there you have stale claims, but you don't have stale evidence."
2012.12-126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1297.99,1299.942,Why can't you cross-examine her?
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1303.394,1304.494,It'll be very difficult.
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1343.035,1351.891,Do you have any idea how many actual-innocence claims win on the underlying constitutional issue?
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1351.891,1352.207,--Right.
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1371.802,1373.152,How many wins on the attempt?
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1373.152,1378.306,"Well, in the Sixth Circuit, a little more than in some other circuits, but generally, not very many--"
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1378.306,1378.939,Not many.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1378.939,1379.189,--you know.
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1449.785,1456.622,Why -- why is it that the meritorious claim is going to be the one that's going to be hidden?
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1456.622,1458.472,Because there are so many.
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1458.472,1458.855,Meaning--
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1458.855,1472.482,"It's important to understand that -- that notwithstanding the limits that Congress was trying to put on these habeas petitions when it enacted AEDPA, that we actually have more habeas filings on an annual basis today than we did before AEDPA was enacted."
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1486.807,1488.274,--But you would -- you want to keep it out altogether.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1488.274,1489.426,No.
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1489.426,1493.811,You want an actually -- potentially actually innocent person not to have--
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1493.811,1494.461,"No, that is not our position."
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1503.6,1505.269,--But they don't have the Federal system--
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1505.269,1506.086,"--No, they don't."
2012.12-126,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1506.086,1506.936,--as the first habeas.
2012.12-126,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1506.936,1514.19,"But as the Alabama amici brief explains, every State has got a process for curing these claims no matter how old they are."
2012.12-126,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1530.967,1531.784,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1539.557,1542.175,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1574.063,1587.554,"Before you proceed with that, can you address Justice Alito's point that the district court said there is no merit to this; it's not an actual innocence -- it's not a valid actual innocence claim."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1604.083,1606.216,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.12-126,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1675.446,1676.196,"Well, I don't understand that."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1694.158,1698.476,"Justice Alito, I don't read the Sixth -- or I don't read the district court as actually getting to the merits."
2012.12-126,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1713.219,1718.289,Did you ask for a certificate -- what other issues did you ask for a certificate of appealability on?
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1718.289,1720.289,"--Well, our client was acting pro se."
2012.12-126,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1720.289,1722.841,What other issues did he ask for a certificate on?
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1722.841,1724.943,"Justice Alito, I don't -- I don't have that in front of me."
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1733.299,1743.671,"Counsel, you say on page 17 of your brief that this Court has applied the manifest-injustice exception to limits created by Congress."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1745.523,1747.475,"Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1764.101,1766.02,"What do you mean, acts of Congress?"
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1772.174,1779.011,"Mr. Chief Justice, that's incorrect in the sense that there was no Federal statute of limitations before AEDPA."
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1809.896,1812.496,"With 2255, remind me?"
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1812.496,1814.714,"--For Federal, Federal petitions."
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1814.714,1816.633,And said what with respect to time--
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1816.633,1817.2,Federal convictions.
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1817.2,1819.518,--Said what with respect to the time limits?
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1819.518,1825.656,"There were -- there were -- there were -- there was language in both, in both statutes regarding when you could bring a successive petition."
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1839.582,1843.968,"So when you said limits, you didn't mean time limits; you meant substantive limits?"
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1843.968,1844.801,"Substantive -- well, no."
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1846.584,1846.984,Procedural limits.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1851.455,1852.505,We do.
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1856.692,1857.242,Right.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1866.48,1868.749,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there have never been any time limits."
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1868.749,1869.799,Right.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1880.138,1884.692,I think I can agree with that because there was never a statute of limitations before AEDPA.
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1884.692,1884.942,Right.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1902.737,1904.82,"Well, I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-126,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1925.433,1932.856,"Well, you are asking for what is potentially a very big exception to the 1-year statute of limitations."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1940.11,1943.145,"Justice Alito, I suspect few of them could credibly say--"
2012.12-126,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1943.145,1944.828,Very few would say they are actually innocent?
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1944.828,1946.778,"--Well, I haven't done that study."
2012.12-126,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1950.913,1951.68,"Oh, credibly say."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1991.488,1991.654,Should--
2012.12-126,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1991.654,1995.106,Is that plausible given what Congress was trying to do in AEDPA?
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,1995.106,1997.256,"--Absolutely, Justice Alito, for two reasons."
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2049.508,2052.46,I'm not sure that's right.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2090.768,2093.637,"Well, and the statue speaks to that."
2012.12-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2102.259,2107.879,"And the statute of limitations would run from the discovery of the new evidence, not from--"
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2107.879,2112.448,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, to the extent that the evidence goes to support a claim."
2012.12-126,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2170.802,2187.831,"But that's very odd, because if you have somebody who's actually innocent, then you're saying that person can't get out of prison unless the person happens to have a good constitutional claim that's totally unrelated to the fact that the person is actually innocent."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2189.431,2195.587,"Well, I don't think so, Justice Alito, in the sense that all this is, is a gateway to allow them their first opportunity to bring a Federal habeas petition."
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2211.03,2228.908,"Your friend responds to that point, I think, by saying that every State allows collateral review in that instance and that what we're talking about is simply preclusion of the second bite at the apple or a third bite at the apple, I guess, by -- by assumption in the Federal system."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2228.908,2234.645,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not sure that's practical to the extent that we've already raised our underlying constitutional claims in the State court."
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2241.648,2243.667,What about the actual-innocence claim?
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2243.667,2249.488,"The innocence evidence may -- you may be able to pursue that under -- under the -- under the state rule, but that is more akin to a freestanding--"
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2249.488,2256.325,"Is that the most -- is that the most -- I thought I understood your friend to say, he can correct me if I'm wrong, that every State has an avenue for considering that."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2256.325,2258.094,"--Well, two responses."
2012.12-126,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2295.13,2296.465,"Counsel, I see--"
2012.12-126,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2296.465,2298.932,"Well, assuming for the sake of argument that there is this exception."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2314.86,2330.804,"Justice Alito, for decades this Court has never required diligence and, in fact, in McCloskey has expressly rejected it and the Court has noted that diligence has not historically been required under the standard, because as the Court said in House and Calderon, that Congress raised the bar in two places on the statute."
2012.12-126,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2354.068,2354.418,--But--
2012.12-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2354.418,2358.789,"--You have a larger -- you have a larger category, you say miscarriage of justice."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2375.398,2383.237,"Justice Ginsburg, I think the Court has always treated the phrase “ miscarriage of justice ” as synonymous with actual innocence, and that's the one thing it's getting at."
2012.12-126,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2389.841,2390.274,--Counsel--
2012.12-126,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2390.274,2393.459,Are bribed jurors not a miscarriage of justice?
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2393.459,2394.926,"--I'm sorry, Justice--"
2012.12-126,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2394.926,2398.361,"A juror who's bribed, is there no -- no miscarriage of justice there?"
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2398.361,2401.397,"--Well, that would presumably be the basis for a habeas claim."
2012.12-126,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2401.397,2404.601,But what we're talking about the meaning of the term “ miscarriage of justice ”.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2412.787,2413.62,"Well, Justice Kennedy--"
2012.12-126,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2413.62,2414.87,Do you want to say it's a term of art?
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2415.37,2428.647,"--Justice Kennedy, I'm relying on the Court's decades of decisions, many of which you've written in this area, where they've described miscarriage of justice in the habeas setting as the equivalent of incarceration of an innocent person and that's what the exception is getting at."
2012.12-126,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2428.647,2429.397,--I--
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2429.397,2434.883,"So does this boil down to -- I mean, you have a one-year statute of limitations."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2444.422,2451.426,"Well, that could be viewed as an impediment under -- under the statute, there's a statutory provision for--"
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2451.426,2454.628,"Yes, I mean, don't they toll it when there's some -- when the courthouse burns down?"
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2454.628,2456.73,"--It could also be based on tolling, correct."
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2456.73,2457.614,All right.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2469.472,2472.424,I'm not sure if I fully understand the question.
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2472.424,2475.376,"Well, he has his one year and he gives four criteria."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2483.297,2484.899,That's -- that's true.
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2486.682,2489.118,And a different one you say is when he's actually innocent.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2489.118,2491.018,--That's -- that's -- that's correct.
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2491.018,2491.701,All right.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2502.24,2505.292,"Well, then that raises a whole--"
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2505.292,2506.292,"Well, what is your answer?"
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2506.292,2506.958,--different range of--
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2506.958,2509.427,Or can he toll it under those circumstances?
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2509.427,2517.1,"--Well, any -- as the Court said in Schlup, the timing of the submission by the Petitioner can certainly be considered in the Schlup analysis."
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2517.1,2530.423,"So the answer is in your view, if he deliberately and -- and without cause delays it for 5 years his filing, just so everybody will die, you would say, okay, I'm not worried about him."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2530.423,2531.373,"Well, Justice Breyer--"
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2531.373,2532.025,Is that right?
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2532.992,2539.279,"--I would say -- I would say that he can still attempt to avail himself of the Federal miscarriage of justice exception, but the huge problem he's going to run into--"
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2539.279,2539.896,Does he win or lose?
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2539.896,2541.648,--He likely -- he may well lose.
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2541.648,2542.481,What do you think?
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2542.481,2544.95,He may well lose at the Schlup stage.
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2544.95,2545.716,I didn't ask that.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2546.433,2549.418,"Well, I don't have all the facts, I suspect he's going to lose."
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2549.418,2549.934,"Yes, you do."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2552.62,2560.124,"Well, Justice Breyer, on those facts I'm going to say he loses at the Schlup stage because Schlup, which is one, incredibly high bar to meet."
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2572.264,2573.331,And how long did you--
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2573.331,2577.25,"I'm just trying to -- they admit that if he's diligent, it's okay."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2577.25,2579.185,The State?
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2579.185,2579.635,Yes.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2581.287,2583.054,We believe he's diligent.
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2585.756,2587.123,The State is asking for a diligence requirement.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2596.913,2603.417,"Well, there's -- there's never been a diligence requirement in this setting, because that's not been the focus."
2012.12-126,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2603.417,2603.733,--But--
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2603.733,2609.054,"But there is a sham -- there is a sham and deliberate delay requirement, not a diligence one, but there is a sham."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2610.354,2610.604,"No, but--"
2012.12-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2610.604,2615.756,What I'm trying to say is maybe we're arguing about something that we could solve.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2635.735,2645.86,"--I think -- I think the Court can just build on the principles it's already set forward in Schlup and other places, and that is, that there's never been a diligence requirement in this setting."
2012.12-126,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2658.435,2667.291,--But there has always been a laches defense until Rule 9(A) was rescinded.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2667.291,2669.307,"--That's correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-126,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2669.307,2670.042,All right.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2716.554,2717.056,Absolutely.
2012.12-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2755.598,2756.414,How about--
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2756.414,2764.204,"--Is this established after -- after some kind of evidentiary hearing, the delay, whether he delayed for a particular purpose or not?"
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2764.204,2765.07,"Well, it depends."
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2779.547,2783.166,Why -- why did your client wait 5 years after the last affidavit?
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2783.166,2785.701,"--A number of reasons, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-126,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2810.416,2819.605,"Well, as your -- as your adversary says, there's nothing really procedurally complicated about filing a Federal habeas."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2850.226,2860.516,"Well, Justice Alito, no -- no rational petitioner is going to want to wait in that period, because if they file within the 1-year period, they go straight to review on their habeas claims and they don't have to worry about any procedural gateway."
2012.12-126,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2861.868,2869.538,But I -- I don't understand your answer about why it took him 5 years from the -- from obtaining the last affidavit to the filing of the Federal habeas.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2882.829,2887.967,"--Well, and Justice Alito, you're right, we're not arguing for equitable tolling here in the sense that he could have filed earlier."
2012.12-126,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2900.357,2908.03,"But you think that Congress, which in AEDPA was trying to speed all this up and get rid of the delay and make things simpler, intended to allow that?"
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,2916.134,2926.075,"--Well, no, Justice Alito, you're correct that AEDPA was intended to delay -- or to end delay when possible -- but as the Court said in Holland, AEDPA was not meant to end every delay at all costs."
2012.12-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2955.427,2964.55,"--In the Second Circuit, where they've had a similar case, the Second Circuit itself said that actual innocence is rare."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,3029.406,3032.441,"I think ordinarily, yes."
2012.12-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3037.245,3043.315,But it didn't find anything about whether this was -- this claim was a good one.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,3043.315,3044.765,--That's correct.
2012.12-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3045.934,3048.3,And I'm still puzzled about what happens next.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,3060.108,3069.131,"Well, it's correct that the case should be remanded back to the district court, just like this case -- just like the Court did in Schlup, where it announced the standard and remanded back to the district court for application."
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3143.181,3154.237,"Well, but I mean, the whole question -- and your friend made the point -- the question is how many are filed, in how many cases does the claim arise, not how few times it's upheld."
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,3154.237,3154.906,--Sure.
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3171.031,3174.983,How do you know which of these are meritorious and which aren't?
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,3178.451,3180.82,"--We do, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3180.82,3184.872,And your friend says nobody can reasonably think this person is innocent.
2012.12-126,1,19971,chad_a_readler,,3196.346,3198.198,I don't think it's one you can cast aside.
2012.12-126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3214.005,3215.055,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-126,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3217.624,3223.944,"Three brief points about Holland, and some closing thoughts about diligence."
2012.12-126,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3309.201,3322.874,"Mr. Bursch, you suggested earlier some way out of this puzzle about why Congress would have put the actual-innocence exception into the second successive petition provision, and not had one for a first petition--"
2012.12-126,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3322.874,3323.307,--Yes.
2012.12-126,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3323.307,3325.274,--But that seems really quite odd to me.
2012.12-126,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3348.872,3358.88,"Let me explain that and I'm glad you raised that because, you know, besides the legislative history that informs what we are looking at here, what they did in 2244(d)(1)(D) is they made it broader."
2012.12-126,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3384.445,3387.397,"Well, I guess I'm just not sure I understand that."
2012.12-126,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3399.455,3403.757,"Right, they could have, but again, that would have limited (d)(1)(D)."
2012.12-126,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3403.757,3404.34,"Well, it didn't have to."
2012.12-126,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3406.523,3414.563,"Well, if they said there is an exception for those who claim actual innocence, the implication is for those who don't claim actual innocence, you are out of luck."
2012.12-126,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3414.563,3416.248,"Well, you just you make the converse clear."
2012.12-126,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3416.248,3422.152,"Well, if we could rewrite congressional statutes with hindsight, maybe we could draft a perfect statute."
2012.12-126,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3422.152,3435.226,"All I'm saying is that your interpretation of the statute creates a glaring anomaly that people would be out of court on the first petition and they could turn around on their second petition, which is usually disfavored, and get an actual-innocence exception."
2012.12-126,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3435.226,3437.661,"No, that's not the way that we interpret this at all."
2012.12-126,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3486.159,3487.761,What do you think about the words
2012.12-126,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3512.726,3513.492,"Go ahead, briefly."
2012.12-126,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3513.492,3523.698,--As long as it takes into account that the State interest in timeliness is at its apex when we are dealing with new evidence that relates to the actual constitutional claim.
2012.12-126,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3528.169,3529.252,"Thank you, counsel."
