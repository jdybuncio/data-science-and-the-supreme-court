1985.85-62,2,22231,e_paul_eggert,,1504.468,1507.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-62,3,19147,cabanne_howard,,2908.295,2913.401,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, just three points in response to the prior questions."
1985.85-62,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2927.115,2939.938,"If two out of every hundred thousand baitfish are diseased, you may find those two but you would never know whether you found them all."
1985.85-62,3,19147,cabanne_howard,,2939.938,2940.561,That is the point.
1985.85-62,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3064.605,3065.73,What sentence do you refer?
1985.85-62,3,19147,cabanne_howard,,3068.807,3072.337,"Well, I realize the court didn't use the words ""I hereby find""--"
1985.85-62,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3072.337,3073.898,He didn't say I believe this one and I don't believe that one.
1985.85-62,3,19147,cabanne_howard,,3074.461,3074.727,--Yes.
1985.85-62,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3076.96,3078.944,What makes you think that?
1985.85-62,3,19147,cabanne_howard,,3078.944,3079.881,"Well, because--"
1985.85-62,4,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3092.986,3095.86,"He didn't actually say I hereby find so and so, but I think--"
1985.85-62,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3095.86,3102.418,What he said was there is a disagreement and in view of the fact there is a disagreement the state is entitled to rely on the uncertainty.
1985.85-62,5,19147,cabanne_howard,,3102.418,3102.824,Right.
1985.85-62,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3114.757,3117.303,"And, in case it does, the state can go ahead and protect its environment."
1985.85-62,5,19147,cabanne_howard,,3117.303,3117.6,--Yes.
1985.85-62,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3117.6,3118.209,That is what it says.
1985.85-62,5,19147,cabanne_howard,,3118.209,3121.505,"Anyway, I think that finding is there, at least I would characterize--"
1985.85-62,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3121.505,3123.207,"The finding that there is uncertainty is there, yes."
1985.85-62,5,19147,cabanne_howard,,3123.207,3124.254,"--Yes, that is right, and that is what we need."
1985.85-62,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.595,3135.092,Do you know of any other states that have a similar rule?
1985.85-62,5,19147,cabanne_howard,,3135.092,3136.311,No.
1985.85-62,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3164.003,3169.11,Why are these shiners any more dangerous to Maine than they are to New Hampshire?
1985.85-62,5,19147,cabanne_howard,,3169.11,3171.812,"--Well, they would be equally dangerous to New Hampshire."
1985.85-62,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3171.812,3174.437,"New Hampshire lets them in, don't they?"
1985.85-62,5,19147,cabanne_howard,,3174.437,3175.733,I think they do.
1985.85-62,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3176.561,3177.311,You don't know that?
1985.85-62,5,19147,cabanne_howard,,3177.311,3180.965,"--I don't know the answer to that, as to what the New Hampshire law is."
1985.85-62,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3180.965,3181.574,What about Vermont?
1985.85-62,5,19147,cabanne_howard,,3181.574,3183.542,"I don't know, but the situation--"
1985.85-62,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3183.542,3185.307,Do you know of any other state that keeps them out.
1985.85-62,5,19147,cabanne_howard,,3185.307,3189.353,--I know of no other state that has a statutory prohibition.
1985.85-62,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.353,3198.566,"Well, do you know of any other state that lets them in on the assumption that the threat is not very great?"
1985.85-62,5,19147,cabanne_howard,,3198.566,3204.72,It is a question of what the state administrative officers do with their administration discretion that legislatures may have given to them.
1985.85-62,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.72,3207.111,"So, I ask you again, do you know of any--"
1985.85-62,5,19147,cabanne_howard,,3207.111,3209.611,"No, I do not know, but that doesn't mean it isn't being done."
1985.85-62,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.982,3226.229,--You mean some diseased fish would cause more havoc there than they would in the non-fragile New Hampshire fishery?
1985.85-62,5,19147,cabanne_howard,,3226.229,3226.416,Yes.
1985.85-62,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3246.72,3248.001,"Thank you, gentlemen."
