2018.17-765,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.12,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-765, United States versus Stitt, and Case Number 17-766, United States versus Sims. Ms. Ross."
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,12.12,18.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The crime of burglary has always focused on dwellings."
2018.17-765,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,41.64,58.4,"That wasn't the position that the government took prior -- prior to Mathis, was it? I thought that prior to Mathis, the government acknowledged that generic burglary did not include motor vehicles as habitations?"
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,58.4,62.64,"I don't think that's quite right, Your Honor."
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,97.04,111.56,I have little problem understanding your argument with respect to mobile homes or floating homes. Those are structures that don't have any propulsion -- self-propulsion mechanisms.
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,147.28,157.6,"Well, Your Honor, to answer sort of your question directly and then just take -- take a step back, I think people often will know that those are being used because those are, in fact, designed or adapted for that purpose."
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,159.24,159.52,All right.
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,216.2,219.08,"So, Your Honor, I think there are a number of points sort of in that question."
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,247.28,248.68,So where any person lives.
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,251.28,252.12,"Right, Your Honor."
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,258.72,260.56,"So define ""used"" for me."
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,261.36,261.64,So --
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,261.64,273.08,And define it in a way that a thief is going to know or a burglar is going to know that it's being used as a home.
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,273.08,308.48,"So, Your Honor, the -- I don't think Congress was focusing specifically on whether a burglar would know ahead of time. What Congress was doing was looking at how the states defined ""burglary,"" and that is essentially the -- the central intuition of this Court's decision in Taylor, is that Congress did not itself provide a functional definition of ""burglary."" What it did was it looked at how the states defined ""burglary."" And the states, by and large, included vehicles used and adapted for overnight accommodation. Now the specific provision that's at issue in the Sims statute, again, if you think it's properly before the Court, it requires an interpretation of the state law."
2018.17-765,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,327.84,328.32,Well --
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,328.32,330.12,You've gone around my question.
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,340.64,370.72,"So, Your Honor, I think they are not encompassed by these statutes. And I think that our definition turns on whether most states would, in fact, have included that person. So I don't think that it's encompassed by this statute because, again, I think even the homeless person that you're hypothesizing would change their vehicle in some way that might put a burglar on notice. But even if you disagree with me on that, no state case -- as Respondent Sims readily admits in the brief, no state case has applied it to a vehicle in which someone happens to live."
2018.17-765,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,387.28,417.44,"Well, counsel, I'm not sure how that helps you, because you've identified, first of all, that only 12 states are at issue, which seems to me a strike against the government here, as to suggest that this was what Congress had in mind in 1984/'86. Second, the -- the statute at least in Arkansas is disjunctive, right? It says a -- a place customarily used to -- to live, which might be your -- line up with the Tennessee statute and suggest some sort of customization or change."
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,471.8,493.52,"Well, Justice Gorsuch, to sort of answer your questions in reverse order perhaps, I think that's actually not particularly anomalous because what the -- what the burglar has done in the first case but hasn't done in the second case is opened up exactly the risk of a violent confrontation with which Congress was concerned in -- in enacting a statute that specifically both in 1984 and 1986 --"
2018.17-765,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,493.52,496.92,"Well, if the car is empty and no one's around, it's -- it's quite unlike a home."
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,507.24,508.16,"You have, Your Honor."
2018.17-765,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,542.0,543.44,I'm -- I'm sure he's going to dispute that.
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,554.88,557.48,"No, Your Honor, I don't think it's exceedingly small."
2018.17-765,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,621.16,642.28,"But you are using any car, that is, any car is capable of being lived in, so the burglary statute that you're -- you are envisioning, a statute that took in anything capable of being lived in would include any car?"
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,642.28,645.36,"No, Justice Ginsburg, I don't necessarily agree with that."
2018.17-765,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,702.04,705.28,"It sure sounds to me like you've turned those two prongs into one, made them superfluous."
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,705.28,711.8,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because something that is customarily used would be everyone knows that you can live in that."
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,727.76,744.84,"I'm -- I'm sorry. What is ""assume""? And then what's the meaning of ""adapted""? Is it a structural change of some sort, or is it throwing a pillow and blanket? Is it putting a mattress in there? What -- what does ""adapted"" mean?"
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,744.84,746.28,"So, again, Your Honor, I would --"
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,746.28,749.96,And what's customary to understand that adaptation?
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,749.96,770.44,"So I think the states have grappled with what -- what is adapted for overnight accommodation under their statutes, and, by and large, this comes up in cases involving campers, hotels, houses under renovation, and -- and the answers are not surprising. Respondent cites three cases for the suggestion that maybe it's difficult to decide whether something is adapted for overnight accommodation."
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,773.24,775.4,But we can't just leave it in state hands.
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,781.36,786.96,"You are providing a federal definition, Your Honor, but, again, I don't think that when Congress did this it was trying to itself determine these edge cases."
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,788.96,790.96,"Well, we said dwelling and structure."
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,797.36,798.4,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,798.4,801.76,Or give some understanding of what the federal meaning of it was.
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,815.72,816.36,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,816.56,821.04,So does it have to be something permanent to be adapted?
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,821.04,826.32,"So I don't think that there is a -- a clear answer to that question, unfortunately."
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,828.64,832.44,"Well, the problem really is that, if it's criminal law, shouldn't we be clear?"
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,832.44,833.52,"Well, we should be --"
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,833.52,843.04,"Shouldn't we give notice to people of what the consequences of their actions are, and so don't we have an obligation to be as clear as we can be?"
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,843.04,844.32,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,852.0,853.88,"Just a bed, putting a mattress?"
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,853.88,854.84,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,855.32,861.2,How about the people who are carrying the mattress from the store to their home? I see that all the time.
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,861.2,864.52,"Well, no, Your Honor, because that wouldn't be installed in a way that was actually adapted for overnight accommodation."
2018.17-765,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,864.88,866.4,So it has to be installed in some way?
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,866.4,868.28,"I mean, you would just be transporting your mattress in that case."
2018.17-765,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,873.88,902.28,"Does it matter if it says sometimes, sometimes I sleep in my car, and sometimes I sleep in a home? Does it have to be the regular residence? Does the car to qualify have to be what you sleep in all the time, or could it be that you have a principal residence someplace else, but many times you sleep in your car?"
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,902.28,915.36,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, just to back up again, I think that the vehicle in which you happen to sleep on occasion wouldn't fall in even under the broadest possible interpretation of the Arkansas statute at issue in Sims because you wouldn't live in your car in that instance."
2018.17-765,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,917.4,929.8,"I'd like to ask you a general question, if you would answer it. You've read probably Justice Alito's opinion about the woman who was trying to go to Brussels and she ended up in Serbia."
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,929.8,930.12,Yes.
2018.17-765,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,930.12,930.64,All right.
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1024.88,1044.72,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I certainly understand all of those concerns and I don't think anyone standing here from the Department of Justice would suggest that this is always an easy determination under the categorical approach. I do think in this case it is not particularly difficult, and that is because, as I started out, burglary has always concerned dwelling."
2018.17-765,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1060.04,1070.16,"It may be, but do you know when the last time was that I thoroughly looked into state criminal law? It was my first year of law school, and I'm not sure how -- how much I looked into it even then. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1070.16,1071.2,"Understood, Your Honor."
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1074.0,1082.48,"-- and, again, I mean, the best I can give you is that 44 states would have covered this in 1986."
2018.17-765,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1090.72,1094.12,"Well, I'd like you to return to Justice Breyer's original question."
2018.17-765,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1137.24,1139.88,May I add a fifth? (Laughter.)
2018.17-765,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1139.88,1140.32,Please.
2018.17-765,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1140.32,1148.48,Because I know there actually is a statute in Congress right now that replaces ACCA with a statute that looks to the penalties that have been given.
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1155.88,1160.56,"Your Honor, I apologize, I'm actually not aware of whether the department has taken an official position on that."
2018.17-765,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1208.28,1209.36,"Well, at least with respect --"
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1209.36,1210.12,And they do worry --
2018.17-765,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1210.12,1210.32,Yeah.
2018.17-765,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1214.56,1242.92,"You might have gotten a hint that a majority of the Court really hates ACCA and is picking it apart bit by bit by bit. And at least with respect to the enumerated offenses like burglary, why not depart from this categorical approach and look at what actually happened in the particular case to the extent that you can determine it? If you can't determine that it -- it falls within generic burglary, fine."
2018.17-765,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1272.44,1275.6,Because didn't this Court say you can -- couldn't do that?
2018.17-765,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1275.6,1281.2,"Yeah, the Court said that, but the Court isn't always right. Sometimes when we make a mess -- (Laughter.)"
2018.17-765,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1281.2,1286.56,"-- which we have done in this -- in my humble opinion, in this area, we have made one royal mess."
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1289.64,1295.28,"Your Honor, again, I -- I think perhaps in some case that would be something that this Court needed to think about."
2018.17-765,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.4,1393.64,Well --
2018.17-765,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1393.64,1419.64,"Suppose we think about the consequences, the number of years that are added to a person's life by ACCA. Another approach the Court could take is to say because this is such a harsh statute that has such extreme consequences for the individual, we are going to have a clear statement rule for Congress."
2018.17-765,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1445.88,1450.44,"Your Honor, I -- I think Congress was very plain in this statute."
2018.17-765,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1525.64,1531.64,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher."
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1531.64,1589.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We ask the Court to affirm the judgments below for three reasons. First, this Court's precedent, from Taylor on through to Mathis, make clear that when it comes to the burglary provision of ACCA, buildings and structures are in one category that are inside the statute, vehicles are in another category that are outside the statute, and this case involves quintessential vehicles. Secondly, the ""use"" prong of the government's definition that it offers to this Court is an independent reason why Arkansas's law goes beyond any generic definition of burglary that would be acceptable. And, third, if necessary, we would ask this Court to apply the Sixth Amendment rule that Justice Thomas announced in Apprendi and himself laid out in Mathis and Shepard, that ACCA itself violates the Sixth Amendment because it transgresses the jury trial right. Now --"
2018.17-765,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1589.04,1610.6,"May I stop you on your first point, Mr. Fisher? So the Court has indeed said many times that vehicles fall outside the generic definition of ""burglary."" But I think that when the Court said that, what it really meant was this is a way to say if -- if the -- if a statute covers basic car theft, it's outside ACCA."
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1626.92,1632.36,I think the -- the closest the Court did come to actually dealing with that question was in Mathis.
2018.17-765,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1676.44,1681.64,But I don't think -- I don't think Mathis really is -- is at odds with what I was saying.
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1707.64,1707.76,Yeah.
2018.17-765,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1812.68,1857.28,"But there are a lot of -- there are a lot of vacation homes that are occupied for only a short period of time and a -- somebody contemplating a burglary can look at them and determine pretty easily that place is not occupied at the -- at the present time. But what about, say you have a house, and then next to it you have a self-propelled vehicle that is designed or adapted for the overnight accommodation of persons and is actually occupied at the time of the initial entry by the defendant. Is there any reason why the -- the burglary of the house should be treated differently from the burglary of this vehicle? Isn't the risk exactly the same?"
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1857.28,1870.6,"Well, Justice Alito, I'm going to answer that question, but just allow me to preface it. I don't have -- I don't have to win that hypothetical because I -- the hypothetical the government has to win is the person not being in and it not being near a house."
2018.17-765,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1871.88,1877.8,"Well, why don't you have to win that? That's the Arkansas statute. What I read you is exactly what the Arkansas statute says."
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1877.8,1879.6,"No, no, no, the Arkansas -- well, the Arkansas statute says --"
2018.17-765,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1879.6,1882.16,"I'm sorry, the Tennessee statute."
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1882.16,1886.64,"The Tennessee statute does not require it -- it does require the person to be there, yes, Justice Alito."
2018.17-765,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1886.64,1886.88,Right.
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1886.88,1888.8,But it does not require it to be sitting right by a house.
2018.17-765,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1890.24,1890.4,"No, no."
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1902.32,1928.2,"I think because the criminal law, we've heard a lot about notice this morning, and a core concept of criminal law is providing fair notice. And so, for the same reason that a vacation home is inside burglary because it is a home, it is a dwelling, and so you would expect it to be occupied as a residence, even if it happens to be somebody's second home, that is in. The same objective characteristics of a vehicle, even a recreational vehicle adapted for occasional overnight accommodation, fall outside."
2018.17-765,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1949.6,1970.48,"But I notice if -- if you're convicted three times of burglary for burglarizing an RV, you're on notice, presumably, if you look at the federal statutes and you then possess a firearm, that -- that those burglaries were of a structure, as Taylor said."
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1972.64,1978.68,"Well, Justice Kavanaugh, I think that, if I may, it begs the question a little bit whether the RV is, in fact, a structure that's covered by --"
2018.17-765,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1978.68,1986.88,"But you would look at Taylor and you'd see it's citing the model -- Taylor's the case, right, focus on Taylor. It's a long time ago."
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2009.88,2015.56,"Well, Justice -- Justice Kavanaugh, there are many, many pieces of Taylor."
2018.17-765,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2031.08,2035.64,"But Taylor -- Taylor does not do that, though, when it says other -- or other structures."
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2044.32,2046.84,"I think it departs from the '84, but that's why -- that's why the court --"
2018.17-765,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2046.84,2048.16,Because the '84 Act only says building.
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2048.16,2048.64,That's right.
2018.17-765,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2050.84,2052.36,And one of the -- I'm sorry to interrupt.
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2077.72,2078.28,Right.
2018.17-765,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2198.96,2201.36,Which category does this case belong in?
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2201.36,2202.84,So this case belongs in the latter.
2018.17-765,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2202.84,2202.88,Why?
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2202.88,2206.72,Because we're talking about things that are not primary residences. They're not --
2018.17-765,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.72,2220.6,"But they're -- I mean, they're residences, they're inhabited by people, and so I don't know why it would be a lower statistic if it's, say, a car or a trailer or -- or some kind of motorized vehicle that a person uses as his home."
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2220.6,2226.84,"Well, I think, Justice Breyer, the typical usage of something like a sleeper van or recreational vehicle is not as a residence."
2018.17-765,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2239.64,2239.96,What are you -- what are you --
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2239.96,2241.52,And I think that's the way the statistics work.
2018.17-765,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2241.52,2244.84,What are you -- what are you basing that assertion on?
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2244.84,2248.56,"I'm just basing it on a common sense understanding of the word ""residence,"" Justice Kavanaugh."
2018.17-765,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2248.8,2253.28,Are these assertions about RVs you're --
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2253.28,2254.92,The customary usage assertion?
2018.17-765,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2254.92,2255.44,Yes.
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2255.44,2270.4,"Well, we -- we do cite -- we cite a statistic in our brief from a -- from a trade association, Justice Kavanaugh, if you want to look at that as a pretty thorough study done out of the University of Michigan, and what they found is that the typical owner of a recreational vehicle uses it only 19 nights a year."
2018.17-765,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2272.0,2277.28,"Your position, Mr. Fisher, is that mobile homes are included, but RVs are excluded, is that correct?"
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2277.28,2279.8,I think -- I think it's probably correct as to mobile homes.
2018.17-765,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2282.28,2284.88,"Yeah, but that's -- that's what I understood you to be saying in your brief."
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2284.88,2285.16,Yeah.
2018.17-765,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2285.16,2287.96,Does any state make that distinction in its law?
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2287.96,2289.88,"Well, Tennessee does, just to start with Tennessee."
2018.17-765,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2321.16,2331.56,"Could you give your view of where, if -- if we accepted your position, what that would mean in terms of how many states' laws qualified?"
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2331.56,2331.92,Yes.
2018.17-765,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2370.84,2373.12,"I'm sorry, you said that in a way that --"
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2373.12,2373.68,I'm sorry.
2018.17-765,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2373.68,2376.04,"-- that the delta, what -- what you're fighting about --"
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2376.04,2376.8,Yes.
2018.17-765,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2376.8,2378.28,-- is in the high teens?
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2378.28,2379.44,"Yes, that's right."
2018.17-765,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2381.4,2381.96,"I mean, that's significant."
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2382.32,2384.68,I -- I don't dispute that that's somewhat significant.
2018.17-765,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2533.64,2543.2,"But isn't that what the Model Penal Code had and some states already have? In other words, this is not something that would be created now."
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2543.2,2549.2,"Well, Justice Kavanaugh, it's true that many states have statutory language that says adapted for overnight accommodation."
2018.17-765,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2554.36,2559.36,"I understand, but that's always going to be the case that there will be some slight differences, right? I mean --"
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2559.36,2560.32,That may be true.
2018.17-765,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2569.6,2576.12,"And you don't think ""adapted"" has a firm grounding, even though it's been around in most state statutes for -- or many state statutes?"
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2576.12,2581.08,"Well, I don't see a definition in the government's brief, and I haven't seen a definition anywhere else."
2018.17-765,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2675.44,2682.44,But we're talking about a state statute that could well be interpreted in lots of different ways by the state courts.
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2687.24,2691.88,"I think if it were ambiguous, Justice Alito, that might be something you wouldn't want to do."
2018.17-765,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2698.92,2717.8,"Well, this was -- this was raised pretty late in the day, this argument about the Arkansas statute and ""living in."" And given that -- and given our decision in Duenas, why don't we do exactly what Justice Alito is suggesting and just remand it and let -- let the lower courts figure it out? Maybe they can certify it to the Arkansas Supreme Court and figure this out."
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2717.8,2721.48,"So for -- so for two reasons, one procedural and one substantive, Justice Gorsuch."
2018.17-765,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2735.68,2737.08,I'll spot you all of that.
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2737.08,2737.4,Okay.
2018.17-765,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2737.4,2738.56,I'm -- I'm with you. (Laughter.)
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2738.56,2739.0,So --
2018.17-765,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2739.0,2745.16,But it -- the -- the Eighth Circuit didn't have a chance to consider this particular argument about living in.
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2752.68,2766.28,"Well, I'd encourage the Court to do exactly -- this is my substantive answer -- to do exactly what it did in Mellouli when the -- we had a controlled substances law in front of you and the question was whether that state law from Kansas was overbroad into the categorical approach."
2018.17-765,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2775.88,2788.0,"The obvious -- I mean, the obvious interpretation the other way is that what they mean by ""used"" is used regularly or used more than once or used in some other way."
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2793.12,2793.48,No --
2018.17-765,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2793.48,2797.48,-- and the person left his briefcase or something in the car. They can't mean that.
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2797.48,2799.2,"No, I agree it doesn't mean that, Justice Breyer."
2018.17-765,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2843.68,2874.04,"But if you were representing a defendant before the Arkansas Supreme Court and the person had been convicted under this statute, a person lived in the car but every morning cleaned up the car so there was no way anybody could tell that anybody had been living there, wouldn't -- would you rule out the possibility of arguing to the Arkansas Supreme Court that there might -- that maybe there should be some additional requirements read into this provision?"
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2874.04,2903.32,"Well, Justice Alito, if I were appointed to that case, I might make that argument, but I think I would have a pretty lousy argument, and the reason why is because the plain text of the law would be directly against my argument. Remember, the -- there's already -- there's a separate prong of Arkansas law that covers customary usage, and I think I heard Ms. Ross say that covers the kinds of vehicles that are designed for that purpose or physically adapted to that purpose. So the only thing the other clause can mean under standard tools of statutory construction is the other -- is some other kind of car, in which somebody lives."
2018.17-765,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3126.32,3136.88,"Mr. Fisher, if we accept the government's ""adapted,"" and I understand all its problems, would the Tennessee statute survive?"
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3136.88,3137.08,If you --
2018.17-765,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3137.08,3139.0,"And if it's not, why not?"
2018.17-765,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3139.0,3167.96,"If you accept the government's -- if you accept the government's definition of ""adapted,"" then the Tennessee statute would -- would fall within it, but it would be also -- there -- there would be -- so, yeah, I think the answer to that is yes, if you accept the government's argument on ""adapted,"" then Tennessee is within it. But we ask, for all the reasons I've asked before, not to accept the government's argument to ""adapted."" The only thing the government has to say for itself, Justice Sotomayor, and I may be repeating myself here, is the state-by-state count."
2018.17-765,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3284.76,3287.36,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Ms. Ross."
2018.17-765,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,3287.36,3293.96,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I just want to make a few points."
2018.17-765,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3536.76,3537.72,"Sorry, Ms. Ross."
2018.17-765,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,3543.56,3546.0,Regular cars meaning no -- nobody's living there?
2018.17-765,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3546.0,3547.32,Nobody's living there. Nobody's doing that.
2018.17-765,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,3548.36,3558.76,"Yes, Your Honor, I think it would be difficult in light of this Court's cases, even though actually a large number of states covered those, I think it would be very difficult in light of Mathis and -- and Duenas-Alvarez and all the other cases in which this Court said --"
2018.17-765,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3558.76,3560.68,So -- so you're accepting that those are out?
2018.17-765,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,3560.68,3561.76,"Yes, Your Honor, you're right."
2018.17-765,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3561.76,3568.08,"And how about the -- the ones that say vehicles that are used for business activities, commercial activities, are those in or out?"
2018.17-765,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,3568.08,3570.32,"So, Your Honor, we haven't taken a position on that."
2018.17-765,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3583.68,3584.48,"Thank you, counsel."
