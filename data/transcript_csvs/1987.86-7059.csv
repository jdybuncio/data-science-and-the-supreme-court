1987.86-7059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We will hear arguments next in Number 86-7059, Tyrone Patterson against Illinois."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,39.541,74.881,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Tyrone Patterson, a 17-year-old youth, was kept in custody for 44 hours without confessing, without seeking to confess, until he was confronted by his indictment, and he asks this Court to apply the safeguards of Edwards versus Arizona and Michigan versus Jackson to protect his constitutional right to counsel, which was automatically applicable upon his indictment."
1987.86-7059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,144.744,152.398,"Do we know, counsel, in this case, what arrangements had been made for his arraignment after the indictment?"
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,152.398,153.666,--There is no indication--
1987.86-7059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,153.666,156.618,"He was indicted in the morning, I take it, on the 23rd."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,156.618,158.652,"--Yes, that's correct."
1987.86-7059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.41,200.629,Does the record say that an arraignment hearing had been scheduled?
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,200.629,203.514,No.
1987.86-7059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,203.514,216.574,"Mr. Honchell, I guess at bottom we are concerned with knowing whether the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to have counsel present for questioning."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,219.359,222.228,I don't believe that is the heart of this case.
1987.86-7059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,226.012,234.035,I would have thought our concern would be whether he had waived his right to have counsel present.
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,234.035,235.952,--The question once the Sixth Amendment--
1987.86-7059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,235.952,239.772,"A defendant can waive his right to have counsel present, can he not?"
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,239.772,240.422,--Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.356,254.449,And what information precisely do you think is needed beyond what this defendant was told in order to be able to make that decision?
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,254.449,261.786,The question before the Court is not the knowledge that any accused needs to waive Sixth Amendment rights.
1987.86-7059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,261.786,272.343,Did he need any information beyond what he was given in order to make a knowing and intelligent waiver?
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,272.343,289.955,"In protecting the Sixth Amendment right to counsel he should not have been approached with any information, including the Miranda warnings, and it would not be the proper protection for this Court to decide the amount of knowledge the accused should obtain for knowing an intelligent Sixth Amendment waiver."
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,336.52,340.655,Or affording any opportunity to try to waive?
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,340.655,341.755,Exactly.
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,349.927,352.445,Unless he asked for counsel.
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,352.445,353.029,Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,393.106,397.574,"Mr. Honchell, would you just indulge Justice O'Connor and me?"
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,422.126,435.183,"There has been a wide variety of opinion on the additional warnings beyond Miranda, the way in which they are provided."
1987.86-7059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.215,481.164,"But for the waiver in this incident, for the waiver that would make admissible these confessions, what additional information would he have had to know to make his waiver of counsel at those confessions conscious and intelligent?"
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,481.164,492.603,--The additional information is difficult to predict as a matter of abstract law.
1987.86-7059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,506.113,507.346,"He was told that, wasn't he?"
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,509.081,512.765,"--He was told... the word ""counsel"" was used."
1987.86-7059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.649,538.917,I must say I don't understand what you are saying.
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,554.26,557.878,--He had to meaningfully know he had a Sixth Amendment right to counsel present because--
1987.86-7059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,557.878,561.247,What is the difference between meaningfully knowing and knowing?
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,561.247,570.853,--Because the warning here used did not convey or express what counsel was intended to do for him after indictment.
1987.86-7059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,570.853,585.029,So then you say in answer presumably to Justice O'Connor's question and Justice Scalia's question he would have had to be told more about what counsel would do for him after indictment before he could intelligently waive?
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,585.029,589.766,That there is a right to counsel who would act on his behalf and represent him.
1987.86-7059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,589.766,596.67,"Well, don't you think this warning gave him the impression that there was a right to counsel who would act on his behalf and represent him?"
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,596.67,601.991,"No, there is nothing in this warning outside pure Miranda."
1987.86-7059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,604.443,605.176,"Well, okay."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,613.799,616.115,"That is a possible method, yes."
1987.86-7059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,616.115,620.302,"You think that would have made this case come out differently, in your view?"
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,620.302,645.001,"No, because in our view there should not have been any waiver sought through Miranda warnings or otherwise because once the accused is indicted the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is attached and we advocate the same protection that this Court created for indicted defendants or for defendants benefitting from Sixth Amendment in Jackson and defendants requesting counsel in the Fifth Amendment in Edwards."
1987.86-7059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,663.463,667.267,"Well, in Edwards we said there could be no interrogation when the defendant has said, I want counsel."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,667.267,667.867,Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,667.867,671.469,"But now here nothing equivalent to that happened, did it?"
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,671.469,676.288,"That's correct, but it is not necessary to ask for Sixth Amendment counsel to be protected by it."
1987.86-7059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,693.417,694.634,"Mr. Honchell, may I ask you--"
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,694.634,694.95,"--Yes, sir."
1987.86-7059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.95,696.036,--a question about the standard?
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,728.305,731.959,I don't really think there would be any significant difference.
1987.86-7059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.959,734.911,"Of course, there would be a very serious ethical difference between the two."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,734.911,735.277,Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,735.877,739.879,But in constitutional terms I suppose the cases would be precisely the same.
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,739.879,747.219,It would be precisely the same because the Sixth Amendment counsel arises merely upon being indicted.
1987.86-7059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,754.623,760.526,From the point of view of the defendant I suppose you would tell him the same thing in either situation and he could waive whether he really has a lawyer or not.
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,762.994,770.584,"The protection in either situation would be the same, and it is to bar any effort at getting a waiver, no matter what the warnings are."
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.471,807.273,Here is a police officer comes to tell him about the indictment.
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,814.446,821.433,There are advantages and disadvantages to using the indictment as a means of reaching the defendant.
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.433,835.543,"Well, the officer comes anyway and tells him about the indictment, and the defendant then says, by the way, I want to make a statement and I don't care to have a lawyer present."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,835.543,840.763,"That is a question of initiation, and we would resist that as a means--"
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.763,843.413,"Well, the officer came to him."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,843.413,845.232,--In this case he certainly came to him.
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,983.373,990.443,"Well, in the Fifth Amendment case, there is pre-charge interrogation, in custody?"
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,990.443,991.479,Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,991.479,995.681,"There is a right to a lawyer, isn't there, right then and there?"
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,995.681,996.814,Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.814,1000.417,"But it doesn't... it really has to be exercised, doesn't it?"
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1000.417,1004.869,"It has to be exercised to be protected, and the police can seek a waiver of it."
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.988,1006.271,Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1017.177,1018.296,Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1022.781,1027.335,When there is an indictment the right to counsel attaches.
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1027.335,1028.535,"Yes, under the Sixth Amendment."
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.535,1030.27,"Well, under the Sixth Amendment."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1030.27,1030.819,Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.819,1036.258,"But why shouldn't it have to be exercised, just like in the Fifth Amendment case?"
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1036.258,1059.789,"Because it is a much broader right designed for much greater purposes, and it has been the consistent policy of this Court because of its importance to the trial itself that it attach automatically upon indictment, that it extend to pre-trial proceedings because of the harm done to the accused if he surrenders the Sixth Amendment right to counsel."
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.789,1065.241,"Yes, but you have been analogizing this to the Edwards situation."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1065.241,1066.359,Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1066.359,1071.963,And... but of course in Edwards there was an exercise of the right to counsel.
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1071.963,1072.597,Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1072.597,1074.632,There was an exercise of it.
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1075.899,1076.815,Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.815,1080.952,And the indictment here means you have a Sixth Amendment right.
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1082.802,1090.908,"Because before this Court decided to protect a Fifth Amendment right to counsel, it required that it be exercised."
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.632,1107.02,"Well, Massiah and other cases like that, the lawyer was actually appointed."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1107.02,1107.72,--Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1107.72,1108.72,"Or hired, or something."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1108.72,1111.822,"Yes, that's true."
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.822,1117.292,"And if he had been arraigned, if he been arraigned and he says, I don't want a lawyer--"
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1117.292,1118.994,Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.994,1130.801,--would you still have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel that you couldn't... that you couldn't violate by going to him?
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1130.801,1152.297,"When the accused is represented by counsel, the police would be barred from seeking him unless he permits the police by contacting the authorities when he invokes the Fifth Amendment right to counsel, or in any application of the Sixth Amendment, because we maintain--"
1987.86-7059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1152.297,1156.849,"Well, but Justice White's question was what if he is told he has the Sixth Amendment right at arraignment."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1172.461,1198.176,"--In that proceeding I think I would indicate yes, he could be approached by the authorities, because by waiving his right to counsel at the arraignment in court, it would be an indication he need not have counsel, but I think if the accused is to be fully protected this Court must examine the extent to which he indicates his forfeiture of counsel."
1987.86-7059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1312.285,1314.003,Let me ask you one other question if I may.
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1334.484,1341.721,--The police should not be able to interrogate the accused if he is represented by a lawyer.
1987.86-7059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1341.721,1348.142,So you would say there should be greater protection if he has actually had a lawyer appointed for him than if he had not.
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1348.142,1349.41,It should be the equivalent protection.
1987.86-7059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1355.997,1368.621,"Yes, but see, in the case where a lawyer has been appointed, you seem to be conceding that it would be perfectly permissible for the police to have a situation arise in which the accused initiates some kind of a conversation like this."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1368.621,1368.938,Yes.
1987.86-7059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.938,1371.823,And they could go ahead and interrogate him without ever telling a lawyer.
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1371.823,1372.307,"Oh, no."
1987.86-7059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.606,1401.542,"The thing that puzzles me, and it kind of cuts both ways, is why the constitutional protection should change depending on the timing of the interrogation."
1987.86-7059,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1417.638,1420.856,I don't think the protection would change.
1987.86-7059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1507.512,1508.814,"Thank you, Mr. Honchell."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1514.885,1560.913,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Your Honors, the State of Illinois does agree that this case is about what effectuates a knowing and intelligent waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and on this issue we maintain that the Miranda warnings must be given their common sense meaning, that if they are given this meaning, that the four Miranda warnings which apprise a suspect of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination also by their content necessarily apprise him of his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel and form the basis on which he can make a knowing and intelligent waiver."
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1561.363,1564.032,May I ask you the same question I asked your opponent?
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1568.602,1579.494,"--If counsel is merely appointed by a court, Justice, and the defendant doesn't know about it, I think that plays no role in his... in the waiver."
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.494,1600.907,"So in other words, if there were a procedure in Illinois where the judge would, immediately upon the return of an indictment, appoint a lawyer for the man, but there is obviously going to be some delay before they get together, the police could nevertheless still take the indictment, go to the man, and tell him about the indictment, and have a conversation arise like this, and give nothing more than Miranda warnings, and that would be adequate protection?"
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1600.907,1603.192,I think it would be adequate in this regard.
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.465,1624.189,"So his rights, at least until he has talked to the lawyer and the lawyer has given him some additional advice, his rights after indictment and before indictment in this... in a custodial setting are precisely the same."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1624.189,1625.139,--There--
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1625.139,1629.677,"I mean, there is an additional provision of the Constitution to rely on, but as a practical matter they are exactly the same."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1629.677,1629.977,--That's right.
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.729,1640.116,"What about, say, a week after he had met with the lawyer, and so forth and so on, actually, then he knew that he had a lawyer."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1643.484,1646.202,If a defendant knew he had a lawyer?
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1646.202,1646.952,Yes.
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1646.952,1677.408,"Once the defendant knows he has a lawyer, and thereby somehow evinces a request for a lawyer, then I think the Edwards rule or the Michigan versus Jackson rule would kick in whereby the police could no longer initiate any kind of interrogation or anything like that, but just having counsel appointed by a court, and that knowledge is not known by the defendant, and he has made no assertion that he might want counsel on his own, I think that has no bearing on the validity of his waiver."
1987.86-7059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1677.408,1685.061,"Counsel, can the police delay the indictment... or the arraignment for a few hours in order to talk to him a little bit more?"
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1685.061,1688.529,Could they delay the arraignment?
1987.86-7059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1689.348,1696.952,"Yes, suppose he is indicted at 10:00 in the morning and the judge is available for arraignment any time."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1702.789,1711.395,"--I don't see any problem with that, Your Honor, so long as before the arraignment they give him his Miranda warnings, advise him, and he makes a knowing and intelligent choice."
1987.86-7059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1711.395,1713.831,There is no duty to arraign as promptly as possible?
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1713.831,1730.042,"Well, I know in Illinois the arraignment has to take place within seven days, and a further Edwards response to your questioning of Mr. Honchell, this record is lacking on exactly what... the arraignment procedure."
1987.86-7059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1740.814,1746.652,"Well, under the rule you propose there would be an incentive to delay arraignment, would there not?"
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1746.652,1754.491,In order to... the incentive being that they want to talk to the defendant before he ever talks to counsel or--
1987.86-7059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1754.491,1754.741,Yes.
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1754.741,1755.891,--counsel at arraignment?
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1770.584,1772.619,"Yes, but there is this difference, is there not?"
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1784.926,1792.264,"I think that is the kind of information that is sometimes described as, it might be helpful, it might not be helpful to the defendant, but that is not the question--"
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1792.264,1801.036,"--I mean, it might be helpful to the police in encouraging him to talk, that this is more serious than it appeared yesterday, because now a grand jury has returned an indictment--"
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1801.036,1807.174,"--That's true, too, but again, that is only knowledge that might be helpful to the police action or the defendant's decision."
1987.86-7059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.516,1823.885,"--Mr. Donatelli, I suppose we have been talking about whether counsel has been appointed."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1829.739,1830.605,That is my position.
1987.86-7059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1830.605,1843.232,"I mean, the mere fact that the court has named a counsel, that merely authorizes that individual to come to the defendant and say, will you have me represent you, but the court can't appoint a counsel really."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1843.232,1847.001,"I agree with that exactly, and that is certainly the point I was trying to make when I said that knowledge."
1987.86-7059,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1858.224,1870.866,"Well, Mr. Donatelli, as things actually work in Cook County, Illinois, would a court ordinarily appoint a counsel for a defendant when the defendant wasn't present at an arraignment?"
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1870.866,1873.818,"That would not happen, to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1929.905,1943.062,"May I ask as a matter of practice before indictment when the warnings are given and he knows all this about getting a lawyer, how often does Cook County actually provide a public defender for a person before he has been indicted?"
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1944.747,1946.366,How often does--
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1946.366,1953.77,"Yes, during a pre-indictment custodial interrogation the Miranda warning is given saying you are entitled to a lawyer and all this."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1957.655,1959.174,"--Your Honor, I don't know that--"
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1959.174,1963.709,"So that really... that warning is a little misleading, I think, pre-indictment, isn't it?"
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1968.311,1970.213,--At the time of pre-indictment?
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1970.213,1971.196,Yes.
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1973.248,1984.555,"That is probably true, and either... I think it might be held in a spot where there might be a PD around who could approach the defendant and ask him--"
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1984.555,1985.722,What is a PD?
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1985.722,1986.455,--A public defender.
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1986.455,1991.559,"There might be a public defender there, but the police actually go out and find one for him?"
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1992.459,1993.928,That I don't know.
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1993.928,1995.428,I don't think I've ever heard of--
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,1995.428,2007.588,"If it is in a setting where there might be one around, that could happen, but I would agree with Your Honor that usually it would be that the... just questioning would cease until he gets an attorney."
1987.86-7059,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2038.607,2055.485,--I take it when counsel is appointed the police are not told now let him alone until counsel has had a chance to talk with him and find out whether he is wanted to represent the accused?
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2055.485,2072.411,"--Once counsel is appointed at arraignment, Your Honor, I don't know that there is any mechanism whereby the police are told that they can no longer interrogate him now at their own initiation, but of course Michigan versus Jackson from this Court would tell them that, would tell the police that."
1987.86-7059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.411,2078.165,"Well, suppose counsel has been appointed and counsel has conferred with him and the police know that."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2081.552,2089.906,"I think under the... the rule set out in Edwards and Michigan versus Jackson is that no, the police cannot initiate an interrogation--"
1987.86-7059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2089.906,2090.408,--Exactly.
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2090.408,2096.329,--once he has evinced a desire to proceed with counsel at all encounters with the police.
1987.86-7059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.462,2099.948,"Of course, we don't need to decide that issue here."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2099.948,2102.049,--That is exactly right.
1987.86-7059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2104.732,2114.607,I take it at arraignment the judge has the obligation to give a more full explanation of rights than just a Miranda warning.
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2120.594,2126.665,"--I think so, certainly, Your Honor, if that is enough to tell a defendant about his right in one setting--"
1987.86-7059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2126.665,2128.481,"Well, he gives the Miranda warning off the card."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2130.483,2138.053,"--I think if that... yes, because that gives him the basis on which he can fully comprehend and know and intelligently waive his right."
1987.86-7059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2138.053,2144.891,You think arraignment proceedings are no more extensive than just reading Miranda rights?
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2144.891,2165.906,"I think practically speaking you are right, it would involve more than that, but I don't think that the way the judge would inform the defendant of his right to assistance of counsel and asking him if he wants counsel appointed, I don't think he would read the Miranda warnings from him, but I am saying their content... in other words, the judge, I think, would give him the equivalent content, but not by reading those warnings off the card."
1987.86-7059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2167.722,2170.274,"Well, you are really then waiving counsel for trial."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2171.541,2172.576,At arraignment?
1987.86-7059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2181.582,2182.466,Yes.
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2182.466,2184.418,That clarification is very important.
1987.86-7059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2191.122,2191.622,Yes.
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2199.393,2216.339,"I don't think that is any problem, Your Honor, and the reason is, is that our criminal justice system has a goal of having the most accurate and reliable convictions."
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2227.897,2237.668,"And I suppose you would think it would be proper for the prosecutor, not just the police, to go in and tell the defendant about the indictment and let him have a chat with the defendant."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2240.304,2240.82,Yes.
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2240.82,2248.643,"Let the lawyer do it, because he is probably professionally better trained even than the police, and he is probably better able to get to the bottom of the true facts."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2248.643,2250.36,I would agree with that.
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.36,2255.13,"That would be an approved procedure, to have the lawyer go to his adversary without counsel and talk with him."
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2255.13,2260.249,"So long as there has been no request for counsel, yes, Your Honor, I would agree with that."
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2260.249,2262.968,I suppose the police can always try to play games with this.
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2272.841,2275.293,That is exactly true.
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2283.464,2284.98,In order to be able to talk to him.
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2284.98,2288.499,--before he has accepted counsel or requested counsel.
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2292.403,2295.688,Isn't there some limit on the period time they can hold a man in custody without charging him?
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2295.688,2296.888,"--Well, certainly there is that."
1987.86-7059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2296.888,2298.474,They can't just delay indefinitely.
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2298.474,2300.14,"That is exactly right, of course."
1987.86-7059,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2300.14,2304.793,"And I think you said earlier arraignment has to be, what, within seven days?"
1987.86-7059,1,29851,jack_donatelli,,2304.793,2305.277,In Illinois.
1987.86-7059,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2538.378,2539.728,"Thank you, Mr. Donatelli."
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2554.404,2569.247,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we take as our starting point in ascertaining whether the Miranda warning supplied petitioner with the information that he needed for a knowing waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the pre-trial interrogation."
1987.86-7059,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2628.269,2633.59,What is the Sixth Amendment right to counsel?
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2636.558,2643.029,"--Well, the Court has held that it is a right that attaches on indictment and that applies in various critical pretrial proceedings."
1987.86-7059,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2643.029,2646.683,"Well, I know, but it is a right to have counsel at trial, isn't it?"
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2646.683,2652.086,"Well, at trial and at... the Court has held it also encompasses various pretrial--"
1987.86-7059,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2652.086,2657.055,"Well, are you suggesting that the waiver that was given here waived his right to counsel at trial?"
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2657.055,2658.573,"--No, we think that all it waived was--"
1987.86-7059,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.573,2659.557,What did it waive?
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2659.557,2663.442,--It waived his right to counsel at the interrogation that was about to take place.
1987.86-7059,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2663.442,2668.846,And it didn't waive anything else?
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2668.846,2671.298,"No, it was limited--"
1987.86-7059,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2671.298,2672.833,It's a waiver but it isn't?
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2672.833,2676.702,"--Well, it is a waiver of the right to counsel at this pretrial proceeding."
1987.86-7059,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.725,2690.794,Why isn't this good to waive counsel at trial?
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2690.794,2696.782,"--Well, we don't think it conveyed to him the knowledge of what the assistance of counsel embodies at trial."
1987.86-7059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2719.898,2722.098,"More important, he wasn't asked to waive counsel at trial here."
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2726.135,2731.955,"Well, as I tried to indicate before, I think you are right, Justice Scalia, that it was clear that this was just a limited--"
1987.86-7059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2731.955,2740.894,"Supposing this had been a lineup after post-indictment lineup, and he gave similar warnings, said, you don't have to have your lawyer there, we would like to have the lineup right away."
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2751.167,2753.885,"--Well, we think these warnings wouldn't be adequate because they refer to--"
1987.86-7059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2753.885,2761.725,"Just change them, say we are about to have a lineup and so forth, and we want you to know you have a right to have your lawyer there, would you like to go ahead without it?"
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2762.391,2764.843,"--Yes, we think that that would be sufficient."
1987.86-7059,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2764.843,2767.129,"Without giving notice to the lawyer, that would be perfectly all right?"
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2767.129,2767.429,Right.
1987.86-7059,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2780.402,2795.696,"Well, Mr. Pincus, even if a lawyer has been appointed, you think there is no obligation whatever on the part of the police to let the lawyer know they are going to be approaching the defendant with a request for waiver of presence during the lineup?"
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2795.696,2802.116,"--Well, I assumed the question was that the lawyer had not been appointed, and an arraignment or some other--"
1987.86-7059,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2802.116,2803.616,"No, the lawyer has been appointed."
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2804.616,2807.401,--But not as the result of any request by the defendant.
1987.86-7059,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2807.401,2809.203,"Well, he accepted the lawyer--"
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2809.203,2810.086,If it is the result--
1987.86-7059,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2810.086,2814.174,--but then as the proceeding... critical stage number 2 is a lineup.
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2824.529,2826.647,--I think I misunderstood your-question Justice Stevens.
1987.86-7059,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2841.591,2843.241,Supposing the conversation develops this way.
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2865.356,2872.026,"--Well, I think the question there would be whether there had been an initiation, whether who had... who had approached whom, and I think--"
1987.86-7059,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2872.026,2873.712,I am saying they initiated precisely as it is here.
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2878.364,2886.87,"--Well, the difference... well, the difference with this case is that in the hypothetical the defendant had asserted his right to counsel, so then there is a question of who initiated the interrogation."
1987.86-7059,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2908.033,2919.257,"Well, supposing they tell him, look, we, can either go ahead with the lineup right now, because we've got these people here, or we can tell your lawyer about it and arrange it at a time that is convenient for him, what do you want to do, and he says, I will go ahead without."
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2921.193,2923.978,"Well, again, Your Honor, that is not this case."
1987.86-7059,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2923.978,2926.18,Is there any constitutional objection to their doing that without telling his lawyer?
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2926.18,2929.799,"Well, I think the question would be who initiated the inquiry, and--"
1987.86-7059,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2929.799,2931.232,"Well, I have given you the facts."
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2933.684,2942.19,"--Well, Your Honor, again, it is not the facts of this case, because in that case the defendant has already, as in Michigan against Jackson, asserted that he wants to proceed with counsel."
1987.86-7059,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2946.76,2947.243,Maybe the man never said a word at all.
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2949.61,2955.782,"Well, he evidenced that he wanted to proceed with counsel in that way, by adopting that lawyer as his lawyer."
1987.86-7059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2960.251,2963.686,--So this case would be different if there had been an arraignment?
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2969.673,2971.773,--If there had been an arraignment and he had requested counsel or--
1987.86-7059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2971.773,2974.875,He had accepted counsel appointed during the arraignment.
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2974.875,2977.16,"--Yes, then it would be controlled by Michigan against Jackson."
1987.86-7059,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3021.289,3033.763,"Well, Mr. Pincus, what about this point of possible manipulation of arraignment time to allow more room for the police to approach the defendant if we were to adopt your rule?"
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3033.763,3047.57,"Well, Your Honor, the prosecution controls both for the time of indictment and for the time of arraignment, so we don't think that really it's going to make... moving the time back to indictment will just introduce, as Justice Scalia pointed out, the possibility that the indictment could be pushed back."
1987.86-7059,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3063.299,3073.405,"But if we do rule for you, do you think it is justifiable to delay arraignment in the hopes that a Miranda warning will elicit this kind of confession?"
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3073.405,3081.76,"--Well, Your Honor, we don't think that the Miranda warning elicits the confession, but I think that the prosecutor could delay the time of arraignment, but it doesn't change--"
1987.86-7059,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3081.76,3085.879,And do you think that is desirable and sound policy?
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3085.879,3087.914,"--Well, I think it depends upon the particular case."
1987.86-7059,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3104.776,3107.276,"Yes, but the fact is different when he... it is warnings plus indictment in this situation."
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3111.68,3116.132,"--Well, we don't think he has to be told that he was indicted in order for there to be a valid waiver."
1987.86-7059,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3146.686,3154.423,The defendant in a prison can stop interrogation?
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3154.423,3155.625,He can--
1987.86-7059,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3155.625,3156.759,Can he?
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3156.759,3162.379,"--Your Honor, that is what... he may not be able to physically stop it, but he can prevent--"
1987.86-7059,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3162.379,3163.346,That is what I... that is what I thought.
1987.86-7059,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3163.346,3168.182,"--the... any statements from being introduced against him, so he can protect himself effectively."
1987.86-7059,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3170.218,3171.484,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."

1987.86-7059,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3236.944,3242.648,"If those are problems, I mean, if that length of time is a problem, that is surely a separate one."
1987.86-7059,3,20951,donald_s_honchell,,3254.087,3268.929,"--What we do have to protect the defendant is that after he is indicted, he is not to be approached by the authorities when they want to use the indictment to get a statement from him."
1987.86-7059,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3313.042,3315.558,"He has a right to counsel before the indictment, of course, too, right?"
1987.86-7059,3,20951,donald_s_honchell,,3315.558,3324.731,"Yes, but that can be overcome when the police approach him and want to discuss the case with him."
1987.86-7059,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3354.666,3357.285,Fifth Amendment right is not established in the Constitution?
1987.86-7059,3,20951,donald_s_honchell,,3357.285,3359.152,Not the Fifth Amendment right to counsel.
1987.86-7059,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3366.641,3367.691,We just sort of made that up.
1987.86-7059,3,20951,donald_s_honchell,,3369.343,3384.186,"There is no constitutional right in the Fifth Amendment to counsel, but Miranda said we are going to apply a right to counsel to protect against self-incrimination, and we are going to allow it to be waived when the police want to use this procedure of warnings."
1987.86-7059,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3491.122,3504.799,"What if at the arraignment the judge says, you have the right to counsel, and tells him all about it, now, if you want counsel, speak up, and he doesn't say a word."
1987.86-7059,3,20951,donald_s_honchell,,3508.25,3510.633,No.
1987.86-7059,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3513.066,3515.851,So you have to exercise your Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
1987.86-7059,3,20951,donald_s_honchell,,3515.851,3516.335,No--
1987.86-7059,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3516.335,3523.441,"There you are at arraignment, here this right is attached, and if you want counsel, you have to exercise it, you have to ask for it."
1987.86-7059,3,20951,donald_s_honchell,,3523.441,3525.476,--You would indeed have the right to counsel.
1987.86-7059,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3527.659,3530.845,Can you get a Faretta waiver in Illinois by just being silent?
1987.86-7059,3,20951,donald_s_honchell,,3535.181,3539.116,At arraignment I don't know if a counsel would be appointed.
1987.86-7059,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3539.116,3540.0,How do you stand--
1987.86-7059,3,20951,donald_s_honchell,,3540.0,3540.985,At the trial he would be appointed.
1987.86-7059,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3540.985,3544.437,--How do you stand moot in Illinois?
1987.86-7059,3,20951,donald_s_honchell,,3546.889,3547.739,Yes.
1987.86-7059,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3547.739,3549.772,And the judge appoints a lawyer.
1987.86-7059,3,20951,donald_s_honchell,,3549.772,3550.457,Yes.
1987.86-7059,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3550.457,3551.741,Isn't that right?
1987.86-7059,3,20951,donald_s_honchell,,3551.741,3554.709,I assume for purposes of the arraignment yes.
1987.86-7059,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3556.578,3559.613,For purposes of the whole proceeding unless there is a Faretta type waiver.
1987.86-7059,3,20951,donald_s_honchell,,3559.613,3559.98,--Yes.
1987.86-7059,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3559.98,3560.947,Isn't that true?
1987.86-7059,3,20951,donald_s_honchell,,3560.947,3562.482,Yes.
1987.86-7059,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3569.319,3570.353,"Thank you, Mr. Honchell."
