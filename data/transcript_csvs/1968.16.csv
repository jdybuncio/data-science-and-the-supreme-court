1968.16,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,45.904,"Number 16, Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen et. al., appellants versus Chicago, Rock Islands and Pacific Railroad Company et.al."
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,62.001,65.426,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.16,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,684.491,700.668,"Mr. Youngdahl, I gather your position is that whatever maybe the merits and all of these arguments or the bearing of these facts upon the question, it's nothing for courts to be concerned with that the Arkansas legislature is (Inaudible), is that it?"
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,700.668,706.135,"Yes Your Honor, that's the most important aspect of our argument."
1968.16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,706.135,709.365,That is your argument with respect to the due process claim.
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,709.365,713.066,That is also our argument with respect to the burden on commerce.
1968.16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,713.066,720.343,"Well, it's not for the Arkansas legislation that it's determined, how much to -- in its unbridled discretion, how much to burden the interstate commerce, is it?"
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,720.343,722.612,"That is certainly true, Your Honor."
1968.16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,785.612,789.166,What were the other claims that you have to meet?
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,789.166,790.27,Equal protection and --
1968.16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,790.27,791.141,And discrimination against (Voice Overlap).
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,791.141,793.214,Yes Your Honor.
1968.16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,847.927,852.914,(Voice Overlap) what happened to the Equal Protection Clause since 1916.
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,852.914,859.308,"Well, that is true Your Honor, but a good deal has not happened in our view to Arkansas railroading with respect to that kind of fact."
1968.16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,859.308,866.887,"Well, what is this -- what's the length of the total line have to do with safety as in individual crossing?"
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,866.887,871.274,"Well, we can think of several things, the record shows the following kind of fact."
1968.16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,945.504,953.182,"This -- these exemptions are what -- to refresh my recollection, 50 miles and also domestic corporations, is that it?"
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,953.182,957.159,"No Your Honor, something of a sort, purely 50 miles and 100 miles."
1968.16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,963.657,967.986,"That could also be called as opposed as an equal protection argument, as well."
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,967.986,971.982,Either way it's in classification is infirmed in some way.
1968.16,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1022.913,1031.435,Did the New York -- did the recent New York decision deal with classifications like that?
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,1033.749,1049.79,"Yes Your Honor and the long opinion in the case of the opinion of Supreme Court, the trial court, which is a very careful discussion of that to deal in detail with it, I do not recall whether or not the Court of Appeals refer to that particular thing or not."
1968.16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1725.664,1733.759,Do you think there's any different in this respect between the freight crew law in the switching crew law?
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,1736.476,1736.918,Yes Your Honor.
1968.16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1743.843,1748.829,But how about the -- does this pass the same argument?
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,1748.829,1751.621,"As far as -- as far as any legal standard, I don't see a difference at all."
1968.16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1780.912,1787.793,"Yes, but there is a factual argument with in terms of discrimination against interstate commerce."
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,1787.793,1803.791,"Well, there is the -- that difference and that that applies only to the freight crew law, I presume or the burden on commerce argument would apply only to the freight crew law, because the switching crews are not an interstate kind of situation."
1968.16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.791,1812.79,"Well, then why isn't there is discrimination against interstate commerce and the switching crew law?"
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,1817.577,1818.659,That's correct.
1968.16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1818.659,1821.606,And yet you say it's a local operation.
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,1821.606,1822.815,"Well, that's correct, but --"
1968.16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.815,1826.784,"Well then, why wouldn't it apply to local trains then?"
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,1832.477,1838.303,"Well, there is no evidence in the record."
1968.16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.671,1857.437,"They do, don't they?"
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,1857.437,1859.315,That is correct.
1968.16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.048,1886.213,"I know, but 100-mile in some other -- but the local railroads, the intrastate railroads, less than 50-mile railroads don't have to comply with the switching crew, do they?"
1968.16,0,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,1886.213,1887.799,That is correct.
1968.16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1887.799,1889.024,Why don't they?
1968.16,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1968.875,1973.802,Mr. Light.
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1980.878,1984.519,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court."
1968.16,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2142.435,2146.097,How many -- how many states have laws like this?
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2149.044,2152.984,"I understand it, five Your Honor, I believe"
1968.16,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2152.984,2153.852,New York.
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2153.852,2162.539,"New York and Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Arkansas."
1968.16,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2162.539,2164.423,"And each is a little different, I suppose."
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2164.423,2165.34,Yes sir.
1968.16,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2167.842,2174.975,Does Arkansas have a crew concess law relating to passenger trains?
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2174.975,2176.278,No sir.
1968.16,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2180.379,2182.462,"But it's apparently, it's not an issue here?"
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2182.462,2184.335,"No, it is not an issue."
1968.16,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2184.335,2186.718,Maybe you don't have fast trains anymore.
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2186.718,2189.861,"We have very few, very few."
1968.16,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2335.879,2339.436,You mean unlike the other two.
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2339.436,2348.076,"No sir, just in case that the same newspapers had been circulated up here as were circulated down home."
1968.16,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2357.493,2359.035,Mr. Light.
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2359.035,2363.015,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.16,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2917.955,2935.932,"I thought that the counsel said that many of the accidents were caused by collision, an increased number of collisions and that the collisions were caused by the lack of observation because there were fewer men in the cab."
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2935.932,2939.457,That's the contention of the other side Your Honor.
1968.16,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2943.369,2948.617,"Is it untrue, the fact that there were collision accidents."
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2948.617,2955.871,"As I indicated Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Lucente is going to discuss the statistical evidence as I understand the statistical evidence --"
1968.16,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2955.871,2967.363,"Well, but you just made the statement that they couldn't show anything and I just want to ask you if it was a fact that the collision accidents had risen?"
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2967.363,2988.859,"As I understand and I'm going to, if the Court permits, make an abbreviated answer to that question because just to say this is a part of Mr. Lucente's presentation, the statistical evidence in the case that there has been a increase in the number of reportable collisions."
1968.16,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3049.423,3053.991,They'd hold it unconstitutional under what operation of the Constitution?
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3053.991,3055.804,I take it under the Due Process Clause.
1968.16,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3055.804,3059.662,Or was it the state Constitution they were talking about?
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3059.662,3086.554,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I don't recall whether they specified, the entire Court, the only issue upon which the entire seven justices of the New York Court of Appeals were agreed, is that it had to be tested as safety legislation, and if it didn't pass most of their, it failed because it could not constitutionally be justified as an economic measure or a measure to a just employment relationships."
1968.16,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3086.554,3091.13,"That could of course, had been a matter of state constitutional law?"
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3091.13,3096.299,That's possible and I do not recall whether the Court was explicit about which Constitution.
1968.16,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3253.886,3265.2,"Has there been a discernable trend, one way or the other legislatively, either toward the enactment of (Voice Overlap)."
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3265.2,3272.515,"There's been a clear trend, which is acknowledged by my adversaries in their brief toward the repeal of such legislation."
1968.16,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3297.538,3307.348,"Didn't -- this is not really much our point, but haven't I read that New York is talking about the repealing its statute?"
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3307.348,3311.865,"Justice Stewart, the New York had three crew concess statutes."
1968.16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3838.097,3845.095,"That one state can a make different judgment as to what risks it's willing to put up with, couldn't it?"
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3845.095,3854.731,"There's no doubt about it, if the judgment is rationally related to do the purported purpose of its regulation, Your Honor."
1968.16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3854.731,3863.722,But I suppose the yard -- I suppose the same rituals can that take place if it still upholds the Arkansas law.
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3867.064,3880.499,"It just illustrates, Your Honor, that the train safely moves from Coffeyville to Greenwood Junction in charge of four men, and the other two men mounted and rendered no service for six miles."
1968.16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3881.026,3882.888,(Voice Overlap) that so.
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3882.888,3883.83,Yes sir.
1968.16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3895.112,3899.903,Can I just ask you if the court below make findings on discrimination?
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3899.903,3900.866,It did not Your Honor.
1968.16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3903.054,3904.265,It didn't reach that issue?
1968.16,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3904.265,3905.336,That's right.
1968.16,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3911.783,3913.323,Mr. Lucente.
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,3913.323,3917.74,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3943.993,3945.209,All right.
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,3945.209,3949.413,"Under safety issue, the District Court made several critical findings."
1968.16,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4146.439,4155.475,You don't make any claim at the -- that the fewer men on a crew makes for a safer operation.
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4155.475,4156.528,"No, we do not Your Honor."
1968.16,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4166.575,4167.854,"But you don't say, you're not safer?"
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4167.854,4168.781,"No, we do not make --"
1968.16,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4168.781,4174.184,Because that kind of a claim could be and apparently was made in the Arizona case.
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4190.572,4195.239,"No, we don't have that argument here, Your Honor."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4350.98,4351.884,Casualities?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4351.884,4353.183,"Casualities, the injuries to burden."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4353.183,4355.942,How about the accidents?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4355.942,4362.877,"Yes, accidents Your Honor are comprehended under the Interstate Commerce Commission term of train accidents."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4420.294,4442.36,"Might not that be fortuitous, just the fact that you didn't have to happen to have any very large accidents that killed a great number of people and might not that be -- might not that also be to the fact the railroads have taken off most of their passenger trains, where people might be killed?"
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4442.36,4462.36,"The evidence, Your Honor, shows that the reason for this increase in reportable train accidents is primarily the fact that the standard is stated in terms of damage to equipment and that one of the features involved in determining the damage to equipment is the amount of cost involved in repairing the equipment."
1968.16,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4506.428,4511.671,Don't you -- couldn't that be a direct reflection of the fact that there are fewer people in the crew?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4520.167,4529.875,"That could account for some of them Your Honor, but the fact is that only a very small number of train accidents have a potential for casualties."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4591.118,4601.453,"I suppose you would agree that every collision carries with it, the possibility of the casualty, wouldn't you?"
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4601.453,4602.286,"No, I would not Your Honor."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4603.731,4606.113,It's just been unlikely nowadays.
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4606.113,4619.395,The collisions that we are referring to here Your Honor are not primarily collisions between two trains moving in same direction or even between two trains moving -- I mean in opposite direction or two trains moving in the same direction.
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4660.896,4669.838,"I suppose when the car went over an embankment, it might be of casualty so far as some of the employees are concerned, wouldn't it?"
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4669.838,4673.029,"It might be, yes sir, if there were employees in that area."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4673.029,4674.364,Wouldn't it be?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4674.364,4676.109,"Yes, if there were employees in that area --"
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4676.109,4681.228,"Well, wouldn't there be employees on the train if one of them went over the embankment?"
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4681.228,4686.751,"Not the switching cars to which I'm referring, you're referring to a train operating over the line which goes over an embankment."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4686.751,4687.583,Yes.
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4687.583,4691.297,The employees are in the caboose and on the head in.
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4698.451,4700.067,Does that mean they wouldn't be hurt?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4700.067,4714.291,"They might be hurt in the caboose from a sudden stop, but the likelihood of any injury in the locomotive would be fairly remote, with a 150 car train where one of the middle cars derails and goes over the embankment."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4714.291,4718.39,You don't think that would endanger anybody who happen to be in the caboose?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4718.39,4724.469,"If there would be a sudden stop in the caboose and unless the men weren't properly braced, there might be an injury."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4728.704,4733.197,"(Voice Overlap) to the embankment in order to have a casualty, would it?"
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4733.197,4737.902,"It might, that is correct Your Honor, there could be a casualty from that type of an accident."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4737.902,4754.145,"It seems to me we've had recent cases in this Court or eight cases, I believe, where someone sitting in the caboose for a -- in times of a very slight accident up above was hurt very severely."
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4754.145,4764.368,It is possible for that type of casualty to occur when a caboose -- when a train stops suddenly and the occupants of the caboose are not braced and they bounced around in the caboose that does happen.
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4779.227,4796.988,Would you -- would you say from just as a matter of common sense that an increase made number of collisions was not a safety factor but it could be seriously considered in the matter of this kind?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4796.988,4798.236,I would not say that Your Honor.
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4823.974,4838.795,"Well, is there anything in the reportability of accidents that would effect the collision part of your argument, as to whether there might be casualties or not?"
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4838.795,4847.567,"No, the standard to which I refer is $750.00 standard does not relate directly to casualty potential of the collision."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4847.567,4865.897,"But I understood counsel to say that in Arkansas or in other states, there was a much greater increase in collisions during a given period recently than in Arkansas."
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4865.897,4871.345,"I do not understand, I don't believe there is data there where it shows collisions by states."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4871.931,4880.256,"Not by states by the rest of the country, the rest of the country was considerably higher than in Arkansas."
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4880.256,4881.53,The data with respect to that --
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4881.53,4882.424,Is that true?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4882.424,4893.527,"No, the data that I'm familiar with in the record does not permit a comparison between Arkansas and the rest of the country in so far as collisions are concerned."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4903.642,4910.651,"We couldn't assume, could we, that if it were related to all accidents, some of them didn't relate to collisions?"
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4910.651,4912.801,"Yes, that is correct Your Honor."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4975.169,4976.513,That's yard service not --
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4976.513,4980.217,"That's freight and yard service, includes both of them Your Honor."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4980.217,4981.201,We'll recess.
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,4981.201,4984.317,Thank you Your Honor.
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5103.229,5110.72,Was there any question in there about the engineers getting more money if they didn't have a fireman?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5110.72,5120.23,"Under agreements made with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, there have been wage increases, which were applicable to operations without firemen."
1968.16,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5139.086,5156.677,"May I ask you this one question, what if the Court didn't reach to (Inaudible), have you lost the case there?"
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5156.677,5167.687,"I take it under the authorities, Your Honor, that we do have the burden of showing that the safety benefits if any arising from the statute are --"
1968.16,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5167.687,5183.866,"So, about the (Inaudible), do you still ask that the -- if we disagree with your path, do we then have to base the discrimination purpose?"
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5183.866,5186.485,I think the discrimination and equal protection argument --
1968.16,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5186.485,5189.577,(Inaudible) will make it discriminatory.
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5189.577,5195.321,"Yes, the discrimination and equal protection arguments might still be valid despite the finding with respect to safety."
1968.16,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5195.321,5196.94,Lower court did not have such --
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5196.94,5203.366,"That's right Your Honor, the lower court did not pass on any of those two points."
1968.16,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5203.366,5216.846,You don't think that the -- do you think that the very factors which would show that these laws are related to safety would also show that there's a difference between 50-mile trains and longer trains?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5216.846,5219.04,"Now, the statutes in question Your Honor --"
1968.16,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5219.04,5220.295,Roads not trains.
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5220.295,5232.82,The statutes in question Your Honor apply with respect to length of road in the state and switching operations for large railroad can be precisely the same as switching operations for a small railroad.
1968.16,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5232.82,5239.478,Unless your opponents are right in saying that the longer roads have longer trains.
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5239.478,5246.493,"But in switching operations, Your Honor, the longer trains would not affect the movements of cars within the switching yard."
1968.16,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5258.439,5259.541,What about the freight?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5263.3,5292.902,"The freight operations -- the question of whether the length of line means anything with respect to size of crew Your Honor is answered I believe in the evidence by the fact that the arbitration award of Board Number 282 laid down a series of guidelines, which provided considerations to be taken into account by special boards in determining what the size of the crew should be on particular runs or assignments."
1968.16,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5292.902,5300.323,This is the same kind of an argument that goes to whether or not these laws are related to safety at all or not.
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5300.323,5304.013,"The argument does depend ultimately on that, yes."
1968.16,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5304.013,5316.478,"And so, if the laws are not related -- are related to safety, you would also lose your discrimination argument, at least in the freight area?"
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5316.478,5328.296,If the -- I believe though there is still a valid inquiry as to whether the 100-mile limit and the 50-mile limit is a differentiating circumstances as far safety is concerned.
1968.16,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5328.296,5329.62,Even in the freight area?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5329.62,5330.69,Even in the freight area.
1968.16,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5330.69,5334.007,Even though it has (Inaudible) on the road?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5334.007,5341.282,"Over the road, a 100-mile railroad might hold a 150 car train, which is then interchanges with --"
1968.16,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5341.282,5346.033,"Well, you think the record is such that we can decide that issue here or what we remanded if we don't agree on you --"
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5346.033,5349.1,The record does contain a great deal of evidence of the operation --
1968.16,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5349.1,5349.866,It does?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5349.866,5351.033,"It does, yes Your Honor."
1968.16,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5351.033,5352.507,"We don't have any findings, now do we?"
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5352.507,5358.563,"There are no findings on that point, but there is a great deal of evidence on the record on the operations of the smaller railroads."
1968.16,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5358.563,5361.498,"Well, ordinarily we don't make findings of that kind, I guess."
1968.16,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5364.381,5377.786,Would you say there's enough evidence -- would you say that we should -- if we -- I suppose you would object just to our even doing it if we did it and ruled against you.
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5377.786,5378.476,Yes.
1968.16,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5378.476,5384.091,I mean even that you -- would you -- what would be your position if we should remand this case or not?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5384.091,5400.506,"If the question turns on equal protection commerce and the discrimination against commerce points, I believe perhaps it should be remanded to the lower court for taking further evidence and for findings on those issues."
1968.16,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5400.506,5402.482,Was there no evidence taken under that issue?
1968.16,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,5402.482,5407.593,"There was evidence taken on it Your Honor, we put in a considerable amount of evidence on that point."
1968.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5431.612,5433.859,Mr. Youngdahl.
1968.16,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,5433.859,5440.883,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.16,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5458.19,5469.739,"Well, what's the matter of trying it again or weren't these issues involve -- weren't the issues made up -- the issues which were made up in the trial court included discrimination and equal protection?"
1968.16,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,5469.739,5470.906,Certainly that is correct.
1968.16,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5470.906,5473.938,And so the case was tried with those issues in it?
1968.16,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,5473.938,5474.387,"Certainly, that is correct."
1968.16,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5474.387,5476.56,The record was made close.
1968.16,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,5476.56,5477.934,Yes.
1968.16,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5477.934,5479.884,Which is the question of findings?
1968.16,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,5479.884,5491.108,"Well, I understand Your Honor that the compelling principle in a constitutional challenge is that the plaintiffs had a burden of showing that the laws is unconstitutional."
1968.16,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5508.444,5516.614,"That maybe -- some cases that may have said that in equal protection area, but you think they've said that in the commerce area?"
1968.16,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,5516.614,5518.782,"Well, I don't understand commerce to be involved in a particular --"
1968.16,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5518.782,5521.577,Or the discrimination against interest commerce?
1968.16,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,5521.577,5538.805,"Well, Your Honor, as to discriminate against interstate commerce, our primary answer would be that the two groups are not all contiguous well-formed interstate covered, intrastate not covered, to the contrary without going into detail at this time."
1968.16,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5627.154,5629.484,Are copies of that opinion available?
1968.16,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,5629.484,5632.814,"We would be glad to make them available Your Honor, it was just issues about two weeks ago."
1968.16,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5632.814,5633.373,Will you do that please?
1968.16,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,5633.373,5637.408,"I will, yes Your Honor, thank you."
1968.16,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5660.023,5662.455,I don't understand that --
1968.16,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,5662.455,5663.897,I don't understand --
1968.16,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5663.897,5666.146,What business do you suggest?
1968.16,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,5666.146,5675.474,"I don't understand why, if they contend that it's just as safe not to have a fireman, and not just a safe on a passenger train as it is on a freight train."
1968.16,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5714.403,5717.173,What page was that in the appendix?
1968.16,3,33709,james_e_youngdahl,,5717.173,5722.678,"In the appendix it was pages 419 to 500, a testimony of Mr. Homer."
