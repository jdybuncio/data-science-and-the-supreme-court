1992.91-8685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.959,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-8685, Terry Lynn Stinson v. The United States."
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,13.51,16.452,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-8685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.738,191.207,"Well, Mr. Kent, I understand the Government to essentially agree that a commentary that plausibly interprets the Guideline is binding on the sentencing court."
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,191.207,192.365,"Yes, ma'am."
1992.91-8685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.365,200.062,And to agree to with you that a court's failure to follow such a commentary would be an incorrect application of the Guidelines.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,200.062,200.811,That is--
1992.91-8685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.811,213.571,"But I think the Government then says, however, here any... this commentary should not be applied retroactively in these circumstances."
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,215.754,216.385,"--Yes, ma'am."
1992.91-8685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.385,221.608,Is that question presented and... and should we decide it here?
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,221.608,223.158,"Yes, this Court should decide."
1992.91-8685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,223.158,225.011,The court below didn't address it.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,225.011,231.005,"No, it did not, but the question is necessarily subsumed in the question that has been accepted for cert by this Court."
1992.91-8685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.229,243.16,So this case may turn on the retroactivity question.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,243.16,243.931,"Yes, Justice."
1992.91-8685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.809,277.824,"That may well be, but... but Congress can enact a piece of legislation which it calls clarifying legislation and we will not apply that retroactively."
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,293.774,302.71,"Justice Scalia, if the... if the Sentencing Commission's characterization was plainly inconsistent with the act that it took, then this Court would not be bound by it."
1992.91-8685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.136,346.669,"But it seems to me, Mr. Kent, that what this so-called clarifying commentary describes is that it clarifies the new and now current sentencing regime for felons in possession."
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,379.5,382.752,"Justice O'Connor, I have two responses to that."
1992.91-8685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,382.752,383.503,Okay.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,383.503,388.456,"First, the Sentencing Commission has twice described this commentary as clarifying."
1992.91-8685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,392.189,393.74,"Yes, but what does it clarify?"
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,400.073,409.059,"--Justice O'Connor, it's our position that this clarification is drawn out from the definition that went into effect in November of 1989."
1992.91-8685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,466.107,471.611,"Did that... I'm sorry, finish."
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,472.663,473.033,If I may.
1992.91-8685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,525.766,532.669,"Well, I thought there was a statute that tells the district courts to apply policy statements in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced."
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,540.176,553.814,"Well, I think that the Government... if Justice O'Connor is referring to the Government's argument that 3553... title 18, 3553 requires a sentencing court to apply the Sentencing Guidelines in effect--"
1992.91-8685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,553.814,554.805,Policy statements.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,554.805,572.927,"--In policy statements in effect on the date of sentencing, it reads too much into that statute to say that that governs a court of appeals' application of post-sentencing clarifying commentary or policy statements, reads too much into the statute."
1992.91-8685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,593.891,601.044,Can one tell immediately the difference between clarifying and nonclarifying commentary?
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,601.044,604.597,"Well, judicial review of course."
1992.91-8685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,613.623,614.154,Mr. Kent.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,621.868,625.872,--Unless it's plainly inconsistent with what the Sentencing Commission's done.
1992.91-8685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,662.625,663.166,Mr. Kent.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,663.166,663.666,That's a change.
1992.91-8685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.666,670.691,"Mr. Kent, am I not correct that the Sentencing Commission itself could... could clarify all of this?"
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,678.526,679.227,They can.
1992.91-8685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,679.227,681.367,"Frankly, I was content to let them do that."
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,712.799,713.641,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-8685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,713.641,718.894,So why don't we... why don't we just talk about that and let the Sentencing Commission worry about all the rest?
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,720.384,729.71,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think the Sentencing Commission already has... has handled the rest in amendment 461 where the Sentencing Commission in September of 1992--"
1992.91-8685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.71,730.341,Well that may be.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,755.897,771.609,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I... I believe the Sentencing Commission has tried to express that already in amendment 461 where the Sentencing Commission directly referred to this case, Stinson, and reiterated their explanation that the amendment, 433, was clarifying."
1992.91-8685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.635,804.921,"But not because they... not because they disagree with you about the meaning of ""clarifying""."
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,810.485,817.106,--Their holding was limited to their... the Eleventh Circuit will not follow commentary that overrules their prior precedent.
1992.91-8685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.293,880.108,"Whatever we said about it could be contradicted by the... by the... by the Sentencing Commission, couldn't it?"
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,880.108,882.059,It could be--
1992.91-8685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.059,891.037,"Now, we could come out with a decision, the Sentencing Commission could say no, we really didn't mean that, we meant the opposite, and moreover this view that we now express should be applied retroactively, right?"
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,893.308,905.674,"--Well, yes, Justice Scalia, you yourself, in the Braxton opinion, deferred to the Sentencing Commission, of course, on a question on which cert had already been granted, because the Sentencing Commission had agreed to take up that issue."
1992.91-8685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.42,938.635,And the Sentencing Commission has... has said that the courts may apply that 433 retroactively.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,938.635,939.537,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-8685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,939.537,942.248,"But does it say ""may"" or ""must""?"
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,942.248,946.533,"Well, Justice White, that gets into--"
1992.91-8685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,946.533,948.042,Well which... which does it say?
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,948.042,959.932,"--Well, under 3582 in Guideline 1B1.10, in which the Sentencing Commission, in amendment 461, has said that this amendment may be applied retroactively under 1B--"
1992.91-8685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.932,960.191,May be.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,960.191,960.912,--May.
1992.91-8685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.15,976.221,That's because it was here.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,976.221,979.333,Here and also his appeal before the Eleventh--
1992.91-8685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,979.333,986.299,It's before... it's before... that's because... because there was a petition for certiorari filed on time.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,986.299,987.539,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-8685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.319,1003.14,433.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,1006.252,1006.833,"--Yes, sir."
1992.91-8685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.765,1010.563,"For rehearing, that's right."
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,1010.563,1011.374,Which had not expired.
1992.91-8685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.681,1064.629,"Well, of course, every court of appeals that had dealt with the question had decided it contrary to what the Sentence... Sentencing Commission said it meant."
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,1064.629,1068.022,Which is the very reason the clarifying amendment was necessary.
1992.91-8685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1087.855,1088.435,That's right.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,1088.435,1108.778,"--Note also that, as the Government itself notes in its brief in opposition to my original petition for cert, two circuits, that's the First Circuit in Bell v. United States and the Fifth in Shano v. United States, have already applied this amendment retroactively, so to speak."
1992.91-8685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1132.453,1139.368,What if the... what if... just forget about the Guidelines for a minute.
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,1176.281,1178.384,"No, sir, Justice White, he does not."
1992.91-8685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.998,1194.894,"Of course, I suppose the legislature could say that... and this... this lowering of the sentence shall be applicable to all pending cases."
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,1194.894,1197.647,--The Congress could.
1992.91-8685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1200.328,1209.364,"And so, in effect, your argument is that this is exactly what the Sentencing Commission has said."
1992.91-8685,0,45237,william_mallory_kent,,1209.364,1210.764,"Exactly, Justice White."
1992.91-8685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1236.833,1238.703,"Thank you, Mr. Kent."
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1240.695,1252.043,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-8685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1303.755,1310.58,Are they in some lower hierarchy than policy statements or are they treated the same way as policy statements?
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1310.58,1314.664,"I think for... for this sort of purpose, Your Honor, they would be treated in the same way."
1992.91-8685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1458.209,1483.766,"Well, now, is... is all commentary like an agency rule, because the commentary... the Sentencing Commission has to... its rules on commentary, 1B1.7, says that some commentary is treated like legislative history, and we don't usually think of that as being binding on the courts."
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1485.926,1486.577,No.
1992.91-8685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1533.246,1537.239,"Well, but a legislative report, that... that's different than an agency rule."
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1559.747,1566.61,"Oh, well it... it may... it is of lower force than the Guideline itself, because the commentary--"
1992.91-8685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1566.61,1567.471,"Well, of course, yeah."
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1567.471,1570.383,--The commentary has to be consistent with the Guideline.
1992.91-8685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1577.896,1578.246,Of course.
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1578.246,1580.838,"--Has implemented, then the agency's interpretation won't be applied."
1992.91-8685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1613.559,1620.855,Well is it... is it fair for me to say that your position is that all commentary should be treated like an agency rule?
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1620.855,1625.167,"Like an agency's interpretation of its rule, if I can change that, Your Honor."
1992.91-8685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1625.167,1625.618,All right.
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1625.618,1629.701,"It's not... not equivalent to the rule, but like an agency's interpretation of the rule, that would be our position."
1992.91-8685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1629.701,1631.332,All commentary.
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1631.332,1632.073,Yes.
1992.91-8685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1632.073,1632.954,Well--
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1632.954,1636.634,And so we think that is a reasonable way of looking at the generic issue that--
1992.91-8685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1636.634,1643.189,"--Well, I didn't know courts were bound, absolutely bound by an agency's interpretation of its own rules."
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1643.189,1645.22,--No.
1992.91-8685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.967,1654.576,I didn't... I agree with that.
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1663.622,1667.465,"--Your Honor, we've always taken the position that unless the agency--"
1992.91-8685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.465,1677.102,"If they want to put out a new regulation, that may be... that may be something else again, if you want to amend the regulation, but I didn't know we were just bound by an agency's rule."
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1677.102,1678.723,"--Your Honor, we've always taken--"
1992.91-8685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1678.723,1680.165,I mean interpretation of its own rule.
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1680.165,1688.66,"--No, we... we've always taken the position that that... unless... that interpretation is binding unless it's inconsistent with the text of the regulation, relevant statute--"
1992.91-8685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1688.66,1689.519,"Well, all right, all right."
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1689.519,1690.401,--Or the Constitution.
1992.91-8685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.401,1691.322,So we're not bound.
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1697.616,1698.544,Oh.
1992.91-8685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1757.353,1760.365,"That, of course, was not the court of appeals' reasoning in this case."
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1772.904,1773.876,Correct.
1992.91-8685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1779.077,1785.763,"And I read the opinion as indicating that if they had acknowledged that it were binding, they would have applied it in favor of the petitioner."
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1787.983,1789.035,I would say that... that's incorrect.
1992.91-8685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.194,1811.75,"Well, you... but that you would say they would... you say the... that this commentary was... what is it, a 433, was that it?"
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1811.75,1812.972,"That's the amendment, Your Honor, yes."
1992.91-8685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.972,1813.602,"Yeah, yeah."
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1816.976,1817.654,Yes.
1992.91-8685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.654,1819.767,Not just an interpretation of it.
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1819.767,1823.59,"Well, it... it actually did several things."
1992.91-8685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.03,1842.451,"Well, is it... as relevant here, was it a... I thought the... I thought the Commission thought it was just a... a clarification or an interpretation of its... of the Guideline."
1992.91-8685,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1842.451,1846.755,"--Well I think it's... as Justice O'Connor mentioned, it's a clarification of how the new system is to be implemented."
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2366.393,2369.836,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court again:
1992.91-8685,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.582,2489.745,"But they are right that even if we ruled against you here, that you would not be completely without a remedy."
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2489.745,2494.217,We could seek... we could petition the district court.
1992.91-8685,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2494.217,2496.669,But then you would have to go through another procedure.
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2496.669,2498.001,That's correct.
1992.91-8685,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.973,2499.801,And you don't want to have to do that.
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2499.801,2511.708,"--Not only do we not want to have to do it, we believe that Mr. Stinson's entitled to the law in effect to be applied to his sentence or his appeal before his sentence is final."
1992.91-8685,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2511.708,2519.034,"Well, if you through this other procedure it's discretionary with the trial court whether it... whether it will make the change or not."
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2519.034,2519.836,Exactly.
1992.91-8685,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2572.94,2583.605,"Well, wouldn't... if we rule for you, shouldn't the court of appeals, now that it knows the commentary is binding, remand to the district court for resentencing?"
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2583.605,2597.444,"--Well, we would come up against the problem, though, Justice White, of does this particular commentary... I mean this is the... the problem addressed by the Government in its brief, and it's a question necessarily subsumed in the issue under which cert has been granted."
1992.91-8685,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2604.26,2614.486,"Well, it... it applies, but the district court didn't have the commentary before it, did it?"
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2614.486,2615.707,"No, sir, it did not."
1992.91-8685,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2615.707,2626.713,"And is it possible that even with the commentary, that... that the district court would have imposed the same sentence, or would it be impossible?"
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2626.713,2630.877,"Well, it's... it's possible that the district court could have imposed a worse sentence."
1992.91-8685,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.877,2642.675,"Well, then I... I can't imagine why the court of appeals shouldn't... if we remanded the court of appeals, why the court of appeals shouldn't decide what the sentence is."
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2649.538,2654.633,"Well, I don't know whether the court of appeals would decide whether this commentary is clarifying or not."
1992.91-8685,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2665.892,2680.201,"Well, let's assume we say it's... that it's retroactive and applies to this... this defendant, but we don't know how the sentencer would sentence the... this defendant under this new commentary."
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2680.201,2681.21,"No, sir."
1992.91-8685,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2681.801,2682.452,Well--
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2687.595,2703.536,"Well, precisely, I'm asking the Court to vacate Mr. Stinson's sentence, to remand it for resentencing with instructions that this commentary is clarifying commentary and is to be applied to his... determination of his sentence."
1992.91-8685,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2703.536,2705.93,"Well, that's what Justice White was suggesting too, I think."
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2721.739,2724.2,"Well, I would win insofar--"
1992.91-8685,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2724.2,2731.375,And you... you object to the notion that... that the... that the case should go back to the district court.
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2731.375,2733.756,"--Well, no, Justice White."
1992.91-8685,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.074,2753.13,"Well, I know, but what did you ask the court of appeals to do in your petition for rehearing, remand to the district court for resentencing under the new Guidelines--"
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2753.13,2753.491,Yes.
1992.91-8685,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2753.491,2754.392,--Under the new commentary.
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2754.392,2754.943,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-8685,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.943,2756.142,All right.
1992.91-8685,2,45237,william_mallory_kent,,2756.142,2758.854,If there are no further questions.
1992.91-8685,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2758.854,2760.357,"Thank you, Mr. Kent."
