2002.02-182,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.937,"We'll hear argument now in Number 02-182, Georgia versus John Ashcroft."
2002.02-182,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,8.999,17.09,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-182,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1604.371,1612.75,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-182,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1630.999,1636.201,"In... in preclearing, does the Government look at the effect as a whole?"
2002.02-182,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1657.765,1658.22,The Justice Department--
2002.02-182,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1658.22,1661.109,--and... and as a whole might be better off?
2002.02-182,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1661.109,1666.476,"--The Justice Department's view is that the analysis should focus on the plan as a whole, and our guidance is--"
2002.02-182,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1666.476,1667.385,You do look at it as a whole.
2002.02-182,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1667.385,1668.5,--We do look at the plan as a whole.
2002.02-182,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1668.5,1673.989,And you didn't think that this plan resulted in a gain as whole?
2002.02-182,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1673.989,1690.875,"No, because our... our feeling was that there were three Senate districts that we focused on specifically because we felt, for a variety of reasons, that the diminution in black population was likely to have a significant impact on black voters' ability to elect candidates of choice in those three districts."
2002.02-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1706.6,1708.458,"Well, the certainty or... or ability?"
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,2672.051,2680.679,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court:"
2002.02-182,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2728.855,2736.324,"Well, in... this type of case is governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is it not, which provide for intervention under given circumstances?"
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,2736.324,2739.296,"Absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and--"
2002.02-182,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2739.296,2751.146,"Mr. Braden, I... I think even if you're correct that intervention was appropriate, did the intervenors join in the appeal here?"
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,2751.146,2753.58,--Intervenors did not join in the appeal.
2002.02-182,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2753.58,2756.924,So why isn't it moot as to your issue?
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,2756.924,2768.441,"As to our issue, it's not moot because this Court might fashion a remedy to send it back to the district court for additional findings, in which we would have presumably a position to argue it in that case."
2002.02-182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2768.441,2770.011,"Well, then you should have appealed."
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,2781.9,2783.879,We did not ask this--
2002.02-182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.879,2785.076,--You can't walk both sides of the street.
2002.02-182,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2785.076,2786.934,I thought intervention was granted.
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,2786.934,2788.131,--Intervention was granted.
2002.02-182,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2788.131,2789.823,So how could you appeal from a victory?
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,2789.823,2792.135,"I do not know, Justice."
2002.02-182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2794.447,2801.962,"Well, intervention was granted, but you didn't join the appeal from... from the decision below or file a cross appeal."
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,2802.333,2803.198,--That is correct.
2002.02-182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.188,2912.59,Didn't... didn't almost all of the black legislature... legislators in the Georgia assembly favor this... this plan?
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,2912.59,2914.448,"That is, in fact, correct, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.448,2915.895,How... how many opposed it?
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,2916.677,2917.586,One in--
2002.02-182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2917.586,2918.246,A woman.
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,2919.277,2921.301,"--Actually, I believe there were two, but one in the Senate."
2002.02-182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2950.568,2961.138,"Well, that may be, but I... I find it hard to believe that they didn't have the... the... or a majority of them at least didn't have the best interests of their... of their race in... in mind."
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,2999.32,3004.438,"That... that... Justice Scalia, that is a very plausible explanation in a hypothetical State."
2002.02-182,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3024.295,3024.5,"--Yes, but don't the figures--"
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,3024.5,3025.986,--whether or not they'll be elected.
2002.02-182,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3025.986,3034.038,"--Don't the figures show that some of the districts were way up there before, were... were packed and they reduced them something like 80 percent to 55 or 60?"
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,3037.132,3038.208,Absolutely correct.
2002.02-182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3112.262,3136.039,"The black... the black community's candidates of choice has overwhelmingly been Democrats and to... to increase the probability of getting a Democrat elected by moving black voters into another district is precisely to give black voters a... a better choice, to... to... it may not be a black candidate, but it will be the candidate the black voters want."
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,3136.039,3142.977,And I think that's a misinterpretation of this Court's position and a misunderstanding of what the voting rights is meant to protect.
2002.02-182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3180.788,3181.243,No.
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,3192.389,3203.617,"In... Justice Scalia, the fallacy I believe of that argument, in all due respect, is that there's one type of Democrat candidate, and the reality to that is there isn't one type."
2002.02-182,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3243.408,3251.293,Move out... move out black voters to elect Democrats in the district they are moved to or in the district they're moved from?
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,3251.293,3252.696,--In the district that they're moved to.
2002.02-182,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3273.917,3285.434,"Whether they're Democrats or Republicans or whatever they are in these other districts, I take it in your view if evidence had been put on the stand that the black voter was better off, then you might lose your side of the case."
2002.02-182,2,21844,e_marshall_braden,,3285.434,3286.444,--Absolutely correct.
2002.02-182,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3286.444,3288.035,Thank you.
2002.02-182,3,21708,david_f_walbert,,3293.524,3293.979,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2002.02-182,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3331.214,3337.242,"Well, it's conceivable if all they're interested in... is, is in race and you want us to presume that."
2002.02-182,3,21708,david_f_walbert,,3339.759,3347.106,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think that there's... that's realistic to think that the delegation would vote themselves out of office, which is what we're talking about."
2002.02-182,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3374.106,3375.137,And the evidence is where?
2002.02-182,3,21708,david_f_walbert,,3375.88,3377.449,"That's in the testimony of every one of the legislators, said that's why we get--"
2002.02-182,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3377.449,3379.967,So what... what do I read and what pages do I read?
2002.02-182,3,21708,david_f_walbert,,3379.967,3383.932,--It would be in the... it's in the... the testimony of the legislators.
2002.02-182,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3384.554,3384.841,Okay.
2002.02-182,3,21708,david_f_walbert,,3384.841,3386.327,--It's... I'm sorry.
2002.02-182,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3392.726,3398.216,The district court didn't consider that relevant testimony because it was not testimony about safe seats elsewhere.
2002.02-182,3,21708,david_f_walbert,,3398.216,3400.089,"I would think that's a fair characterization, Your Honor."
2002.02-182,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3435.822,3439.992,"That's what we're supposed to, go into which political party is better for which particular group of people?"
2002.02-182,3,21708,david_f_walbert,,3439.992,3440.28,No.
2002.02-182,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3474.749,3485.523,"Can I ask before... before you conclude your argument, what is the status of the litigation that's pending in the State court to resolve the dispute between the Attorney General and the Governor?"
2002.02-182,3,21708,david_f_walbert,,3485.523,3485.689,Yes.
2002.02-182,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3512.195,3513.514,"Thank you, Mr. Walbert."
2002.02-182,3,21708,david_f_walbert,,3513.514,3514.257,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2002.02-182,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3514.257,3516.032,The case is submitted.
