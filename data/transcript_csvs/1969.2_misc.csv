1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,116.493,120.857,"Your Honor, I think there's three, maybe four -- four judges."
1969.2_misc,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,123.638,124.446,A senior judge?
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,124.446,129.75,"Yes, sir."
1969.2_misc,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,149.989,156.409,How do you distinguish -- how do you discern the form in which they act?
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,156.409,163.951,"Well, sir, the order itself, the signators or the judges who signed it beneath their signators, they said Circuit Judge."
1969.2_misc,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,194.828,210.164,"Well, when all the judges -- all of the circuit judges of a given circuit assemble and meet to address themselves to any business other than an en banc hearing, are they not acting as a Judicial Council?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,210.164,212.261,"I don't believe they are, Your Honor."

1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,250.863,251.19,Yes sir.
1969.2_misc,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,251.19,254.93,"-- as a counsel, not on a particular case."
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,254.93,259.406,"Well sir, the statute provides only that they're required to meet at least twice a year."
1969.2_misc,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,260.515,267.289,But you would not suggest that other meetings were not meetings of the council if they go beyond two meetings.
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,267.289,271.396,"No sir, I believe that this was a meeting of the Judicial Council."

1969.2_misc,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,281.975,287.055,"But of course, they hold their place on the council only by virtue of their being the circuit judges, is that not true?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,287.055,289.795,"Yes sir, that is true."

1969.2_misc,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,602.148,607.218,What the -- did the second order purport to do with reference to the first?
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,607.218,611.801,"Well, Your Honor, the second order merely called for the hearing."
1969.2_misc,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,648.402,658.78,Does the Council undertake to say that certain members of the Court of Appeals shall not sit in certain cases?
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,658.78,660.204,"No sir, it doesn't."
1969.2_misc,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,660.204,664.896,Is this running just to the -- I know that Judge Chandler is a District Judge.

1969.2_misc,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,792.755,793.947,And that's criminal or civil?

1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1026.671,1033.726,"Your Honor, I contend that the Judicial Conference could act in a way in which was an exercise of the judicial powers."
1969.2_misc,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1059.947,1062.299,"You meant the Judicial Conference there, didn't you?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1062.299,1065.992,"No, I was back on the Judicial Council, Your Honor."
1969.2_misc,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1066.724,1075.881,What is the specific judicial power which has been vested in those terms in the Judicial Council to which you were referring?

1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1109.388,1111.711,Sir?
1969.2_misc,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1111.711,1114.828,"Is that cited in your brief, that Section?"

1969.2_misc,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1124.108,1124.933,Alright.
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1124.933,1128.871,"-- at this instant, but it is cited in there."
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.643,1140.698,"What makes that a judicial function, the removal of an officer?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1140.698,1145.795,Removal of a bankruptcy -- of the referee in bankruptcy?
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.571,1154.48,"I know, but it is removal, why is that a judicial function necessarily?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1161.402,1162.549,"Well, but those are --"
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1162.549,1165.16,"[Inaudible] and when he does that, he's performing a judicial function?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1165.16,1165.579,"No, sir."
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.559,1184.667,"Do you think when a judge, a District Judge removes a -- removes a probation officer, he's exercising a judicial function?"

1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1214.361,1215.586,By the Court.
1969.2_misc,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1215.586,1218.0,Is that a judicial act when the court appoints him?
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1218.0,1218.428,"Yes, sir."
1969.2_misc,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1497.113,1503.948,"Well, do you recall the details of how that sent -- last sentence happened to get in there in the legislative history?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1505.581,1511.001,"Well, sir, it was a very complicated and extended procedure."
1969.2_misc,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1521.099,1522.945,"Well, I was speaking of the specific sentence."
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1564.757,1572.411,"Your Honor, my memory may be faulty ,but with all due respect, I do not believe you are correct."
1969.2_misc,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1615.632,1630.124,"Well, whether it's in the 1939, even though this occurred in the 1939 setting or the 1948 setting, it was in the setting of members of the Senate who have thought the statute had to be strengthened to give bigger authority to the Council."
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1631.533,1634.655,"Your Honor, I don't know if that was the intention of their questioning."
1969.2_misc,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1916.893,1927.333,"Now, that -- your argument is made upon the premise that Judicial Council has taken all the cases away from him."
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1927.333,1928.457,"They did initially, yes sir."
1969.2_misc,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1928.457,1931.39,"Well, they did initially, but that was superseded."
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1931.39,1932.023,Well --
1969.2_misc,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1932.023,1936.093,"Well, am I incorrect in my understanding of that?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1936.093,1950.298,"They did supersede it, but then they kept him from hearing any cases later filed in his Court and furthermore, they pressured him into all of this, Your Honor, that they've been acting against him ever since the first of (Voice Overlap)."
1969.2_misc,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1950.298,1961.812,"I understand your argument, all those arguments, but am I incorrect in my understanding that their action taking all the cases away from him was superseded?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1961.812,1963.135,"Yes, sir."
1969.2_misc,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1963.135,1964.752,"I'm incorrect in that, am I?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1964.752,1966.93,"Yes, sir -- you are correct, yes sir."
1969.2_misc,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1966.93,1968.089,I'm right in that understanding?
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1968.089,1969.112,"Yes, sir."
1969.2_misc,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1969.112,1980.414,"So then, any argument based upon the premise that there's an outstanding order taking all the cases away from him is based upon incorrect premise, am I correct, right?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,1980.414,1990.495,"Your Honor, the order has been superseded because of the continuation of the Council to act and because of the importance to the judiciary of whether they can do this."
1969.2_misc,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2009.944,2014.697,"Now, we come to Mr. Justice Stewart's question, what is the exact situation of Judge Chandler now?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2016.898,2032.395,"His exact situation, Your Honor, is that he has the remnants of four or five cases that had been assigned to him before this matter arose, that he has the remnants of those still in his office."
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.111,2061.685,"But that's backed up by an order of the Judicial Council because the time he agreed to that, he disagreed with the reassignment of cases that he already had."
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2061.685,2062.333,He disagreed.
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.333,2069.849,"And the Judicial Council then entered an order, didn't it, saying that he can keep his old cases?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2069.849,2070.206,"Yes, sir."
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.206,2072.877,But that he can't have any new ones?
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2072.877,2073.704,That's correct.
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2073.704,2075.59,"Well, is that order still outstanding?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2075.59,2090.079,"That order was in effect until several months ago when the Judicial Council advised the members -- the other judges of Judge Chandler's Court and him that if they wish to enter into a new order for the division of business, they might do so."
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.972,2117.512,"Well, let's assume that Judge Chandler said, “I want to be assigned my full quota of the cases” and the other two judges disagreed and said the present division should continue, then there would be a disagreement."
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2117.512,2117.705,Yes.
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.705,2127.351,"And let's assume then that the Council, the Judicial Council entered an order, saying no new cases."
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2130.768,2132.515,"For him to -- yes sir, I would it was beyond their power."
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.515,2135.524,On the same grounds that you're using now?
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2135.524,2144.038,"Well, Your Honor, I don't believe that the Judicial Council can -- cannot -- can make such an order as to take away all the cases of the --"
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2144.038,2145.529,"Well, it purported to."
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2145.529,2149.164,"It purported to, yes sir, and we challenge that decision before this Court."
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2149.164,2168.777,I don't know why you -- I don't know why you think the -- you think you have to argue about the old order when there's a -- when the superseded order -- I mean the order superseding the old order is in accordance with your approach just to suspect as the old one.
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2168.777,2168.88,Oh!
1969.2_misc,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2229.888,2249.766,"Now, is it your contention that what you call the present order, which was promulgated under Section 137, is not authorized by Section 137, or is it your position that if authorized by 137, then Section 137 is unconstitutional as applied?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2249.766,2253.266,It is not my contention that Section 137 is unconstitutional.
1969.2_misc,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2279.972,2287.051,"Well, let's assume -- let's assume a genuine -- a genuine disagreement among the District Judges."
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2303.058,2305.063,"I would agree, Your Honor that's perfectly fine."
1969.2_misc,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2305.063,2306.7,If Section 137 does authorize --
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2306.7,2307.29,"Yes, sir."
1969.2_misc,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2307.29,2308.637,-- the Council will do it?
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2308.637,2308.923,"Yes, sir."
1969.2_misc,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2308.923,2311.095,And that that's a constitutional power?
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2311.095,2311.752,"Yes, sir."
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.328,2325.771,"Do you say that – I thought awhile ago, you said that the Judicial Council could not have ordered saying that a judge could not have any new cases?"
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2325.771,2326.421,"Your Honor, I said --"
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.421,2336.952,That would be a -- and you say that one -- and you say that Section 137 did not authorize what the Judicial Council did in this case by saying no to new cases?
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2336.952,2339.325,"Well, Your Honor --"
1969.2_misc,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.325,2351.539,"You assume that 137 does authorize the second order of the Council, I assume that you would say it's unconstitutional."
1969.2_misc,0,42905,thomas_j_kenan,,2351.539,2362.999,"Your Honor, the Section 137 certainly superficially authorizes the second order of the Judicial Council because the judges were disagreeing."
