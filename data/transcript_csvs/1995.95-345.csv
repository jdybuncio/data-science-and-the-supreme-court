1995.95-345,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,18.002,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-345, United States v. Guy Jerome Ursery, and Number 95-346, United States v. $405,000 and some change, consolidated for argument."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,19.344,22.065,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-345,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,149.069,165.438,"Now, do you think, Mr. Dreeben, that the civil forfeiture could be punitive for purposes of the Excessive Fines Clause and yet not multiple punishment within the meaning of double jeopardy?"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,165.438,167.421,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, I do."
1995.95-345,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,240.488,248.362,So you think Halper maybe could be viewed as a multiple prosecution case and not a multiple punishment case.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,248.362,264.434,"I think that Halper, analyzed in the terms that the Court analyzed it, was a multiple punishments case, but it is nonetheless true that under Halper, there is some confusion about the exact test that the Court adopted in that case due to different formulations."
1995.95-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.744,286.577,And even though it's considered such for purposes of the Excessive Fines Clause?
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,286.577,287.959,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,287.959,288.21,Why?
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,306.333,313.585,The answer to that question goes in part back to the roots and origins of the Double Jeopardy Clause itself.
1995.95-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.268,346.858,But you're saying... I'm sorry.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,370.313,395.718,"Well, I think the answer, Justice Scalia, is that to the extent that there is protection against multiple punishments that has been recognized in this Court's cases as subsumed by the Fifth Amendment, that protection has been limited and defined in very specific contexts, and has never been a freestanding doctrine that would invalidate any and all simultaneous or contemporaneous pursuit of two actions that had some punitive component to it."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,418.064,430.723,"But isn't the different with, or at least a difficulty with the historical argument that you're making that some of the forfeiture in this case, or in these cases, just do not have common law pedigrees?"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,465.806,470.19,"--I agree, Justice Souter, that history is not the entire answer to this problem."
1995.95-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,507.945,526.867,"But Mr. Dreeben, if we stick with the house where marijuana was dried, I thought, based on your answer to Justice O'Connor, that you would say that should be treated the way Austin was treated, as an excessive fine case, but doesn't belong... wasn't that the problem in Austin, that what was--"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,526.867,527.788,"--Right, that's correct."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,559.979,560.32,--Okay.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,587.949,596.027,"Well, let me first put in the historical context the forfeiture of facilitating property and apply it to the real estate in this case."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,628.587,643.918,"Well, that may be, but that doesn't help you out, I think, in a historical argument, which essentially is they understood at the time these clauses were enacted as part of the original Bill of Rights that there could be both these procedures, the criminal prosecution and the forfeiture."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,656.427,682.433,"Well, I don't think the argument completely goes, Justice Souter, because the same rationales and justifications for the forfeiture of property that is used to facilitate a crime also are present in the forfeitures of property that were known to the common law, and the fact that the principle is being applied in the new context to respond to new problems that the common law hadn't faced does not mean that it is something that would be unfamiliar to the Framers, and I think that--"
1995.95-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,682.433,688.197,"Mr. Dreeben, what was the basis in the Prohibition era when the distillery was taken?"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,700.638,744.256,"--Yes, that was under a civil forfeiture, and what that led to was this Court's decision in Various Items v. United States in 1931, in which the Court examined a claim that's virtually indistinguishable from the claim that's being made here today that the forfeiture of property following a criminal conviction of the owner of property constituted a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, and the Court rejected that contention by reference to the very ancient traditions of in rem forfeiture which had been recognized by this Court in a variety of cases such as the Palmyra and the Brig Malek in the 19th Century, that that supported the treatment of such forfeitures as not sufficiently punitive as to trigger the Double Jeopardy--"
1995.95-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,744.256,757.534,"--Suppose, Mr. Dreeben... suppose, Mr. Dreeben, you had a case in which there was a forfeiture against the owner of a property because the property had been used for a drug transaction but the owner was not criminally liable."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,769.033,769.864,--Yes.
1995.95-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,769.864,777.178,"Could the owner of the property say, this is excessive because, what, you are punishing the other person--"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,777.178,777.729,Well--
1995.95-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,777.729,783.712,"--excessively, or you're punishing me excessively compared to what the use of the property was?"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,783.712,790.036,--This Court has not articulated what the proper test or measure of excessiveness is under the Eighth Amendment.
1995.95-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,803.046,816.494,"But my question is, do we apply that analysis at all to the owner who's not guilty of a crime but who nevertheless is sufficiently aware of the drug proceeding so that the forfeiture is being permitted--"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,816.494,816.844,Yes--
1995.95-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,816.844,818.614,--assuming that culpability is required.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,818.614,833.724,"--I think that that is the necessary consequence of Austin, that there is Eighth Amendment analysis that can be invoked at the behest of the owner of the property, who is the only one who has any real property stake in the forfeiture itself, and that that person--"
1995.95-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,833.724,836.576,Even though that owner did not commit any crime at all.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,836.576,836.876,--That's correct.
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,886.63,906.162,"But of course, the Government can do all of those things consistently with a double jeopardy analysis if it does them, as it were, at the right time, so this is not a case in which you say, well, if you apply the punishment analysis here and say the cause applies, these historical objectives of the Government are precluded, because they're not."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,906.162,908.105,"Well, they are in a very practical sense, Justice Souter."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,913.969,916.571,"No, but you simply have to bring them in a coordinated proceeding."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,916.571,919.493,"--Well, and I would submit that we have done so in these cases."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,919.493,932.919,"Well, that may be, but I mean, the only... my only point is that there... you don't have here a case in which, if we... if our position on this point does not prevail, these objectives are in effect precluded, because that... all I'm saying is, they're not."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,932.919,933.269,Well--
1995.95-345,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,933.269,940.045,"But you may have just such a case if, in fact, the Court were to decide that these were not parallel proceedings."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,945.178,953.984,"--Well, then I think we would have a very, very significant practical problem if we were not permitted to use the alternative remedies, because criminal forfeiture is no substitute for civil forfeiture."
1995.95-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,953.984,955.506,"It's rather new, isn't it?"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,958.037,958.748,That's correct.
1995.95-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,974.747,978.791,"Mr. Dreeben, mechanically, how does it work out in the district courts and the U.S. Attorney's Office?"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,998.355,1008.18,"Forfeitures can be handled out of either as an administrative matter, and in some U.S. Attorney's Offices the Criminal Division does it and coordinates it extensively with the criminal case."
1995.95-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1014.875,1020.138,Does the DOJ have guidelines for when it will pursue criminal as opposed to civil forfeiture?
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1020.138,1020.889,We do not.
1995.95-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1034.398,1048.919,"If you wanted to proceed by criminal forfeiture and there were one criminal defendant but two owners of the property, could the... is there some intervenor procedure where the noncriminal defendant can somehow be involved in the criminal proceeding?"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1049.928,1054.192,"--I think it would not work, because when we initiate the civil forfeiture action we bring it against the property."
1995.95-345,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1110.749,1113.86,For criminal forfeiture you have to have an indictment?
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1113.86,1114.541,Yes.
1995.95-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1180.526,1183.017,"On that reason, what are the aims?"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1190.872,1192.213,--There are three reasons--
1995.95-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1192.213,1196.027,"--Yes, well, three, the same three reasons apply for the purposes of criminal punishment."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1221.302,1229.556,"--Well, I don't... there are purposes that are served by both civil and criminal law, and I don't think that any purposes are--"
1995.95-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1229.556,1229.787,Yes.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1249.061,1251.054,--It is not solely--
1995.95-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1251.054,1251.553,Or is there anything other than historic?
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1251.553,1252.825,--It is not solely historic.
1995.95-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1252.825,1253.256,I'm not saying just that.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1255.406,1256.618,I think that there is.
1995.95-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1256.618,1256.997,What?
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1256.997,1258.178,I think that there is reason itself.
1995.95-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1280.273,1308.043,"And then that's why we put people in prison, because they're misusing themselves, and so they can't do it again while they're there, and we want people to take good care of the property, so we deter them... I mean, it sounds awfully similar to me, and also it's so natural to say, taking the house away from the person and giving it to the Government is a punishment, but I don't know that that ends your case, and even if that's so, you have... and I just want to get out from you all the possible differences."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1308.792,1309.062,Well--
1995.95-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1309.062,1309.823,--is the purposes.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1312.966,1336.411,"--I think that once you are talking about the purposes and the history, and this Court's cases, you are essentially covering the issue, but it's not to be lost sight of that this Court said as recently as the Bennis decision that deterrence is an aim distinct from any punitive purpose, and it has always been true in civil forfeiture law that deterrence has been a recognized purpose and aim."
1995.95-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.209,1364.617,Mr. Dreeben--
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1371.292,1371.843,I think that--
1995.95-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1371.843,1374.294,Almost any punishment I can think of has a deterrence purpose.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1374.294,1384.912,"--Punishment will always have a deterrent purpose, but merely having a deterrent purpose is not sufficient to brand a sanction as punitive for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause."
1995.95-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1384.912,1398.53,"Mr. Dreeben, tell me if my fix is this is wrong, but I thought that part of the old idea was not just that you reify the thing, but that you arrest the thing so it's no longer accessible to anybody, and that's the Prohibition era."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1423.218,1445.781,"Well, I meant to do that, Justice Ginsburg, in stating that it serves the traditional purpose of abating a nuisance, of preventing the ongoing commission of the crime, which is quite similar to what this Court described as the purpose of the forfeitures in Bennis, and was quite similar to the purposes of the forfeitures that were imposed in the common law era, and then later pursuant to statutes in this country."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1445.781,1450.636,"But of course, that doesn't help you out in a proceeds case, because the Government is going to put the proceeds right back in circulation."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1450.636,1451.988,"Well, I... that's right."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1451.988,1452.729,You're not putting anything out of commission there.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1473.012,1489.541,"Exactly right, Justice Souter, and although that had not been traditionally accomplished through forfeiture, it had been traditionally recognized as no issue under the Fourth Amendment whatsoever for the Government to seize the proceeds that a robber derives when he goes into a bank and comes out with money."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1489.541,1495.446,"But that's different from the drug sale proceeds, though, because in the robber case you're going to give the money back to the bank, as Justice Breyer said."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1497.877,1498.728,One would hope.
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1498.728,1502.411,"Yes, we do hope it gets back there,--"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1526.848,1538.906,"I think that both analogies work, although the concept that I was trying to describe is that of simply that depriving the wrongdoer of the ill gotten gains that he has derived from criminal activity is not punishment."
1995.95-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1546.41,1550.384,"If it's not punishment, then does that mean it's not for an offense?"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1550.384,1555.886,"It could be conceived of as not being for an offense, but I think--"
1995.95-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1555.886,1558.578,Or is the better argument that it's not the same offense?
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1558.578,1568.314,"--I think that strictly speaking, as proceeds, the reason why it's not punishment is that the owner of money derived from crime has no right to retain them at all."
1995.95-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1652.048,1652.899,Mr. Dreeben--
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1654.459,1654.849,That is correct.
1995.95-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1654.849,1656.091,Even conceding it's an offense.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1656.091,1656.552,That's right.
1995.95-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1656.552,1657.083,Which you don't concede.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1657.083,1657.771,That's right.
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1657.771,1660.823,"Mr. Dreeben, isn't the... I think I follow what you're saying."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1695.948,1700.28,"I think Brown v. Ohio, Justice Souter, really addresses a quite distinct problem."
1995.95-345,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.615,1756.607,"But Mr. Dreeben, isn't that only half of the Blockburger test?"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1767.014,1774.258,"Well, it does, Justice Stevens, because we aren't required to prove that any property was used in a violation in order to obtain a conviction."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1779.972,1782.165,Where the act involves the use of property.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1782.165,1784.326,"--No, the act does not necessarily involve the use of--"
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1784.326,1788.608,"No, it involves the possession of the drugs, or possession of proceeds, whatever the case may be."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1788.608,1789.038,"--Well, I--"
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1789.038,1791.159,"The money that is laundered, or whatever the case may be."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1793.58,1794.751,"--No, I think that you can--"
1995.95-345,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1794.751,1798.785,But you're saying that you don't have to prove that the act was committed on a particular piece of property.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1798.785,1821.609,"--We don't have to prove any particular piece of property, and in fact, ironically enough, in this very case Ursery's criminal conviction arose out of his manufacture of marijuana on somebody else's property, and thus, even looking at the question of whether the same offense exists on the very facts of the case, the civil forfeiture in this case and the criminal violation were not the same offense."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1821.609,1827.543,"No, but the basis for your forfeiture of the house was that he was in fact using the house, his own property, in drying the marijuana."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1828.354,1829.765,That is the basis of the forfeiture.
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1829.765,1836.119,--Neither the forfeiture nor the criminal offense had anything to do with the fact that the marijuana was being grown across the property line.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1836.119,1841.591,"No, the criminal offense had everything to do with the fact that the marijuana was being grown on somebody else's property."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1841.591,1842.452,Why?
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1842.452,1844.042,That was the basis of the criminal case.
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1847.996,1851.639,You mean there was a separate offense of growing marijuana on someone else's property?
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1851.639,1853.79,"--Yes, and that is exactly what the indictment charged."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1853.79,1854.02,"Literally, there is?"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1854.671,1855.482,"Well, the--"
1995.95-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1855.482,1863.527,"Mr. Dreeben, I thought you were indicting him criminally for only part of the conduct that was involved in the forfeiture."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1864.959,1866.95,"--I think that's exactly correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1896.519,1899.791,"The money laundering case, however, even on your analysis, that would be different."
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1899.791,1908.627,"--A money laundering case would be different to that extent, yes, but it would still not be the same offense as the forfeiture offense for the reasons that I've described."
1995.95-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1908.627,1909.579,Manufacturing?
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1909.579,1910.177,Excuse me?
1995.95-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1910.177,1911.169,Manufacturing?
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1918.133,1924.308,"No, and you don't have to show that he used any particular property, or that he owned the property that was involved in the offense."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2064.547,2072.954,What about the argument that the other side made that if that is a sound argument you could make the same argument with respect to two parallel criminal prosecutions?
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2072.954,2078.75,In a criminal case what would emerge to prevent that is the protection against successive prosecutions.
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2095.28,2100.412,That assumes that in the civil case there isn't a successive prosecution within the meaning of those terms--
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2100.412,2100.923,--That's correct.
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2100.923,2101.794,--because it's not punitive.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2101.794,2109.348,"That... no, I think it assumes that because the successive prosecutions rule has always been limited to two criminal cases, and what the respondents--"
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2109.348,2111.91,That gets us right back to Justice Scalia's question.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2132.125,2146.404,"--Justice Souter, the Court's conclusion in Austin that civil forfeiture was sufficiently punitive to be judged under the Eighth Amendment specifically and explicitly recognized that civil forfeiture was not and never had been recognized as a criminal proceeding."
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2161.753,2182.326,"But doesn't that leave us... I mean, Halper has come down, and doesn't it leave us, on your reasoning, in a position of incoherence, of saying, on the other hand, yes, it is punitive, but not for purposes of defining the prosecution or the action in which it is going to be enforced as a criminal action?"
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2182.326,2184.098,I think that Halper does--
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2184.098,2187.33,That strikes me as just intellectually incoherent.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2187.33,2191.351,"--Halper does produce a variety of very strange results, and that is why this Court should--"
1995.95-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2191.351,2192.873,But wasn't it itself a hybrid?
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2198.888,2201.359,"--That is correct, and it did that in the context--"
1995.95-345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2201.359,2203.169,But we're talking about the extent to which it is too much.
1995.95-345,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2203.169,2208.294,--I think that the question in Halper was to specifically note it as a rule for the rare case.
1995.95-345,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2214.966,2216.008,"Very well, Mr. Dreeben."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2218.169,2227.185,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2283.342,2283.943,Mr. Finer--
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2283.943,2284.293,--Yes.
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2284.293,2291.958,--the Government argues here and it argued in its brief that our 1931 decision in Various Items is controlling.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2297.921,2298.872,That's correct.
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2299.934,2300.534,Would you tell me why?
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2300.534,2301.114,"--Yes, I can."
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2342.991,2344.043,A civil forfeiture--
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2344.043,2344.561,--Civil forfeiture.
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2344.561,2345.122,--just like the Government has brought here.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2345.122,2349.126,"Oh, I do not disagree that they are remarkably analogous cases."
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.126,2351.477,"But then, why didn't you mention it in your brief?"
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2351.477,2356.73,"In part because the modern test does not even address the labels, Your Honor."
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2359.361,2369.268,"Well, but Various Items was a unanimous decision, too, and neither Halper nor Austin made any reference to it with a sense of overruling it."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2369.268,2376.114,"--That's correct, and in fact did not seem to use it for support, either, and so we see no support for the argument either way."
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2389.301,2395.675,"Mr. Finer, the decision that you're defending started out on a very candid note."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2405.302,2408.214,I agree that civil forfeiture was not.
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2414.268,2416.909,But all of these things are called civil forfeitures.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2416.909,2417.27,--That's correct.
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2417.27,2418.371,Halper was called that.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2420.292,2420.823,I agree.
1995.95-345,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2420.823,2424.774,Various Items dealt with instrumentalities.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2428.737,2430.169,That is correct.
1995.95-345,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.169,2443.518,"Well, does that matter, because traditionally, I take it the Government traditionally, the civil forfeiture has been against proceeds or instrumentalities, and does that fact mean that we shouldn't take Halperin as really undermining Various Items?"
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2443.518,2444.819,"Well, let me correct that."
1995.95-345,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2451.732,2452.763,Instrumentalities.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2452.763,2453.685,--The instrumentalities.
1995.95-345,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2469.264,2488.988,"My thought is, if the Government's claim is primarily historical, and also based on precedent and history, then we look to the later cases and we'll have to say, are they consistent or inconsistent, and then I suddenly did notice, and don't know what to make of it, that the Halperin, et cetera, is not... is not the historical context."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2493.299,2494.661,"That's correct, in 18--"
1995.95-345,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2494.661,2497.733,"Right, and so I wonder what to make of that, in your opinion."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2497.733,2517.616,"--I think what we make of that is, when we have a statute such as the one used in Halper, which was the False Claim Act, that dates from roughly 1863, a Civil War era action to deter and punish those who might excessively defraud the Government, and in that case the Court did not have a historical precedent to look at."
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2551.868,2557.792,"Mr. Finer, I don't quite grasp that, because the flavor of the two cases seems to be remarkably different."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2564.747,2565.078,Yes.
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2565.078,2566.588,For the one of a kind.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2566.588,2566.978,Yes.
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2566.978,2570.842,And then Austin seems to be a rule for every case.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2570.842,2573.281,"And yet they are entirely harmonious, for this reason."
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2602.791,2606.995,"Well, certainly in Bennis we said that there can be a deterrent or a remedial purpose."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2606.995,2612.669,"Yes, and in Bennis the deterrence... the language is very interesting, because clearly there are different types of deterrence."
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2613.987,2617.661,Why do you say there's general and specific deterrence?
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2619.383,2630.26,"--You... that... those words are not used, and yet the flavor of deterrence that's described in Bennis, the remedial form, makes sense only if that decision is made, and for this reason: deterrence is a forward looking concept."
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2649.813,2660.472,"Well, you can't deter him in the sense you used in the first... putting a person in jail may deter him in the future, but it doesn't do anything about his past conduct."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2660.472,2668.316,"--No, and because it does not do anything about its past, the special deterrence case is punitive, and that's why deterrence comes up in the cases."
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2668.316,2670.817,"Well, but that simply isn't what Bennis said."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2670.817,2671.448,That's true.
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2671.448,2677.141,And I think your extrapolation out of it... is it based on some case that we have decided?
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2677.141,2677.472,No.
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2685.386,2686.597,What are those cases?
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2686.597,2688.137,"--Well, Austin, for instance."
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2688.137,2689.95,"Well, Austin wasn't unanimously decided."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2689.95,2691.77,"That... no, I beg your pardon, Chief Justice."
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2702.337,2708.872,"Mr. Finer, with respect to Bennis, it seems to me that your argument goes this way."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2722.181,2723.541,I'm not clear he would have been--
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2723.541,2724.232,Why not?
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2724.232,2724.722,--and for this reason.
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2752.913,2755.745,Then there's a question of what label you put on it?
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2755.745,2756.336,--No--
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2756.336,2762.079,"It seems to me taking that car was not so different from taking one Plymouth whatever, or one Ford Victoria."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2762.079,2765.541,"--I completely agree, and from the subjective standpoint it feels the same, I'm sure."
1995.95-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2775.977,2788.827,"If you had a forfeiture under the Federal statutes of an automobile and the judge gave some erroneous instructions, could the Government appeal if it lost in the case?"
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2788.827,2790.647,I'm not clear.
1995.95-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2792.54,2793.011,Yes.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2794.36,2795.141,Ah.
1995.95-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2795.141,2796.541,--I take it a forfeiture case is tried by a jury--
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2796.541,2797.161,Yes.
1995.95-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2797.161,2797.782,--a civil forfeiture case?
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2797.782,2798.063,Yes.
1995.95-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2803.035,2803.436,Yes.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2803.436,2804.367,--court error?
1995.95-345,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2822.759,2824.65,But that's the next logical step.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2847.785,2851.728,"--Yes, where you could not be tried again after the jury's acquittal."
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2851.728,2852.049,Yes.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2855.649,2856.621,I quite understand.
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2856.621,2859.883,So why do you say it could appeal in a civil forfeiture case?
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2859.883,2869.05,"If it were taken as a double jeopardy analysis, and if I understand the Justice's question at this stage, Justice Kennedy, I would change the answer, and it's not a hypothetical--"
1995.95-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2869.05,2869.35,"No, no--"
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2869.35,2870.53,--and I have to agree.
1995.95-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2870.53,2871.711,--it's a civil forfeiture proceeding.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2871.711,2872.012,Right.
1995.95-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2872.012,2876.286,But I think it follows from your argument that the Government could not appeal.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2876.286,2886.493,"If we agree that the error by the trial court presents a second jeopardy, then I do agree, and the test we have used in preparing--"
1995.95-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2886.493,2890.044,Has that ever been held in any case in the--
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2890.044,2890.655,--In a civil case?
1995.95-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2890.655,2891.136,--Yes.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2891.136,2892.618,I'm not aware of any case that so holds.
1995.95-345,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2904.814,2906.386,"So what, then, is the harm?"
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2952.015,2955.808,It goes to the actual harm that the text of the clause is intended to protect.
1995.95-345,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2966.767,2968.009,"--Yes, but you are... that's my point."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,2989.882,2993.564,"Justice Breyer, I'm not sure I would object if they were separate cases, whether they were--"
1995.95-345,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2993.564,3002.3,"Oh, so now it all has to be in the single case, and they have to have... in other words, it just has to be in front of the same judge, you're saying."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3002.3,3006.253,"--I'm not even sure the test is whether it's the same judge, but let me provide what I think the test is."
1995.95-345,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3006.253,3006.544,What.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3006.544,3010.667,The test seems to be a single verdict test.
1995.95-345,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3023.125,3026.177,We don't even have that rule in respect to sentencing.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3030.129,3030.65,--Quite right.
1995.95-345,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3030.65,3032.82,Yes.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3032.82,3034.491,From a single verdict.
1995.95-345,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3052.102,3058.838,"Well, it... actually, the sentencing often involves issues of great significance that were not present in the liability phase."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3058.838,3063.811,"Absolutely, and in fraud cases, for instance, you don't even get to the fine part of the fraud case."
1995.95-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3075.758,3076.339,"Mr. Finer, what--"
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3079.161,3080.603,"We think we do, and for this reason."
1995.95-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3080.603,3083.044,Neither one has an element that the other one doesn't?
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3083.044,3084.245,"Well, yes."
1995.95-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3110.512,3113.762,But it wasn't necessary to prove that offense to get the forfeiture.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3116.165,3117.044,--It may have--
1995.95-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3117.044,3126.671,"Using Blockburger correctly, Blockburger requires that the charge be a charge which would require the same offense."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3126.671,3127.182,--Yes--
1995.95-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3127.182,3129.413,Not simply that factually it happened to be the same one.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3129.413,3130.194,--I quite agree.
1995.95-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3138.089,3138.48,Right.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3138.48,3140.48,But in Blockburger you have to have two offenses.
1995.95-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3142.303,3147.206,"That's right, and just as in the Double Jeopardy Clause you don't have any mention of punishment."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3147.206,3148.207,Well--
1995.95-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3148.207,3151.489,You started to talk about the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3164.686,3171.772,"--To the extent that your question, Justice Scalia, is whether there is a risk of conviction, that's correct."
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3184.541,3186.141,"Mr. Finer, can I give you a specific example--"
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3186.141,3186.471,--Please.
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3186.471,3190.772,--It was one that Justice Scalia suggested in his Kurth Ranch defense... dissent.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3214.258,3215.52,"It can, Your Honor, because I would add--"
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3215.52,3216.361,Because the first one is not penal?
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3216.361,3218.622,"--It would not be, because it would be seen as remedial."
1995.95-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3233.972,3236.173,Why would it be seen as remedial?
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3236.173,3237.284,--It's a--
1995.95-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3237.284,3237.783,Because that gives you the right answer?
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3237.783,3241.877,"--Because it's a disgorgement of a profit in that setting, which is not what the--"
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3241.877,3242.428,"No, it's a fine."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3244.449,3244.769,--All right.
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3244.769,3247.49,I gave you a case of... which is not unusual.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3248.571,3248.892,I misunderstood.
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3248.892,3256.075,"--Is both disbarred and fined, and the fine is meant to be punishing."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3256.075,3256.736,I understand.
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3256.736,3257.628,But it's in a civil setting.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3260.71,3265.132,"I would agree, then, the subsequent prosecution for the same offense would be barred."
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3265.132,3265.853,On the--
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3265.853,3280.723,"It would be a punishment, and a second punishment, or rather the jeopardy of the second punishment, yes, and under the text of the clause, while it does not say punishment in its terms, the life and limb phrase has been long understood to mean a punishment, and the jeopardy part refers to risk."
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3289.208,3291.82,"--Well, the fine doesn't have... come self identifying."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3300.635,3301.156,--So it's--
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3301.156,3302.897,--but it's a fine if you did something bad.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3302.897,3306.309,"--It would not be a label, it would be an analysis that leads to a conclusion."
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3311.404,3312.923,Austin is one case.
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3312.923,3313.314,--Yes.
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3313.314,3319.618,"What I... the example that I brought up, which is not original, is something that I think is pervasive in our system."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3319.618,3320.249,I understand--
1995.95-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3320.249,3327.283,"We have an administrative agency that licenses and sanctions, and then you can have a criminal prosecution for the identical conduct."
1995.95-345,1,30261,jeffry_k_finer,,3327.283,3332.285,"--I agree, and I would use the analysis from that one case, Austin, because the analysis is very workable."
1995.95-345,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3336.429,3337.09,No.
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3346.546,3349.299,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-345,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3441.486,3448.352,"Well, you, like Mr. Finer, didn't mention Various Items in your brief, Mr. Robbins."
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3448.352,3453.494,"Well, I think with all respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe Various Items is self distinguishing."
1995.95-345,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3453.494,3462.611,"Well, but ordinarily we expect counsel, when there's a case that is called to their attention that bears on it, and particularly... to deal with it in some way."
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3462.611,3464.634,"Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm happy--"
1995.95-345,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3464.634,3467.926,You felt it was just so far wide of the mark that it didn't even deserve any mention?
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3467.926,3486.309,"--Well, if I may, Your Honor, my view is that a reading of the case makes clear why it doesn't control and, indeed, has made clear to this Court why it didn't control in the cases that this Court has looked at since that case was decided, and after all, there were a great many cases cited in the Government's 59-page brief."
1995.95-345,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3489.49,3497.145,In what cases subsequent that have distinguished Various Items would you... are you referring to?
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3497.145,3499.098,"--Well, no, I think quite the contrary."
1995.95-345,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3558.137,3564.041,"Are you suggesting that Various Items, if only it had had an innocent owner exception, would have come out differently?"
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3564.041,3564.591,"No, I--"
1995.95-345,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3564.591,3566.391,Then it would have been double jeopardy?
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3566.391,3569.143,"--Well, let me say that's not the only distinction."
1995.95-345,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3575.587,3590.327,"So you have to be really old fashioned, and then you escape the double jeopardy problem, but once you put in an innocent owner exception, then you are in this bind where the forfeiture proceeding will mean you can't bring the criminal action?"
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3590.327,3593.139,"--Well, no, actually Justice Ginsburg, I don't think that's the complete answer."
1995.95-345,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3593.139,3604.977,"Well, you said that putting in the innocent owner exception types that statute as punishment in a way it wouldn't if you just take it away from any old person, innocent or not."
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3604.977,3607.488,"Well, surely that is a point of distinction."
1995.95-345,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3659.521,3660.052,Like Bennis?
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3660.052,3668.707,"--Well, you know, I think, if I may, I don't think Bennis really turns on the same fact... you know, the same issues that are at stake here."
1995.95-345,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3689.051,3711.046,"That seems to me very strange that you would say that a statute that is trying to be modern have an innocent owner exception gets you into the double jeopardy bind, but if it's like the Bennis statute that didn't give you that exception, then you're... then the Government is okay."
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3711.046,3715.888,"Well, again, let me say, I am by no means suggesting that that is the only feature--"
1995.95-345,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3715.888,3716.459,And the other--
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3716.459,3717.31,--in the statute that--
1995.95-345,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3717.31,3743.087,"--In answer to Justice Ginsburg, what the other being... look, the QED analysis, formal analysis, Various Items deals with instrumentalities, Halper didn't deal with instrumentalities, instrumentalities have a pedigree historically, the other didn't, and therefore the other cases deal with excessive punishment, not double jeopardy, so draw the dots, follow the dots, it's never been overruled, and that's the end of the instrumentalities."
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3747.271,3748.46,--My--
1995.95-345,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3748.46,3750.973,"Because you said one was the innocent owner, and the other is--"
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3750.973,3751.633,--Well--
1995.95-345,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3751.633,3753.285,"--You're going to make, which is what I want to hear."
1995.95-345,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3753.285,3758.818,"--Well, not... I think the answer is that 881 (a)(7) has a variety of features that render it punitive."
1995.95-345,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,4492.926,4493.926,Thank you.
