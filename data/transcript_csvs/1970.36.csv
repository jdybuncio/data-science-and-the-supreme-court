1970.36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.585,"The case on for argument this morning is Mackey against the United States, number 36."
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,12.36,16.18,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,370.065,375.655,"Would you clarify it for me here, just what compulsion are you referring to?"
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,379.035,392.791,"If Mr. Mackey had not filed these returns, he could have been indicted for failure to file a return and could have been sentenced to the penitentiary for five years and could have been fined $1,000.00 for each offense."
1970.36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,392.791,395.804,"It’s true of all of us, isn’t it, if we don’t file tax returns?"
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,395.804,396.985,That is correct.
1970.36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,454.915,461.376,"I know this is going over old ground perhaps, but it might help me."
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,490.317,492.56,"In the first instance, no."
1970.36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,548.545,569.26,"And then what about the applications for Government employment which requires many, many answers and that is accompanied by a statute making it a felony, to give a false answer."
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,569.26,569.455,Well --
1970.36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,569.455,573.264,For testing that that statute just someway violates the Fifth Amendment?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,573.264,587.175,"Of course, if you file a false answer, I think the Court has decided that decision just last month in the -- I mean last fall in the cases and (Inaudible) within this area that we are in."
1970.36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,593.676,597.987,But it's right to file a false document at many times is there?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,597.987,599.638,Not if it’s a felony to so file it.
1970.36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,600.982,603.333,"Absent, absent the statute."
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,606.076,606.677,A false document?
1970.36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,606.677,611.001,"Make a false answer, any question?"
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,611.001,613.643,Inherent right to file a false answer?
1970.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,744.42,755.543,"Mr. Ward, what was used here, as I understand it were the excise tax returns, not the gambling statute."
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,755.543,756.583,That is correct.
1970.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,765.541,766.197,Monthly.
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,766.197,766.439,Right.
1970.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,779.206,780.766,Because it was as networth prosecution?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,780.766,791.89,"Precisely, and if this Court is held both in Friedberg and Holland that this is an absolute necessity in such a case because they are purely totally, solely circumstantial evidence cases."
1970.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,933.351,949.344,"Now, it was the Government's theory that the wage -- the monthly wagering tax returns were accurate and that they were inconsistent with his income tax return or that they were inaccurate and so was his income tax return?"
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,949.344,951.583,The Government never took that position Mr. Justice Stewart.
1970.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,951.583,953.754,[Voice overlap] did it not?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,953.754,954.958,I don’t know.
1970.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,973.358,974.951,There was gross receipts?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,974.951,975.632,Right.
1970.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1001.473,1008.094,"Sure in a long trial was a good defense, you got it before the jury that gross receipts are not the same thing as net income, didn’t you?"
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1008.094,1008.865,We did.
1970.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1013.422,1027.961,"So far as his occupation, that is he was a gambler by profession or vocation or revocation, what did he put down in his income tax return with respect to his occupation?"
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1027.961,1030.587,In that particular area?
1970.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1044.238,1045.579,That is source of income?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1045.579,1047.233,"One of the sources of income, yes."
1970.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1047.233,1053.534,Isn’t there a place in the income tax return where you put down -- where you put down your employer if any?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1053.534,1053.738,Yes sir.
1970.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1053.738,1057.21,As you put down your occupation if any or am I mistaken?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1057.21,1060.013,To my knowledge and I know I’m correct in this.
1970.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1062.649,1064.362,Remember what he did say?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1064.362,1069.172,As far as his occupation is concerned?
1970.36,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.859,1173.445,Do you have any (Inaudible)
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1173.445,1183.878,"No I think under the Sullivan case Mr. Justice in Candor, I think under the Sullivan case having put something into schedule C, you waived the privilege."
1970.36,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.516,1193.386,"You say the Government -- schedule C usually requires a person to report his business income, doesn’t it?"
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1193.386,1195.493,"Yes, plus his source."
1970.36,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.493,1201.783,"Yes, plus the source and there he can claim any deductions and --"
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1201.783,1202.82,Yes sir.
1970.36,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.82,1205.555,Did he?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1205.555,1207.629,"The ins and outs situation, no sir."
1970.36,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1210.676,1211.806,State the net figure?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1211.806,1214.769,"The net figure, the taxable income figure."
1970.36,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1214.769,1223.358,"So, do you say the Government may require the income tax formally, you didn’t object to the use of that schedule C information?"
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1223.358,1224.574,"No, no sir."
1970.36,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.574,1226.261,You waived your privilege if you had one?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1226.261,1228.796,"Well, the Sullivan case pretty much teaches you that."
1970.36,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1236.646,1239.981,Mr. Marchetti-Grosso fits into that or not?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1239.981,1246.206,"No, no sir because I think there was a particular finding here and this case mentioned Sullivan and distinguished it in Marchetti-Grosso."
1970.36,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1246.206,1253.119,So the Government may still in the regular income tax form demand that a person state his business and the source of income?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1253.119,1254.194,Except under Sullivan.
1970.36,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1254.194,1256.303,Even if it is gambling?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1256.303,1260.071,"They can demand the source of -- or they can demand the income figures, yes."
1970.36,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1269.733,1271.346,But you didn’t?
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1271.346,1274.181,"In the income tax returns, no sir, no sir."
1970.36,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.534,1304.648,You can normally say they’re like results of other income from whatever we scheduled C that exist.
1970.36,0,46553,william_m_ward,,1304.648,1305.92,But he didn’t.
1970.36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1645.215,1646.322,Mr. Zinn.
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1646.322,1660.099,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court I should like first to set out some additional facts relating to petitioner’s conviction which we believe are essential to this Court’s resolution of the case.
1970.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1679.376,1680.778,How many years involved.
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1680.778,1685.157,"Five years, 1956 through 60 inclusive."
1970.36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1685.157,1693.284,"About $28,000.00 a year is what he was reporting, but he came out with a million dollars at the end."
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1693.284,1705.528,"Well, he started out with assets of roughly $360,000.00 and according to the Government's computation had over a million and a half dollars of assets at the end of the prosecution years."
1970.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2135.578,2137.405,That is not including layoffs.
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2137.405,2138.155,That’s right.
1970.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2179.916,2182.641,"What is this schedule C, it is what?"
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2182.641,2187.763,"Income from a business or profession, it is filed by an individual proprietor."
1970.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2187.763,2188.392,Self employed?
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2188.392,2193.518,"Yes, someone who is employed wouldn’t have to bother with that form."
1970.36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2193.518,2213.792,"Mr. Ward, at least I thought I heard him say that this form that you are referring to now, the tax on wagering is a scheme of Federal Government from the sole purpose of forcing people to disclose their illegal activities."
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2216.455,2220.062,I believe you did Mr. Chief Justice and I hope to –-
1970.36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2220.062,2223.549,"The tax is 10% of the gross, isn’t it?"
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2223.549,2225.375,Yes sir.
1970.36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2226.695,2232.246,This is something it looks something like a reverent measure I should think.
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2232.246,2263.866,"The Court said in Marchetti and Grosso that this was a revenue measure, but that because of the inter relationship of the wagering tax information that had to be furnished and the comprehensive scheme of federal and states statutes prohibiting gambling and gambling related activities that the privilege would be a complete defense if the forms were not filed."
1970.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2376.03,2376.485,Is this deducted?
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2376.485,2378.632,Yes it is Mr. Justice.
1970.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2378.632,2379.305,The 10% of excise tax --
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2379.305,2380.302,"Yes, it is and it was --"
1970.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2380.302,2383.705,-- and gambling or it is deductible from your income in computing your income capacity.
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2383.705,2385.713,It is the cost of doing business.
1970.36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2407.78,2413.211,Could you have made your case if you had merely focused on the deduction taken on the general tax return?
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2413.211,2416.803,I think very frankly Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2434.616,2439.657,"Is ordinary, is regular when you speak of income tax returns, you’re distinguishing --"
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2439.657,2447.436,"From the wagering tax forms, the schedule C and we have asked the Government prosecutor why did you pushed to put this in."
1970.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2480.015,2483.389,And it could have been computed by --
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2483.389,2495.027,"Multiplying the excise tax deduction by 10 and subtracting from the product of that multiplication, the figure that was shown as gross receipts on the income tax returns."
1970.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2526.762,2543.09,"Right or wrong, however, what you are telling us is that the wagering tax returns do show a much higher annual gross receipts than he reported as just total annual gross receipts for anyone with these taxable years."
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2543.09,2544.141,"That is right, but they all --"
1970.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2544.141,2547.885,But he did use this or at least was usable as a part of your substantive case.
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2547.885,2548.496,That’s right.
1970.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2548.496,2551.858,Much more than just showing his profession as a gambler?
1970.36,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2551.858,2567.712,"Yes, but the fact is Mr. Justice Stewart that defense counsel had a point in saying this could have been computed by multiplying the excise tax deduction which was also on the income tax returns by 10."
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,3694.745,3702.559,"Mr. Chief Justice, on many occasions, the Assistant Solicitor General said that is not the case and that is quite true."
1970.36,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3755.327,3765.057,"You have mentioned that I think three times now, is there anything remarkable about taking not many days to review a case that has 865 exhibits?"
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,3765.057,3766.44,"I think so, yes sir."
1970.36,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3772.108,3776.485,And how do you read all that materials in much less time?
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,3776.485,3788.801,"Well, I question how much they really - they might have read it a quite number and quite a lot of it was foundation evidence, evidence that didn’t necessarily had to be read but had to be in for the purposes of providing the foundation for the exhibit evidence."
1970.36,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3910.948,3920.939,"But Mr. Ward, what about the claim or the deduction that was legitimately an evidence, right?"
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,3920.939,3927.422,"Well, that was the claim I believe of the Mr. Mackey’s defense lawyer at trial that all of the evidence --"
1970.36,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3927.422,3931.852,"No, maybe he made a specific with -- in his return, you said --"
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,3931.852,3935.324,Are we talking about the wagering tax return Mr. Justice or the --
1970.36,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3935.324,3936.174,Income tax.
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,3936.174,3937.553,Income tax return.
1970.36,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3937.553,3941.164,He said that I pay the tax for wages.
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,3941.164,3942.529,Correct.
1970.36,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3942.529,3946.894,"And all you have to do is one part of a 10, and you got to figure out."
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,3946.894,3949.56,That is what the defense lawyer argued.
1970.36,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3950.223,3952.579,Do you find any fault with that?
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,3952.579,3957.487,"I think you should have wanted at the time, yes, but having lost it having lost the argument."
1970.36,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3957.487,3959.461,I am not saying it lost.
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,3977.504,3979.245,In the wagering tax return?
1970.36,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3979.245,3979.932,No sir.
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,3979.932,3982.968,"In the income -- no, there was no coercion there."
1970.36,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3983.558,3997.382,"And wouldn't it be proper for the prosecutor to argue to the jury you quote the statute, this is what it means, we multiply it by 10 and we have got that much of admitted gross income."
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,3997.382,3998.749,"He could have, yes."
1970.36,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4003.347,4007.5,This is not just harmless error --
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,4007.5,4012.004,"No, I think not because I think that you cannot have a person testify against himself."
1970.36,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4039.55,4046.793,"But at that time, there was no objections made to the introduction of the wagering tax forms on the Fifth Amendment grounds, is that correct?"
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,4046.793,4048.545,That is correct Your Honor.
1970.36,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4071.463,4073.458,"But you have one now, you think?"
1970.36,2,46553,william_m_ward,,4073.458,4074.418,"Yes, yes."
