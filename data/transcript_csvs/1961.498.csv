1961.498,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,16.725,"Number 498, in the matter of criminal contempt of Thomas C. McConnell, Petitioner."
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,20.473,27.817,Mr. Chief Justice Warren and may it please the Court.
1961.498,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,463.152,464.568,Is that -- is that in the record?
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,464.568,465.858,"Yes, that's in the record."
1961.498,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,465.858,476.517,What page?
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,476.517,480.101,Page 598 of the transcript of proceedings.
1961.498,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1057.378,1058.76,What volume is that in?
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1058.76,1063.11,It's volume 3.
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1118.071,1120.734,How far does your theory go in this respect?
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1157.646,1157.929,Yes.
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1157.929,1158.01,-- exactly in the same situation?
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1158.01,1160.465,I don't -- I don't think I have any right to do that.
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1160.465,1166.714,"Well, we're assuming that the -- that the judge's order was entirely unlawful, that it – that it was entirely contrary to the law of evidence."
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1166.714,1168.394,"If it was assumed that it was unlawful, yes."
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1168.394,1169.93,That was the assumption of my question.
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1169.93,1177.035,"But, I don't think that court sort of an order would be unlawful under the rule because, there, I have the record and chance to make the record."
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1188.429,1190.495,I still don't understand the answer to my question.
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1211.609,1212.709,Not at all.
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1212.709,1213.84,"Well, what is -– what is your point?"
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1213.84,1226.519,"My theory is that, if the order which he enters is not just an erroneous order, not just an erroneous ruling on the question of evidence --"
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1226.519,1228.317,"What, very erroneous?"
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1228.317,1250.394,"No, not very -- not a degree of erroneousness, but where a rule is promulgated, where he is supposedly bound by that rule himself and he sets that rule aside over the objection of all counsel, of counsel on the other side, where I can't make a record because the rule says how I can make the offer."
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1259.769,1260.502,How does that differ?
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1262.493,1264.252,"Well, it differs from your case because --"
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1264.252,1269.814,"Let's assume your whole case collapses without the testimony of this witness, in my hypothetical case."
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1269.814,1293.497,"Well, in your hypothetical case, I could still make the record on review because if I'm refused -- if I am erroneously refused the opportunity of asking a question, I can assign error on that and I -- but how can I assign error on an offer of proof which wasn't made and the upper court says, it isn't in the record so it doesn't consider."
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1305.505,1308.139,"Well, all rules of law are supposed to be binding on the court as well as counsel."
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1308.139,1319.067,"I know but they are -- they give room for difference of -- or there can be an error of it, one way another, but where it cuts down -- cuts away the very fundamental rules of your rights in the court."
1961.498,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1604.641,1606.045,"May I ask you Mr. McConnell, under --"
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1606.045,1607.726,-- contention of this Court.
1961.498,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1607.726,1610.306,"I gather, you're a member of the Illinois Bar, is that it?"
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1610.306,1611.335,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1611.335,1611.422,Is --
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1611.422,1613.453,It's been a member for 37 years.
1961.498,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1613.453,1618.243,May this conviction be the predicate of any disciplinary proceedings in the Illinois Bar?
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1618.243,1620.451,I can't answer that.
1961.498,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1633.59,1651.958,"Mr. McConnell, do I understand that after -- after this colloquy that you're taught -- you've talked about and after you -- you were prevented from asking these questions, that the judge later reversed himself and did allow some of these questions that need to be answered?"
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1651.958,1663.135,"He did -- he did and Judge Duffy refers to that and says that ""my objection bore fruit,"" that it did result in such, but I never got back to these questions."
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1682.926,1686.388,"What did that have to do with the issue which had been segregated, the issue of public trial?"
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1686.388,1713.447,"It had absolutely nothing to do with that issue, Your Honor, but I took the position that that irrelevant issue prevented me from introducing the evidence of conspiracy and monopoly which I had alleged and sought to prove, and the only way I could make a record for review up above was to show that I had the evidence of conspiracy and monopoly which, if I had been permitted to show it, it would have resulted in a prima facie case for the plaintiff."
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1713.447,1726.921,"Well, I thought under the trial judge's theory which you say was erroneous, that the issue of public damage was to be segregate and tried first and that the -- all the conspiracy issues were to be tried later."
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1726.921,1731.481,"Well, we couldn't try any conspiracy issue unless we won the irrelevant issues."
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1738.203,1738.258,I understand.
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1738.258,1740.213,It's erroneous in the Radiant Burners case --
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1740.213,1740.642,I understand.
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1740.642,1742.701,"-- and said it's specific, and the per curiae --"
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1742.701,1747.378,And what you're trying to get in didn't have anything to do with the -- with the issue which he had said to --
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1747.378,1748.042,Not a thing to do with that issue.
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1748.042,1749.041,-- to try it separately.
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1749.041,1750.858,I said that was irrelevant.
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1758.974,1759.352,I see.
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1759.352,1760.122,-- on that issue.
1961.498,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1760.122,1760.394,I understand.
1961.498,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1760.394,1764.18,That's what I was trying to do.
1961.498,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1949.384,1956.743,Mr. Monahan.
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1956.743,1961.953,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1961.498,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2790.79,2802.097,"Mr. Monahan, was this -- was this colloquy outside of the -- the presence of the jury, that you've been reading, or was it in the presence of the jury?"
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,2802.097,2809.691,"Up to the point, beginning with that -- with remarks about plain to the galleries, do you recall that?"
1961.498,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2809.691,2810.053,Yes.
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,2810.053,2812.252,"Up to that, it was in the presence of jury."
1961.498,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2812.252,2813.926,I see.
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,2813.926,2822.479,"And, those remarks, beginning at that point, was in a recess which had been declared where the jury had departed, but where the attorneys were still present."
1961.498,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2822.479,2824.107,Yes.
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,2824.107,2853.352,"Now, Judge Duffy, in his dissent, says he agrees that the statement, the allegedly contemptuous statement, was offensive and he said Mr. McConnell certainly should have apologized to the court after the recess but if -- but, he said no contempt occurred because there was no obstruction of justice."
1961.498,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3077.725,3084.546,This is a -- this is a case in New York where the procedure could have been under 42 (a)?
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3084.546,3087.478,"It was under 42 (a), sir."
1961.498,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3091.954,3093.583,Deferred some issues of the procedure.
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3093.583,3094.073,"Pardon me, sir?"
1961.498,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3094.073,3095.205,Deferred some issues.
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3095.205,3103.271,"Yes, just as in Sacher, that's exactly what happened in Sacher, sir."
1961.498,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3104.366,3111.166,There was -- there was no hearing on -- no hearing on this at the time he was sentenced to -- before the sentence.
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3111.166,3113.924,"That is correct, sir."
1961.498,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3136.167,3139.775,What was the court obstruction?
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3139.775,3156.427,"The obstruction to the court basically, Mr. Justice Black, was the defiance of the authority of the court in the presence of the jury thereby demeaning the authority of the court publicly."
1961.498,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3167.696,3169.239,What case moves that now?
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3175.272,3179.237,"Well, now, for -- for example, if Your Honor --"
1961.498,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3179.237,3184.282,That does not have to be an actual obstruction of justice.
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3184.282,3193.391,"For example, if Your Honor will recall in McGuinness against United States which was here several years ago on petition for certiorari --"
1961.498,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3193.391,3194.076,Which one?
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3194.076,3225.137,"McGuinness, where the alleged contempt was the defense counsel saying to the court in the presence of the jury, after the judge had asked a question -- a certain question of a defense witness that the defense thought was objectionable, defense counsel said “Your Honor ought to be ashamed of himself for asking such a question and should cite himself for contempt for doing so.”"
1961.498,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3241.377,3248.351,Then you rest your case only on the fact that what he said was of such nature that it would demean the judge.
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3248.351,3250.977,"Not entirely, if it were necessary."
1961.498,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3272.396,3289.856,"Well, if it was the demeaning of the judge, what do you think about the cases that indicate that a man who has a personal interest, by reason of having been abused, thinking his reputation has ended, that he should not try the case?"
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3289.856,3318.563,"Well, I think that that is an arguable position, Mr. Justice Black, but I think that has been foreclosed by the Sacher decision because, certainly, Judge Medina was baited and insulted in that case far more than happened in this case and at much greater length, but this Court held that Judge Medina had the power to act summarily at the end of the trial."
1961.498,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3318.563,3323.128,What about the latest case?
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3323.128,3324.888,"Do you have any in particular mind, sir?"
1961.498,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3324.888,3327.555,"What about the case you said didn't cover, Offutt?"
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3327.555,3329.489,Offutt.
1961.498,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3352.133,3361.987,How long did this wrangling go on?
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3361.987,3368.504,"I would say that if, by wrangling, you mean something of the nature of what happened in the Offutt case, sir."
1961.498,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3368.504,3370.419,I mean by what happened here.
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3370.419,3371.619,It did not go on at all.
1961.498,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3373.393,3374.676,Do you think no wrangling?
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3374.676,3374.83,No.
1961.498,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3397.963,3401.368,Do you think the defendant wrangled?
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3401.368,3402.616,Do I think that the --
1961.498,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3402.616,3405.336,Do you think the other side wrangled in as a lawyer?
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3405.524,3405.721,Well --
1961.498,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3405.721,3407.788,-- there was no wrangling.
1961.498,1,38107,philip_r_monahan,,3407.788,3428.002,"I think that the petitioner made statements which the trial judge and the Court of Appeals unanimously, with reason, found overstepped the bounds of propriety and were contemptuous."
