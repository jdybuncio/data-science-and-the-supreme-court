1977.76-839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,24.49,We will hear arguments next in 76-839 Foley against Connelie.
1977.76-839,0,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,27.056,30.406,Mr. Chief justice and may it please this Court.
1977.76-839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,68.793,75.396,Who were the constituents in the discrete insular minority that Justice Stone referred to?
1977.76-839,0,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,75.396,80.889,"In that case they were not aliens, they were -- you are talking about footnote 4, I take it."
1977.76-839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,96.351,101.221,In fact what were they in Justice Stone's --
1977.76-839,0,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,101.221,108.625,"I do not recall this, Your Honor, I do recall they were not aliens."
1977.76-839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,108.625,110.016,That was in the Carolene Products.
1977.76-839,0,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,110.016,111.788,"Yes, it is footnote 4 in Carolene Products."
1977.76-839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,111.788,119.132,I think the footnote was kind of not necessary perhaps to the decision of that case.
1977.76-839,0,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,119.132,126.424,"No, I agree Your Honor, and I was not relying upon the footnote number 4, Carolene Products but rather description."
1977.76-839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,126.424,128.393,In Justice Blackmun's opinion to the Court.
1977.76-839,0,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,128.393,129.102,That is right.
1977.76-839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,151.443,181.242,"Do you think there is a difference between a discrete insular group whether minority or otherwise, when they are -- let us say American-Indians or Negros or women or men who cannot change their condition, that is one kind of a discrete insular group."
1977.76-839,0,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,185.726,187.246,"They can, they cannot."
1977.76-839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,212.387,218.608,As I understand the record Mr. Foley could not become a citizen in time to meet the age requirement.
1977.76-839,0,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,218.608,225.399,That is correct and therefore this is a status which he and others like him are unable to change.
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1050.235,1052.874,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1977.76-839,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1091.176,1092.158,You say there is none.
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1092.158,1107.482,"There is no such issue Your Honor and that is for the reason that the case was brought as a Class Action of all permanent resident aliens, and I should note here Your Honor that of course there is no issue with respect to any other types of aliens, temporary resident aliens or illegal aliens."
1977.76-839,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1122.963,1125.318,Did the District Court certify a class action?
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1125.318,1137.0,"Yes, Your Honor and that is the class essentially as I have given it to you and it appears in the District Court opinion, the majority opinion at pages A 3-4 of the Appendix to the jurisdiction of statement."
1977.76-839,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1169.111,1171.444,What is the page number that you gave us?
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1171.444,1178.706,It is A 3through 4 of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement.
1977.76-839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.416,1209.528,"Well, Ms. Gordon this class is a little different at least and it is a little broader than the one you identified, it talks about the plaintiff and all other alien residents in the State of New York who have applied or will apply for the position of State trooper."
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1219.048,1228.414,Your Honor I think that it expressly implied and the -- I am just trying to find the original stipulation Your Honor.
1977.76-839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1228.414,1242.955,But on A3 and A4 that is what it says.
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1242.955,1246.961,If Your Honor looks at the beiges Appendix D22.
1977.76-839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1246.961,1247.647,D22?
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1247.647,1250.223,Right.
1977.76-839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1269.982,1274.569,And I suppose all permanent resident aliens implies that they are not illegal aliens.
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1274.569,1276.707,"Yes, and that they are not temporary aliens, Your Honor."
1977.76-839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1276.707,1278.745,And certainly permanent means they are not temporary?
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1280.321,1315.481,"Right, and as I was just indicating to you because the age of the appellant was not raised below, because his entering status was not raised below and it was the date of his permanent resident status was not raised below, there was no dilemma hypothicated before the District Court -- and obviously the District Court majority so proceeded in fact if you look at Judge Mansfield's dissent, you will find the reference to the alleged dilemma footnoted in his opinion as a point raised in the appellant's reply brief before that court after the case was --."
1977.76-839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1315.481,1316.794,And this class --
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1316.794,1320.693,"And this class, in other words there was no --"
1977.76-839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1320.693,1322.738,Inevitably include some in that dilemma.
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1322.738,1340.982,"It might very well includes some in that dilemma but the dilemma, the specific one that appellant seeks to argue even if you concede him the facts that he now alleges in his reply brief namely that he cured a permanent resident status in 1974 and that he will be 30 years old in 1980 he now alleges."
1977.76-839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1340.982,1350.768,But this class by definition of those who would otherwise be eligible to compete for employment would include all resident aliens up to age 29.
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1350.768,1350.953,That is correct.
1977.76-839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1350.953,1357.091,And obviously would include therefore many who could not become nationalized citizens before they were too old to apply.
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1357.091,1358.384,That is correct it would.
1977.76-839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1358.384,1359.053,It is inevitably --.
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1359.053,1377.028,"If that might be so except with respect to this named plaintiff it is not so because based on his new facts as alleged since he will not to be 30 until 1980 and since he can become citizen in 1979, he could be fully qualified to compete in the next examination series, that is the point."
1977.76-839,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1379.548,1387.399,"Well, if the effect becomes critical or may there not be some problem with the breadth of the class certification."
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1387.399,1401.546,If that is the issue Your Honor it would become -- there would be a problem with the breadth of the class certification and it is our position here that the class certification cannot be modified to admit of what are essentially new allegations by the plaintiff.
1977.76-839,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1438.807,1467.915,"But what if what if this court were to hold that all though as to aliens who fulfill their residency requirement and could becomes citizens before their 29th birthday, there is no denial of Equal Protection worked by the New York Statute as to those in the class that appellant alleges he is in, those who can not become citizens by their 29th birthday there is a discrimination."
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1472.124,1475.245,It would seem that the court would have to avoid it Your Honor except that I think.
1977.76-839,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1475.245,1476.369,How do we avoid it.
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1476.369,1487.406,"Well, you would obviously have to -- it was my view Your Honor that you could not change the class certification and the class certification framed the issue in the case and accordingly this dilemma was not reached."
1977.76-839,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1508.39,1510.847,And if you win you do not worry about it at all?
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1510.847,1512.103,That's right Your Honor.
1977.76-839,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1512.103,1515.892,And that is why I think you should be gaining.
1977.76-839,1,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1515.892,1516.203,Your Honor.
1977.76-839,2,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,2801.842,2804.564,Yes.
1977.76-839,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2856.56,2867.06,"Are you suggesting that the army, the military services could not exclude aliens from military police duty."
1977.76-839,2,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,2867.06,2870.703,"No, I am not suggesting, I am saying they do not Your Honor."
1977.76-839,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2870.703,2872.31,That is under choice and discussion.
1977.76-839,2,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,2872.31,2883.484,"Yes, but that was issue as to whether or not there were police departments which in fact continued because of the uniform policy across the country."
1977.76-839,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3001.923,3005.7,"And of course lawyers can make arrests per se, can they?"
1977.76-839,2,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,3005.7,3011.724,"They cannot but the police officers cannot be no republics, file affirmations in court and do the all sort of things."
1977.76-839,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3011.724,3014.26,"Well they might have, if they became notorious public."
1977.76-839,2,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,3014.26,3016.798,They would have they have kind of different status to do it.
1977.76-839,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3020.965,3031.856,"What is your view of the so called citizens arrest which has been (Inaudible) if not our law, would an alien not be able to make a citizens arrest."
1977.76-839,2,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,3031.856,3034.045,I would not know the answer to that.
1977.76-839,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3048.661,3051.269,Do you think an alien can make a citizens arrest?
1977.76-839,2,33431,jonathan_a_weiss,,3051.269,3054.749,I would think not by definition.
1977.76-839,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3063.723,3064.45,Thank you counsel.
