1969.103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.141,"Number 103, United States against Armour & Company."
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,40.481,43.955,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1969.103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.963,454.449,Did the Government's request to the District Court subsume a request to amend the decree?
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,454.449,460.282,Not in terms and of course this is the -- I think the semantic problem that is at the heart of this case.
1969.103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,461.713,476.898,"Let's assume the Government had taken the approach that we think the decree should be amended expressly to prohibit matters like these, would any different kind of a hearing or any different kind of procedure then required?"
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,476.898,497.139,I think we would contend that there would not be any requirement for different kind of procedure on the theory that I of course will elaborate that we think that in a very real sense the four corners of this decree do provide a rather clear condemnation of this kind of situation.
1969.103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,497.139,497.683,"Well,let's --"
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,497.683,508.774,"In other words, we're not -- the Government's theory of the case to approach it in another way has not been based upon any sort of change in facts other than of course the undisputed facts it takes."
1969.103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,508.774,529.579,"What if you -- if you accepted the fact that the purpose of the decree was to prohibit an alliance of any kind between the Armour entity and any of the other described entities then it wouldn't make much difference whether you amended it or just interpreted it, would it?"
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,529.579,542.684,"No I think not, and of course I could make further observation that it seems a little strange and inconsistent with traditional equitable theories for a decree to say nobody in the world shall takeover this company."
1969.103,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,549.322,554.756,"For now, as a matter of interpretation."
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,559.673,568.564,"Yes, but what we say -- I was just addressing myself to the question of whether the presence or absence of such language in a decree would make any difference."
1969.103,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,582.419,596.707,Are you suggesting here that the tendered by Host stimulated or initiated or originated and collaborated in by Armour?
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,596.707,599.698,"No, it's undisputed that the opposite is the situation."
1969.103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,620.118,630.201,Doesn't that overlook the fact that traditionally and ordinarily you have to have a party in order to reach them with relief?
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,630.201,648.612,"Well, of course the Section 5 of the Sherman Act specifically does provide and this was relied upon by the Government below that whenever the interests of justice shall so require, the Court may bring in additional parties."
1969.103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,648.612,655.019,Did you follow that procedure that Mr. Justice White suggested?
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,655.019,655.201,Oh!
1969.103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.019,659.586,[Inaudible]
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,659.586,667.793,"Yes, General Host and of course Section 5 permits that to be done as a procedural matter and establishes the Court's jurisdiction over --"
1969.103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,667.793,671.081,Was General Host in existence in 1920?
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,671.081,677.607,I believe that its predecessor General Baking Company I think it was incorporated in 1911.
1969.103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,775.582,782.079,I didn't read the District Court as saying it was without the jurisdiction of power?
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,782.079,785.843,"It's not clear that it did, if it did I think it was wrong."
1969.103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,790.225,792.155,That is between you and your --
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,792.155,794.777,"I believe that so, yes."
1969.103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1030.415,1034.025,There were originally five corporate defendants?
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1034.025,1039.042,"Five, it soon became four through the merger of Morris into Armour."
1969.103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1039.042,1044.637,And I suppose there are other large meatpackers?
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1044.637,1046.478,Armour is number two I believe.
1969.103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1047.882,1048.819,Cudahy --
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1048.819,1050.084,Cudahy is quite a bit smaller.
1969.103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1050.084,1052.35,I don't know what the other is.
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1062.514,1063.223,I think that might have been --
1969.103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1063.223,1069.359,"-- and if General Host had taken it over, would you be here saying that this decree should cover that situation?"
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1069.359,1081.408,"No, no, I think not and whether we could have a theory that the decree ought to be modified, I think it will be very hard for them to hold, but of course, that's the situation that arises in the case of any decree."
1969.103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1083.015,1083.77,It might have been --
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1083.77,1083.876,[Voice Overlap]] historic violation --
1969.103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1083.876,1086.491,It might be an original lawsuit against that situation?
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1086.491,1089.271,"Yes certainly, but historic violations --"
1969.103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1089.271,1092.068,And that certainly might be true here too?
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1092.068,1114.657,"Yes, but old violations do give raise to perpetual decrees and of course there is a ground for modification, if the defendant subject to the initial decree can prove that there are at some serious competitive disadvantages because of drastic changes in the market."
1969.103,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1114.657,1120.11,Is this that same old consent decree that's been with us about 40 years?
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1120.11,1122.969,"50 years, Mr. Justice Black."
1969.103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1299.651,1310.538,"Well, all those things are good arguments for proceeding against General Host perhaps in an independent proceeding, independent action?"
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1310.538,1311.186,I think --
1969.103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1311.186,1326.783,"If it's fundamentally, fundamentally unwise, unsound to have these two branches of the food industry combined, that can be reached in other ways in this case."
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1326.783,1335.276,"Yes, of course there are problems and I'm told enormous problems in the traditional Section 7 action in a case like this."
1969.103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1467.49,1477.341,"There are some suggestions I saw I guess in the brief or that this is a transitory or impermanent situation, that Greyhound is in the picture somewhere?"
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1477.341,1480.708,"Greyhound is in the picture, yes."
1969.103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1542.127,1561.177,"If General Host were to enjoined as a party, if the motions have been granted, would the scope of that litigation have been as broad as if General Host had been proceeded against independently?"
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1561.177,1564.798,"If I have said would this the same amount, with that same kind of proceeding trial have been held?"
1969.103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1564.798,1567.608,[Voice Overlap]
1969.103,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1567.608,1582.88,We say that under these circumstances there are no undisputed facts that are pertinent to the proposition that the Government is seeking to establish that the four corners of the decree prohibit this situation.
1969.103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1595.812,1598.159,"Very well, Mr. Springer."
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,1603.597,1607.184,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.103,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1653.257,1660.999,"And the agreement provided for the sale by General Host to Greyhound of General Host's interest in Armour, is that right?"
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,1660.999,1662.698,That's correct.
1969.103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1712.003,1722.982,That should permit -- the present statute permits the Department of Justice to intervene in the Interstate Commerce Commission proceedings?
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,1722.982,1741.65,I suspect that the Department of Justice can intervene or move to be heard as amicus or make their presence felt at the ICC in a way that their views would made known at the ICC.
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1944.401,1971.408,Mr. Bergson what would the -- what would you say if the original decree had said that Armour can acquire any stock in a baking company and no baking company can acquire any stock in Armour and then this transaction took place and the United States applied to the Court for an order preventing General Host from -- which had never been a party to the case --
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,1971.408,1973.888,That's right.
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.888,1977.062,-- to prevent General Host from acquiring stock in Armour?
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,1977.062,1987.214,I think that under those circumstances General Host would be entitled to a hearing as to whether or not that type of order should have been entered in the first place.
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1994.662,2011.338,So you say no parties do -- no parties to injunction suits can be held in contempt or even have the order amended to apply to them without re-litigating the basic factors of the injunction?
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2011.338,2011.998,Oh!
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2015.76,2017.928,"I agree, I know, that's what I say."
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2026.255,2029.464,You can't be held in contempt to that injunction.
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2029.464,2030.47,And nobody has attempted to hold --
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2030.47,2032.467,And the department concedes that.
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2032.467,2034.724,"Yes, and nobody has attempted to hold General Host in contempt."
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2034.724,2047.245,"But, I don't think that they can be made subject to the injunctive provisions without having a hearing as to whether or not they should have been made."
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.245,2056.534,"You mean, without having a hearing as to whether or not on the whole basic substance of the injunction case?"
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2056.534,2078.344,"Well, whether or not this case was based primarily on a proclivity by these meatpackers to violate the antitrust laws, that they had a long standing conspiracy that and it encompassed not only horizontal agreements among them, but vertical agreements."
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.182,2146.7,Let's suppose that General Host and Armour made a contract to sell a large amount of treasury stock of General Host to Armour and the Government applied for an order against both Armour and General Host.
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2146.7,2148.554,I don't have any problem with that Your Honor.
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.554,2151.578,"But why wouldn't you, because the the order against General Host?"
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2151.578,2164.409,"Because they -- I think an injunction is applicable to not only to the parties, but anybody in proclivity or acting in consent with the parties and under the circumstances that you postulated they would be acting in consent."
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.409,2171.045,So there's a non-party being subjective to the injunction without being able to re-litigate anything?
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2171.045,2174.765,But he is doing in privity with the --
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.765,2181.597,"Alright, that's the way you characterize it but nevertheless that's a non-party being subjected to --"
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2181.597,2184.769,I think I can state my position this way.
1969.103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2243.357,2257.854,"You're suggesting about joining all the food companies in the country, at least I took it that way, joining all the food producers in the country, grocery producers isn't really very realistic, is it?"
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2257.854,2264.023,I don't believe that's the -- I don't believe you correctly characterized my suggestion.
1969.103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2266.842,2268.004,Something that you said.
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2268.004,2268.627,No.
1969.103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2268.627,2280.556,"The intimation I got at least and perhaps you better clear that up that if they wanted to take this position, they should have joined General Host and a whole lot of other people similarly situated?"
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2280.556,2282.747,"Well, that's right."
1969.103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2287.337,2290.646,"Well, it's a rhetorical position on your part then to make your point I take it?"
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2290.646,2292.422,That's right.
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.238,2598.659,Is that the Prince Family?
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2598.659,2604.456,"That's the Prince Family, yes Your Honor and our brief points out what the stock holdings were."
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2626.622,2631.695,You don't think it would make any difference if General Host acquires 100% of the stock?
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2631.695,2632.883,Oh no.
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.883,2635.111,You think the district judge thought that would have made a difference?
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2635.111,2638.609,"No, I do not believe that he thought that that would make a difference."
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2639.339,2647.718,You seem to emphasize the lack of the possibility immediately of General Host getting control of the board?
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2647.718,2675.436,"No, but I think what he went on to say however that he did not find that control itself would be bad and that if General Host abused its control and caused Armour to violate the decree come on back, and I'll enjoin it quick as a flash, but mere ownership doesn't cause Armour to violate the decree."
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.436,2685.92,What -- what kind of a hearing would you say that you required for the Government to [Inaudible] amendment?
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2685.92,2695.787,"Well, what happened -- there are a couple of precedents in this area."
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2734.202,2738.582,To effectuate what Mr. Bergson?
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2738.582,2744.832,To effectuate what the Government claims with the purposes of this decree.
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.832,2746.762,"Well, what do you think the purpose of --"
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2746.762,2747.307,The purpose of --
1969.103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2747.307,2758.809,You apparently deny that one of the purposes that you effect to separate the meatpackers and other food processors?
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2758.809,2786.863,"No, I say that it was -- it was -- the purpose of it was to prevent proven or admitted violators who had used their power in the past from using it in the future which is done in many, many antitrust cases, but we are non-proven violator and we are a non-proven violator or non-admitted violator."
1969.103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2786.863,2803.131,"You don't treat it as a blanket prohibition in the terms that Mr. Justice White has postulated that food processors, bakers, non-meat food processors should never be in combination with meatpackers?"
1969.103,1,26627,herbert_a_bergson,,2803.131,2818.043,"Oh no, I don't think anything in this decree, anything in this decree prohibits the largest beef packer in the country today, this isn't in the record but I hope you'll pardon, but Mr. Justice Stewart, I think asked this question."
1969.103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2918.573,2920.348,"Thank you, Mr. Bergson."
1969.103,2,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2925.35,2928.901,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1969.103,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3259.03,3260.06,Thank you Mr. Springer.
