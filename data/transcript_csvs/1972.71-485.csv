1972.71-485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.778,"We’ll hear this morning in 71-485, Gottschalk, Commissioner of Patents against Benson and Tabbot."
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,46.207,50.911,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1972.71-485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,76.655,85.815,"Very well, must they not have the digital computer as part of this combination in order to make the whole thing meaningful?"
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,93.396,111.86,"No, our bet is precisely -- our contention Mr. Chief Justice is that what respondents have claimed here is simply a set of steps to be carried out in a machine. They have tried to link the claim that they have made to the machinery a number of ways but our contention which I will shortly develop --"
1972.71-485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,111.86,116.327,"They’re interdependent, aren’t they?"
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,116.327,120.298,Our contention is that the mathematical procedure which respondents are claiming.
1972.71-485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,126.332,127.45,"Interdependent, I said."
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,127.45,131.237,"No, independent is our -- is precisely our claim and I will develop that shortly."
1972.71-485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,986.153,994.244,"Mr. Stone, don’t they at least still limit the scope of the patent to the computer field?"
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,994.244,1013.209,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it is not entirely clear whether there claim is limited to operation in the computer field because the only words in that -- in one of their claims they refer to shifting in a shift register and that is a word which is probably related at least to general purpose digital computers."
1972.71-485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.974,1063.746,Wouldn’t you agree with the question of Chief Justice that outside of the computer field there are simply no utility for that thing?
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1063.746,1100.234,"I would agree that outside of the computer field that there was no general utility known right now for this process other than carrying out calculations on a computer but that is such -- data processing itself is such an abstract science and its really a -- its the science of finding answers to mathematical problems and it’s an inherently, the information that is fed into a data processor is inherently non patentable in the most extreme sense in which we don’t allow patents on scientific and mathematical ideas."
1972.71-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.234,1102.383,Is the computer itself patentable?
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1102.383,1112.967,"Yes, the computer is certainly patentable and had respondents claimed a computer for carrying out this process which was new and useful and non-obvious, they certainly could have been given a patent but what they can’t get is a patent for --"
1972.71-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.967,1125.664,Assuming they’re having done any computers until they invented one to make this conversion?
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1125.664,1131.169,"Well, I suppose they could have -- if they have invented the computer, they could certainly have claimed the computer."
1972.71-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1131.169,1133.773,And you just think they haven’t claim the computer?
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1133.773,1136.291,They haven’t claim the computer because they haven’t invented the computer --
1972.71-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1136.291,1151.34,"Well, assume -- assume if -- if there haven’t been any computers and they invented the computer to carry out this process and that was patentable, why is that -- why isn’t this against the background of the existing computers, why is this a new piece of an old machine?"
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1151.34,1153.038,No.
1972.71-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1163.051,1165.981,Assuming something it never did before although to put it that --
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1165.981,1171.897,No more than an adding machine is doing something it never did before anymore when it adds a series of numbers that’s never added before.
1972.71-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.897,1179.797,"But well, until this process was discovered, computers have never done this particular operation had it?"
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1182.516,1195.103,"Well, Mr. Justice White the analogy which we used in our brief and I think that this is the appropriate analogy, is an old play of piano and which carries out, which plays songs when piano rolls are inserted into it."
1972.71-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.774,1234.516,When a computer is programmed to give this answer it isn’t the same machine as it is when it isn’t program?
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1234.516,1237.392,It’s precisely the same machine Mr. Justice White.
1972.71-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.277,1243.551,But why put in -- why put in the instructions then?
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1243.551,1246.519,I don’t understand what the connection between those two propositions is.
1972.71-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.438,1269.347,"Well, you certainly do reduce the programs doing nothing."
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1269.347,1270.035,I don’t reduce --
1972.71-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1270.035,1272.206,They don’t add a thing to a computer.
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1272.206,1286.087,"I don’t reduce into nothing, the math -- the underlying mathematical discoveries that are involved with them maybe extremely ingenious and extremely important and extremely useful but they don’t add anything to a computer, they are mathematical calculation which a computer is already there to carry out."
1972.71-485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1311.183,1327.876,"Mr. Stone, when scientists and physicians and researchers have put together a known substances which perform a totally new function that is it will open up or close up particular valve in the heart for example."
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1333.352,1337.03,That may be patentable if it meets all the necessary qualifications Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1337.98,1345.469,"Well, now isn’t -- what are they giving the patent on, the substances or the intellectual concept?"
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1345.469,1355.216,"They’re giving a patent as -- assuming that they asked -- that it’s white -- the device itself that they asked for patent on, they are given a patent on the device."
1972.71-485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1355.216,1364.862,"Well, the device is the sum total of the end substance that is the matter on which producers does result."
1972.71-485,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1367.64,1376.053,"Yes, and they are cases if all they have discovered is that certain substances in the combination produces certain result."
1972.71-485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1640.236,1643.548,Thank you Mr. Stone.
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,1648.396,1655.006,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.46,2246.137,"Mr. Cox, if the claims work or do machine, would these claims be in trouble?"
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2246.137,2247.093,I think they might ask.
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.585,2249.126,Why?
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2249.126,2256.783,"Well, I think they -- I say -- I have taken your word in troubles because I think that you would raised in a serious questions."
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2266.829,2279.571,"Well, if these applicants had simply stated in their claims this method, this relationship, this way of converting, you would agree it would not be patentable?"
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2279.571,2287.974,I think there would be a serious question there because I would doubt whether they have would have made the specific application over other than a useful arts.
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2292.795,2294.281,"Well, it may still be very useful."
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2294.281,2294.741,It would.
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.741,2295.804,I mean if the man could --
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2295.804,2332.422,"Yes, but the trouble with it Mr. Justice White I think would be in position rather of arguing on the other side of this but the trouble would be that make specific application of the -- of the thing of useful arts of claim may be so broad as to preclude any use of the formula told by even for purposes of a speculation or thought or something of that kind and I think that is one of the basis use the old rule that you can’t -- you can’t patent a natural law as such or a principle as such question."
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2350.491,2358.173,"Well if the, I would suppose it is -- if there weren’t such a principle, the Government wouldn’t have any case at all?"
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2358.173,2359.5,They wouldn’t have any case at all --
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2359.5,2361.628,So the question is here I suppose?
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2361.628,2367.498,"Well, the question isn’t here because respondents here haven’t made that kind of a claim, Mr. Justice White."
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.937,2372.12,"Yes, but the Government is claiming you are."
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2372.12,2376.695,"Well, they’re claiming we are but the fact here is that the claims --"
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.695,2377.828,What’s this case is all about?
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2377.828,2395.261,The claims simply do not extend that far and furthermore the Government doesn’t really want to win on the ground but the claims go too far what they want is a rule that exclude all this programs and we’ve any trouble about these claims.
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.962,2410.719,"What do you -- what -- do you claim this is a process, I take it?"
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2410.719,2412.616,It’s process in the machine process.
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2412.616,2417.454,Under what part of the definition of process in the statute do you think is called?
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2417.454,2420.396,"Well, there isn’t any definition beyond the word."
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.656,2466.735,"Well, couldn’t you get a -- then as you -- as you put it you could get a patent on the machine once you put the program in there and you get a patent on that machine when it’s set up that way."
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2466.735,2477.212,"Well, I am not sure of that and I think you could because the machine, you change the circuit – you change the circuitry in the sense temporarily."
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2484.918,2496.297,"But its instantly, if the machine hasn’t been change then argue your dealing is using the machine to carry out a mental process, if it is in the machine, why would you need to process patent?"
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2496.297,2515.636,"Well, you need to process patent because the very -- the very purpose of programs and the utility programs sends the inventiveness in programs lies in the fact that it makes possible to use a machine without changing the circuitry."
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.818,2684.246,Why didn’t any claim 13 say so?
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2684.246,2685.975,"Well, we think it did say so, if may it please."
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.975,2687.801,"Well, it didn’t use those words."
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2687.801,2687.969,Well --
1972.71-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2687.969,2690.505,It would have been aptly easy to do so.
1972.71-485,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2690.505,2701.693,"If that is -- Mr. Justice White, the respondents here had consistently taken the position and patent over all the way through that that’s what claim 13 meant."
1972.71-485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3385.25,3388.167,Thank you Mr. Cox.
1972.71-485,2,40553,richard_b_stone,,3394.993,3398.896,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-485,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3523.603,3535.555,"Well, Mr. Stone you say that the application of the Government’s theory here would not then require outright rejection of the validity of the patent claim if it had been limited to the PBX."
1972.71-485,2,40553,richard_b_stone,,3537.129,3555.85,"There would at least be a – Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the patent office would certainly have heard the issue whether there was some invented element beyond the pure mathematical invention or some synergistic relationship between the claimed machine and the algorithm which would import patentability."
1972.71-485,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3654.649,3669.949,"Mr. Stone, your time is up but did I understand you correctly to say that if these have been limited to the PBX or a single purpose machine of some kind, then the Government’s position would be different?"
1972.71-485,2,40553,richard_b_stone,,3669.949,3670.775,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-485,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3722.025,3724.103,Thank you Mr. Stone.
