1955.373,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.542,"Number 373, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, versus Philip J. LoBue."
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,10.332,18.919,May it please the Court.
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,79.879,82.38,What -- on his sale of that stock?
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,82.38,85.321,On his purchase of the stock.
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,95.616,96.976,Before he sells it?
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,96.976,106.198,"That's right, sir, on the -- on his exercise of the option right given to him by the corporation on the purchase of the stock."
1955.373,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,496.06,504.037,Aren't the findings here -- aren't the findings here by both Courts that this stock wasn't given for services?
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,504.037,514.394,"The finding in this case, sir, are based on what we conceive to be an erroneous standard that the --"
1955.373,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,514.394,516.015,"Well, they do make that finding, don't they?"
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,516.015,516.626,"Yes, sir."
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,914.719,917.17,He gets -- he gets all at one time?
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,917.17,918.942,"No, he didn't get it all in one time."
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,935.632,938.927,"Well, all the rest he exercised at one time?"
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,938.927,942.694,He exercised his -- the first two options at one time.
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1003.559,1008.124,He gave no indication that whether he would or wouldn't take it until --
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1008.124,1010.23,Until he gave the promissory notes.
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1010.23,1014.922,"Well, until just before January 1947?"
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1014.922,1016.479,"Yes, sir."
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1017.446,1019.01,Clear option up to that time.
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1019.01,1022.254,It was a clear option I assume was binding on a corporation.
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1023.025,1023.997,(Voice Overlap) --
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1023.997,1025.525,"Yes, sir, there is no question about that I assume but the --"
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1025.525,1027.777,But not binding on him?
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1027.777,1029.125,"Oh, certainly not."
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1035.836,1042.301,"Just like he bought an option to buy the cause, something like that?"
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1042.301,1048.936,"Well, I -- I would suppose that there would be no difference from our point of view whether it was going to -- whether it was put in Colony or not."
1955.373,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1056.202,1062.445,Do you charge him with any income if he had received the option and did not exercise it?
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1062.445,1066.944,"The options were not transferrable, Mr. Justice."
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1120.775,1125.689,Is the stock putting transfer transferrable?
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1125.689,1133.067,"No, the -- it was not transferable because the -- the option -- the option specifically provided that the --"
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1133.067,1135.266,When he got the stock it was?
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1135.266,1143.865,"Mr. Davis told Mr. LoBue that one of the conditions was that the option, the right to purchase the stock, is not transferrable."
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1146.226,1149.675,"So, all you have to do is to exercise and then sell the stock?"
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1149.675,1150.468,He could exercise.
1955.373,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1156.719,1158.502,(Inaudible)
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1177.625,1189.763,"Well, the -- the question as to whether the compensation was the option or was the exercise of the option resulting in his acquisition of shares of stock."
1955.373,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1442.514,1444.014,For what purpose?
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1444.338,1445.737,Now --
1955.373,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1445.737,1449.321,Did it appeared that he work harder if he had a proprietary interest?
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1449.321,1471.468,"Well, it seems -- it seems to us that the -- that the analysis of the conception of a proprietary interest that is accepted by lower courts is -- is really incomplete, because almost every time, every time I should say, a corporation sells stock."
1955.373,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1568.806,1572.588,"What's the relation, its relevance, Mr. Elman?"
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1572.588,1577.382,That's set forth in our brief beginning at page 3.
1955.373,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1578.287,1580.003,What's the thought of that?
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1580.003,1583.043,"The -- the number that is, unless -- unless it's a gift --"
1955.373,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1583.043,1584.04,(Voice Overlap) --
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1584.04,1596.365,"-- unless it's a gift -- unless it's a gift, if -- if property is transferred by a corporation to its employee, it's taxable to the extent of the difference between the --"
1955.373,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1596.365,1599.775,What does the Tax -- Tax Court do with the regulation?
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1599.775,1611.255,Tax Court thought that that regulation had a kind of automatic conclusive presumption effect that it precluded any inquiry into the fact.
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1683.893,1685.016,Where is that?
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1685.016,1685.631,Pardon.
1955.373,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1685.631,1686.938,Where did you Act for this?
1955.373,0,37869,philip_elman,,1686.938,1695.742,"We have not set forth the 1950 Act in the statutes involved section, sir, because this Act -- this -- the -- the Act is not involved strictly speaking."
1955.373,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1831.582,1844.795,Mr. Barrett.
1955.373,1,38870,richard_f_barrett,,1844.795,1850.255,There are two basic questions presented in this case.
1955.373,2,37869,philip_elman,,3696.047,3698.651,"If the Court please, I don't know if my time is up."
1955.373,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3699.667,3701.07,"Oh, I think you have a minute or two, yes."
1955.373,2,37869,philip_elman,,3701.07,3702.377,"In very brief points, I should like to make first --"
1955.373,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3702.377,3703.416,"Yes, yes."
1955.373,2,37869,philip_elman,,3703.416,3707.275,-- in response to Mr. Justice Black's questions to Mr. Barrett.
1955.373,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3732.734,3733.225,At that time?
1955.373,2,37869,philip_elman,,3733.225,3734.469,At that time.
1955.373,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3809.263,3813.241,Was propriety interest to be equated with gift?
1955.373,2,37869,philip_elman,,3813.241,3814.272,"Not at all, sir."
1955.373,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3814.272,3814.897,Pardon me.
1955.373,2,37869,philip_elman,,3814.897,3817.29,"It may be, it may be that where there is a gift, there's an --"
1955.373,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3817.29,3821.491,That's why -- that's why your remarks about gift do not (Voice Overlap) --
1955.373,2,37869,philip_elman,,3821.491,3821.497,Our difficulty --
1955.373,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3821.497,3823.51,(Inaudible)
1955.373,2,37869,philip_elman,,3823.51,3826.725,Our difficulty is that which was expressed by Mr. Justice Harlan.
1955.373,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3839.063,3844.618,"Well, that's what I understand as the category, compensation, gift as proprietary interest."
1955.373,2,37869,philip_elman,,3844.618,3848.611,"We find compensation and gift in the statute, but we don't find proprietary interest."
1955.373,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3848.611,3849.194,All right.
1955.373,2,37869,philip_elman,,3849.194,3856.11,"And if the right questions have been asked here, was there an intention to compensate, was there an intention to make a gift, this case would not be here."
