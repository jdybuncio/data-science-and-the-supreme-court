1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,25.532,37.407,"Chief Justice Warren and Associate Justices, I'm here in behalf of Sheriff Dan Tehan who is the petitioner, Sheriff of Hamilton County, Cincinnati, Ohio."
1965.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,431.032,439.138,Has the as the Ohio Supreme Court or any – or any Court of Appeals in Ohio dealt with this question?
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,439.138,457.179,"Well as a matter of fact, Justice Stewart, I don't' know the anticipated question like this, but I left Cincinnati in great haste yesterday afternoon and somehow grabbed an Ohio bar which has the most recent Ohio Supreme Court case on this point."
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,470.075,471.745,What's that citation again?
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,471.745,476.953,"The citation is 3 Ohio State Second, page 212."
1965.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,476.953,479.293,Is that the latest Ohio Bar you have in your hand?
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,479.293,482.312,"There's one since, but this is the latest one I have on my desk."
1965.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,482.312,483.557,I have those in my office.
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,483.557,485.441,What does it say?
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,485.441,493.932,"This case was substantially the same as what we have here in that although it was a burglary case I believe, the defendant didn't take the stand."
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,529.004,530.821,Is this on direct review?
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,530.821,533.626,It was --
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,533.626,536.948,A state habeas?
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,536.948,539.004,No it's habeas corpus --
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,539.004,539.716,State habeas.
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,539.716,540.202,Yes.
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,540.202,540.756,Yes.
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,540.756,541.479,But at any rate --
1965.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,541.479,544.503,You said somebody about Maxwell and I couldn't get it.
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,544.503,546.063,Maxwell is the warden of the Ohio State by that.
1965.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,546.063,547.798,I know but who was the plaintiff?
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,547.798,548.568,Pinch is the --
1965.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,548.568,549.915,P-I-N-C-H
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,549.915,551.81,P-I-N-C-H.
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,603.273,615.914,"That sound is if then the -- your own supreme court in a collateral proceeding would have reached precisely the result the Court of Appeals did here, also in a -- for the federal habeas, is that right?"
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,615.914,618.293,Are you – are you referring at to the Malloy against Hogan.
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,618.293,618.957,"No,no."
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,621.791,622.542,That's correct.
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,622.542,624.9,And what's the holding that it's not retrospective?
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,624.9,626.197,That it's not to be applied retrospectively.
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,626.197,629.217,I see and so they sustained?
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,629.217,643.434,"In effect, this decision recites that there has been a previous reliance upon the validity of the constitutional provision referring to the Adamson case and Twinding and so forth."
1965.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,711.72,730.383,"One of the problems in this case at least as alleged by your adversary that quite apart from Griffin and the Griffin rule, the automatic Griffin rule that this case maybe an aggravated case in which the prosecutor's remarks was substituted for evidence."
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,730.383,732.077,"Well I -- again, as I say that was --"
1965.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,732.077,743.678,"That was a subject as you know of the first appeal here which was dismissed and a petition was denied but as you also as I've understand it, that's been reincorporated now in this argument."
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,743.678,768.588,"I know that Mr. Arnold has taken that position in his brief and he has on prior occasions, but having been at the trial itself and having had myself exposed to the chronological happenings of these things, the comment by Mr. Sutler upon Ed Shott's failure to take the stand and testify in no way substituted for evidence in the case."
1965.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,866.542,880.177,"Am I correct in understanding that the Ohio law, this -- that this -- that in order to be guilty of this offense under Ohio law, there has to be a showing of more than a single sale."
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,880.177,883.241,I can answer that yes and no for this reason.
1965.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,923.666,924.179,Bring this out –-
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,924.179,946.29,"-- similar to the narcotics laws that would say it's unlawful to posses morphine however in some exempted preparations, you may in fact have and that's what happened here and that's why to me, as a trial order, it was somewhat of a surprise to have felt satisfied in the showing of prima facie case in behalf of the State under our procedure."
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1063.009,1065.689,"Mr. Prem, may I ask you, is this the usual form?"
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,1092.174,1101.086,"The Constitution does not but the case law that in the annotation said that this is not only in the Constitution, it has been codified in the revised code."
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1101.086,1108.619,"Well, what I'm trying to get to is the Constitution only goes how far to take the stand and testify maybe commented upon by the State."
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,1108.619,1109.312,That's correct.
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1109.312,1119.877,But this instruct the jury that the constitution says also that you may draw any inference and it's better than testify that you deem a reasonable inference.
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,1122.133,1128.614,I don't recall that particular point having actually been argued but --
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1128.614,1131.299,"And that's -- so that's determined as broad inference, isn't it?"
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,1138.161,1142.681,"Ours is very, very similar if not identical to the provision in California --"
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1142.681,1143.803,California.
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,1143.803,1145.059,And --
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1145.059,1150.002,"Well I as I recall it, the Griffin instruction wasn't as broad as that."
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,1150.002,1165.681,"I don't exactly recall what the Griffin instruction was however, in opposition to the suggestion that you just made, the thought of process in my mind that in a similar case, if in fact there were and the case is similar to the one we tried here."
1965.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1172.839,1177.753,I know that's the old argument as to whether comment means much need more [Inaudible] --
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,1177.753,1193.159,"Well I'm talking now only about this case and this case the defendant is an attorney and a member of the bar and this was, as I said a ponzi type scheme that didn't involved just this amount of money in this case but it -- I really don't know how much, maybe millions of dollars."
1965.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1193.159,1196.104,Was there any objection [Inaudible]
1965.52,0,19756,calvin_w_prem,,1196.104,1198.364,Not to this particular part.
1965.52,1,42341,thurman_arnold,,1406.255,1406.693,Mr. Chief Justice –-
1965.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1406.693,1407.761,Mr. Arnold.
1965.52,1,42341,thurman_arnold,,1407.761,1410.556,– may it please the Court.
1965.52,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1882.388,1890.198,That's under the assumption that all will agree that this case was correctly decided quite apart from Griffin.
1965.52,1,42341,thurman_arnold,,1890.198,1898.729,"No, this case decided, the Court of Appeals decided that comment on the -- a unit of extension."
1965.52,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1902.938,1904.243,Yes.
1965.52,1,42341,thurman_arnold,,1904.243,1931.645,"And the Court of Appeals decided that the comment on the evidence -- I mean of a failure to take the stand was unconstitutional and they've decided on the basis of Malloy and this Court has now by Griffin, if there ever was any question about Malloy, affirmed the result in the -- that case."
1965.52,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1933.939,1936.389,"Judge Arnold, may I ask this."
1965.52,1,42341,thurman_arnold,,1945.727,1947.086,Yes.
1965.52,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1947.086,1949.313,"-- and rehearing in June, 1963 --"
1965.52,1,42341,thurman_arnold,,1949.313,1949.866,That's right.
1965.52,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1949.866,1953.167,Do you know when we granted certiorari in Griffin?
1965.52,1,42341,thurman_arnold,,1953.167,1953.867,"Yes, I do."
1965.52,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1968.963,1970.569,"Yes, October 1963."
1965.52,1,42341,thurman_arnold,,1970.569,1971.996,Yes.
1965.52,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1971.996,1974.581,"Right, just a few months after --"
1965.52,1,42341,thurman_arnold,,1974.581,1975.521,Yes.
1965.52,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1978.253,1982.951,Well -- but it was filed here on October after we had denied near case.
1965.52,1,42341,thurman_arnold,,1982.951,1984.495,That's right.
1965.52,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1984.495,1987.103,And we denied [Inaudible] before?
1965.52,1,42341,thurman_arnold,,1987.103,1988.641,"Yes, that's right."
1965.52,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1988.641,1995.355,And was this point raised in the petition that we denied in your case?
1965.52,1,42341,thurman_arnold,,1995.355,2015.634,"In the petition, we denied -- we've raised the point as to the burden of proof and the fairness of trial and -- I mean the burden of proof ploy, the fairness of trial and we asserted that even under Adam -- Adamson, this kind of comment would not be allowed."
1965.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2733.592,2735.244,Mr. Prem.
1965.52,2,19756,calvin_w_prem,,2735.244,2767.986,"The only additional comment that I would have to make, if the Court pleases, is that in response to what Mr. Arnold suggested to the Court about the preliminaries in this case and I keep referring to how brief this trial was, I've had to call the Court's attention to the transcript especially on page 22 that part of the trial which were the opening statements of counsel."
1965.52,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2800.838,2816.364,"It is with great regret that I announce that the Court has just learned of the passing of Honorable Henry Wallace, former vice president of the United States."
