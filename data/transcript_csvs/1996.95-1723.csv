1996.95-1723,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,7.406,11.374,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-1723, Tom Grimmett v. Patricia Brown."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,43.495,46.742,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,53.656,57.108,Are you also representing the trustee in bankruptcy?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,57.108,58.34,"--Yes, we are, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,58.34,61.373,Because the interests seem to diverge a little bit--
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,61.373,62.661,I think the application--
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,62.661,65.803,--and I was a little curious about how your argument was going to cover both.
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,65.803,81.385,"--The application on the first issue of the Banker's Trust issue, by definition, since it rests on a conclusion of the bankruptcy, I think only applies to her definition of injury at this point, and not to the trustee's interest."
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.204,131.417,"Well, could you tell us just preliminarily please whether Vincent Siragusa has... at one point the bankruptcy order had discharged Vincent Siragusa's debts."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,131.417,131.988,Yes.
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,135.69,142.426,Has that ever been... has an order come from the bankruptcy court changing that?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,142.426,142.907,Yes.
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.096,145.955,I didn't see it.
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,145.955,155.272,"--Joanne and the trustee objected within the 1 year of his statutory discharge, claiming that the discharge had been obtained by fraud."
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.741,170.485,But what order issued from the bankruptcy court reflecting any of that?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,170.485,172.405,--The... there is an order.
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.584,189.505,"So you say it is, but we won't find it anywhere in these papers?"
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,189.505,190.316,"I don't believe it's in this record, no."
1996.95-1723,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,190.316,197.181,A preliminary discharge is one that... could you explain that just very briefly?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,197.181,198.653,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-1723,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,229.703,231.625,That the discharge was obtained by fraud?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,231.625,232.054,--Yes.
1996.95-1723,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,277.655,284.36,"Mr. Sauber, what's left of... what injury has now been incurred?"
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,290.634,293.025,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1723,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.025,295.038,"It was a discharge in bankruptcy, was it not?"
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,299.252,304.163,The... there are two ways in which Joanne can be injured by this bankruptcy fraud.
1996.95-1723,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.859,313.35,That's out.
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,313.35,334.044,"Secondly, if she is forced to accept at the end of the bankruptcy less than 100 percent of the debt he owed her when he started this scheme, and that reduction is caused by the racketeering activity, that is her racketeering injury at that point."
1996.95-1723,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.044,334.415,Well--
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,334.816,349.056,"Well, our position is that until the bankruptcy is complete and over, whether or not she's been injured, whether or not her preexisting non-RICO debt has been affected by the racketeering activity cannot be determined."
1996.95-1723,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.056,351.968,And she has a cause of action before that injury occurs?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,351.968,353.819,She filed a protective cause of action.
1996.95-1723,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,353.819,373.173,"But the very authority that you rely on, Mr. Sauber, the Banker's Trust, says that such a claim is not ripe, and the bottom line of that case was dismissal, so I was frankly surprised that you were urging to preserve your case, that no injury has yet occurred."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,376.335,381.158,"Well, it was... if I may, it was dismissed, Banker's Trust, without prejudice."
1996.95-1723,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.019,402.522,"I've no objection to dismissing this without prejudice, but I don't know how it cannot be dismissed if there has been no injury."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,402.522,409.718,"Well, there has been no injury to Joanne if you accept our argument with respect to Banker's Trust."
1996.95-1723,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,443.339,447.293,"We can't tell whether the trustee's been injured either until the end of the bankruptcy, can we?"
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,447.293,453.337,"Well, I think that the Banker's Trust line of cases would only apply to Joanne."
1996.95-1723,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,453.337,457.081,"When you say Banker's Trust, you're referring to the Second Circuit case?"
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,457.081,457.692,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1723,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.893,477.813,How was he injured in May of 19--
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,477.813,498.338,"--The Ninth Circuit rests its decision on the assumption that in May of 1989 Joanne and the trustee recognized, because they filed their adversary complaint, that her husband has tried to concoct a bankruptcy scheme to get out from paying her the legal obligation."
1996.95-1723,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,498.338,500.2,--How does that injury the trustee in bankruptcy?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,525.667,529.247,"Well, the racketeering complaint which was filed in 19--"
1996.95-1723,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,529.247,531.719,Much less the... the other part of that is how is the trustee hurt?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,531.719,535.783,"--Well, the racketeering complaint is different from the adversary complaint."
1996.95-1723,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,549.38,551.463,"It all is the same thing, isn't it?"
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,572.327,584.178,--I think that the Ninth Circuit concluded that in May of 1989 both Joanne and the trustee were injured by the recognition that Vincent had filed a fraudulent bankruptcy.
1996.95-1723,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,584.178,585.186,It hurt their feelings?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,585.186,585.587,No.
1996.95-1723,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,592.841,594.604,But did it transfer the assets?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,596.916,597.484,No.
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,604.38,610.665,"The assets were transferred, and the trustee therefore collected less money in the bankruptcy estate."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,612.848,615.429,"--Well, the assets were transferred."
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,631.381,638.345,"And the trustee in bankruptcy, a settlement between the trustee in bankruptcy and the individuals who got it?"
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,638.345,641.548,"--Yes, and with Joanne personally, and as a result--"
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,641.548,643.459,"Yes, but and... we're talking about the trustee."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,643.459,643.729,--Yes.
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,643.729,645.882,Did the trustee get the assets back into the--
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,645.882,646.133,He got a--
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,646.133,647.174,--bankruptcy estate?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,647.174,647.775,--I'm sorry.
1996.95-1723,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,652.958,653.418,Right.
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,653.418,666.177,"--had diminished in value and they entered into a settlement of a certain amount of money which came into the estate, some of which went to Joanne personally, because she personally settled with the partners at that point also."
1996.95-1723,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,671.051,672.321,Could you answer... sorry.
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,681.269,689.764,"--Well, the estate of Vincent is... has not yet paid off its lawful debt to Joanne."
1996.95-1723,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,689.764,691.524,How much does it owe?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,702.533,715.002,"If you take into account the settlement, it's our position that the estate at this point has lost several hundred thousand dollars and that Joanne, by definition, has also lost several hundred thousand dollars."
1996.95-1723,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,715.002,717.463,"By the fraud, or by the reduction in value of the business?"
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,717.463,735.543,"Well, I think that it clearly is the reduction in value of the business, but I think the allegation would be that the business was reduced over the course of the bankruptcy because of the bankruptcy fraud, that the proceeding in bankruptcy--"
1996.95-1723,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,735.543,739.817,"Why would he enter into a settlement, then, accepting less, if he's entitled to more?"
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,739.817,740.879,--He's pursuing more.
1996.95-1723,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,760.05,767.395,"When you say the bankruptcy fraud, you mean something different, Mr. Sauber, I take it, than the fraudulent conveyance?"
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,767.395,768.545,Well--
1996.95-1723,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,768.545,771.109,Surely you can answer it yes or no.
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,773.109,795.011,"--I mean something in addition to that, his submission of false statements throughout the bankruptcy as to his assets, and as to his intentions, but basically, Mr. Chief Justice, yes, his attempt to transfer his property, claim that he no longer has the assets to pay off his debt to his wife, and to go through and obtain a discharge."
1996.95-1723,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,796.824,812.085,"But I still don't understand, is there a separate claim somewhere that the... he conveyed property, perhaps the medical practice, to third parties in fraud of creditors?"
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,812.085,812.633,Yes.
1996.95-1723,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,813.515,815.876,"That has nothing to do with the bankruptcy, I take it."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,815.876,820.38,"--Well, the point of the fraudulent conveyance does have something to do with the bankruptcy."
1996.95-1723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,854.081,861.377,"Can you tell me, what is the first predicate act under RICO and what is the second, and what was the date of each?"
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,861.377,869.645,The earliest predicate acts alleged in the complaint are the filing of the bankruptcy.
1996.95-1723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,876.717,879.218,What are the later predicate acts?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,886.104,887.486,--No.
1996.95-1723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,901.354,902.814,And when did that occur?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,904.346,905.926,"No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
1996.95-1723,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,909.539,915.353,"Well then, why couldn't there be a pattern inferred from the multiple predicate acts before the second victim even entered the picture?"
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,915.353,921.908,"--There may have... there may be such a pattern, but in this case she alleged--"
1996.95-1723,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,921.908,940.73,"Well, if there is such a pattern, and I thought your answer a moment ago was that there was, then I would suppose that so far as the pattern requirement for your cause of action it was satisfied before anything was done to damage the medical partner."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,940.73,943.292,"--No, I would disagree."
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,957.1,971.56,"Yes... yes, but if there are two predicate acts insofar as she is concerned, the filing of the bankruptcy petition and, second, the transfer of the assets of the medical practice, that's enough to establish a pattern as well."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,971.56,973.572,It may or it may not be.
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,973.572,993.778,"Well, let's suppose it is, that we think it is enough, and this other story about another doctor, well, fine, but it was complete as of the time the bankruptcy petition was filed and the transfer then was made, plus mailings and calls and so forth."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,993.778,998.749,"But Justice O'Connor, you are redefining her pattern and her RICO case."
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1007.726,1026.249,"I'm just looking at what the record discloses here, and what's being alleged, and enough is being alleged apparently to establish both a claimed injury by her and a series of acts that would qualify as a pattern."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1026.249,1035.714,--I think that that really starts to sound a little bit to us like overpleading in that basically she was in a dispute with her husband.
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1056.386,1061.641,"You included all these facts in the complaint, and if it's laid out, there it is."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1061.641,1062.601,--Absolutely.
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1063.753,1067.406,"In fact, it's a complaint that went on for 130-some pages."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1069.967,1082.154,"--It is quite a lengthy and quite a detailed complaint, but the pattern that she does allege and chooses to proceed with is the pattern that includes the other--"
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1082.154,1084.265,That she now chooses to proceed with.
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1084.265,1084.616,--No--
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1084.616,1089.297,She filed this complaint in... what year was it?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1089.297,1089.928,--19--
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1089.928,1090.739,November '93.
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1090.739,1091.13,--Yes.
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1091.13,1109.522,"And claimed injury and claimed a RICO cause of action, and we have to decide among other things, I guess, when a statute of limitations begins to run, and is there anything we can agree on at all in this messy case?"
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1118.898,1119.399,Absolutely.
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1119.399,1126.593,That means an injury and a pattern.
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1126.593,1127.693,"A pattern, yes."
1996.95-1723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1166.818,1170.042,But that... was that not until after the injury had occurred?
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1170.042,1171.982,After her injury occurred.
1996.95-1723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1171.982,1173.514,"Well, let's just take it at that point."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1190.715,1197.51,"There are... Justice Kennedy, there are a number of predicate acts alleged in the complaint."
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1215.282,1218.965,"Yes, but in fact there may well have been a pattern already."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1231.812,1233.404,"--Well, I don't--"
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1233.404,1239.945,And whether she understands the cause of action correctly is something this Court has said doesn't matter.
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1254.125,1255.197,--I'm--
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1255.197,1258.809,She doesn't have to understand.
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1258.809,1259.44,--I'm sorry.
1996.95-1723,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1259.44,1263.953,She doesn't have to understand what all would be considered as part of the pattern.
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1263.953,1280.636,"No, but I do think that it was... it's only fair to suggest that she would have a difficult time proving continuity and relationship and threat of continued activity if it was just a dispute between her and her husband."
1996.95-1723,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1280.636,1289.721,"Then it seems to me that you should go back and say what I thought you did not say before, and that is, Justice O'Connor, your suggestion is not well-taken."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1298.157,1298.567,Well--
1996.95-1723,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1298.567,1309.994,"And I think you've got to choose what your pattern view is, because if you accept Justice O'Connor's suggestion and my suggestion, I guess, then it seems to me you're out, even on the more favorable rule."
1996.95-1723,0,40493,richard_sauber,,1309.994,1318.52,"--Well, I don't want to say that under no circumstances could a single scheme with multiple predicate acts constitute a pattern."
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1619.452,1623.693,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1723,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1728.502,1729.952,This is an adversary complaint in the--
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1729.952,1731.785,"--In the bankruptcy court, yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1723,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1731.785,1735.217,"--And what, strictly speaking, is an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy--"
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1735.217,1741.349,It's in effect a civil claim that is in some way related to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.
1996.95-1723,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1750.446,1756.119,--And seeking some sort of remedy against the assets of the bankrupt?
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1756.119,1772.521,"Well, it can also be, as it was in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, a request for a personal remedy against individuals and, indeed, the individuals in the bankruptcy case included the very respondents before the court today, the lawyer defendants."
1996.95-1723,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.41,1822.183,And what you're reading from is the adversary complaint in bankruptcy.
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1822.183,1823.625,--Filed in May 1989.
1996.95-1723,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1823.625,1825.356,Not the complaint in the present action.
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1825.356,1825.826,No.
1996.95-1723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1862.859,1863.86,What paragraph?
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1864.771,1869.413,"Paragraph 33, and then if you continue on to subparagraph B--"
1996.95-1723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.413,1870.024,I see.
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1870.024,1872.115,"--C, D."
1996.95-1723,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1902.625,1903.975,So what is your point in reading--
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1903.975,1909.04,"--The point is that the... there are several points, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-1723,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1927.372,1928.321,--Was there an injury?
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1928.321,1930.762,"Yes, and that's the next point to get to."
1996.95-1723,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1979.388,1982.747,"Mr. Lacovara, may I ask you to clarify this?"
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2000.769,2001.49,Yes.
1996.95-1723,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2001.49,2005.942,Other circuits have the injury plus pattern.
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2022.254,2032.712,I think Judge Hall left open the question whether or not the petitioner would prevail under the injury-plus-pattern recognition point.
1996.95-1723,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2047.061,2049.134,But that's not something that the Ninth Circuit dealt with.
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2049.134,2050.013,--That's correct.
1996.95-1723,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2050.013,2059.35,"The Ninth Circuit said, our rule, in contrast to the rule in other circuits, is simply injury, and it doesn't matter that you didn't know at that point there was any pattern."
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2059.35,2062.092,"That's correct, but I do want to say--"
1996.95-1723,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2062.092,2068.916,"And on what you're telling us now, it seems like this isn't the right case for us to decide that question."
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2068.916,2072.259,"--Well, I can only speak as the respondent."
1996.95-1723,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2110.564,2121.83,But I thought that the debate between the parties was not about the Third Circuit rule but between the injury or injury-plus-pattern rules.
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2121.83,2148.469,"Well, in... up through the Ninth Circuit, since Ninth Circuit law was quite clear, it was sufficient to argue that petitioner's RICO complaint was barred by the Ninth Circuit's injury discovery principle, but now in this Court I take it that the issue before you is, what is the right rule to lay down for all civil RICO claims whether or not it's the one that was adopted--"
1996.95-1723,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2148.469,2150.739,"Well, and there's another aspect to the rule."
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2164.008,2176.016,"--Well, I think the way the injury rule has been defined, it's either an actual or imputed or constructive injury."
1996.95-1723,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2189.134,2190.476,No should-have-known component.
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2190.476,2192.536,"Exactly, or even actual knowledge."
1996.95-1723,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2192.536,2205.526,"And yet, in circumstances where fraud is an element, the courts have fairly often applied the should-have-known thing, and RICO often involves claims that turn on fraud."
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2205.526,2228.671,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, but that was an argument that was specifically rejected, or the implication of that argument was specifically rejected in Agency Holding v. Malley-Duff, in which the Court said the proper statute of limitations for civil RICO cases is not the fraud statute, even if it happens to be a fraud predicate that's invoked in a particular case."
1996.95-1723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2269.077,2270.459,What about a fraudulent concealment?
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2270.96,2271.741,That's a tolling doctrine.
1996.95-1723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2271.741,2272.141,--Yes.
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2272.141,2287.362,And we concede that under any principle of accrual there will be a tolling if there's been active concealment designed to mislead the potential claimant into believing that she has no claim.
1996.95-1723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.362,2306.413,"Mr. Lacovara, what troubles me about just applying the Clayton Act rule is that the Clayton Act does not have a provision like RICO which refers to predicate acts, the last of which occurred within 10 years after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity."
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2326.646,2332.699,I don't think that that's necessarily a necessary assumption in the statute.
1996.95-1723,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2382.702,2407.8,"But on that point you do tell us that in this... this is an academic case, because whether you apply your rule, which is injury, or injury plus pattern, this complaint is untimely, and if we take that view, then we can say, well, we haven't got a real case to deal with any more, since either rule would lead to the same judgment."
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2407.8,2408.791,"Well, that's conceivable."
1996.95-1723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2441.124,2449.56,"Under your proposed rule, does there have to have been the pattern in existence when the injury occurred in order for the injury to start the statute running?"
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2449.56,2451.951,--That's a debatable question.
1996.95-1723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.083,2465.761,"Well, otherwise it's a very strange statute you have, because it allows you 10 years between the... you know, the two predicate acts."
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2476.818,2478.107,I would think--
1996.95-1723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.107,2481.28,--And there would be no cause of action if it's... under RICO at the time of the first injury.
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2481.28,2511.96,"--That issue isn't squarely framed here, because she... the injury that she alleges, and I would like to cite to the passages where she describes her injuries as of 1989, indeed, 1987, but I think the correct interpretation of the statute, Justice Scalia, would be that for any RICO claim to accrue there must have been a pattern of racketeering and then injury from a predicate act that occurred, otherwise it would be hard to reconcile the language of--"
1996.95-1723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2511.96,2520.607,"And the rule would be 4 years from the time of discovery or from the commission of the second predicate act, whichever occurs the later."
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2520.607,2522.617,--I would not agree with the--
1996.95-1723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2522.617,2523.168,No.
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2523.168,2523.779,--discovery point.
1996.95-1723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2523.779,2524.831,"Well, I didn't say--"
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2524.831,2525.592,Under one of the rules.
1996.95-1723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2525.592,2526.41,--I didn't say discovery.
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2528.701,2529.051,Sorry.
1996.95-1723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2529.051,2539.43,"--it would be 4 years from the injury, right, or the commission of the second predicate act, whichever occurs the later."
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2539.43,2540.0,No.
1996.95-1723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2547.904,2549.605,I don't see the need for that.
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2568.699,2569.21,Well--
1996.95-1723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2569.21,2577.013,"And a rule that would allow that person 4 years from the time of injury, or the time the second house burns down, would I think be a just rule--"
1996.95-1723,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2577.013,2577.163,--There is something--
1996.95-1723,2,40493,richard_sauber,,3369.871,3374.694,I want to make three points quickly.
1996.95-1723,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3410.988,3415.67,But she could assume that without... that wasn't what was before her.
1996.95-1723,2,40493,richard_sauber,,3431.959,3450.412,"Yes, but I think in choosing between those two rules the Ninth... Judge Hall and the Ninth Circuit clearly decided that had they gone the other way and chosen the injury-and-pattern discovery rule, her complaint would have been timely, and it's not an issue in this case when the second pattern occurred."
1996.95-1723,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3487.698,3489.007,"Yes, but may I interrupt?"
1996.95-1723,2,40493,richard_sauber,,3489.007,3489.388,--Yes.
1996.95-1723,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3489.388,3491.871,You're assuming the answer to something your opponent thinks we need not decide.
1996.95-1723,2,40493,richard_sauber,,3498.036,3501.345,"I'm sorry, say that again."
1996.95-1723,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3501.345,3508.601,You're assuming that a plaintiff may have a RICO cause of action based on an injury that occurred before the statute was violated.
1996.95-1723,2,40493,richard_sauber,,3508.601,3511.873,"No, I'm not assuming that at all, and let me explain."
1996.95-1723,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3520.709,3527.415,"But if we add a version to that, that discovery or the second thing occurs, whichever comes later."
1996.95-1723,2,40493,richard_sauber,,3527.415,3541.443,"Right, and if you take the fact that the first predicate act is the discovery that you've been injured by the first predicate act, and the pattern or the other predicate acts come later, you've in essence created two classes of plaintiffs."
1996.95-1723,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3541.443,3541.924,No.
1996.95-1723,2,40493,richard_sauber,,3547.837,3548.656,Absolutely.
1996.95-1723,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3553.752,3557.556,"That's not the rule your friend is arguing, by the way."
1996.95-1723,2,40493,richard_sauber,,3559.468,3580.339,"He's arguing for an injury rule which in our view is completely inappropriate to the racketeering statute, which has as many of the predicate acts fraud claims, which this court has already decided in Holmberg v. Yonquist means that in a fraud claim you must be able to discover the fraud before the statute of limitations starts running."
1996.95-1723,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3612.212,3612.993,"Thank you, Mr. Sauber."
