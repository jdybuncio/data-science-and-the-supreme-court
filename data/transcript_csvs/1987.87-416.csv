1987.87-416,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.147,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 87-416, the United States Catholic Conference Et Al."
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,14.622,23.497,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-416,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,169.452,176.397,"Mr. Baine, certainly there's language in Blair v. United States, as you know, that it certainly cuts against your position."
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,176.397,195.588,"--Blair v. United States is a case that concerns the subpoena power of the Grand Jury, and what the Court held in that case is that one who is subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury cannot object on the ground that the criminal statute that he believes is the subject of the investigation is unconstitutional."
1987.87-416,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.793,269.766,"Mr. Baine, if the case were one in which the burden on the witness was minimal rather than the greater burden that you allege in this case for these witnesses, do you think that any witness should be able to make the same jurisdictional challenge, regardless of the burden on the witness?"
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,269.766,274.579,There's no question that the burden in this case was substantial and we certainly rely upon that fact.
1987.87-416,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.068,296.134,"Well, so, is your answer to me yes, regardless of the extent of the burden any witness in any circumstance should be able to make this kind of a challenge?"
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,296.134,297.516,"Yes, that is my answer."
1987.87-416,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,316.777,322.531,"Well, the Court's got the power to decide its own jurisdiction and do something until somebody reverses it, doesn't it?"
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,322.531,326.565,--There's no question the Court has power to decide its own jurisdiction.
1987.87-416,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,340.804,344.497,"And to go forward with the case until it's reversed, isn't it?"
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,344.497,370.623,"Go forward with the case until it's reversed in the sense that a party may not question jurisdiction, but the critical point here is that as far as the Bishops were concerned, there was a final judgment entered as to them, and this Court has held over and over that a judgment against... of contempt against a non-party witness is a final judgment and the witness is entitled to appeal it immediately before undertaking any burden of compliance."
1987.87-416,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,390.875,394.208,"Well, do you... what are you attacking?"
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,397.391,407.188,"The Court of Appeals said that the non-party witness may not challenge the Article III Power of the District Court, and that is where we say the Court of Appeals committed error."
1987.87-416,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,407.188,409.039,"Well, they said something about jurisdiction."
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,409.039,413.82,What they said is that the witness may raise the limited challenge that there is no colorable jurisdiction.
1987.87-416,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,413.82,415.032,Why did they say that?
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,415.032,419.116,"Well, I don't know why they said it, but I think I know where the error occurred."
1987.87-416,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,419.116,426.49,"If they said that, they would have to... it would be proper for them to redecide the merits of the jurisdictional question."
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,426.49,431.622,"I think there's no question, once you start looking at jurisdiction, there's no reason not to decide the question outright."
1987.87-416,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,451.347,456.159,What would the Court of Appeals have done if it had found there's no colorable jurisdiction?
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,456.159,458.921,It would have reversed and found that the contempt judgment was invalid.
1987.87-416,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,458.921,464.594,Were there any efforts to define what colorable was?
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,464.594,466.266,"Well, I don't think the Court of Appeals defined it at all."
1987.87-416,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,470.778,473.933,What do you think they meant by colorable?
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,473.933,477.023,I'm not sure what they meant.
1987.87-416,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.745,526.517,"What if we agree with you that the Court of Appeals should have decided the jurisdictional issue straight out, would we just remand and let them decide jurisdiction?"
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,526.517,528.477,That would be an option before the Court.
1987.87-416,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,538.815,541.015,But it would save us a lot of work.
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,541.015,544.178,"It would, indeed."
1987.87-416,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,544.178,553.274,"Ordinarily, if we disagree with their standards, say they have another one to apply, don't we usually let them apply it first?"
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,553.274,566.141,"I think, quite frankly, the Court has done it both ways, and certainly the Court could either remand for a full decision by the Court of Appeals on the question of jurisdiction or it could go ahead and decide the question itself."
1987.87-416,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,640.21,648.885,"Well, is lack of standing as quintessentially jurisdictional as, say, the absence of subject matter jurisdiction?"
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,648.885,653.87,"Certainly, the absence of Article III standing is."
1987.87-416,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,676.634,686.73,"What case of ours comes closest to supporting that particular proposition, that lack of Article III standing is just like lack of, say, subject matter jurisdiction?"
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,686.73,707.853,"Well, I think in Valley Forge, what the Court in Americans United v. Valley Forge was the Court said is that Article III standing... that without Article III standing, a plaintiff may not litigate in the federal courts, that it is an essential ingredient of the Court's Article III Power, that in the absence of Article III standing, there simply is no case or controversy."
1987.87-416,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.588,730.29,Couldn't they raise it by mandamus in the Court of Appeals?
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,733.58,749.421,"Well, I suppose that they could, but I think that it's an elementary doctrine that is implicit in all of the Court's cases, that at some point, one must be able to have a right of appeal from the final judgment against you."
1987.87-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.421,767.403,"Well, we could say that they can appeal when the merits, if the issue that they're appealing that pertains to the sanction that they've suffered, relates to the merits of the case, they simply have to wait until the merits of that case have been disposed of or are appealed."
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,767.403,768.695,"Well, the--"
1987.87-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,768.695,785.275,"Now, that might be a problem where the sanction hasn't been suspended in the interim or where it can't be returned, but where the sanction is just the payment of money, surely you could say, well, wait until the merits of the appeal either come up or are finally decided, and at that point, we'll let you challenge the sanction."
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,785.275,798.772,"--Well, you could say that because you are construing a statute, but if you were to say that, you would be denying the party of any meaningful opportunity for review because there is no judgment against the Bishops at the end of the case."
1987.87-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.446,815.535,"I understand, but at that point, I'm saying, you let the Bishops come up and say we shouldn't have been socked with this fine, and if it's been paid, we want it returned, if it's been suspended in the interim, as it has here, we don't have to pay it."
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,817.074,830.805,"If the Court were to hold that, the Court would be, in a sense, overruling Nelson v. United States in 1906, Alexander v. The United States in the same year, United States v. Ryan a number of years later."
1987.87-416,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.872,868.099,"Mr. Baine, how does that problem differ than the problem that confronted Blair in Blair v. United States?"
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,872.412,875.304,The issue in Blair was a little different.
1987.87-416,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,886.671,892.906,He claimed that the grand jury had no power to act because they were investigating a crime that was not authorized by federal law.
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,902.21,905.351,"--Of course, the holding in Blair wasn't that the witness had no right to review."
1987.87-416,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,912.497,914.14,"Well, his defense was the grand jury... his defense was very similar to the one here."
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,916.961,923.285,"And in the context of the grand jury, that simply isn't a defense because one cannot say--"
1987.87-416,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.285,933.242,"But once you say that, you're saying you can never make this argument, and I'm just saying to the extent you're relying on the fact that this issue is never reviewable, that argument could also have been made in Blair."
1987.87-416,0,33762,kevin_t_baine,,936.193,936.603,--Yes.
1987.87-416,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,999.898,1002.079,"Thank you, Mr. Baine."
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1003.678,1015.287,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.2,1116.843,"Mr. Horowitz, what precisely is the claimed injury here?"
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1116.843,1134.925,"Well, the claimed injury in this case, basically the gist of it, is that there has been government favoritism, that the government... that the Catholic Church has violated the prerequisites for having a Section 501(c)(3) tax-exemption and, yet, the government has failed to take away that tax-exemption."
1987.87-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.843,1151.495,"Mr. Horowitz, can I give you a hypothetical that keeps running through my mind as I read this case?"
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1168.596,1174.68,Congress passed a law that contributions--
1987.87-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.68,1178.273,Either the Congress or Internal Revenue took that position by regulation.
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1186.14,1196.168,"--Well, one thing that is distinguishing or that is different about this case is that the Plaintiffs have not... are not claiming any right of their own, and in the case of--"
1987.87-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1196.168,1199.069,"Well, I would like an answer to my question, if you're able to give me one."
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1199.069,1199.85,--I think in that--
1987.87-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1199.85,1201.79,What would your position be to that?
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1201.79,1205.584,--I think the Republican Party would then claim a tax-exemption of its own.
1987.87-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1205.584,1206.124,No.
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1222.234,1235.494,"Well, I think at a minimum, a member of the Republican Party would have standing to claim the denial of the tax-exemption to himself... to the Republican Party, and they could raise such a defense or as the basic claim that there was an--"
1987.87-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.494,1243.778,My question is whether they would have standing to challenge the granting of an exemption to the Democrats because they clearly would not be eligible.
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1246.179,1249.632,--They could bring a separate action challenging.
1987.87-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1251.285,1253.137,Possibly not.
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1253.137,1254.257,Possibly not.
1987.87-416,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1254.257,1273.44,"Well, I guess that question comes down to whether equal protection challenges lie where what you're suing for is not to get treated... not to have yourself treated as favorably as the other person, but to have the other person treated as unfavorably as you."
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1289.211,1293.763,"Well, they usually come up in the context of the plaintiff's own entitlement to a certain benefit."
1987.87-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1314.666,1322.911,"Yes, but we're assuming here we have a clearly unconstitutional discrimination granting one group a preference that is illegal under the allegations."
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1324.123,1324.504,--Yeah.
1987.87-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1324.504,1325.502,--but don't we have to make that assumption?
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1331.247,1331.807,"Well, first,--"
1987.87-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1331.807,1336.901,"And I don't understand why that's different to the Democrat-Republican example, and maybe you're right."
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1336.901,1337.642,--The reason why this case is different?
1987.87-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1337.642,1338.092,Yeah.
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1338.092,1346.618,"Well, first, you're not allowing the Republicans to bring a suit challenging their own tax status."
1987.87-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.618,1360.535,"No, there is no statutory basis for granting either of them an exemption, but they either administratively or they do pass a statute saying Democrats shall get it, but they don't say anything about Republicans."
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1372.854,1376.257,"Well, I would say this case is different in a lot of ways."
1987.87-416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1410.569,1417.383,--Were any of the Plaintiffs here people who had had their tax-exemptions revoked because of political activity?
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1417.383,1418.325,"--No, no."
1987.87-416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1495.445,1500.949,Is there any challenge to the statute itself here as opposed to the way it's administered?
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1500.949,1501.389,No.
1987.87-416,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1543.367,1547.501,Is there an Establishment Clause challenge being made?
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1547.501,1557.479,"Well, there is something that the District Court called Establishment Clause standing, and that just falls back on the basic claim of favoritism."
1987.87-416,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.64,1598.263,Do you think the Court of Appeals was right in saying there was a colorable jurisdiction?
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1598.263,1602.425,"No, we don't think so, although as Mr. Baine said, it's hard to know what they meant."
1987.87-416,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1611.081,1613.073,I suppose the Government made all these arguments?
1987.87-416,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1615.154,1620.297,"--We participated in the Court of Appeals, but that issue... I don't know what we said on that issue."
1987.87-416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1620.297,1623.579,"Thank you, Mr. Horowitz."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1625.252,1640.39,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.439,1686.441,"Yet, it is a final judgment as to them, isn't it, Mr. Beil?"
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1688.422,1700.901,"Yes, it is, and, but it's... in order to determine what issues can be raised from that ""final judgment"", one should look at the cases that allow appeals from this determination."
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.93,1718.382,"Mr. Beil, in theory, they don't care about the dismissal of the lawsuit."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1736.254,1737.694,"Well,--"
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1737.694,1740.745,"Now, you know, we do have a thing called habeas corpus."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1753.625,1754.396,--No.
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.377,1762.55,"Well, but that's the basis that they want to... on which they want to challenge it."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1762.55,1764.16,The Court makes a determination.
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.859,1809.891,"So, even though you are perfectly correct that the Court has no jurisdiction and that is ultimately determined to be the case on appeal, there is no way that you can make that vindication until the case is decided, so you have to spend however many years it is in jail until the other lawsuit finally concludes?"
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1811.183,1816.967,"--I think that... well, this Court has made a distinction between civil contempt and criminal contempt."
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1844.082,1846.245,"Well, now, what is your authority for that proposition?"
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1848.556,1851.659,"Well, I think--"
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1851.659,1854.04,What cases do you say support that?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1854.04,1867.678,"--United Mine Workers, which discusses at some length the distinction between criminal and civil contempt, the Court does draw a distinction between criminal contempt standing apart as a separate action, and civil contempt is much more related to the action."
1987.87-416,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1867.678,1880.077,"But I thought the distinction was that the criminal contempt citation could stand and the civil could not, which seems to me to cut against you in this case."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1890.505,1890.976,Yes.
1987.87-416,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1890.976,1894.055,And where does the fine... where is the fine payable?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1894.696,1897.208,The District Court has ruled the fine is payable to the Government.
1987.87-416,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1897.208,1898.239,To the Government.
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1898.239,1898.93,To the Treasury.
1987.87-416,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1898.93,1900.062,Do you think that might make it criminal?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1900.062,1901.942,"No, no."
1987.87-416,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1901.942,1903.331,Why not?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1903.331,1907.416,"It is ruled as a civil contempt, part of the civil contempt."
1987.87-416,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1915.86,1923.514,Don't we need to know what the nature of the sanction imposed to determine whether it's civil or criminal and if the fine is payable to the Court?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1924.895,1931.531,"--Well, no, because civil contempt can either be coercive, to essentially you pay... either you produce the documents or you pay the fine."
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1987.558,1997.335,What case do you rely on for the proposition that an appeal in a civil contempt action cannot raise an issue unless it's independent of the main action?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,1997.335,2013.324,"Well, the cases that have all come up have all been... well, in the cases that allow civil contempt appeals, Alexander, Ryan, Cobbledick, all the issues were issues that relate specifically to the witness."
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.722,2043.274,"So, Blair is your closest case to support that proposition?"
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2043.274,2043.975,--Yes.
1987.87-416,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2043.975,2056.422,"Mr. Beil, do you think it's open... it was open to the Court of Appeals sua sponte to determine that there was no Article III standing and to dismiss?"
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2056.422,2057.944,I think the Court has to be very careful.
1987.87-416,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2058.885,2061.256,Was it open to the Court to do that?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2061.256,2061.656,--Yes.
1987.87-416,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2062.455,2064.188,Is it open to this Court to do that as well?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2064.188,2064.708,--Yes.
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.298,2164.855,Why should we start off regarding the matter as somehow the primary focus should be the case out of which this order from the court issued?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2183.866,2187.319,--But what is the injury that that party is being asked to suffer?
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2187.319,2189.132,He's going to be fined or he's going to go to jail.
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2189.132,2195.584,"Well, I think actually the focus is not on the fine because that's one that's created by his refusal to produce documents."
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2245.796,2252.432,"Well, that person has a right... has the power to get an immediate appeal, can't he?"
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2259.537,2259.917,That's right.
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.917,2265.081,"Now, you tell me how the third party can get a judgment immediately when he's not in control of the lawsuit."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2265.081,2268.663,I'm not sure I understand the question.
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2268.663,2277.328,"I'm saying when there is a subpoena issued to the party in the lawsuit, he can, at great expense, but he can get a determination."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2282.982,2283.683,Yes.
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2283.683,2291.678,"But the third party, you're telling us there is no way that third party can ever stand on his rights and say I will not turn over these documents."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2295.759,2297.762,That is right.
1987.87-416,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2395.478,2399.898,"I assume if the appeals are frivolous, there could be sanctions against the witness?"
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2399.898,2415.99,"Yes, but may not necessarily be frivolous appeals, and certainly a decision by one district or one circuit is not binding on a determination by another circuit."
1987.87-416,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.381,2469.984,This contempt judgment was appealable?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2469.984,2471.366,Yes.
1987.87-416,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2471.957,2478.042,"It's appealable and in the process of appealing it, you may consider jurisdiction."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2478.042,2481.493,--In the way you would consider jurisdiction on a mandamus petition.
1987.87-416,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2482.392,2491.208,"But you agree if the Court of Appeals had decided no colorable jurisdiction, they would have reversed... they would have set aside the discovery orders?"
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2491.208,2491.698,--Yes.
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2495.482,2506.909,"Just as a matter of judicial administration, that's sort of a halfway house, it seems to me, that has a good deal to be criticized and not much to commend itself."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2512.594,2515.895,"Well, I think... I don't think the Court of Appeals was doing that."
1987.87-416,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2551.089,2552.371,How do you define colorable?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2552.371,2555.63,I think the way the Court of Appeals did it was mandamus.
1987.87-416,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2569.871,2570.75,What does that mean?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2570.75,2579.155,"Well, usurpation of power means essentially that's there no rational argument in support of a District Court's determination."
1987.87-416,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2595.668,2601.524,"But if you decide there was no Article III standard, the District Court was totally without power."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2601.524,2621.145,"I guess it comes back to the question of the District Court has jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction, and that determination, Respondents suggest, remains unassailable until appeal of a final judgment."
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2646.102,2656.049,But then this doctrine really gives the Petitioners nothing that a writ of mandamus or the application for writ of mandamus might not give it.
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2656.049,2658.16,"--On the jurisdictional issue, I think that's the case."
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2670.359,2676.343,"When you say personal to the witness, you mean by that that they affect the witness and no one else in the case?"
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2676.343,2676.893,Yes.
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2676.893,2679.565,Because certainly it's kind of personal to go to jail.
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2679.565,2684.788,"Yes, but we're not dealing, as I say, we're not dealing with a criminal contempt here."
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2688.67,2691.903,And you say it would be different if we were dealing with a criminal contempt?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2691.903,2695.825,"Well, Justice Kennedy is correct in that."
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2696.616,2697.487,You think it's the same.
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2697.487,2700.488,"--I think it would have to be the same under Mine Workers, it would have to be the same."
1987.87-416,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2700.488,2715.369,"Now, if the Second Circuit here had decided that there was no standing and no Article III jurisdiction, would that have been reversible error?"
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2715.369,2717.149,Yes.
1987.87-416,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2717.149,2721.343,Even though sua sponte could have made that decision?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2721.343,2731.979,"If it had decided that there was no jurisdiction, yes, I think that decision would have been wrong for two reasons."
1987.87-416,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2823.478,2834.678,"Well, but the Court has allowed any citizen standing to challenge taxing and spending decisions by legislative bodies."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2834.678,2835.576,"Yes, but if this were an administrative--"
1987.87-416,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2835.576,2839.82,This is an enforcement agency challenge.
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2839.82,2848.585,"--Well, except that the difference here, though, is that the enforcement... the failure to enforce is the equivalent of a subsidy."
1987.87-416,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2850.195,2853.768,"Well, that could have been said in Valley Forge, couldn't it?"
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2853.768,2859.552,"--But in Valley Forge, the plaintiffs there had... were not people who ran other hospitals or other colleges."
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2882.677,2903.44,"It seems to me that the true counterpart, the counterpart for Justice Stevens' hypothetical, would be an organization in which it had its tax-exemption revoked, because it had been lobbying or it had been active politically, and they say you revoke my tax-exemption but you didn't revoke the Catholic Church's, which was doing the same thing."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2903.44,2913.868,"Well, I think that those people would certainly have standing, but certainly under the Establishment Clause, you don't... coercion is absent."
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2913.868,2918.252,Establishment Clause standing is to attack spending of money.
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2918.252,2921.104,That's what we're arguing here.
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2921.104,2926.667,"Well, but it's a long way around to say that you're attacking a spending of money."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2928.79,2937.308,"Well, I think that the Court has held that the tax-exemption or tax deduction is the equivalent of a cash grant."
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2958.004,2960.655,That gives the taxing and spending clause considerable scope.
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,2968.239,2973.001,Death is the only other thing I can think of.
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3023.956,3027.248,--What case of ours do you think comes closest to supporting that?
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,3027.248,3034.732,"Well, I think Abington, in fact, says that, and Engel both say that coercion is not an element."
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3034.732,3037.903,"And, there, the challenge was to prayer in public schools."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,3037.903,3044.358,What the nature of a claim under an Establishment Clause is the preference... the nature of the injury is the preference.
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3115.065,3127.844,"Let's assume a group has a complaint about the Chaplain Corps in the services, saying that they aren't chaplains for some religious groups, although there should be."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,3146.838,3149.907,"Well, I think that could... I think a challenge could be made that way."
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3153.52,3157.303,But on an equal basis.
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,3157.303,3157.864,Yes.
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3157.864,3159.584,Your problem here is an equal basis.
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,3167.1,3167.939,Yes.
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3169.741,3176.885,"So, you think a chaplain suit would lie if what you brought suit for is not to get a chaplain for your group, but to take it away from everybody else's."
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,3176.885,3182.892,Because if one would argue that that's the... the giving of the chaplain to one group is an.
1987.87-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3189.825,3201.341,"Do you know any case like that where your complaint is other people are favored over you and what you get is not equal treatment in the sense of you being favored, but, rather, will disfavor them?"
1987.87-416,2,35550,marshall_beil,,3201.341,3234.344,"Well, in Heckler v. Mathews and Orr v. Orr, which are... one is a gender discrimination case and I guess they both, in fact, are gender discrimination cases, the Court has held that the mandate of equal treatment, which could be done either way, either by extending or by removing, and that you don't... because a plaintiff is seeking only one, but both remedies are available, doesn't mean that that plaintiff doesn't have standing, because otherwise no one would have standing because you'd always say, well, he's seeking this, but the remedy is that."
1987.87-416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3330.736,3333.848,"Thank you, Mr. Beil."
1987.87-416,3,33762,kevin_t_baine,,3336.719,3339.601,Thank you.
1987.87-416,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3453.647,3455.958,"Mr. Baine, would that make any difference?"
1987.87-416,3,33762,kevin_t_baine,,3462.363,3467.225,"--If they had had an exemption denied, they could bring a lawsuit challenging the denial of that exemption."
1987.87-416,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3469.636,3472.879,Would they have standing in that lawsuit to make the challenge they're making here?
1987.87-416,3,33762,kevin_t_baine,,3474.301,3478.004,They could make the substantive argument that they had been denied equal protection.
1987.87-416,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3478.004,3479.765,"I understand, but that's not my question."
1987.87-416,3,33762,kevin_t_baine,,3479.765,3485.427,"And once they had standing to get into court, they could make the argument of unequal treatment."
1987.87-416,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3487.869,3489.211,What is your answer to my question?
1987.87-416,3,33762,kevin_t_baine,,3489.211,3491.962,And they could say that you can remedy this in one of two ways.
1987.87-416,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3494.604,3498.176,Would they have standing to make precisely the same claim made here?
1987.87-416,3,33762,kevin_t_baine,,3503.219,3507.082,"If they're saying we don't care what you do to us, I don't think they have an injury that they're complaining about."
1987.87-416,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3508.833,3510.723,"Well, the same injury, unequal treatment."
1987.87-416,3,33762,kevin_t_baine,,3519.64,3521.232,"Well, I think it does."
1987.87-416,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3524.062,3525.403,They could then bring a lawsuit.
1987.87-416,3,33762,kevin_t_baine,,3525.403,3534.349,"--they could then bring a lawsuit saying that was unlawful and they could say it was unlawful because by revoking mine and not revoking anybody else's, that's an equal protection claim."
1987.87-416,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3543.044,3548.838,What happens in the selective prosecution case is that you get off just as everybody else has gotten off.
1987.87-416,3,33762,kevin_t_baine,,3554.383,3556.164,That's true.
1987.87-416,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3556.164,3557.684,You always get the more favored treatment.
1987.87-416,3,33762,kevin_t_baine,,3557.684,3558.946,That's true.
1987.87-416,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3567.35,3568.211,"Your time has expired, Mr. Baine."
1987.87-416,3,33762,kevin_t_baine,,3568.211,3569.122,I'm sorry.
1987.87-416,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3569.122,3570.044,The case is submitted.
1987.87-416,3,33762,kevin_t_baine,,3570.044,3571.836,Thank you.
