1982.82-5576,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.243,We will hear arguments first this morning in Pickett against Brown.
1982.82-5576,0,27308,harold_w_horne,,17.334,21.35,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-5576,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,297.529,302.59,"Mr. Horne, why did the mother wait so long in this case to bring her suit?"
1982.82-5576,0,27308,harold_w_horne,,302.59,327.595,"You won't find it in the record, Your Honor, because I didn't come into this case until the statute of limitations issue has already been raised and we went straight from that issue to the Supreme Court, but in this case, Mrs. Pickett, when she became pregnant was so embarrassed, she told me, that she immediately left the town that she was living in, Memphis, moved down into Mississippi with her child to give birth in a community where nobody knew her and where she could hide her shame."
1982.82-5576,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,346.6,361.111,Is it your position that no statute of limitations can be applied to an illegitimate child during the minority for establishment of paternity?
1982.82-5576,0,27308,harold_w_horne,,361.111,379.574,"Well, certainly in Tennessee I would agree that that is my position because of the other factors, but I would argue, likewise, that in any state irrespective of what factors were considered, that there is no logical reason for denying an illegitimate child the right to seek paternal support where the legitimate child is provided that right."
1982.82-5576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,388.099,393.941,"Well, Mr. Horne, what about a state which doesn't toll any statute during minority?"
1982.82-5576,0,27308,harold_w_horne,,403.565,429.711,"Well, I haven't given as much consideration to that possibility as I have in this case, but my initial reaction, Your Honor, is to say that any statute of limitations which affects a child's right to know his father, to have his father's name, the name on the birth certificate, and the right to receive support from both parents would be an unconstitutional deprivation of both equal protection... equal rights, rather and due process."
1982.82-5576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.444,438.189,"It wouldn't be a equal protection violation, would it, if all causes of action of minors are treated the same?"
1982.82-5576,0,27308,harold_w_horne,,438.189,464.319,"--I think it would, Your Honor, because in the context of paternity, and let me say I'd have more difficulty with it, it's something I haven't thought about in great depth, but in the context of child support, the only purpose for which a state can pass a limitations period on an illegitimate child's right to support would be the prevention of stale and fraudulent claims."
1982.82-5576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,531.352,534.149,"Well, that's not an equal protection claim, though, I wouldn't think."
1982.82-5576,0,27308,harold_w_horne,,543.395,543.941,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-5576,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,569.681,583.957,What is the practice or law in Tennessee regarding the leukocyte antigen test for paternity actions?
1982.82-5576,0,27308,harold_w_horne,,583.957,614.739,"There is a bill presently before the state legislature which I understand two weeks ago made it out of committee to the floor, but has not been passed yet, last I heard, which provides that the Department of Human Services in contested paternity cases, is to provide to defendants an HLA blood test, which would be paid for by the state initially, with cost to be allocated based upon the abilities of the parties to pay for it thereafter, and the results of the blood test would be made admissible in the court proceedings either to exclude paternity or to prove a probability of paternity."
1982.82-5576,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,614.739,619.255,Are those blood tests admissible today in evidence in Tennessee?
1982.82-5576,0,27308,harold_w_horne,,619.255,621.408,It is admissible to disprove paternity.
1982.82-5576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,929.761,943.506,"Doesn't the legislature, quite apart from the conduct of paternity suits, have an interest, or isn't it legitimate for the legislature to say we don't want that kind of a case to be tried 16 years after the events in which it happened."
1982.82-5576,0,27308,harold_w_horne,,953.377,965.686,"Well, it would be as reliable and actually, considering HLA blood testing nowadays, it would be more reliable than an automobile accident or contract case that was brought by the child 20 years after the child was born."
1982.82-5576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,972.152,992.033,"That's an equal protection argument and you may well be right on that, but I think a legislature, or would you disagree with the observation of a legislature, if it acted even-handedly, could say that there are just some passages of time that are too long to allow for an accurate determination of facts."
1982.82-5576,0,27308,harold_w_horne,,992.033,999.547,--I would have to agree with Your Honor and make one exception and that's because of the statutory structure in Tennessee.
1982.82-5576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1043.748,1046.306,"Mr. Horne, can I ask you a question?"
1982.82-5576,0,27308,harold_w_horne,,1046.306,1046.887,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-5576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1046.887,1051.383,"Perhaps it's not appropriate, but I'm sure, you say you tried 2,500 of these cases."
1982.82-5576,0,27308,harold_w_horne,,1051.383,1053.555,"Well, I've handled over 2,500."
1982.82-5576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1068.096,1073.609,"Are these... are part of these for the welfare situation, or are they all private?"
1982.82-5576,0,27308,harold_w_horne,,1073.609,1083.308,"A large majority of them are, I'm on a contract with the state Department of Human Services to prosecute on a case by case basis cases that they turn over to me for investigation."
1982.82-5576,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.661,1111.626,"I take it this is a fairly substantial percentage of the total number of such cases, or is it, I'm just not familiar with the volume of this litigation."
1982.82-5576,0,27308,harold_w_horne,,1111.626,1120.151,"--Well in 19... my recollection is that Memphis, Tennessee has the highest birth rate per capita of illegitimate children, varying month to month, with Atlanta, Georgia."
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1393.589,1397.978,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-5576,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1502.825,1513.257,"Would that be true, for example, if the father had made some small contribution to the child during its first year and then not again?"
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1517.943,1518.739,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-5576,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1532.5,1541.399,It's hard to see how that furthers the state's goal then to eliminate stale claims if something like that could occur.
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1541.399,1552.505,"I would submit, Your Honor, that when, in fact, support has been provided that there is a greater likelihood that you can produce additional proof other than the testimony of the parties."
1982.82-5576,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1578.464,1586.431,"In other words, the state has the statute of limitations, the period of limitations nine times longer than the mother has."
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1586.431,1594.362,--The state is allowed to bring that action as long as the child is dependant upon the state for support and that is 18 years.
1982.82-5576,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1596.3,1598.489,Even though the mother... even though the child is dependant on the mother for support.
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1598.489,1598.941,No.
1982.82-5576,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1601.643,1602.751,"No, in the mother's case however."
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1602.751,1603.564,--I'm sorry.
1982.82-5576,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1603.564,1605.079,I'm just drawing the parallel.
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1612.265,1613.045,That's correct.
1982.82-5576,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1613.045,1615.949,So the state has nine times the length of time.
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1615.949,1617.01,That's correct.
1982.82-5576,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1617.01,1619.697,Do you think that's fair?
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1619.697,1626.006,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe that there are differing state interests which compel the different limitations on these actions."
1982.82-5576,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1626.006,1640.064,"Would that be true for the state, as well, if the period of time that the child was on welfare was very brief, the state would still have up to 18 years to bring an action?"
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1640.064,1648.308,"If, in fact, the child was on welfare, Your Honor, that action would be brought by the Department of Human Services at the time when they are on welfare."
1982.82-5576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1661.146,1668.579,What happens to the difficulties of proof argument where the state is involved.
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1668.579,1675.687,"--Your Honor, I believe that counsel has acknowledged that there continues to be a difficulty of proof, notwithstanding the longer limitation of the state."
1982.82-5576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1676.42,1680.027,Why shouldn't it bar the state from suing then?
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1680.027,1687.323,--We believe that the state has a... that the state's interest in those actions where children are public charges is different.
1982.82-5576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.323,1696.287,The state should be... you should be quicker to excuse the state in making a mistake?
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1696.287,1698.819,"No, what we're saying, Your Honor, is that society--"
1982.82-5576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1698.819,1702.426,"Well, the argument is that there's a great possibility of making a mistake after a period of time."
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1702.426,1703.222,--I believe that--
1982.82-5576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.222,1704.395,Isn't that right?
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1713.059,1714.139,--That's correct.
1982.82-5576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.139,1716.217,And yet that doesn't bar the state?
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1716.217,1722.652,We believe that society's interest in insuring that children are supported by those who--
1982.82-5576,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.652,1729.414,"You can make all the mistakes you want to, but if the mistakes... the chance that the mistake is really existent, the state can nevertheless override it."
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1729.414,1741.736,"--I think that in light of this Court's opinions with respect to the protection which must be afforded or defended when the state is a party clearly addressed the point which you've raised, Your Honor."
1982.82-5576,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1741.736,1757.872,"In these cases, about 15 or 16 years later, is there a dispute over paternity or merely a dispute in most of them over whether the person should or can pay?"
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1757.872,1761.916,"The dispute is... the issue there is paternity, Your Honor."
1982.82-5576,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1761.916,1762.478,Beg pardon?
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1762.478,1763.636,Paternity.
1982.82-5576,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1766.35,1786.094,"Well, do you know, has an examination been made of these records to find out in how many of those of cases had run a long time... ten, 12, 14 years, the real dispute is merely over the support and the ability to pay or whether there is a dispute over the responsibility."
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1786.094,1793.997,"Your Honor, in the actions which I've had an opportunity to participate in, the denial is of paternity at that point and not of support."
1982.82-5576,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1800.978,1825.69,"Ms. Short, in your... going back to the question that we were addressing, under the Tennessee scheme, if the child received welfare for a brief interval, let's say in the first year, then goes off welfare, under the Tennessee scheme the mother has 18 years to bring a paternity action for the child."
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1825.69,1826.938,--I would submit to Your Honor that--
1982.82-5576,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1826.938,1827.874,Is that right?
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1827.874,1833.48,--during that one year period of time the state has likely established paternity at that time.
1982.82-5576,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1833.48,1841.805,"Well, if that isn't done, as I understand the Tennessee scheme, the mother would then have the full 18 years in which she could bring the action."
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1841.805,1844.024,"If the child is a public charge, yes."
1982.82-5576,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1844.024,1847.101,If the child was ever a public charge.
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1847.101,1847.772,Yes.
1982.82-5576,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1847.772,1858.909,"And so the stale claim argument isn't made in those circumstances, and yet the circumstances are identical to the situation if she had never gotten welfare."
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1858.909,1864.342,"Your Honor, we concede that the claims are just as stale when they're brought two years or 18 years."
1982.82-5576,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1889.208,1900.658,"Yes, but you've just acknowledged that it would be waived also for the mother if the state didn't bring the claim after the brief welfare episode."
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1900.658,1915.18,"Your Honor, I find it hard to believe that if a mother is, in fact, on welfare within her first year, that paternity will not be established on her behalf by the Department of Human Services."
1982.82-5576,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.77,1978.078,"But I think perhaps that argument was directed also to the independent right of the child to bring an action for support, or does Tennessee law recognize an independent action for the child?"
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,1978.078,1998.383,"Under our paternity statute, Your Honor, the action to establish support lies with the mother, unless the mother is disabled or is deceased, at which time, the action may be brought by the child through a guardian or next friend or I would submit, if the action is not brought on behalf of the child during its minority, then he may bring that action thereafter."
1982.82-5576,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1998.383,2005.69,"And in this case, was the mother the only person who could have brought the action at the time it was brought under Tennessee law?"
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,2005.69,2015.326,"I think that under the facts, Your Honor, that the mother was not... the child was not a public charge and the mother, or her personal representative, could have brought this action on behalf of the child."
1982.82-5576,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2031.162,2033.209,Let's see if I understand this.
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,2040.438,2041.218,"No, Your Honor."
1982.82-5576,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2042.767,2046.608,"Well, in this respect, the child can't bring its own action."
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,2055.979,2069.084,"Your Honor, I find it difficult to imagine a situation where the mother would not be the proper person to bring the action to establish paternity."
1982.82-5576,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2069.084,2079.847,What if she may have a crush on the father and doesn't anticipate he's going to be a good boy after all and when he grows up he'll take care of the child and just not bring the action?
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,2079.847,2092.762,"Well, in those instances, I would assume that the mother is providing support for that child and perhaps the mother's affections for that father are that great you would think that he would also be providing support for that child."
1982.82-5576,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2098.214,2099.384,May I repeat my observation.
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,2104.696,2106.259,"Perhaps so, Your Honor."
1982.82-5576,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.44,2203.5,"Maybe this is just repetitive, but how can you make that argument if she could go on welfare and then the action could be brought tomorrow."
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,2203.5,2204.607,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1982.82-5576,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2204.607,2211.729,"But how does that argument deal with the problem if she goes on welfare tomorrow, she could... you could then bring the action."
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,2216.291,2218.338,I believe that the problem still exists.
1982.82-5576,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2227.16,2232.781,The state's interest in getting some money is superior to the child's interest in establishing his relationship with his father.
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,2233.69,2235.889,--The state's interest in insuring that these--
1982.82-5576,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.889,2237.89,Do I state it fairly?
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,2237.89,2239.016,--are supported.
1982.82-5576,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2239.016,2246.481,What you're saying is that the state's interest in getting its money back is superior to the child's interest in establishing the relationship with his father?
1982.82-5576,1,41994,susan_short,,2246.481,2249.713,"With respect to the stale and fraudulent claims, we would say yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-5576,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2565.928,2571.396,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Horne?"
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2571.396,2572.628,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-5576,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2622.846,2624.313,It's an economic question.
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2624.313,2627.124,"--In a vast majority of the cases, it's economic."
1982.82-5576,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2700.353,2703.976,Fading memories in an appellate proceedings are not very important.
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2705.992,2706.834,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-5576,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2708.086,2710.632,You mean it takes eight years to get on to trial?
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2710.632,2715.519,"--To get into the Circuit Court before a jury, it takes five to eight years in the courts of Shelby County."
1982.82-5576,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2757.989,2767.718,Would the equal protection problem be equally solved here by holding the Tennessee statute on 18 years unconstitutional?
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2767.718,2781.994,"I don't think... the state has a right to make a period of limitations and by the very nature of a statute of limitations, the period is left up to the discretion of the legislature and it is arbitrary and capricious by its very nature."
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2803.327,2809.559,"Mr. Horne, maybe I missed it, but what statute of limitations would you be satisfied with?"
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2809.559,2823.524,"Well, frankly, Your Honor, I would be satisfied with the period of minority plus the period after minority which would, in this particular case in Tennessee, be the age of 20 for the child, giving the child the right to, once he reaches 18--"
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2823.524,2824.632,"No, I'm talking about the mother."
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2824.632,2826.726,"--For the mother, 18 years."
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2826.726,2829.521,On what basis?
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2829.521,2831.097,On the basis that--
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2831.097,2835.55,She reaches a certain age?
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2841.702,2844.983,"--Well, from the state's perspective, Your Honor--"
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2844.983,2848.512,I thought the 18 years was because the child was not mature.
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2849.947,2852.228,--I don't understand Your Honor's question.
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2853.214,2861.946,That you give a child two years plus 18 because an infant is not mature enough to maintain a lawsuit.
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2861.946,2862.866,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2862.866,2866.504,"Well, is that true of a 45-year-old mother?"
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2866.504,2869.253,"Yes, sir, in a context--"
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2869.253,2870.221,She's not mature?
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2870.221,2872.518,--You mean a mother who gives birth to an illegitimate child?
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2872.518,2873.142,Yes.
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2874.955,2883.514,"Your Honor, from the perspective of the state, there's two reasons for granting to the mother the right to make that important decision."
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2936.446,2938.084,I'm not talking about that decision.
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2938.084,2940.224,And let's say that she was 45 years old.
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2954.829,2957.843,I'm talking about this case.
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2965.949,2966.542,"--Yes, sir."
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2966.542,2968.917,I'm talking about this one.
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2968.917,2970.336,In this particular--
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2970.336,2977.351,"Why does this woman here, this mother, have 18 years to make up her mind?"
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2977.351,2982.725,"--Well, Your Honor, she has 18 years because--"
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2982.725,2983.115,Plus two.
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,2984.675,2996.841,"--Well, I'm saying that she should, but she has only 18 years in Tennessee to make up her mind because if the child were a public charge, then that child would have 18 years to... she would have 18 years there to make up her mind as well."
1982.82-5576,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3030.097,3031.735,I heard what you said.
1982.82-5576,2,27308,harold_w_horne,,3031.735,3032.437,Thank you.
1982.82-5576,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3032.437,3034.995,"Thank you, counsel."
