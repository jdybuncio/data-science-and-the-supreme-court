1991.91-538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.158,"We'll hear argument first this morning in argument No. 91-538, Forsyth County, Georgia v. The Nationalist Movement."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,16.122,17.194,"Forsyth, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,17.194,18.413,"Forsyth, very good."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,18.413,21.103,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.499,166.379,"Mr. Stubbs, that goes a little far, doesn't it?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,181.67,183.723,Our ordinance would not require you--
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,183.723,188.414,"I know your ordinance wouldn't, but your principle would allow the county to charge me for that, it's the county's property after all."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,191.106,204.624,"--I think the Fifth Amendment allows you to, if you have to administer an ordinance, and if you have to police demonstrations, to charge a fee to offset the cost of doing that."
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,211.389,213.653,But that is the principle you were arguing.
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,224.028,228.73,I don't mean to say that there is a rental for the use of the property.
1991.91-538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.497,247.203,"Now are we dealing here with the quintessential public forum, the streets and open spaces in the county?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,247.203,271.809,"Justice O'Connor, we believe that for purposes of this case, the courthouse grounds can be considered as a quintessential public forum; however, we would note that in an Eleventh Circuit case, which name escapes me, they took the Richard Russell Federal Building in Atlanta and basically differentiated the different types of forum, depending on where you stood in the plaza--"
1991.91-538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,271.809,280.805,"For purposes of our resolution of this case, you agree that we should decide it on the grounds that it is a public forum?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,280.805,285.668,--We have no problem with you deciding it on that basis.
1991.91-538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,285.668,298.407,Now do you think that the Constitution requires the county to make any exception for indigents and those who are unable to pay a fee?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,298.407,301.84,"Yes, ma'am, we believe that, and we do--"
1991.91-538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,301.84,311.135,Do you think that this ordinance does that when it doesn't extend it to a group that has no assets?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,311.135,316.169,--We believe we can make that distinction.
1991.91-538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,316.169,319.811,"How would you justify that, do you suppose?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,319.811,332.771,"We justify it because a group, first of all, a group... each of the individuals, if they don't have any assets, that group can then get a waiver of the fee."
1991.91-538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,332.771,340.245,"But not under the terms of the ordinance, which would extend only to individuals, I thought."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,340.245,349.67,"No, I think the ordinance indicates that each individual in a group applies for a waiver, then the fee can be waived."
1991.91-538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,349.67,369.703,"So that if the group organizing a particular gathering on the public streets in Forsyth County wanted to get a permit, you would want an affidavit of indigency from every person participating, is that it?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,369.703,378.801,"If it was a group that was not a formal association or a corporation, under the terms of our ordinance, that is what we are stuck with until we can get back and fix it."
1991.91-538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,385.475,388.046,And if it were an informally organized group?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,388.046,394.19,We think each individual could come in and sign an indigency waiver.
1991.91-538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,394.19,399.343,Do you think that is at all burdensome on the right of speech?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,399.343,401.864,Not on the right of speech.
1991.91-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,408.55,417.529,What is the principle upon which you base your conclusion that there must be an indigent waiver?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,422.09,442.183,"--Justice Kennedy, we have reviewed or tried to review this Court's cases, and there are numerous indications in the past that the constitutional rights that we all have cannot be denied by lack of funds."
1991.91-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,442.183,450.048,"I can think of the appellate transcript case, Griffin and Illinois, and I stop about there."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,451.99,453.781,The poll tax case.
1991.91-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,453.781,454.432,Pardon me?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,454.432,456.932,"The poll tax cases, I believe, were only--"
1991.91-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,456.932,458.194,The poll tax cases?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,458.194,460.375,--Or some of them.
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.13,468.2,Wait a minute.
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,474.153,480.899,"--As we read them, they invalidated the poll tax because there was a bad motivation there."
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.899,481.449,That's right.
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,487.533,496.509,"There is an alternative way to spread your message than to use county property, and a poll tax situation, if you didn't pay the tax you couldn't vote."
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.639,500.17,"That's right, you are agreeing with me, then."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,500.17,500.631,Yes.
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.631,507.996,"You don't have to make this exception, you have just chosen to make this exception between the rich and the poor?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,507.996,524.376,"We have chosen to make the exception, but we believe that it is required to the extent that if a poor person or a group of poor people want to engage in some kind of free speech, that they should be entitled to do so if they can't afford to pay the fee."
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.376,528.841,"We are not talking about free speech... we are talking about only parades, right?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,532.531,552.335,"Yes, but if it is our street, we would assume that they come under our ordinance and would have to apply for a permit and would ordinarily be charged a fee, but we are providing an indigency waiver if they cannot afford that if they are individuals, whether we have to or not, we thought we did."
1991.91-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,552.335,566.314,"That is what we are here to inquire, I thought that was your submission to Justice O'Connor, that a indigency waiver is required, but it seems to me that is a very important part of this case."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,566.314,585.288,"Justice Kennedy, the Eleventh Circuit didn't reach that issue and it wasn't briefed in any great detail, and I would assume that whatever happens to this case, the possibility exists that the Eleventh Circuit may get to deal with the indigency provision again."
1991.91-538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.908,605.61,Is there some claim by the respondents here that they were indigent?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,605.61,606.181,Yes.
1991.91-538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,606.181,609.742,How did the lower courts treat that?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,609.742,611.685,The Eleventh Circuit didn't reach it.
1991.91-538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,629.096,637.43,Did the respondent fill out the necessary affidavit specified in the ordinance?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,637.43,638.041,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,638.041,641.952,Did they then get a permit or--
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,641.952,650.801,"They were issued a permit contingent on payment of a $100 fee and they would not pay so they did not march, and this is how the case got here."
1991.91-538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,650.801,660.285,"--Mr. Stubbs, the county administrator in this case just considered costs of administration of the permit application?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,660.285,661.367,"Yes, ma'am."
1991.91-538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,661.367,671.942,"Why did the administrator not consider the cost of police required for the march, do you suppose?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,671.942,683.7,"Justice O'Connor, in 1985 the Eleventh Circuit came down with a decision which basically said that they read... it didn't have anything to do with Murdock, they just said that you could not charge a fee for police activities."
1991.91-538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,685.343,689.143,Your ordinance refers to the cost of police.
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,689.143,690.145,--That's correct.
1991.91-538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,690.145,695.638,But in deference to the Eleventh Circuit's rulings in some other case--
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,695.638,698.009,We did not exercise that option.
1991.91-538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,698.009,698.82,--I see.
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,716.101,716.972,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-538,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,716.972,728.299,"So that in your view, you could have had an ordinance that would have allowed you to charge $700,000 for the civil rights demonstrations or parades in the earlier instances?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,728.299,729.881,Our ordinance puts a cap--
1991.91-538,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,729.881,734.243,"I know yours does, but your principle would allow you to do that, is that correct?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,734.243,736.905,"--Our principle would, Justice Souter."
1991.91-538,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,745.831,751.575,"Well, no, I realize that, but I just want to understand what the rule is that you are ultimately relying on, subject to the cap."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,784.167,792.754,"--That is one of the reasons why we thought the cap in New Hampshire, and our cap, is probably necessary."
1991.91-538,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,792.754,820.513,"But can you get out of it that way, because as I understand it, at least within your $1,000 limit, you would still be adjusting or you would still be setting your fee within the $1,000 limit depending upon the likely cost, and that would bear a relationship, I suppose, to the controversial nature of what was being demonstrated for."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,820.513,822.634,"Well, we have a balancing of interests here, obviously."
1991.91-538,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,838.596,840.785,"But this isn't a time, place or manner restriction--"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,840.785,842.608,"We believe it is, Justice Souter, because--"
1991.91-538,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,842.608,850.172,"--How is it a time, place or manner restriction if it is varying depending on... or varying in relationship to the content of the message?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,850.172,852.773,"--Well, first of all--"
1991.91-538,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,852.773,861.629,"I mean, by definition, you know, what is allowed under time, place and manner starts with the assumption that you don't have that kind of a content-based determination."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,861.629,871.327,"--Well, it's not... the content doesn't affect how the ordinance is administered."
1991.91-538,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,878.46,879.15,What's the difference?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,879.15,879.771,"Well, I think--"
1991.91-538,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,879.771,886.927,"I mean, if you are going to... if you are say that your principle allows you to charge in relation to the cost of policing, you are saying the same thing."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,886.927,899.877,"--Well, Justice Souter, the only way I can answer that question is to say that in Cox v. New Hampshire we used the same language that they did there."
1991.91-538,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,929.295,930.915,"But basically, you are resting on Cox?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,943.515,945.946,--We have a problem if Cox is no longer viable.
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.946,958.144,"Mr. Stubbs, am I correct that you not only did not charge for the police protection which you were authorized to charge for, but you didn't even charge the full amount of the administrative costs?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,958.144,958.845,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,958.845,963.126,You reduced what it might have been.
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,963.126,969.661,The administrator made a determination that he wanted to charge what had been charged the year before so that there would be no--
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.661,971.323,That is very generous of him.
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,981.368,992.167,"--I think the generosity was an attempt to avoid what has happened, to coming up here, and not out of agreement with the message by any means."
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,992.167,993.547,"Well, how do we know that?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1017.162,1019.423,The ordinance doesn't necessarily allow it.
1991.91-538,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1043.489,1089.03,"Mr. Stubbs, let's assume that you could meet Justice Scalia's concern and that the generosity, or we won't call it generosity, the reduction was subject to some principle, so that it wouldn't be a danger of its varying depending on the sympathy or lack of sympathy with the organization, assuming that the amounts would be, on some principle basis, reduced down to what perhaps is a nominal amount in today's values; don't you then encounter a different problem, that what you are charging really doesn't bear any relationship at all between, or to, rather, the expense that you are trying to offset?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1107.022,1142.984,"--Justice Souter, we addressed that in our brief by citing this Court's language in Massachusetts v. United States where the Court recognized, and I think that was a supremacy clause case, that the costs the FAA was charging States and anybody else using their facilities was negligible in relation to the entire costs, but the Court indicated that they could nevertheless be considered, because Congress considered it that way, as an integral and essential part of the network of user fees that the Congress had set up."
1991.91-538,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1146.857,1149.268,Is that going to pass First Amendment muster today?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1149.268,1154.323,"--Well, Massachusetts v. United States is not that old of a case, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.23,1377.317,"Once again, you wouldn't say that if it were just, or would you, if it were just an individual who wants to stop passers-by."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1382.14,1388.494,Our ordinance has made a policy decision--
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1388.494,1389.415,I am not talking about your ordinance.
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1396.549,1410.289,"--If there is really no administrative cost to the county and there is no policing requirement in that situation, there is no need for any fee because there would be no basis for it, and it would be struck down."
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1410.289,1415.041,"I see, and is that the case with radio time too?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1419.776,1421.385,"Apparently, the Government--"
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.385,1428.532,"I mean, suppose I have all this empty radio time, with cable channels I suppose there is a lot of dead time, if it doesn't cost you anything you can't charge for it?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1428.532,1443.405,"--As we understand the way the FCC operates, you pay to be able to have one of those channels or those frequencies, and therefore, after that it is your decision what you charge."
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1454.931,1456.36,And you think streets are the same?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1456.36,1475.793,"I don't think they are the same, but it impacts on First Amendment expression, whether it is the same or not, and therefore we don't necessarily see why there should be any great concern if the fees are reasonable and are not related to content, and are related to direct costs."
1991.91-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1479.877,1489.013,Why isn't this case like the instance where a municipality charged ink used by the press?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1489.013,1490.692,"Excuse me, I didn't hear that."
1991.91-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1490.692,1504.543,Why isn't this a case like the one where the Minnesota Star was challenging the ordinance in which the city taxed ink used by the press?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1518.852,1528.549,"I am trying to remember the facts of the Minnesota Star, but I believe it had something to do with where you put your papers."
1991.91-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1528.549,1531.13,Suppose you had a tax on ink.
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1531.13,1533.702,On ink?
1991.91-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1533.702,1543.058,"On ink, that is used by the print media, and the whole bearing of the tax, the whole burden of the tax falls on the media."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1545.98,1549.733,"I am not familiar with the case, Justice Kennedy, I apologize."
1991.91-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1563.562,1575.939,"Suppose the whole burden of the tax falls on the press because there was an exemption in that case for small purchases of ink, just ink in bulk."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1587.958,1589.879,--We don't believe it is.
1991.91-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1620.87,1623.651,I am not saying it is a tax on free speech.
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1625.411,1632.387,"But there are other burdens on speech, any time, place or manner--"
1991.91-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1632.387,1634.137,But they are general burdens.
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1635.299,1669.56,"--It is specific in that it's money, but it is not specific in that it offsets out-of-pocket expenditures or time by salaried employees for the county, and therefore, we believe we are entitled to recoup it based on the Cox v. New Hampshire case, which we believe was reasonable and logical and has not been... and there appears to be no reason that we can see why it should not still have vitality--"
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.56,1675.454,"Do you make charges for bike races, either a marathon or a bike race in town--"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1675.454,1676.907,"--That's correct, we do."
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1676.907,1679.047,"--You do, under a different ordinance?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1679.047,1679.948,"No, this ordinance."
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.948,1680.779,Under this ordinance?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1680.779,1681.939,Under this ordinance.
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1686.023,1690.594,"I thought it just applied to parades, processions or open air public meetings."
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1690.594,1692.487,"--Well, a parade, a procession--"
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.487,1694.961,You consider a bike race a parade or a procession?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1694.961,1696.37,--We would.
1991.91-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1696.37,1699.572,Wow.
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1699.572,1715.613,"It is just an attempt to make sure we know what is going on, where it's going on, and that we can take care of it properly, and we have charged the fee to numerous types of different activities that have occurred in the county, on county courthouse property, or on the streets."
1991.91-538,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1715.613,1721.658,Does the record tell us whether... what variation in the fees there has been for these other events like bike races and so forth?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1721.658,1730.922,"I hesitate, Justice Stevens, because there were two cases and in one of them, the record would reflect that."
1991.91-538,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1739.099,1741.09,So it is a matter of public record in one of the two cases?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1741.09,1741.651,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-538,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1741.651,1743.131,What does the record show?
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1743.131,1751.676,"I know the administrator testified, I think he has charged the Girl Scouts $5.00 for a little activity that they had."
1991.91-538,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1754.58,1757.011,At least it is not a flat $100.00 from everybody--
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1757.011,1757.89,"--No, sir."
1991.91-538,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1757.89,1761.843,"--even though I suppose the administration is pretty much the same, the cost of administration probably is pretty much the same?"
1991.91-538,0,40549,robert_s_stubbs_iii,,1761.843,1771.49,"It depends, Justice Stevens, because if it is a very simple thing like the Girl Scouts, then he simply does what he does and issues a permit and away we go."
1991.91-538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1780.106,1782.086,"Thank you, Mr. Stubbs."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,1784.258,1789.931,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court:"
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1860.767,1866.423,"Mr. Barrett, do you think those cases overruled Cox?"
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,1866.423,1869.863,"Cox was adopted, Your Honor, at a time--"
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1869.863,1871.135,Will you answer my question?
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,1871.135,1875.459,"--They were consistent with Cox, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1875.459,1886.465,"But Cox, Cox spoke of a fee ranging from a nominal amount to $300.00 in 1941 and said there was nothing unconstitutional about that fee."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,1886.465,1891.009,"First of all, Your Honor, in 1941 there was no public forum doctrine."
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1894.752,1900.854,You said Cox was consistent with Follett and the other case.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,1900.854,1901.595,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1901.595,1902.246,Okay.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,1902.246,1905.89,I will tell you why if I may.
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.89,1906.28,"Yes, please do."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,1906.28,1912.833,"First of all, Cox spoke specifically that it was distinguished from holding an open public meeting."
1991.91-538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1929.895,1941.062,"Cox just dealt with a parade, I mean, with a meeting in the streets, and specifically noted that there was no question of passing out literature or solicitation or anything like that."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,1941.062,1941.863,--Correct.
1991.91-538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.863,1947.447,So we are just talking about a... and Murdock was something else again.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,1947.447,1962.456,"Murdock, Your Honor, if it please the Court, laid down the rule to qualify Cox so that it said that when there was no right for there to be a charge or a tax upon the poor, it also--"
1991.91-538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1962.456,1964.267,"Yes, but Murdock didn't deal with a parade."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,1968.07,1968.919,"--No, Your Honor, it simply stated--"
1991.91-538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.919,1970.431,This was handing out literature.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,1970.431,1971.282,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1971.282,1976.135,The case in point here is Cox because this is a parade and Cox dealt with a parade.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,1981.799,1984.11,"If it please the Court, Your Honor, this is not a parade."
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1992.545,1997.42,It entails the same sort of expenses for the county as a parade would.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,1997.42,2017.234,"Well, Your Honor, perhaps the expense is the right of the poor to assemble in public, and I submit that the expense is cutting off the right of the poor; also under Terminello in 1949 which is the classic case of the heckler's veto, because the cost then would be if the demonstrator says--"
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.234,2020.166,I am not at all sure Terminello is even good law.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2020.166,2022.056,"--I am sorry, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2022.056,2027.051,I said I am not at all sure Terminello is even good law anymore.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2027.051,2057.329,"Perhaps I can tell you how in Forsyth County when demonstrators threatened, and also in Atlanta which is cited somewhat in the appendix, when demonstrators said they were going to come and throw rocks and throw bricks, then the police had to respond to that emergency and then under the county's argument, the would-be assemblers or paraders as the case may be, are then to be charged for the cost of defending against the hecklers?"
1991.91-538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2068.279,2072.259,I am not sure of the theory of your case.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2087.86,2088.65,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2088.65,2090.972,"Well, then it has nothing to do with the poor."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2090.972,2093.342,Nothing to do with which?
1991.91-538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2093.342,2096.686,Then it has nothing to do with the distinction in rich and poor.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2096.686,2100.268,"I would agree with that, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2100.268,2108.474,"So then we shouldn't be talking about the poor, and that was the whole thrust of your argument as I understood it from--"
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2108.474,2112.458,We are talking about the poor because we have a group of individuals who were denied under--
1991.91-538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2112.458,2121.453,"--But the principle of the case that you are arguing has nothing to do with that, then why don't we proceed to the principle that you are arguing, and I would like to know what that principle is."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2121.453,2123.145,"--Well, we have several, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2132.93,2136.062,Were they allowed to charge poll taxes to the rich?
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2136.062,2137.524,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2137.524,2138.554,Is that right?
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2138.554,2139.596,I would think.
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.596,2140.487,I didn't know--
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2140.487,2143.488,"I mean before the Court's decision they could, of course."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.488,2144.167,"--No, I mean afterwards."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2144.167,2144.818,"No, sir."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2144.818,2150.562,"So once again, as Justice Kennedy says, it doesn't support your poor argument."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2151.944,2157.628,"In this particular case, Your Honor, the assets of the organization were $90 and some cents."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.58,2164.182,"Right, and if it could have paid the fee, you would have no problem."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2164.182,2165.592,"Yes, we would, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2166.473,2170.484,"Then why don't you talk about your problem instead of raising this poverty thing which has nothing to do with your case, does it?"
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2170.484,2172.537,It does in this respect--
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.537,2175.659,Especially since there is a waiver for poverty in the ordinance.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2175.659,2176.949,"--May I address that, Your Honor?"
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.949,2177.68,Sure.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2177.68,2180.592,"Let's say for a moment that you see, here is the courthouse green."
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2210.641,2213.994,"Whoa, what are the privacy provisions of the Constitution?"
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2213.994,2235.92,"--Well, I am speaking of Brown v. Socialist Workers' Party, the '74 nuclear freeze campaign of Ohio which... and of course, the NAACP v. Alabama that based it on freedom of association, that says that the right of people to protect their freedom of association is a privacy right, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2241.356,2244.498,"Counsel, you have 30 minutes."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2250.111,2252.212,"--All right, Your Honor, I was trying to--"
1991.91-538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2252.212,2258.115,I would like to know why this ordinance is invalid if someone can afford to pay the fee.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2258.115,2269.343,"--In this particular case, the convenience that I am speaking of, I would like to perhaps finish what I was saying and then I will address that the best way I can, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2352.427,2356.871,But newspapers don't impose a burden on a little town or a little county.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2388.552,2395.757,"--And they said the same thing in the Stamp Act, and here they are in essence saying, all you have to do is pay a fee to stand on the steps."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2395.757,2397.398,There were no expenses involved in the Stamp Act.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2414.01,2417.621,"I hadn't thought of that, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2417.621,2425.116,"Is that the only thing wrong with this statute, that it doesn't permit you to waive police protection?"
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2425.116,2434.833,If it means that you would waive your own life to appear in public in the United States of America to deliver a speech in the quintessential public forum--
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2434.833,2441.956,"This is a little tiny county, they have one policeman, and you want to bring in 10,000 people to march."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2445.339,2451.804,"--No more than they would at the Capitol of the United States, Your Honor, which has no charge, no more than they would on the steps of this very Court."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2451.804,2456.807,"I don't understand what you mean, no more than they would--"
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2456.807,2462.771,"There is no fee under the Constitution in freedom, and we would submit, Your Honor, there is no pay-as-you-go in patriotism."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.771,2475.729,"--I don't see anything in the Constitution that says that reasonable costs cannot be assessed against people, just like the radio."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2478.561,2484.145,"That was the decision in Murdock, Your Honor, there can be no fee for a right enjoyed under the Constitution."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2484.145,2485.454,We are not talking about a fee.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2488.597,2507.29,"And of course, we respond that is the heckler's veto, Your Honor, that if the expenses are occasioned by having hostile counterdemonstrators, then the fee escalates beyond calculation and then the right of assembly is abridged, and the right of the people to assemble will not be abridged, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2507.29,2510.893,And you don't think that the monetary limit stops that problem?
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2510.893,2513.064,"Well, actually, there isn't a monetary limit."
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2537.11,2544.723,"Mr. Barrett, I think you better calm down a little and address the issues."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2546.436,2548.978,"It's an emotional issue based on humanity, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2548.978,2554.86,I suggest you try to keep your emotions under control and try to discuss the merits of the case.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2554.86,2560.765,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2560.765,2564.876,"I still don't quite understand why the $1,000 limit does not apply."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2567.12,2570.452,"Under the ordinance it really isn't a cap at all, Your Honor, and it is a--"
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.452,2572.202,Why is it not a cap?
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2572.202,2580.026,"--Because they have the toilet fees, the medical fees, the miscellaneous fees, which they say in the administrator's opinion--"
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.026,2581.048,They had nothing to do hecklers.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2582.638,2583.309,"--Yes, sir."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.309,2587.533,"You say the more hecklers you have, the more police there will have to be, so the fee could be enormous."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2591.574,2594.147,"That is not what I stated, Your Honor, I thought we were talking about two separate things."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2594.147,2595.987,What did you say then?
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2595.987,2603.424,"I said that there is not a $1,000 cap, there can be more than $1,000 under some provisions in the ordinance."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2603.424,2604.172,But not for hecklers.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2604.172,2605.404,"No, sir, not for hecklers."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.954,2609.077,So your heckler's fee argument is gone.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2609.077,2612.948,"--Supposedly, if there were more hecklers there might have to be more toilets, there might have to be more--"
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2612.948,2614.3,Hecklers produce toilets?
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2614.3,2616.641,"--Hecklers produce more than toilets, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.494,2639.285,"Mr. Barrett, let me just clear up one thing."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2639.285,2639.846,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2639.846,2642.698,"You have not, though, in this case, challenged these other fees, have you?"
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2642.698,2644.23,"Which other fees, Your Honor?"
1991.91-538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2644.23,2648.254,"The toilet fees, and you mentioned there are a bunch of others than could get the cap over $1,000."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2648.254,2664.535,"We have challenged the entire thing, Your Honor, saying that there shouldn't be any fee at all, not a nominal fee, any more than there should be on the right to vote or the right for a candidate to run for a public office because he is indigent, or the right of a Jehovah's Witness to hand out literature without having to pay $1.00 a day."
1991.91-538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2664.535,2671.008,"Are you willing to have us decide the case, so the only fee at issue is this potential fee of up to $1,000."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2671.008,2688.609,"Although that is the issue before the Court as it came from the Eleventh Circuit, Your Honor, of course, if the Court in its wisdom sees fit, we would like to be able to say that the Court has said that the modern free speech cases have ruled out fees or taxes that burden the First Amendment."
1991.91-538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.609,2693.935,"But all I am saying, if I understand your argument correctly, you would make the same argument even if there were no other fees at all?"
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2693.935,2695.174,"Yes, we would, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2738.874,2752.303,"I assume that the rule, your no charge allowed, it doesn't just apply to political groups such as yours, I suppose it would apply to entertainment, if you wanted to have an open air rock concert, I suppose you couldn't charge."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2752.303,2759.027,"The cases have distinguished that to some extent, Your Honor, because that would be a commercial enterprise, whereas this is not a commercial enterprise."
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2762.487,2763.869,What do you mean commercial enterprise--
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2776.679,2785.923,"Yes, Your Honor, and it was distinguished from this case because it simply meant the volume could be turned down and in the lower courts, the original court said that that was the--"
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2785.923,2788.457,You have no quarrel with that--
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2795.25,2795.6,--No.
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2800.114,2801.873,You just made it.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2801.873,2811.441,"I was saying it could be made, but I am simply just saying, we are not a commercial enterprise, and so therefore, in no sense would we say that--"
1991.91-538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2811.441,2815.752,Then I still don't know the answer to Justice Scalia's question.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2829.433,2830.883,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2830.883,2832.815,So do you have a valid ground for distinguishing the case?
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2832.815,2835.718,This case from Ward v. Rock Against Racism?
1991.91-538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2835.718,2840.78,From the hypothetical of a rock concert wanting to come in and use this facility and having to pay the charge.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2840.78,2850.396,"If it is the public forum, I would say the First Amendment and the right to petition the Government, the right to speak, the right to assemble bars any fees in that public forum, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.396,2855.8,We just have to hope that it isn't our little town that they pick on to have the next big rock concert.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2855.8,2879.187,"Well, perhaps, Your Honor, if someone, let's say Luke Perry of Beverly Hills comes to town and he is on the courthouse steps surrounded by young ladies seeking autographs, he would be welcomed with bureaucratic hosannas, but on the other hand, Jerry Brown, not the one running for President, but the leader of the Forsyth County parade, he is on the steps wanting to collect signatures to petition the Government."
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2896.649,2904.212,"Now the Eleventh Circuit didn't decide the case on the basis that the ordinance wasn't content-neutral, did it?"
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2904.212,2910.147,"They said simply that on its face, $1,000 was not nominal and they read Murdock to say that it must be nominal."
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2910.147,2916.572,Do you defend that result here entirely apart from content neutrality and that sort of thing?
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2916.572,2920.753,I have to defend it because we want to win the case--
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2920.753,2921.223,"Well, sure."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2921.223,2931.04,"--But I also argue alternatively, Your Honor, in our brief, we say that any fee, nominal or otherwise, abridges the First Amendment in this case."
1991.91-538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2979.993,2983.234,Do you object to having to get a permit?
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,2983.234,2994.423,"Not, Your Honor, if it is simply to notify the authorities, to prevent competing interests from occupying the same space at the same time, as Cox said, for control."
1991.91-538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2994.423,2997.933,Let's assume that that costs the county some money.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,3006.378,3008.551,"The record will show, Your Honor, that we--"
1991.91-538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3008.551,3009.342,Right?
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,3009.342,3015.764,--The record shows we offered to pay $1.00 or $2.00 to the county for whatever charge--
1991.91-538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.764,3030.785,But you would not think that they... let's assume that they could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was going to cost them $50.00 to process your permit and you would say they could not charge that money?
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,3030.785,3035.399,"--That's correct, and I cite in the brief, we did a random survey--"
1991.91-538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3035.399,3038.871,That certainly is inconsistent with Cox.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,3038.871,3046.488,"--Cox was confined, if it please the Court, to a very limited fact circumstance, and in Murdock--"
1991.91-538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3046.488,3050.309,They were talking about a parade.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,3060.476,3073.385,"--They mentioned, for example, a circus where they had spectators, but Your Honor, the differentiation here is we are talking about hostile counterdemonstrators that are threatening the safety of those exercising their First Amendment rights."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3073.385,3077.937,But you wouldn't apply... you wouldn't acknowledge the permit requirement anyway.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,3086.012,3088.276,"We have no problem giving them our name, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.085,3092.518,"But that is part of your First Amendment argument, you can't ask anybody his name."
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,3092.518,3104.835,"--Well, Your Honor, if it please the Court, if there is someone that wants their name not to be divulged, there should be some way in the ordinance to protect their confidentiality as an individual."
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3108.938,3115.751,"But the facial challenge to the statute is it is invalid because it would require somebody to give a name to get a permit, that make the whole thing bad, doesn't it?"
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,3115.751,3125.118,"If there is a valid exception where the confidentiality could be respected, Your Honor, then there would be no challenge:"
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.032,3195.734,I see the mother paying out in municipal taxes what she might be buying food for her child with.
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,3203.03,3210.126,"Balance that if you will, Your Honor, between perhaps the sharpening right there of democracy's rusty instruments."
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3269.574,3272.075,How about the argument not made?
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,3276.858,3277.359,--Perhaps.
1991.91-538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3347.707,3351.229,"Rock concerts too, go with all of this, right?"
1991.91-538,1,38742,richard_barrett,,3351.229,3363.748,"--Well, Your Honor, I am a classical music fan, but I am prepared to let Mick Jagger play so long as Jerry Brown can petition the Government in the traditional public forum, yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3413.421,3419.665,"Thank you, Mr. Barrett."
