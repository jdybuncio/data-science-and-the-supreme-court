2004.03-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,3.715,"Mr. Kaplan, you may proceed."
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,3.715,8.423,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-814,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,106.299,113.236,"Is the Super Scoop practically capable of transportation on water, counsel?"
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,113.236,121.697,"It is more than practically capable, it actually is... actually transports its equipment and its personnel at work and its--"
2004.03-814,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,121.697,123.926,Didn't it come from the west... did it come from the west coast originally?
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,123.926,124.669,"--Indeed, it did."
2004.03-814,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,139.448,140.441,But there was nobody on it in that trip.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,140.441,140.934,--Sorry.
2004.03-814,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,140.934,143.329,There was nobody... there was no one on it--
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,143.329,143.479,"In fact, it's unmanned."
2004.03-814,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,143.479,144.256,--to be injured.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,144.256,146.961,"There was nobody injured and unmanned, yes, indeed."
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.663,259.577,"Well, now, that... that definition, used or capable of being used... right, now."
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,292.392,295.243,"--Very interesting question, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,296.895,300.694,"It... it goes to whether we want to use, you know, section 3 as... as our definition."
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,300.694,319.763,"--This Court seemed to have focused right on point in the cases of Cope in... Cope was early, 1903, and in the case of Evansville in 1926 when they added the two words, practically capable."
2004.03-814,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,380.199,387.63,Is that what we would say about all these gambling casino boats that are parked on the side of the Mississippi River?
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,387.63,398.115,"Your Honor, these are a problematic case, and the whole thing is determined on whether or not it's in navigation."
2004.03-814,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.973,400.882,What's your answer?
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,404.847,405.069,--If the--
2004.03-814,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,405.069,406.333,--along the side of the river.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,406.333,423.317,"--If the gambling boat has lost its ability to be in navigation, if it's affixed to the land, if it has connections to the land, if it doesn't expect to go into navigation, it is out of navigation."
2004.03-814,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,429.344,432.566,"And then what is the standard you use, the definition to use to get to that result?"
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,434.463,436.032,"Say that again, please."
2004.03-814,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,436.032,438.361,You've given us the answer.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,445.503,460.347,"Well, the standard that I'm seeking to have the Court employ is 1 U.S.C., section 3, which says, any... a vessel is any watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used--"
2004.03-814,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,460.347,464.434,And then... and then the riverboat... it depends on how... how permanently it's affixed to the land.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,468.521,478.552,"--If in fact it stays there for 10 years and it does not move, that's evidence that the owner intended that vessel to lose its position in navigation."
2004.03-814,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,478.552,481.152,So there's an intent component to your test now?
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,481.152,493.041,"There... there... technically one could say break the bonds that hold it to the dock and then take it out and use it because once a vessel, always a vessel?"
2004.03-814,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,496.058,496.28,Mr. Kaplan?
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,496.28,499.335,--when it's not practically capable of doing it.
2004.03-814,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.335,508.335,"Mr. Kaplan, you said two things and I... I'm wondering these are separate or they're really one concept."
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,541.028,543.174,The answer is no.
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.324,559.521,So you say it is a vessel.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,565.177,565.294,--I say it's not a vessel.
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.913,569.43,I... I like Justice Ginsburg's answer better.
2004.03-814,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,581.94,584.912,But then the question is whether or not it's in navigation at the time of the accident.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,584.912,586.277,And that only applies--
2004.03-814,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,586.277,590.818,"And... and that is a rule that, I take it, you do not wish us to adopt, or maybe you do."
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,590.818,599.567,"--I'm trying to establish that if it's in navigation, then it is a vessel."
2004.03-814,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,613.563,619.508,"No, but doesn't... doesn't that put you right back in the problem, the original problem, with... with the riverboat?"
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,635.399,645.885,"Justice Souter, if on that situation where all they have to do is cast the lines off and go out to sea, then of course it remains a vessel, and it remains in navigation."
2004.03-814,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,652.035,655.645,So you're saying... and I... I don't mean to disagree with you.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,658.805,673.006,"--There may be, but there's got to be some practically capable influence that this Court has already focused on to say whether that particular vessel is practically capable of being in navigation."
2004.03-814,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,683.509,691.089,"So... so what is... I see the First Circuit as trying to grapple with the very question you're raising, which is I think difficult."
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,691.089,691.56,Yes.
2004.03-814,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,691.56,695.313,"Of course, it seems to me fine, let section 3 apply."
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,744.316,745.885,Like the establishments from the--
2004.03-814,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,745.885,746.135,--What?
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,746.135,746.794,"--pier 4, yes."
2004.03-814,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,746.794,748.546,"Yes, yes, or one like that."
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,763.035,766.074,"Justice Breyer, we're talking primarily of Jones Act."
2004.03-814,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,766.074,766.75,Yes.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,766.75,770.571,Jones Act requires a relationship between the worker and the vessel.
2004.03-814,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,772.057,776.681,"So could we say... could we say that, as well, it must be unlike my garage door?"
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,795.174,797.032,--This Court has already established--
2004.03-814,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,797.032,797.486,Yes.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,797.486,802.483,"--what the standards are for Jones Act, whether a person qualifies."
2004.03-814,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,834.184,839.263,"When you say the function of the vessel, do you mean the function of the vessel in its transportation function?"
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,839.263,840.954,Yes.
2004.03-814,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,840.954,843.555,So that would be the answer to the riverboat problem.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,862.957,863.95,Precisely.
2004.03-814,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,863.95,865.231,"I mean, is that the way out of the problem?"
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.231,865.619,--Precisely?
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,865.991,873.132,There is a safeguard between the vessel and whether a person qualifies as a Jones Act seaman on that vessel.
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.132,880.851,"--So you... you think that the person who operates the dredge, since he's not navigating the vessel, is not covered by the Jones Act?"
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,880.851,882.216,"Oh, I do not."
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.817,885.726,You do not what?
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,887.418,888.616,--I say he's covered by the--
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,888.616,889.154,He is covered.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,890.928,892.043,--Why isn't what?
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.043,895.553,"Why isn't the croupier covered, you know?"
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,895.553,898.359,Is the croupier contributing to the function of the vessel?
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.359,900.382,That vessel's function is gambling.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,901.042,902.074,It is.
2004.03-814,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,902.074,911.984,"Does... look, does the... does the person in charge of the dredge control this process of pulling against anchor lines that moves it 8 feet or whatever it is?"
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,911.984,915.578,The manner in which the dredge... this dredge worked... by the way--
2004.03-814,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,915.578,919.088,"No, but if you can give me a yes or no answer, give me a yes or no answer."
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,919.088,919.293,--Yes.
2004.03-814,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,919.293,919.459,Okay.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,919.459,921.522,That man controls not only--
2004.03-814,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,921.522,923.63,"So that's why he's different from the croupier then, isn't he?"
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,923.63,926.768,--The croupier does not control the motion.
2004.03-814,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,926.768,930.649,"Right, and the... the guy in charge of the dredge does control the movement of it."
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,930.649,931.105,Absolutely.
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.105,934.57,What if you have a very complicated dredge and it takes two people?
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,955.747,956.74,I do believe that.
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,956.74,957.362,"Of course, you do."
2004.03-814,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,958.681,961.077,Then what do you... then what do you do with the croupier?
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,962.767,969.083,"Well, if the croupier is participating in the navigation of the vessel, we don't care anymore."
2004.03-814,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,969.083,971.851,He's not participating in the navigation of the vessel.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,971.851,973.337,Well--
2004.03-814,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,973.337,974.906,He's doing whatever croupiers do.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,977.674,979.614,"--They don't hand me any money, I'll tell you."
2004.03-814,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1122.072,1124.302,Is the scow a vessel too?
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,1124.302,1125.211,I'm sorry.
2004.03-814,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1125.583,1125.749,The scow.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,1126.326,1127.152,"Oh, the scow."
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.152,1127.352,That's easy.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,1127.352,1132.436,"Well, what happened in this one, if Your Honor please, is when... this was a collision at sea."
2004.03-814,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1141.558,1143.582,--I know the circumstances of the accident.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,1153.158,1153.696,"--Oh, indeed."
2004.03-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1164.182,1165.463,"Yes, but you haven't told us whether you think it was a vessel or not."
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,1165.463,1166.001,Pardon?
2004.03-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1166.001,1166.578,Was... was it a vessel?
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,1166.578,1168.025,The scow is a vessel.
2004.03-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1168.025,1169.261,The scow was.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,1169.261,1170.542,The scow is absolutely a vessel.
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1170.542,1171.285,"Oh, that's not even close."
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,1171.285,1171.923,Not even--
2004.03-814,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1171.923,1174.34,"I mean, it carries all this goop somewhere else to... to dump it."
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,1174.712,1176.941,--They had to move from here to somewhere else.
2004.03-814,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1177.024,1178.222,Then explain to me why--
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,1178.222,1179.337,--So did the Super... sorry.
2004.03-814,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1179.337,1181.21,--why it wasn't the vessel that counts.
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,1192.134,1197.79,"Well, the Super Scoop was not moving at that moment, but the scow was moving--"
2004.03-814,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1197.79,1199.647,"Well, why don't you just say the scow was a vessel?"
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,1203.901,1219.876,"--I would take that, Your Honor, but I would like to extend it to get a status... a statement from this Court so that we can remove the indecisions, the silly tests that the lower courts have been creating for what is a vessel and what is not a vessel."
2004.03-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1219.876,1220.991,"Thank you, Mr. Kaplan."
2004.03-814,0,21082,david_b_kaplan,,1223.47,1224.585,"Oh, my."
2004.03-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.411,1234.449,Ms. Blatt.
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1234.449,1239.361,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-814,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1264.42,1268.917,Do you think we need to use the word practical or practically in section 3?
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1268.917,1269.926,Yes.
2004.03-814,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1283.035,1284.128,Why is that reading anything in?
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1289.351,1291.292,I don't... I don't think it much--
2004.03-814,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1291.292,1292.695,I don't regard that as a reading in at all.
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1298.079,1300.663,"--That's fine, and I think... like I said, this is an easy case."
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1302.315,1304.257,Why... why is this an easy case?
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1343.682,1344.22,"--Justice Breyer, the--"
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1344.22,1345.789,"--had a test, tries to make those distinctions."
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1345.789,1345.922,--Right.
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1351.091,1351.279,All right.
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1352.188,1352.56,What it did is it--
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1352.56,1353.653,Now let's take section 3.
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1353.653,1354.479,"--Okay, let's... okay, let's go from there."
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1354.479,1357.451,"And taking section 3, it seems to me, we have the same problems."
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1357.451,1358.937,Let me... let me answer your question.
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1358.937,1372.683,"And I'd like to know your answer and you just said to Scalia what I thought... Justice Scalia that I thought what was an answer isn't because I thought that word practical, as co-counsel recommended, has a rather specialized meaning where we get rid of a lot of these."
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1373.798,1383.457,"I think the... the... you look at the physical characteristics and the surrounding circumstances of any type of watercraft, and if it's out there moving, I... I think that really is an easy case."
2004.03-814,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1431.466,1433.878,But that goes to in navigation--
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1433.878,1434.128,That's correct.
2004.03-814,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.128,1435.447,--not to whether it's a vessel or not.
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1443.499,1443.992,I agree.
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1470.536,1473.469,Your... your view of the word in navigation does all the work here.
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1494.867,1496.42,We think it's in navigation.
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1497.163,1497.363,All right.
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1497.613,1498.235,--If it's--
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1498.235,1507.401,"--the concert master and the... the... all the orchestra players and everyone else are covered by the Jones Act even though, by the way, none of them has ever moved whatsoever."
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1507.401,1507.789,"--No, no."
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1520.71,1521.536,"Well, if that's so, that's--"
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1521.536,1522.196,--I'm going to answer your question on the seaman.
2004.03-814,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1547.254,1547.809,Okay.
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1563.313,1563.479,No.
2004.03-814,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1563.479,1564.388,Is that the way we do it?
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1564.388,1570.166,There's... there's a decision in McDermott v. Wilander that expressly holds that the worker need not aid in the navigation of the ship.
2004.03-814,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1570.166,1570.704,That's right.
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1570.704,1574.625,"Bartenders, croupiers, waitresses, et cetera on cruise ships are all seamen."
2004.03-814,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1581.478,1584.616,So as long as... as long as somebody is... is engaged in a navigation--
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1584.616,1584.838,In the ship's work--
2004.03-814,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1584.838,1586.119,"--function, everybody else comes--"
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1586.119,1586.657,--whether that work is gambling or--
2004.03-814,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1586.657,1587.028,--Okay.
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1587.028,1600.774,"--But now we have, in my concert ship, the concert master and the whole orchestra covered by the Jones Act even if none of them, by the way, has ever been even to sea on that day when... they take the train."
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1600.774,1603.336,"--Well, I just said that they may not be covered, but they--"
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1603.336,1603.541,Because?
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1603.541,1604.906,--They may not be covered--
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1604.906,1605.127,Because?
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1605.127,1606.513,--They may not be covered if they fail the last requirement--
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1606.513,1607.339,But it says--
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1607.339,1608.165,--of Chandris.
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1608.165,1613.078,"--in terms of both its duration and its nature, i.e., a connection to a vessel--"
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1613.078,1613.904,Vessel in navigation.
2004.03-814,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1613.904,1614.276,--in navigation.
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1614.276,1623.275,"Right, and I... Harbor Tug v. Barge, which is a later opinion, explains that that test will look at whether the employee's duties take him or her to sea."
2004.03-814,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1723.296,1733.865,"Ms. Blatt, the... there was a brief filed by Signal I think that argues that a Jones Act vessel has to provide food, care and lodging to be covered."
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1733.865,1734.153,Right.
2004.03-814,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1743.541,1747.611,Are there problems in computing maintenance and cure in a case like this one?
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1747.611,1750.311,It's usually governed by the collective bargaining agreement.
2004.03-814,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1755.869,1757.559,Suppose it were just left it up to the law.
2004.03-814,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1759.971,1772.791,"--There used to be, but in... there used to be a debate, which I think most of the cases the Signal brief is relying on, in how long maintenance and cure goes for and it was a rather kind of arcane, tricky thing, but basically this Court resolved it in 1930."
2004.03-814,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.828,1829.428,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,1831.37,1836.2,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-814,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1919.253,1924.926,"Well, that might affect the decision of whether they are seamen covered under the Jones Act."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,1926.85,1927.388,Well--
2004.03-814,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1927.388,1932.134,But there may be other aspects of the test that aren't met--
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,1932.134,1933.249,--But breaking it down--
2004.03-814,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1933.249,1933.786,--when the thing is tied up.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,1933.786,1939.609,"--Breaking it down, Your Honor, if the petitioner has his way, those tests are met."
2004.03-814,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1960.142,1967.822,"I think it might be a vessel, but probably not in navigation while it's tied up or in mothballs."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,1967.822,1970.134,"--Again, Your Honor, all it is is tied to the pier."
2004.03-814,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.738,1992.221,"Yes, but I think what the Government has said is that though it's in navigation, we have a case that says that the... that the seaman's connection to the ship has to be related to the functioning of the ship in navigation."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2002.373,2006.997,"Well, I don't think a dredge operator does that any more than the waiter on the casino."
2004.03-814,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2014.882,2016.246,But isn't... isn't that the point?
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2021.569,2028.174,"Well, it is our position... and as stated by some of the First Circuit... that the movement of the dredge was incidental."
2004.03-814,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2028.712,2029.622,Should we clarify that?
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2043.778,2044.149,--Correct.
2004.03-814,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2044.149,2046.173,"Obviously, a croupier has such a connection."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2046.173,2046.711,"Correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-814,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2046.711,2049.312,It doesn't say anything about being connected to the navigating part.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2049.312,2052.989,"That's correct, and this Court handled that in Wilander, Your Honor, that it said in--"
2004.03-814,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.989,2060.168,Not to the navigating part but to what the vessel is doing in the course of its being in navigation.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2060.168,2066.856,"--If the term, Your Honor, in navigation, had the bite that I think it should have, then we may not be here today at all."
2004.03-814,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2108.057,2118.255,"But as Mr. Kaplan pointed out, all... the fact that something is a vessel doesn't mean there's Jones Act coverage, and I think Mr. Kaplan was getting to the perils of the sea."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2127.46,2139.841,"Well, Your Honor, the perils of the sea, which this Court discussed at length in the Papai case, we... we say that... that is further evidence that Mr. Stewart is not entitled to Jones Act remedies."
2004.03-814,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2161.268,2165.726,"One peril was a collision with another vessel, and that's exactly what happened here."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2165.726,2166.962,"--We disagree with that, Your Honor."
2004.03-814,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2192.557,2195.119,Suppose there had been... suppose there had been very rough water--
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2195.119,2196.317,They would have sent everyone home.
2004.03-814,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2196.317,2201.313,--and... and the crane operator was the... was operating it and the water came over the freeboard and it capsized.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2203.708,2207.878,"Well, because we are in the protected harbors of the... of Boston Harbor--"
2004.03-814,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2207.878,2207.978,No.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2212.253,2213.329,--That happened a week ago.
2004.03-814,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2213.329,2214.111,--every 86 years or something.
2004.03-814,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.565,2219.273,It happens every... every 86 years they have one of these storms.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2219.683,2220.388,Your--
2004.03-814,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2220.388,2222.412,So far.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2222.412,2228.727,"--Your Honor, I think in that... in that... using your hypothetical, it's a construction platform right off the coast."
2004.03-814,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2262.043,2263.091,And... and by the Coast Guard.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2263.091,2265.425,--The Coast Guard also.
2004.03-814,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2272.363,2277.564,"You're not contending that anything that happens in a harbor is not exposed to the perils of the sea, are you?"
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2277.564,2278.186,"--Oh, absolutely not, Your Honor."
2004.03-814,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2306.793,2315.066,But how do you... how can you possibly describe as a bright line test anything that says you have to identify the primary function?
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2327.431,2332.921,"Well, Your Honor, what it is, I believe, is a bright line test with an exception."
2004.03-814,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2355.834,2362.809,Even though the identical accident happens to his buddy 10 minutes before when the vessel isn't moving.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2362.809,2371.149,"Well, Your Honor, at no time during the 1 and a half years that Mr. Stewart was in the harbor, as far as we know from the record, was the Super Scoop in transportation."
2004.03-814,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2409.248,2417.627,"I... I guess I could agree with you if... if I believed that I had to look to the primary purpose, whether the primary purpose of the vessel was transportation."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2444.005,2447.143,"--I think in that situation, Your Honor, it's... it's a closer call, that they--"
2004.03-814,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.143,2448.092,I don't think it's close at all.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2449.95,2454.796,--That is a traditional trip... ship and those people are engaged in a form of transport--
2004.03-814,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2454.796,2463.119,"But... but that's not the primary purpose of... of the ship, just as the primary purpose of this scow is... of... of this dredge is not transportation."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2463.119,2469.972,"--In that situation, Your Honor, it would be... it would be a primary purpose, though, that transporting the people who happen to be gambling--"
2004.03-814,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2469.972,2470.715,"Oh, a primary purpose?"
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2474.68,2475.794,"--Well, in the First Circuit--"
2004.03-814,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2475.794,2476.992,It has to be a primary purpose.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2476.992,2481.284,"--Well, in the Manuel court, the Fifth Circuit actually uses the term, a primary purpose."
2004.03-814,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.284,2481.739,A Oh.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2481.739,2483.308,And... and I think... and to a degree that--
2004.03-814,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.308,2484.051,And you think that's not fuzzy.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2484.506,2486.902,"--It's an... it's an oxymoron, Your Honor."
2004.03-814,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2581.368,2597.865,"There's a difference to this extent, would you agree, that something that's just tied up to the dock and never moves is different from something that is actually in the water and whether you call it transportation, it is moving?"
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2604.098,2615.615,"Well, Your Honor, this Court has decided, I believe it was in Chandris, that a... a seaman doesn't lose his seaman status just because the vessel he's assigned to is now in... in port."
2004.03-814,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2618.194,2626.639,"Well, I'm just... let's focus on what is a vessel because someone... it may be a vessel but the injured person may not be a seaman."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2655.905,2663.995,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but of course, the ultimate issue the Court is trying to arrive at is whether or not Mr. Stewart is a Jones Act seaman."
2004.03-814,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2697.682,2699.457,Is it... is it the vessel that's the problem?
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2708.949,2710.89,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-814,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2710.89,2715.925,"Of course, you can or you wouldn't have the... the combination of the two terms appearing anywhere."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2722.035,2747.011,"Well, again, Your Honor, if... if in navigation means what it should mean, which is an instrument for transportation or commerce over navigable waters, and not simply as the petitioner and the Government want it to mean that anything that once might have been in navigable waters and stays in navigable waters and isn't mothballed is still in navigation... if it means what it should mean, then that's something I think the First Circuit is... was trying to get to anyway."
2004.03-814,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2761.294,2761.477,"Well, exactly."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2785.814,2794.525,"The First Circuit does... the First Circuit rule, Your Honor, in DiGiovanni and Fall and Stewart does have a snapshot exception."
2004.03-814,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2794.525,2794.897,Yes.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2794.897,2797.209,There's the main rule which has a bright line--
2004.03-814,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2797.209,2799.81,"Right, and that was rejected by this Court in Chandris."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2802.206,2807.9,"--Well, Your Honor, there... there are always... and this is answering Justice Ginsburg's question earlier as well."
2004.03-814,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2824.884,2843.46,"Yes, but it might be much simpler to rely on 1 U.S. Code, section 3 and our... our definition, as we've described it there, and then deal with other situations within the framework of the definition of seaman and the other issues that arise."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2856.447,2866.106,"Your Honor, again, I... I think that if 1 U.S.C., section 3 is adopted, then every vessel capable--"
2004.03-814,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2866.106,2867.1,Congress adopted that.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2867.1,2868.707,"--Well, I don't... I don't agree, Your Honor."
2004.03-814,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2920.431,2925.633,If... if you go... I thought vessel... the word vessel appears in our cases.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2928.704,2929.613,It does not appear in the Jones Act--
2004.03-814,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2929.613,2929.985,All right.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,2998.261,3002.226,--It is pursuant to what... the petitioner and the Government's view.
2004.03-814,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3002.226,3004.084,I know it is but what is your view?
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,3004.084,3008.664,"My view is that it shouldn't be, that it should have some bite to it."
2004.03-814,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3025.277,3033.079,"Well, would it help? Suppose we were to say it was... had to be capable, at least, of having a captain and crew?"
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,3033.079,3036.051,"--I have never thought of that, Your Honor."
2004.03-814,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3036.051,3038.902,Then we better not do anything for the first time.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,3039.239,3053.884,"Your Honor, I think in that in that situation, there are... there can be vessels involved with transportation, getting back to the Cope case and other cases, where there... it's... it's a barge being towed, but it's transporting things."
2004.03-814,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3086.828,3092.688,The... the word vessel does appear in the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,3092.688,3093.265,"Correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-814,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3093.265,3113.782,And this is the... the only purpose of the vessel inquiry that we're involved in is to... to say is this person within one injury compensation scheme or another.
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,3113.782,3114.691,Correct.
2004.03-814,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3114.691,3128.893,"Now why, in making that inquiry, should the courts go off on their own and be inventive and come up with a definition when Congress has given a definition that can be used by default?"
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,3144.618,3152.214,Because this Court effectively overruled the definition or decided not to use it in the Evansville case.
2004.03-814,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3174.218,3174.756,Was the Court then--
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,3174.756,3175.394,--the Court has decided--
2004.03-814,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3175.394,3175.715,--just construing--
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,3175.715,3177.367,--not to follow section 3.
2004.03-814,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3177.367,3183.228,"--just construing instead of not following, but say by capable, Congress must mean practically capable."
2004.03-814,2,23733,frederick_e_connelly_jr,,3183.228,3186.944,Your Honor... and I realize that is what Justice Scalia said earlier.
2004.03-814,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3600.261,3600.921,"Thank you, Mr. Connelly."
