1974.73-1016,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.261,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 73-1016, Lascaris against Shirley and 73-1095, Lavine against Shirley, consolidated."
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,17.063,17.503,Thank you.
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,813.089,819.187,"Well, could you -- could New York disqualify the child for this reason?"
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,819.187,819.614,No.
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,822.049,822.898,"You mean, your statute?"
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,822.898,823.904,That's right.
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,823.904,829.381,"But what if it did, could it -- would that pass (Inaudible)?"
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,829.381,837.76,"Well, I think we'd have a difficult time establishing that."
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,837.76,851.521,"Well, if it -- wouldn't you run into the cases, let's say that a state can't establish any additional qualifications?"
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,851.521,853.914,"Well, we've run it."
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.93,857.026,At least for the child.
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,857.026,859.09,At least for the child.
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,874.069,875.548,How do you handle the cases?
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,880.107,905.526,"Well, this Court in Dubino and in Townsend against Swank laid down various ground rules, if the statute is within the legitimate sphere of state administration as long as it doesn't conflict with any substantial provision of the Social Security Act, the state's provision is all right."
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.998,940.497,"So, you're saying that the condition of the state law is either expressly or impliedly found in the Social Security Act?"
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,940.497,941.244,Absolutely.
1974.73-1016,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,946.681,969.315,"Are you suggesting that this is comparable to a state provision that if employment is offered, which does not interfere with a child care, that the mother must take the employment in order to continue her benefits, not the child's benefits?"
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,969.315,983.653,"Well, it's -- so long that same general line of reasoning that that a person as this Court said in Wyman against James, a person should not be able to get ADC on her own informational terms."
1974.73-1016,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,987.174,989.2,Is that the one why she refused the interview?
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,989.2,991.915,"The home visitation, yes sir."
1974.73-1016,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1216.866,1221.315,You said its 700 and some million dollars a year that's --
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1221.315,1236.364,"Well, it's estimated that the State Department of Social Service estimates that its -- that the cost -- I have to say that the AFDC program is not budgeted in the New York State budget as a separate public assistant items."
1974.73-1016,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1288.58,1294.009,How many other states have an analogue to 101-a?
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1294.009,1297.189,"Oh, I don't know if I can answer that."
1974.73-1016,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1297.189,1300.981,"Well, I don't care about precisely but do -- the most of them or do --"
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1300.981,1301.63,"Well, there has been Iowa --"
1974.73-1016,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1301.63,1303.217,-- (Voice Overlap) of them or what?
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1303.217,1321.191,"Well, 101-a, all that I know about is Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Iowa, New York and there was a recent case out in Utah, Rose against Pampton (ph) I believe in June of 1974 which I just found the other day."
1974.73-1016,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1352.924,1355.826,"That was done after you did it, wouldn't it?"
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1355.826,1359.439,That was done pendente lite after the first -- after the court's remand.
1974.73-1016,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1359.439,1361.762,And that's your behest?
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1361.762,1362.102,No.
1974.73-1016,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1362.102,1364.954,"Not yours personally but at the Commissioner's behest, wouldn't it?"
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1364.954,1367.679,Let me say this.
1974.73-1016,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1417.417,1419.223,Or at least you explained why you couldn't answer it.
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1419.223,1430.962,"Well, now, the federal stat -- we think the federal statutes and regulations and the state statute, a recognition of the basic and primary duty of the parent's duty to support his child."
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.451,1460.483,How long with this study you are following?
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1460.483,1463.675,"Well, the regulation -- I don't know when that was adopted."
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.342,1475.468,And prior to that?
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1475.468,1479.608,It would have been sometime after 1970 Your Honor.
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.608,1489.311,"Well, you didn't impose this condition prior to 1970 or 72?"
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1489.311,1501.907,I do not -- It was in a state regulation but I do not believe there was any provision in the state regulation to impose such a condition prior to Lascaris against Wyman in 67 Miscellaneous.
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1501.907,1514.454,Was that -- was this state condition or policy contrary to HEW regulations prior to the amendment of the HEW regulation?
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1514.454,1527.735,"HEW have taken the position that -- had spoken to the provisions of 402 (a) (11), the NOLEO requirement, the Notice to Law Enforcement Offices requirement."
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1582.494,1583.752,The amendment of his regulation?
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1583.752,1585.387,His -- amendment of his regulation.
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1599.805,1605.5,"So, under the new regulations, New York's regulation is permissible?"
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1605.5,1607.057,Yes.
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.057,1612.261,"And yet the district judge held it and I guess it was held, wasn't it, invalid?"
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1612.261,1613.0,"Yes, he did."
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1613.0,1616.341,Because it was inconsistent with the statute.
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1627.111,1628.109,"No, I don't believe they have."
1974.73-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1628.109,1634.606,"And they haven't addressed this holding, that the amendment was invalid?"
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1634.606,1638.836,"Well, other than in there, we found the jurisdictional question."
1974.73-1016,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1669.35,1674.268,You're' now using whatever time -- you may wonder as reserved for rebuttal.
1974.73-1016,0,16820,alan_w_rubenstein,,1674.268,1703.875,"Well, in that case I think I'll have to stop and just say to the Court that we don't think that a statute was ever intended to enable this woman to come in on her own terms and get assistance, that she has a duty to help us determine the resources, the Congress has always spoken in terms of support as a resources in our brief."
1974.73-1016,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1727.012,1736.999,Mr. Eldridge.
1974.73-1016,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1736.999,1753.775,"Mr. Eldridge, this might be premature but I hope that some point in your argument you may say something about whether if this HEW Amendment were valid or whether you have any case?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1753.775,1756.689,There are two HEW regulations Mr. Justice Brennan.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1756.689,1758.655,"Well, I'm thinking of the one that --"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1758.655,1760.651,That coexist at this point.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1760.651,1761.13,Yeah.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1761.13,1766.962,This latest regulation which is 233.90 (b) (4) I believe.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1766.962,1770.265,"(Voice Overlap), these numbers get me all confused."
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1774.736,1775.393,That's correct.
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1775.393,1776.708,Where in these papers could we find it?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1776.708,1780.561,Page 28 of the jurisdictional statement in the Lavine case.
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1780.561,1780.848,Thank you.
1974.73-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1780.848,1783.373,1095.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1783.373,1792.863,That purports to allow a state to exclude a mother if she fails to cooperate in the prosecution.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1792.863,1795.755,And that may be denied for the uncooperative care (Voice Overlap) --
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1795.755,1796.623,That's correct.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1796.623,1796.883,Yeah.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1796.883,1807.378,"They coexist with that regulation, in other regulation of HEW, 233.90, is that it?"
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1807.378,1809.224,Where can we find that one?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1809.224,1810.821,Okay.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1810.821,1814.582,"Well, I thought this amendment was an amendment to 233.90?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1814.582,1817.614,235.70 which still exist.
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1828.22,1848.919,"If it's set out in this jurisdictional statement on behalf of appellant Lavine on page 28 under B.It says Section 233.90 is amended by adding the paragraph B, a new sub-paragraph 4 as set forth below and B, is that it?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1848.919,1851.532,Let's see.
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1851.532,1852.069,Take your time.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1855.61,1857.394,"Page 3, is that --?"
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1857.394,1859.089,"No, page 28."
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1859.089,1859.746,Of the jurisdiction?
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1859.746,1871.225,"On the jurisdictional statement on the part of Lavine, go down toward the bottom of the page in the smaller print."
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1881.431,1882.529,Yes.
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1886.609,1892.435,"It says, a child may not be denied AFDC either initially or subsequently?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1902.541,1903.048,All right.
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1903.048,1913.3,Because a parent or caretaker or relative fails to assist in the establishment of paternity of a child born out of wedlock or in seeking support from a person having a legal duty to support the child.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1914.176,1917.559,"Nonetheless, there still exist 235."
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1917.559,1918.368,I know.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1918.368,1920.901,Which says that it is not legal.
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1920.901,1921.388,I know.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1922.546,1929.799,"Well, I submit to you that HEW in promulgating this regulation did so without the authority of the Congress."
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1931.314,1934.017,"Well, do you mean in both regulations?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1934.017,1935.811,The first regulation.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1945.648,1947.772,That was the original 233.90.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1947.772,1951.892,That has been the view of HEW since 1951 when this amendment first started.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1951.892,1955.094,"(Voice Overlap) amendment, it wasn't in that regulation, was it?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1955.094,1961.23,There was no condition of eligibility ever in a regulation of HEW until 1973.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1961.23,1963.284,"I see, until this amendment?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1963.284,1964.1,That's correct.
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1972.462,1974.007,Which amendment are you talking about?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1976.241,1977.566,That the latest amendment.
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1979.612,1980.71,What number is that?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1980.71,1983.844,That is 233.90 before.
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1983.844,1984.78,I have just read part of --
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1984.78,1987.585,"That's correct, that's correct."
1974.73-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1991.445,1992.693,"For its parent, for the parent?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1992.693,1993.2,For the parent only.
1974.73-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1993.2,1994.036,Not for the child?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,1994.036,1995.354,Not for the child.
1974.73-1016,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2001.977,2003.622,Isn't that true of all regulations?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2006.215,2014.34,I believe that's correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist but they have authority only if they comport with the intentions of Congress.
1974.73-1016,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2014.34,2016.663,And what about as expressed in the statutes?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2016.663,2033.776,"As expressed in the statutes and in this -- in the Social Security Act, there is an extensive scheme, the NOLEO scheme set out to achieve support for AFDC children and parents."
1974.73-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.994,2045.848,"Well, what about Justice Brennan's question, let's assume this regulation is valid?"
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2045.848,2046.457,The Amendment?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2046.457,2047.573,The amendment --
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2047.681,2048.627,1973 Amendment.
1974.73-1016,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.668,2052.777,Right.
1974.73-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.777,2055.28,Suppose that is -- let's assume that's valid.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2055.28,2065.039,Then there is a constitutional question that an equal protection problem -- it has not been dealt with in any of these cases here before because of the court's teachings.
1974.73-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.039,2073.277,"But the issue here then would be decided against it, the statutory issue."
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2073.277,2076.282,I don't believe there is support in the statute to decide it against me.
1974.73-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2092.005,2094.579,What problem -- I know but if that's an exception.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2101.353,2107.597,The statutory issue would then -- what would remain would be the constitutional issue with the equal protection.
1974.73-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.597,2111.889,And so if the case does post the validity of this regulation?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2111.889,2112.466,"Yes, it does."
1974.73-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2112.466,2113.342,Squarely.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2113.342,2113.751,"Yes, it does."
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2113.751,2124.053,"And as a matter of fact, I expect it does although the Government is not represented here in light of the holding of the District Court that the Amendment was invalid."
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2124.053,2127.926,"The District Court said that the Amendment was not a guide post to be followed judicially, that's correct."
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2127.926,2129.441,"Well, I thought it went beyond that."
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2156.37,2156.64,Yes.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2156.64,2159.123,Isn't that a holding that it's invalid?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2159.123,2160.161,"I believe it is, yes."
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2160.161,2166.486,"Because it's not a -- well, it affects -- as the statute does not otherwise permit a condition of eligibility."
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2166.486,2167.794,That's correct.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2168.251,2172.393,But we have to reach it although the Government is not here.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2172.393,2176.513,"Well, the -- they were invited by this Court to speak to the issue they presented on brief."
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2176.513,2178.956,"Well, they -- all they did was say we ought to hear the case."
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2183.735,2188.144,I can't explain their absence Mr. Justice Brennan.
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2205.164,2214.192,Did they all relate to taking the support away from the mother or the child?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2214.192,2217.146,They initially --
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2225.844,2230.253,"The cases were not the same issue as we got presented here though, were they?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2230.253,2245.752,"Well, in the three affirmances of this Court in Meyers v. Juras, the mother was -- I believe cut off."
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2341.572,2351.324,"That was a -- that would also be true in the case where the mother was cut off for refusing to allow visitation, would it not?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2351.324,2354.955,"Visitation, are you referring to Wyman versus James?"
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2355.033,2360.49,I'm referring to the general problem which Wyman v. James is just one example.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2360.49,2366.001,That is a very real aspect of the problems presented by Wyman versus James.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2450.529,2455.158,"And -- NOLEO mean, Notice to the Office of the Local Enforcement?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2455.158,2459.637,Notice to Law Enforcement Officers.
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2556.071,2558.975,That's a policy position of the Department --
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2558.975,2565.811,I think it was policy position which was a lens to the congressional intent.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2608.655,2620.768,"Mr. Eldridge, if this be a convenient time for you to summarize New York law with respect to the obligation of a father to support his children whether wed or unwed?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2620.768,2632.906,"A father who is acknowledged to be the father of the child, a natural father, wed or unwed has the obligation to support his child until 21."
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2632.906,2634.99,Whether wed or unwed?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2634.99,2636.255,That's correct.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2638.701,2645.974,"Once he's identified as the father and there is a proceeding for identifying him as the father, i.e. a paternity proceeding?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2645.974,2653.296,That's correct Mr. Justice Stewart and that proceeding maybe brought by the Commissioner of Social Services for any county.
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2657.086,2664.419,"But it's a little difficult to maintain that kind of litigation without the cooperation of the mother, is it not?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2664.419,2665.79,"It may be, but --"
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2665.79,2666.811,Maybe?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2666.811,2670.108,"-- but by and large Mr. Chief Justice, people cooperate."
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2695.432,2700.729,"Well, we're not concerned in this case, are we with cases -- situations where they cooperate."
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2702.181,2713.351,"But the point -- the magnitude of the problem by and large people do cooperate and 67% of some counties in California, people do go along with us."
1974.73-1016,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2765.082,2774.222,"May I ask Mr. Eldridge, is there any statutory amendment to which this regulation amendment is 73 is hooked?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2774.222,2775.44,The federal regulation?
1974.73-1016,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2775.44,2775.857,Yeah.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2775.857,2776.526,No.
1974.73-1016,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2776.526,2777.522,There is none.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2781.314,2782.811,That is exactly correct.
1974.73-1016,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2784.536,2791.161,"Whether the WIN program, when the 1967 Amendment added a condition of eligibility."
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2791.161,2794.812,"In 1967, there were two amendments up for consideration."
1974.73-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2813.467,2825.136,But they did -- and that was when they did add the requirement that the states have a special unit to pursue the support obligations of parents?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2825.136,2826.052,That's correct.
1974.73-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2826.052,2828.527,And required the states to have that kind of a scheme?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2828.527,2841.375,That is exactly right but they did not say that that scheme could encompass a condition of eligibility and there had been since 1951 a scheme which did not include conditions of eligibility.
1974.73-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2841.375,2845.784,I gather that was the reasoning of the District Court?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2845.784,2849.847,I believe that that's why they granted no credence to the --
1974.73-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.847,2858.37,"Well, why they held that there was nothing comparable to the WIN edition of a condition of eligibility in regard to NOLEO?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2858.37,2865.043,That's correct and I think that that's why Dublino is not dispositive or is really relevant to this case.
1974.73-1016,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.43,2877.436,Well I expect though we'll have to look at both the statute in the legislative history under the Townsend-Swank case.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2879.023,2883.522,I think that is exactly the test that should be supplied here.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2907.089,2908.696,This is a pending Bill now?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2908.696,2911.957,"This is a Bill that passed the Senate, passed the House --"
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2911.957,2912.327,How long though?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2912.327,2913.892,HR 3153.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2913.892,2914.898,How long it go?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2914.898,2917.271,It has been battled up in conference since 1972.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2917.271,2919.544,How long (Voice Overlap) -- the House of Senate?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2919.544,2929.574,"1972 in October it passed the Senate in 1972, November it passed the House."
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2932.047,2934.57,"And unless it comes out today, it'll laps, isn't it?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2934.57,2935.875,"Its 1973, I'm sorry."
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2937.053,2939.568,"And unless it comes out today I gather, it will relapse, would it?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2939.568,2941.315,I think it is dead really.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2951.152,2952.537,Is that in your brief?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2952.537,2957.757,"No, this is something that we've just adverted to by my opponent in his last brief."
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2957.757,2958.703,In the reply brief?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2958.703,2959.172,Yes.
1974.73-1016,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2967.467,2970.259,"Isn't that the report down there, 93?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2970.259,2971.557,553.
1974.73-1016,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2971.557,2972.882,553.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,2972.882,2984.181,"It says, “The Committee built, would make cooperation in identifying the absent parent a condition of AFDC eligibility.”"
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2992.102,3000.034,The existence of that statute doesn't mean that the state didn't have the power previously?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3000.034,3000.272,I would submit in this --
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3000.272,3005.819,That is recently passed to clarify ambiguous situations.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3005.819,3019.788,"The -- throughout the legislative history, they do not talk about the ambiguity of the situation, they talk about the fact that the states are not pursuing the remedies under the situation and they say that more -- that stronger legislation is required."
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3036.529,3041.188,"Isn't she being offered a -- in this case, isn't she offered a financial incentive?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3041.188,3042.144,They draw a distinction there.
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3114.937,3127.987,"Well, is it possible that Congress is now considering action in order to force recalcitrant states and administrators to take steps, may --"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3127.987,3128.314,"Certainly, this --"
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3128.314,3131.368,"In other words, make it a condition of the grant?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3131.368,3141.259,"Certainly, this was what was under consideration in 3153, as you say though, 3153 is probably dead as of Friday on Congress adjourns."
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3147.544,3161.093,But it isn't quite a different thing to make it a condition of a grant by the Federal Government to the state so that the matching grant and the states making it a condition to the non-cooperating parent?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3161.093,3162.089,Those are quite different things.
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3162.089,3162.728,Quite different things.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3162.728,3165.301,"One requires the state to act, the other requires the parent to act."
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3165.301,3166.896,"Yeah, that's right."
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3183.345,3190.591,I think it has relevance and that it indicates that Congress had never countenance what New York is doing to non-cooperating relatives --
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3190.591,3191.667,As to condition of eligibility?
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3191.667,3193.042,As a condition of eligibility.
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3193.042,3196.236,"Which under Townsend-Swank, you suggest as the test?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3196.236,3196.613,Exactly the test that --
1974.73-1016,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3196.613,3208.011,"And we can't find either in the legislation, in the act itself or in the legislative history that they did intend to authorized the states to attach this condition of eligibility."
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3209.935,3211.093,That is correct Mr. Justice Brennan.
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3211.093,3211.48,And there --
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3211.48,3219.42,"It starts in King versus Smith that goes in Townsend v. Swank and it is reaffirmed in Carlson versus (Inaudible), all of which were unanimous opinions to this Court."
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3219.42,3219.62,And there are other --
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3219.62,3219.959,That's the doctrine --
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3219.959,3225.947,"-- cases which hold that if it isn't forbidden and there's a reasonable regulation, it's permissible, are they not?"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3225.947,3231.197,"Well, under Dublino, there was a discussion of what a reasonable regulation might be."
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3278.024,3299.295,"But then if Congress passes this pending legislation that you've been talking about there probably would be a question raised by someone, sometime rather it is permissible for Congress to attach a condition to its grant of $358 million annually to the State of New York, that they've pursue --"
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3299.295,3303.115,But that's been the nature of categorical grants from their inception.
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3306.618,3314.322,But if it is reasonable then there -- then perhaps there is no constitutional question.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3314.322,3316.169,That may be.
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3316.169,3321.227,But you -- I thought you would -- eventually conceded its reasonableness in terms of --
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3321.227,3322.213,The reasonableness of what?
1974.73-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3322.892,3329.217,Of the categorical grant by the Federal Government to the state.
1974.73-1016,1,20816,douglas_a_eldridge,,3329.217,3335.945,There are lots of ways to examine the reasonableness in the instance of federal revenue sharing at this point.
