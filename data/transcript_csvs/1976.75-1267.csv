1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,68.862,69.828,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.75-1267,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,464.265,476.187,"When you say this typical of this particular industry, do you -- would you distinguish that from large commercial farming operations generally, as they have changed from the old traditional patterns?"
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,476.187,481.309,"Well, I am going to be very cautious here about talking about any other industry than poultry."
1976.75-1267,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,966.975,969.134,"The Tax Court decision, that is not in your brief."
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,969.134,973.314,"No, no, it was decided in 1975 and it is just pointed out that…"
1976.75-1267,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,973.314,974.736,Could you give us the citation again.
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,974.736,988.576,"It is 64 Tax Court 438 and one of the citations that says on page 451, of that case, it says, obviously this was talking about duck grower."
1976.75-1267,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1077.097,1087.171,"How in this case are the farmers compensated, they have given a straight payment an addition, a bonus if, what the chickens are of a certain quality and size?"
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1087.171,1089.884,"Well, if you turn to the next page A24."
1976.75-1267,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1089.884,1090.647,A24 of what?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1090.647,1094.714,"A24 of the petition for certiorari, appendix 24."
1976.75-1267,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1094.714,1096.965,Thank you.
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1096.965,1100.227,Under Section B guaranteed a broiler grower.
1976.75-1267,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1143.367,1147.691,Does the bonus depend in anyway on the price obtained?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1147.691,1152.183,"No, absolutely not, the bonus depends upon how these people did…"
1976.75-1267,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1152.183,1153.936,Cost wise…
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1153.936,1155.6,"No, no, not cost wise in terms of weight."
1976.75-1267,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1155.6,1165.574,"In terms of quality and/or weight, weight reflects quality and the non bonus payment does not depend in anyway on what was obtained in the market for the bird?"
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1165.574,1169.223,"No, not at all, it depends on how bigger poultry house they have."
1976.75-1267,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1169.223,1172.624,What if the chickens that die who takes the risk of that.
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1172.624,1176.353,"The chickens die, the risk of loss is on the company because the company owns the chicken."
1976.75-1267,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1176.353,1181.75,"Owns the chicken, but was if they die as a result of the negligence of the farmer?"
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1181.75,1184.086,"Well, you just do not use him next time."
1976.75-1267,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1184.086,1187.939,You just get another contractor next time.
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1187.939,1202.971,"Now, however talking about this contract that I have before you, I like to point out to you that the integrator provides the chicks, the feed, the medication, the fuel and the litter."
1976.75-1267,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1278.437,1280.312,Thank you.
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1280.312,1283.144,Of the same contract.
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.406,1411.578,Would there be any question about the exemption if there was full integration in the sense that the company didn’t make arrangements with growers but did it itself?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1411.578,1416.239,"Well, I don’t think – see, if you are talking to a person who doesn’t think there is any question…."
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1416.239,1419.145,"I know, I know, I understand that."
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1419.145,1419.79,"Well, if the flock…."
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1419.79,1434.399,"Well let me ask you the question in another way, maybe you would not have time to answer before lunch but, what’s the -- perhaps you could explain that I have missed it -- why does a company arrange its affairs this way?"
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1442.249,1442.797,I suppose….
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1442.797,1444.39,And this was not an accident.
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1444.39,1445.92,"Well, I suppose this whole thing…."
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1445.92,1448.221,"The way of doing business has evolved for a reason, that’s what I mean."
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1448.221,1454.353,"Well, I suppose the whole thing has evolved because the fact instead of dealing from one…."
1976.75-1267,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1454.353,1457.413,You can respond to that at 1 o’clock.
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1457.413,1468.751,Thank you.
1976.75-1267,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1468.751,1471.066,You have about six minutes remaining.
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1471.066,1471.41,Thank you.
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.511,1481.917,What is the business reason for it?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1481.917,1489.455,"Well, this book that supplied you Dynamic Factors and Vertically Commodity Systems on page…."
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1489.455,1490.657,That would be very informative….
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1490.657,1507.77,"No, on Page 40 there is this sentence, “The change forces and responding decisions which have brought the broiler system to its present position represent a fascinating example of an evolvement, of an evolving, energetic, free enterprise system."
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1517.74,1526.477,"I agree with you that, let us just say what is this, but why do you suppose, at least they still would have a choice of doing it themselves or doing it this way?"
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1526.477,1528.468,The problem of this business is the risk.
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1531.919,1537.395,"So, if the risk is part of it, does risk shifting matter to the grower?"
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1537.395,1546.396,The risk is on both of the....The risk is -- the poor farmer who tries to buy the grain and raise chicks has taken a terrible risk.
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1549.486,1556.529,"But, it also I suppose for all sorts of -- for no purpose are these farmers employees of your client."
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1556.529,1557.116,Well….
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.116,1558.934,Are they?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1558.934,1560.89,I don’t think they are employees.
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.89,1565.925,"Yes, then for any other purposes for which it might be important."
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1566.886,1570.368,They don’t pay social security or things like that.
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1571.464,1572.921,And they don’t withhold or….
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1572.921,1576.115,"No, they not, but what I do say is the…."
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1576.115,1578.678,How about Court liability?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1578.678,1579.174,What is that?
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1579.174,1581.252,How about Court liability?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1581.252,1582.394,Court liability.
1976.75-1267,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1582.394,1587.769,Is your client liable for any torts that might be committed by these farmers?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1587.769,1595.271,I think in the contract it says something about the fact that they will be liable if anybody gets hurt in their own farms.
1976.75-1267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1714.854,1724.621,"But I (Inaudible) When you go into processing plants you lose three things, your head, your insides and your feathers."
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1724.621,1726.799,That’s true.
1976.75-1267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1726.799,1728.389,We know that don’t we?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1728.389,1730.097,What I am saying to you is….
1976.75-1267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1730.097,1732.19,And he stopped growing didn’t they?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1732.19,1733.59,That’s true.
1976.75-1267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1733.908,1736.531,once you get to the processing plant that is it.
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1736.531,1749.938,"What I am saying is that, for the purposes of this type of classification, they regard them as not as a cooked chicken or as a string bean that is cooked in a dish or something or in a can or something like that."
1976.75-1267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1767.449,1772.43,But these independent contractors are the ones who grow the chicken.
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1772.43,1775.346,"Well, you must understand when you say…."
1976.75-1267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1775.346,1776.479,Is that right?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1776.479,1778.292,"No, no that isn’t right."
1976.75-1267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1778.292,1782.063,What does your client do to grow on?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1782.063,1785.245,"Well, it is a great many things."
1976.75-1267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1806.097,1810.433,But does growing occur on the independent contractors’ farms.
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1810.433,1812.381,The only thing that happens on the independent contractors’ farms...
1976.75-1267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1812.381,1814.112,Is the chicken grows.
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1814.112,1820.752,"The only thing that happens is that from nine days old, he goes from one day old to nine weeks old."
1976.75-1267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1842.382,1844.185,He does not clean up the pan?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1844.185,1846.985,"No, under the contract Bayside..."
1976.75-1267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1846.985,1848.312,How do they get clean?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1848.312,1849.32,What?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1855.187,1856.949,"No, when you take them out."
1976.75-1267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1856.949,1858.939,I am talking about during the nine week period.
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1858.939,1860.83,"Oh, during the nine week period look, I ascertain..."
1976.75-1267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1860.83,1862.203,During the growing period.
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1862.203,1863.034,The Strain case…
1976.75-1267,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1863.034,1866.009,"I like the word grow, would you doubt?"
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1866.009,1867.644,I am not addressed to any word here.
1976.75-1267,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1881.218,1882.727,You wanted to save anything for rebuttal?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1886.616,1888.066,"I would like,could I…"
1976.75-1267,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1888.066,1888.893,Would you like to say?
1976.75-1267,0,16459,alan_j_levenson,,1892.11,1899.789,Thank you.
1976.75-1267,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1899.789,1902.781,Mrs. Shapiro.
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1902.781,1905.943,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-1267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.501,1952.879,"Now, the chicken farmer said he has owned the truck and send the truck over to a feedmill owned by somebody else and whole feed back."
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1957.47,1961.149,"Yes, it probably would."
1976.75-1267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2033.684,2038.271,I do not -- if those are getting drifted into bayside of the farm to raise the chickens themselves.
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2038.271,2052.159,"No, as a matter of fact, Bayside does own certain – they do own the hatcheries and the breeder farms and the people that are working on those farms are within the primary exemption but..."
1976.75-1267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.159,2056.851,The truck drivers running back and forth between the various plans and those particular farms.
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2056.851,2070.239,"No, then in that situation you would have to decide whether the truck drivers were incidental to the feedmill operation or to the farm operation."
1976.75-1267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.239,2076.203,I thought you had already said that here’s a farmer that owns the trucks that goes to the feedmill.
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2076.203,2085.643,"Yeah, but your hypothetical I thought was that if the feedmill truck was that he owned the truck."
1976.75-1267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2085.643,2097.538,"You mean it might, if a farmer sends his truck to an independent feedmill his truck drivers are exempted, but if he had zoned the feedmill do they earn?"
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2097.538,2101.287,You have to get back to the statute.
1976.75-1267,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2101.287,2117.754,"Well, Mrs. Shapiro, let me add a question along with just so, what is it in the statute that requires, that permits even the compartmentalization that you insist on, that you have to say in its capacity as a feedmill operator and the capacity as a breeder farmer and that sort of thing?"
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2117.754,2126.37,I think it's a necessary implication in the statute because the statute sets up these various categories.
1976.75-1267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2158.602,2163.4,your analysis has the ring of the set of regulations.
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2170.51,2190.447,"Yeah, this is -- what we are talking about is an exemption that is brought into the National Labor Relations Act by the Appropriations Acts which say that this definition in the Fair Labor Standards Act is to be used in the National Labor Relations Act."
1976.75-1267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2190.447,2198.798,"But Mrs. Shapiro definitely the wording of 3(f) of the 1938 Act, Fair Labor Standards Act has not changed has it?"
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2200.369,2201.177,Yes.
1976.75-1267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2201.177,2207.945,But the Appropriations Acts reincorporated in the National Labor Relations Act almost annually do not they?
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2207.945,2210.439,Yes.
1976.75-1267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2210.439,2215.956,Do the regulations taken to account at all of these differences in methods of farming?
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2215.956,2223.006,"well, there is a Fair Labor Standards Act that the regulations that I am referring to are under the Fair Labor Standards Act."
1976.75-1267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2223.006,2224.186,"Yeah, I appreciate that."
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2231.67,2233.841,That is certainly the way you use --
1976.75-1267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2233.841,2235.715,The handling has been --
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2235.715,2239.172,The National Labor Relations Board interpreted...
1976.75-1267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2239.172,2245.996,And have the regulations been revised that much?
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2245.996,2247.342,I guess they have been.
1976.75-1267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2254.574,2258.336,Do the regulation defends themselves to this form of farming operations directly?
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2258.336,2261.516,"Yes, they certainly do."
1976.75-1267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2275.749,2277.063,The board follows that interpretation?
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2277.063,2283.893,Board certainly follows that interpretation.
1976.75-1267,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2351.641,2355.146,an enterprise that does run that limited farming operation itself.
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2358.691,2361.219,"Certainly do, yes."
1976.75-1267,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2374.804,2379.716,Does the feedmill sell to anybody except Bayside people?
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2379.716,2380.297,"Yes, it does."
1976.75-1267,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2380.297,2382.684,It did so as commercial and the people have no connection with it?
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2382.684,2391.752,It sells to a group of farmers who are connected with another integrated poultry companies that doesn’t have its own processing plant.
1976.75-1267,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2391.752,2393.197,Then it is independent of Bayside?
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2393.197,2394.195,Independent of Bayside.
1976.75-1267,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2394.195,2396.184,Even today?
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2396.184,2406.369,I believe that that was at the time of the Board decision; I think that Bayside’s brief says that they no longer do.
1976.75-1267,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2406.369,2410.21,It seems to me I recall something on the papers to the effect that that has been done away with.
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2410.21,2414.662,"Yeah, I think that’s correct."
1976.75-1267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2414.662,2424.999,"Mrs. Shapiro, if your opponent is right on what is a farm and if you are right on the point that the drivers are incidental to the feed mill operation…"
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2424.999,2425.577,Right.
1976.75-1267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2425.577,2428.537,What employees would we be fighting about?
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2428.537,2438.938,"Well, you would still have to decide in that case whether the feedmill operation is incidental to Bayside’s farm operation."
1976.75-1267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2441.111,2450.456,"Oh, I see, because if you could, what if the feedmill operation is incidental to a farm, would it then follow the drivers who are engaged in working in incidental department?"
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2450.456,2475.096,"If you felt that Bayside was a farmer, that the second part of the definition which is what we really are arguing about here, it says to get in to that exemption, you have to be both – the activity has to be by a farmer and also, it has to be incidental to that farmer’s farm operations."
1976.75-1267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2475.096,2492.527,"I am asking the question just a little differently, if we concluded that the feedmill was an industrial operation and not incidental farming, but if the growing was farming by Bayside, would there be any employees that would be fighting about than these drivers?"
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2496.905,2502.209,"Well, this particular fight is over these drivers."
1976.75-1267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2526.028,2526.809,I see.
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2526.809,2529.563,You do have to decide if you accept their argument.
1976.75-1267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2536.793,2547.851,"Mrs. Shapiro the regulation which you referred at Page 18 of your brief 78126, does that description that goes back to 1961 I gather doesn’t it?"
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2558.553,2562.193,"That’s a – yes, I think it does."
1976.75-1267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2588.911,2601.749,"Well, my next question is that the -- this of course is a wage in our division, interpretive bulletin, has it been followed and adopted by the National Labor Relations Board in any cases?"
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2601.749,2604.635,"Well, yes, in the National Labor Relation Board…"
1976.75-1267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2604.635,2608.542,"In addition to this one, I mean?"
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2608.542,2613.693,This case is the result of a fairly long-term of…
1976.75-1267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2613.693,2623.15,"Well, really what I am trying to get at is, remember we didn’t get these briefings so just the other day so, I haven’t had a chance to study this so, as I would like."
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2646.396,2646.948,That’s...
1976.75-1267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2646.948,2652.648,"So, my question is has the board applied this regulation in any other case?"
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2652.648,2654.168,They have done so consistently.
1976.75-1267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2654.168,2655.32,And are they cited in your brief?
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2655.32,2666.092,"Yes, I have put it on 11."
1976.75-1267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2712.806,2715.046,And it avoids having to treat them as employees?
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2715.046,2717.851,And that’s the point I want to emphasize here…
1976.75-1267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.851,2731.087,"And then, let me ask you, I go back to – suppose a farmer is growing chickens and he is sending his own truck out to get feed to bring it back."
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2762.387,2775.259,"The answer to that in the case, the Farmers Irrigation Company case the interpret of this same language."
1976.75-1267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2816.824,2828.811,"Let’s suppose that you are a chicken grower and you hire 30 people to unload the feed trucks and actually go out and feed the chickens, is that part of farming?"
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2828.811,2829.669,"Yes, that’s..."
1976.75-1267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2829.669,2850.422,"Alright, now suppose the farmer who instead of hiring his own employees to feed the chickens for him, contracts with the chicken feeder and they send their employees in and they feed the – do exactly the same thing as his employees used to do, that’s also a part of farming actually."
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2850.422,2857.567,"Well, that is in the third part of the exemption which…"
1976.75-1267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.567,2862.352,"Oh no, I am just suggesting, why isn’t that part of farming?"
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2866.388,2878.153,"When the statute was enacted, the argument was made that, threshers who in the same -- at one point farmers did their own threshing."
1976.75-1267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2878.153,2880.782,"If you take farming apart, nothing is farming."
1976.75-1267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2883.882,2895.973,"40 years ago Mrs. Shapiro or 60 perhaps, were all these things done by what they called the hired hands and used the team horses and a wagon instead of modern truck and maybe a uniform?"
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2906.324,2926.029,"Well, as long as the operation is the basic part of farming, the growing of the chickens, the raising of the crops, then it doesn’t make any difference what the scale of the operation is or…"
1976.75-1267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2926.029,2928.586,"Yes, the court said that in several cases…"
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2928.586,2951.308,"Yes, but when the statute was enacted, the Congress was concerned that the basic definition of agriculture would not include people who were not farmers and were not working for farmers, but were doing essential farm operations."
1976.75-1267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2951.308,2970.264,"A big commercial farm might have and validly does have today a lot of this very sophisticated equipment to the point where they might have their own machine shop to repair them whereas again, 50 years ago the man who would ram the steam rig also repaired it off season."
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2978.437,2986.275,They are working for a farmer on operations that are incidental to his farm operations.
1976.75-1267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2995.166,3000.654,How do you distinguish them from the gentleman that Justice White was describing?
1976.75-1267,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3000.654,3030.044,"The man who is not working for the farmer but is sent into the farm, working for someone else while is not working for the farmer and as I said, the third exemption covers people who are not working for the farmer but are working on the farm, so the Mr. Justice White’s man who is working for an independent company, but working on the farm is within the third exemption."
1976.75-1267,2,16459,alan_j_levenson,,3895.302,3896.323,Thank you Your Honor.
1976.75-1267,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4194.781,4197.525,"Thank you counsel, the case is submitted."
