2012.11-9540,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.587,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 11-9540, Descamps v. United States."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,9.539,15.01,"May it -- Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2012.11-9540,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,73.945,93.423,"You don't take issue, do you, with the argument that in determining what the State law is you can take account not only of the words of the statute, but how the State Supreme Court interprets those words?"
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,93.423,95.775,"I don't take issue with that, Your Honor."
2012.11-9540,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,104.88,113.836,"Well, the California Supreme Court has said that an element of the burglary statute is the violation of some possessory interest."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,151.528,152.095,Okay.
2012.11-9540,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,152.095,153.411,Those are exactly equivalent.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,163.919,170.673,"Well, I don't believe it would, because I don't believe possessory interest equates to Taylor definition."
2012.11-9540,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,170.673,179.596,"No, but they -- they set out alternative elements, either breaking into the structure or the violation of the possessory interest in some other way."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,179.596,189.986,"Well, if -- if the elements are shown, and if that's the definition, then yes."
2012.11-9540,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,193.355,210.484,"But they have said -- do you dispute the fact that saying A, an element is the violation of the possessory interest, and B, the elements are breaking or the violation of the possessory interest in same other way, are exactly the same substantively?"
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,210.484,225.326,"I don't, Your Honor, because in the Taylor sense you have to have an unlawful trespass, actually a trespass, or an invasion of a person's -- well, unlawful trespass."
2012.11-9540,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,239.384,264.285,"I thought your argument was that if the terms of the statute set out alternative ways of satisfying an element, you have alternative elements in essence, that then, even if some of those alternatives don't fall within generic burglary, if one does, then a conviction under that statute potentially can qualify."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,264.285,264.752,"Well, I--"
2012.11-9540,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,264.752,265.235,Isn't that--
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,265.235,266.903,--I have no argument with that.
2012.11-9540,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,266.903,267.42,--Okay.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,267.42,269.203,"That's the modified categorical approach, I believe."
2012.11-9540,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,269.203,269.522,Okay.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,280.144,291.686,"Well, I -- as I said, if the element is set forth and it's an element that meets the definition of the generic definition in Taylor, then I agree with you."
2012.11-9540,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,300.292,301.242,"Well, I'll ask the question one more time."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,329.727,335.465,"Well, there may not be a substantive difference, but in California breaking is not required at any time."
2012.11-9540,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,336.865,341.285,"Mr. Johnson, can I try what Justice Alito is getting at maybe in a slightly a different way."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,381.946,403.375,"Well, because in that case, the jury -- if a statute is made where the question is, is a weapon involved, and you can commit that with an ax, a gun, or a knife, but the element is weapon, the jury is only required to find weapon."
2012.11-9540,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,420.821,436.58,"But I thought our cases held that when you have a conviction for a weapons violation, you can look to the Shepard materials to decide whether, in fact, the weapon violation was a gun, a knife or an ax, can't you?"
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,437.413,442.417,"If the State's statute sets off those as an alternative element, I would agree with that."
2012.11-9540,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,450.256,463.314,"Or if -- you acknowledge if the State supreme court says “ weapon ” could mean a gun, a knife or a hatchet, that would -- that would suffice, right?"
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,468.802,476.323,"Well, I -- if it's spelled out as an element, I think you can, but if it's not an element--"
2012.11-9540,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.323,480.959,"It's not spelled out as an element, but the State supreme court says, our statute says weapon."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,494.952,501.206,"--Again, I think it would go back to the element of -- of weapon--"
2012.11-9540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,501.206,502.689,The problem is there's no way.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,548.504,549.137,--I think you do.
2012.11-9540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,549.137,549.637,Fine.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,609.41,612.546,"Well, it's not my burden to do that."
2012.11-9540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,620.266,621.052,Why.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,621.052,626.02,Because in California a shoplifter is not -- but I would think--
2012.11-9540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,626.02,626.32,"No, no, no."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,662.879,666.681,"--Well, there's -- there's other ways other than just shoplifting."
2012.11-9540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,671.151,672.418,"Yes, you could."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,685.225,696.766,"Doesn't it come back to the test that this Court thought Congress meant when you made the ruling in Taylor that we're not going to look to the manner and means of commission, we're going to look at the elements--"
2012.11-9540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,696.766,697.233,"--No, no, no."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,730.606,741.562,"--Well, if the Taylor definition -- after the Court worked that through, I think the Taylor went with the categorical elements approach."
2012.11-9540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,745.783,746.366,"No, no."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,764.61,770.231,But then why do we have the “ is burglary ” language and the other sentences?
2012.11-9540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,771.933,788.276,"“ Is burglary or otherwise ”, “ or otherwise ”, “ burglary or otherwise ”, and the reason we have “ or otherwise ” is because Congress does know that the number of State statutes that are sort of like something but not completely like something is in the thousands."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,792.18,819.347,"I think in this case one of the -- one of the considerations that drives our argument is that if you get into that factfinding mode of manner and means in order to establish an element that is not in the state statute, which is in the case we're looking at here, I think you got an Apprendi problem, and I think under the Sixth Amendment my client should have had a right to a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
2012.11-9540,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,830.888,840.909,Suppose the Court were to say: We now hold that the modified categorical approach applies to this statute and to these facts.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,858.705,865.275,"Well, I think the breaking under the California statute is a manner and means of committing the crime."
2012.11-9540,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,869.513,871.479,But if he necessarily--
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,871.479,871.796,--do that.
2012.11-9540,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,871.796,885.855,"--the defendant necessarily was convicted of an offense that had the elements of a generic crime, if he necessarily was convicted of that, would that suffice?"
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,893.228,896.346,That's kind of a two-part question.
2012.11-9540,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,896.346,897.53,It is a two-part question.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,899.365,910.138,"Well, the first question is, because the breaking is not part of California requirement, a jury's never required to find that as an element."
2012.11-9540,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,916.375,937.055,"But if under the modified categorical approach we insist that in the particular case before us the generic components of the crime must necessarily have been found by the jury, and if we say that that's the rule, that's inconsistent with your view of what the law ought to be?"
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,937.055,955.552,"I think -- I think it would be, because I think unless -- unless there are alternatives in the statute, some of which constitute the generic crime and some of which don't, I don't think you can use a modified categorical approach."
2012.11-9540,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.552,967.926,"I think what you're saying is, it -- it could necessarily have been found by the jury, but he would nevertheless not have been convicted of that particular crime."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,967.926,969.292,That's obviously a more--
2012.11-9540,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.292,979.234,The jury in finding him guilty of the generic offense could only have found that this mode of committing the offense was what he used.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,988.006,988.44,--Exactly true.
2012.11-9540,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1012.621,1018.692,But under the modified categorical approach the whole point is that we do look to the plea colloquy.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1018.692,1021.561,You look to the plea colloquy--
2012.11-9540,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1021.561,1025.715,"Of course, which is why you say you don't think the modified categorical approach should apply."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1032.702,1039.855,"--Even if you say it does, it still doesn't -- it's not an element of the crime."
2012.11-9540,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1039.855,1041.14,Could you simplify that?
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1071.994,1073.196,Yes.
2012.11-9540,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1077.998,1080.599,But the unlawfulness is not necessary.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1080.599,1082.134,It's not necessary and that's the point--
2012.11-9540,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1082.134,1091.407,"No matter what he said, he wasn't convicted of a generic crime because all he was convicted of under California law was entering and--"
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1091.407,1092.623,--Exactly.
2012.11-9540,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1092.623,1093.207,--with intent.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1094.192,1097.644,And the manner and means of -- of committing it isn't the point.
2012.11-9540,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1107.517,1111.552,But your argument comes back to how the elements are defined.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1147.139,1154.609,"Well, it may -- it may come down to what the Court thinks California means by invasion of a possessory interest."
2012.11-9540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1161.715,1163.698,Because it's like the old joke.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1212.981,1214.214,That's correct.
2012.11-9540,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1215.433,1220.052,"Well, if that's your argument, then you're really asking for us to modify our prior cases."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1242.167,1254.308,"If the predicate element is included in the -- in the statute or the decision, I agree with that."
2012.11-9540,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1256.26,1258.177,So your answer to Justice Breyer was not yes; it was no.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1258.177,1262.247,--Maybe I misunderstood the question.
2012.11-9540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1264.147,1266.366,You didn't.
2012.11-9540,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1266.366,1267.735,Let's -- let's get back to this case.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1284.327,1293.683,"--The conviction is just for entry, and for the entry with intent, which again isn't how this Court defined burglary in Taylor."
2012.11-9540,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1294.949,1305.824,And so your principal argument isn't that -- is that what we've said in the modified categorical cases is that you look to these Shepard documents to help you define the elements of the offense.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1325.135,1325.904,--Yes.
2012.11-9540,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1333.489,1342.595,"Yes, I think -- here's, I guess, the rub, which is -- you know, I take the point that what the Ninth Circuit has said does not seem very categorical."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1373.899,1376.934,There's an -- there's an easy way to fix that.
2012.11-9540,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1406.12,1408.239,"But it's not California's problem, right?"
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1410.922,1413.374,--I agree.
2012.11-9540,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1482.203,1502.431,"There's probably an obvious answer to this, but the Taylor definition of generic burglary is unlawful entry into or remaining in a building with intent to commit a crime."
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1518.226,1528.148,"Well, California burglary is -- I believe, in my reading of the case law, it's -- the intent is formed as you enter the premises."
2012.11-9540,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1536.504,1541.242,That -- that intent would continue while the person remains in the building.
2012.11-9540,0,21044,dan_b_johnson,,1541.242,1551.847,"Well, except the -- again, is it the intent in the generic sense, or is it the intent in the California sense?"
2012.11-9540,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1577.665,1578.615,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1590.639,1593.424,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-9540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1637.203,1645.142,But you're not -- but you're not looking at the factual basis for the purpose of deciding the manner in which the defendant committed the crime.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1739.104,1740.187,I think that--
2012.11-9540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1740.187,1749.043,"--of Federal burglary as defined by Justice Blackmun and the Court in this case, end of matter, QED."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1749.043,1756.547,--I -- I do think you've accurately described what Petitioner -- the dividing line the Petitioner would advocate is.
2012.11-9540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1797.024,1797.79,That's exactly right.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1800.559,1801.192,Yes.
2012.11-9540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1801.192,1829.495,"And of course Congress knew that there are hundreds or thousands of State statutes with several different words and they -- you know, different ways of getting at the same thing, and therefore they wrote the next phrase of their Federal statute, which is it's burglary, arson, explosives or otherwise, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1844.937,1849.658,"Well, I -- the parties have not briefed here and I wouldn't want to speculate on what the Court would--"
2012.11-9540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1849.658,1850.008,I know and that was my question.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1850.624,1860.947,"--Well, this case has been argued as -- because this is a conviction under California burglary, it's been argued under the -- the premise that it should be classified as generic burglary."
2012.11-9540,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1861.466,1879.011,Maybe -- maybe they haven't argued it because there's some serious constitutional doubt about whether the statute which makes it a crime to engage in conduct which creates a serious risk of physical injury is constitutional.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1890.901,1897.639,"--That -- that's -- I understand Your Honor's view on that, on that subject."
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1897.639,1898.522,Mr. Horwich--
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1898.522,1899.072,If I can try to--
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1899.072,1901.274,--I'm going to ask you about an argument you did make.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1901.274,1901.607,--Yes.
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1901.607,1917.803,"As I understand your argument, your argument is not the Ninth Circuit's argument, because you very carefully distinguish what are what you call missing elements cases from this case."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1917.803,1918.319,Yes.
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1918.319,1928.591,"So do you reject the Ninth Circuit's view that the categorical approach should apply even where there is a missing element, as you -- as you call it?"
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1928.591,1933.395,"Well, I want to be very careful that we're talking about the same thing, when we say “ missing element ”."
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2017.232,2018.816,Let me give you a -- let me give you a different kind of example.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2050.204,2058.107,"Well, we would need to know -- I guess I would need to know in your hypothetical what -- what we're trying to classify that conviction as, because--"
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2058.107,2062.278,The conviction is interference with a law enforcement investigation.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2073.669,2074.836,--Well--
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2074.836,2075.503,And it's overbroad.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2079.473,2080.39,"--Well, I'm sorry."
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2093.215,2093.548,Sure.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2093.548,2096.316,"--Well, that might raise a -- I think that raises a different set of questions."
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2103.172,2105.372,"Well, why would there be any difference between those two?"
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2111.242,2131.59,"Well, I think because the way this Court's clause jurisprudence has evolved, it requires the Court to make some assessment of the degree of risk of some set of conduct that's not too much more serious than what the defendant engaged in, but not too much less serious and so I don't know what that reference point is."
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2161.309,2161.609,Okay.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2185.326,2200.586,"--If the State statute provided that all entries qualified, which is what I understand your hypothetical to be, then I think that probably amounts to a missing elements situation, because -- and I'm taking the Court's test from Shepard here."
2012.11-9540,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2221.249,2231.605,"But that's my problem, which is you say that, but how to define a missing element from an alternative element is -- overbroad element, doesn't make any sense to me."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2258.588,2261.706,"Well, I don't think -- no, I don't think we're trying to add that."
2012.11-9540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.902,2306.269,True.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2322.531,2323.014,Yes.
2012.11-9540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2323.014,2323.447,Yes.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2399.197,2399.981,We certainly agree that--
2012.11-9540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2399.981,2402.316,So that's where the problem is.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2402.316,2410.422,--We absolutely agree that -- that the shoplifting basis for California burglary does not correspond to generic burglary.
2012.11-9540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2415.957,2416.243,Ah.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2419.96,2434.287,"--Well, I don't think we're back to -- I don't think we're back to -- I don't think we're back to any real problem here, because the Court should not be seeking a rule here that turns on some idiosyncrasy of how State law is phrased or announced."
2012.11-9540,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2435.203,2442.124,So how do you take that position and advocate the answer you're giving here?
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2457.467,2460.751,"--Well, we're not asking the Court to draw any distinctions among those."
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2484.201,2485.684,But this reading creates its own idiosyncrasies.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2501.678,2502.595,"--Yes, it is a different result."
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2533.798,2543.922,"I think it's -- I think it's a deeper problem than that, because the defendant is standing there and he doesn't care at all whether the prosecutor says unlawfully entered or broke and entered."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2549.724,2550.109,--But--
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2550.109,2558.496,"--the difference between an enhanced sentence and not an enhanced sentence that is not likely to be thought about, let alone adjudicated."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2558.496,2573.775,"--Well, by the same token, the defendant would not care a whit whether it really was a grocery store or it was a car, because those two would also cause him to be convicted of the same, of the same burglary offense under California."
2012.11-9540,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2577.36,2592.569,"The point would expand -- this would expand the problem that you've identified, that the Shepard approach, the existence of the documents, how carefully they've been developed, it would expand that fortuity to a far greater number of cases."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2592.569,2598.473,--I guess I am not prepared to make a confident prediction about the relative number of cases.
2012.11-9540,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2626.324,2645.054,"The -- I'm not sure that it achieves greater sentencing equity when you have two defendants who have done exactly the same thing in California, and because of the fortuity of what the plea colloquy looked like in one case as opposed to another, when it really didn't matter one way or another in that situation, one person qualifies under ACCA and the other doesn't."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2645.054,2646.438,--That -- that--
2012.11-9540,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2646.438,2650.192,And presumably I agree that you don't have -- you don't have empirical evidence.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2659.214,2661.548,"--Well, in part I'm not -- well, in part I'm not even sure of that."
2012.11-9540,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2707.878,2708.911,It seems strange to me at all.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2718.169,2718.802,"--Well, the question--"
2012.11-9540,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2718.802,2724.24,He's only been convicted of having that with someone under 18.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2724.24,2728.275,"--Well, let's imagine for the moment that his case had been tried to a jury."
2012.11-9540,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2752.64,2755.525,Not everything the jury finds constitutes a conviction.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2761.163,2761.679,"Well, the text--"
2012.11-9540,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2761.679,2770.602,"If being -- being under 16 is not -- or 14, whatever it is, is not an element of the charged offense, I don't care what the jury finds."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2770.602,2777.125,"--Well, with respect, Your Honor, the text of the statute in this part of it does not refer to elements."
2012.11-9540,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2799.971,2807.56,But breaking and entering -- in your brief as I understand it you are not relying on the prosecutor's charge that there was breaking and entering.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2857.16,2869.717,"Well, the -- the defendant's statement -- well, in the context of this plea, it is true that the words didn't come out of the defendant's mouth."
2012.11-9540,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2889.029,2891.147,Why should it be different than in the Rule 11 colloquy?
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2910.294,2920.066,"--Because we can treat -- because we can treat the proceeding in this colloquy as the defendant adopting that factual basis offered by the prosecutor, accepted by the court."
2012.11-9540,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2920.066,2922.685,Qui tacet consentire videtur.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2924.302,2927.22,Because your Latin is better than mine.
2012.11-9540,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.986,2935.307,He who remains silent appears to consent.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2935.307,2935.707,--Yes.
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2954.37,2961.774,"I guess it depends on whether the basis has any relevance to the punishment he's going to receive, which in this case it doesn't, but put that aside."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2976.551,2978.586,"--Well, at least if it was different, yes."
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2978.586,2985.473,"Yes, if there were -- if there were no unlawful entry that counted under California law--"
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2985.473,2985.907,Yes.
2012.11-9540,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2985.907,3007.255,"--but, you know, the fact that there is a strange Gauze case which says that you can't burglarize your own home -- right -- the fact that the Court happens to come across that case and happens to decide -- it seems completely irrelevant as to this matter whether or not the California court once decided that you can't burglarize your own home."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3009.522,3011.224,Here's -- here's the relevance of it.
2012.11-9540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3092.611,3108.371,"Let me quickly ask you this then, you say look at Gauze for this reason, it makes clear that in these words of the California statute, there must be an interference with possessory interest."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3125.915,3126.599,--Yes.
2012.11-9540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3126.599,3129.451,The one possible difference is shoplifting.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3129.451,3129.851,Exactly.
2012.11-9540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3129.851,3133.653,"And as to shoplifting, here is what I would like to say."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3174.58,3175.765,"Well, I can't--"
2012.11-9540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3175.765,3199.047,"You see why I turn back to the empirical question and keep wondering, why is it not possible to get, say, a law professor; they have spare time -- get the sentencing committee, get someone to look and see what are the real behaviors that are convicted under section 459."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3199.047,3199.43,--I can--
2012.11-9540,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3199.43,3208.486,"And then advise defendants who -- who anticipate committing these crimes, so that they will know which crimes carry another 30 years."
2012.11-9540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3210.253,3210.605,Well--
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3210.605,3219.711,"--Well -- Justice Breyer, I don't think I can give you a statistical survey."
2012.11-9540,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3241.29,3241.874,Is that--
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3241.874,3243.992,--but that's anecdotal.
2012.11-9540,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3243.992,3246.008,--to charge it as what?
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3247.444,3253.348,"To charge it as larceny, because very often, it will be the completed shoplifting is very hard to prove they had the intent when they went into the store."
2012.11-9540,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3253.348,3258.233,But it -- but it does come under this section 459.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3258.233,3263.12,"It does, but it -- in exactly the same way that automobile burglaries come under this statute."
2012.11-9540,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3317.488,3333.05,"Could you tell me what the difference is between entering the garage with permission and taking a wrench and walking out, and entering a store with permission and taking an article of clothing."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3334.183,3351.094,"--If in your hypothetical the garage is a -- is not your own garage and you don't have the consent of the garage's owner to -- who knows that you're going to take the wrench, no, they are the same."
2012.11-9540,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3351.944,3352.311,They are the same thing.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3361.867,3366.271,"Shoplifting could be charged, and someone could plead guilty to shoplifting, and that wouldn't count."
2012.11-9540,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3367.504,3374.127,"I think your adversary can speak for himself, and his brief did point to some convictions for shoplifting under the statute."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3374.127,3375.177,"--Yes, we agree."
2012.11-9540,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3375.177,3375.51,There are some.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3375.51,3376.693,Absolutely.
2012.11-9540,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3394.54,3410.3,"What seems to me perhaps clearest about this case and others is that this modified categorical approach has turned out to be extremely complicated, and occasionally produces results that seem to make no sense whatsoever."
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3419.739,3422.024,"If I may, briefly."
2012.11-9540,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3422.024,3422.658,You can.
2012.11-9540,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3422.658,3442.271,"My sense -- my sense is that this problem is largely the product of lower courts trying to draw very fine formalized angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin distinctions about the statutes, rather than simply focusing on the conduct that was necessarily admitted."
2012.11-9540,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3446.489,3447.439,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-9540,2,21044,dan_b_johnson,,3450.71,3452.51,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-9540,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3504.112,3520.204,"Mr. Johnson, the last answer by Mr. Horwich to the last question was, it would be simpler if we hadn't done the modified categorical approach; but the reality is we have a statute."
2012.11-9540,2,21044,dan_b_johnson,,3542.72,3554.877,"I agree with that, and I think that -- I -- I don't think anything has changed in -- since -- in the last 22 years for the Court to step away from Taylor."
2012.11-9540,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3560.948,3565.233,"Well, does the offense of burglary have the element of using force or threatening to use of force?"
2012.11-9540,2,21044,dan_b_johnson,,3565.233,3568.602,I don't believe it does.
2012.11-9540,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3572.154,3575.272,So the element doesn't -- the element language doesn't apply to burglary.
2012.11-9540,2,21044,dan_b_johnson,,3575.272,3578.374,--I think it does.
2012.11-9540,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3578.374,3585.247,"Well, you don't have to prove -- I mean, burglary is specifically named."
2012.11-9540,2,21044,dan_b_johnson,,3587.364,3588.432,Clause.
2012.11-9540,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3588.432,3589.732,--It's not the residual.
2012.11-9540,2,21044,dan_b_johnson,,3600.423,3613.297,"Well, again, I think if we get into the residual, it's going to require the evaluations the Court have done on that."
2012.11-9540,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3615.166,3623.272,Do you think only -- only those burglaries that -- that threaten force are covered by the statute?
2012.11-9540,2,21044,dan_b_johnson,,3628.241,3630.626,--I agree with that.
2012.11-9540,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3635.862,3637.479,"Thank you, counsel."
