1961.52,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,12.256,"Number 52, United States, Petitioner, versus Union Central Life Insurance Company."
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,18.565,23.913,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.52,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,894.356,897.54,Do the committee reports refer to that Maniaci case?
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,897.54,899.606,"Not by name, Your Honor."
1961.52,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,992.602,999.984,Was that decision alone among the federal courts or were there other cases (Inaudible) --
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,999.984,1003.538,I don't think there are any other Court of Appeals cases.
1961.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1292.719,1306.367,May I ask you if -- if I can get my mind -- what in your judgment is the federal law required to the kind of notice that is to be given and filed in recording?
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1306.367,1315.533,"Well, I think it requires the name of the lienor and this is the form that has been used for many years."
1961.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1334.574,1343.993,"It's the difference between you and the state that they insist that under that statute, you must describe the property on which the lien --"
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1343.993,1344.547,Real property.
1961.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1344.547,1345.577,-- is claimed?
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1345.577,1346.07,Yes.
1961.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1346.07,1346.863,Real property?
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1346.863,1348.475,Real property.
1961.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1350.301,1361.234,And your argument is that it's not necessary to describe the real property that you -- it's enough for the Government simply to assert that we have a lien on everything this man has.
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1361.234,1389.756,"In fact, our argument goes a little further if Your Honor pleases, we say that to insist as a condition that real property be described would impair the efficacy of the lien as created by Congress, because it would require -- the effect would be that the lien would not apply on after acquired property of the tax payer."
1961.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1389.756,1396.541,Where is the -- why have you quoted the precise language of the lien which Congress says has created?
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1396.541,1406.748,"Well, the Congress just says the notice of lien, but the form of the lien as it has been filed for many years --"
1961.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1406.748,1412.658,"I'm talking about now, you said Congress says there should be a lien, on what?"
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1412.658,1413.75,On all -- yes?
1961.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1413.75,1416.156,You -- cite that -- spoke that statute?
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1416.156,1426.649,"If Your Honor pleases, it's on page 22 of our brief in Appendix A."
1961.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1450.254,1463.089,"That has to be considered, I suppose, as controlled by the other section which authorizes or require whichever you wished to say, a filing of the lien under state law --"
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1463.089,1463.176,Yes.
1961.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1463.176,1467.841,"-- on the state book, now, what's the precise language of that?"
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1467.841,1475.595,That is 3672 (a) on the same page.
1961.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1513.984,1534.289,"Now, am I correct in thinking that the difference between you and them is they insist that as by law authorize the filing, that you are required to file it containing the precise information which the state has said shall be considered to be notice and nothing else?"
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1534.289,1535.949,I think that's correct.
1961.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1564.731,1568.015,"Well, this was not after acquired property, wasn't it?"
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1568.015,1574.513,"No, but we couldn't file any notice, we didn't know whether they were going to acquire property --"
1961.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1574.513,1588.023,"You used that as an argument to show that it was intended to free the Government from setting out the property owned by the person, the taxpayer in specific --"
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1588.023,1588.629,Yes.
1961.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1588.629,1588.784,Tell me --
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1588.784,1590.711,Our brief also --
1961.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1590.711,1591.272,Go on.
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1591.272,1614.69,"-- point -- points out that in the 1954 Code, which did not apply here, though the Michigan Court cited it and quoted it, even more clearly in its legislative history, shows that the intent of Congress was merely that states might designate offices not --"
1961.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1614.69,1616.987,Was that what you read from on page 26?
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1616.987,1621.456,"No, that's -- that was under the 1942 Act."
1961.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1621.456,1624.224,"Before you sit down, may I ask you two questions?"
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1639.243,1639.833,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1639.833,1640.626,Etcetera?
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1640.626,1641.033,Yes.
1961.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1641.033,1642.864,By statute or by decisions?
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1642.864,1645.508,"Well, I think the statute says it in the Glass City --"
1961.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1645.508,1646.845,"The statute did, not in --"
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1646.845,1649.096,"No, I think it maybe construed --"
1961.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1649.096,1649.858,Alright.
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1650.106,1651.021,-- on Glass City.
1961.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1651.021,1678.703,"-- my next question is this, if the Government files a notice to property so and so, defining the parcel of realty that is -- on which it -- for which it invokes a lien, does Michigan law say that -- the Government can say, â€œWe file -- this is a notice of lien on property X, and all after acquired property?"
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1678.703,1679.845,They won't accept it.
1961.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1689.325,1693.05,"But that's the opinion of the Attorney General, and that is the decision of Michigan Supreme Court?"
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1693.05,1708.433,And that was held by -- and that applied until 1956 when Michigan changed this law and now used -- permits liens to be filed in the -- without such a description.
1961.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1708.433,1712.173,So that we are dealing here with an obsolete statute with a --
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1712.173,1713.542,"Well, there (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1713.542,1715.039,"Well, I don't mean obsolete liens but obsolete statute."
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1715.039,1716.812,-- there are thousands of liens and there's almost (Voice Overlap) --
1961.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1716.812,1717.812,"Yes, I understand that."
1961.52,0,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1717.812,1718.655,-- in states.
1961.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1718.655,1724.142,Alright.
1961.52,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1724.142,1725.99,Mr. Butler.
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,1725.99,1730.199,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.52,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1828.112,1830.695,You don't question the Congress' power do you?
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,1830.695,1831.742,"No sir, not at all."
1961.52,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1903.622,1904.949,Where do you quote that statute?
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,1904.949,1917.594,"That statute is the present statute sir and it's found in the appendixes, I believe of the brief of the United States, in their appendixes, yes, at Appendix B on page 25."
1961.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1922.307,1925.737,"But Mr. Butler, doesn't that bear on your -- fluidity of the argument?"
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,1925.737,1933.8,"Not (Inaudible) -- well, sir, I think it bears on the fluidity of the argument to this extent, that the American Bar Association and others are recognizing the problem."
1961.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1957.823,1969.531,"All I'm suggesting is that if you draw inferences from -- as you have every right to it, do you want to hear an argument maybe referenced to general principles related to a specific case."
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,1991.77,2000.497,I believe that you could say very well say that although I do think that the 1955 Amendment supports exactly what we're arguing with reference or prior to it.
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2014.783,2022.849,"Mr. Butler, when you amended your law in Michigan, you adopted a uniform law, didn't you?"
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2022.849,2023.955,Yes sir.
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2023.955,2033.578,And how many states -- do you happen to know have the uniform law at the time of this tax lien?
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2033.578,2052.817,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, I do not know exactly how many states have the uniform law at the time of this tax lien, I can answer your question possibly and directly by saying that in 1923, Michigan adopted the statute which I believe was uniform at that time and required in most states did that the lien contained a description."
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2065.706,2070.681,And that is not required -- that does not require a description of the property?
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2070.681,2073.734,"After Congress expressly declared itself, Michigan went along --"
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2073.734,2075.531,"No, I'm talking about the uniform law."
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2075.531,2076.011,That's right.
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2076.011,2081.905,That was -- I suppose that was in existence before Congress changed its law.
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2081.905,2082.512,No.
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2090.949,2091.501,No.
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2116.33,2117.08,I believe so sir.
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2117.08,2117.816,Alright.
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2130.441,2131.666,I do not know.
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2132.673,2135.715,You don't know whether there was a great number or very few?
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2135.715,2145.695,"I believe, if you read Maniaci and if you read Youngblood and -- as I hope to develop further, the Government was confronted with this problem in many states."
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2195.484,2217.524,The reason I -- the reason I asked you that is because of what counsel read from the reports of the Committee in which Congress -- in which the Committee of Congress said that that this had been the longstanding practice of the Treasury and they were merely righting it law.
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2217.524,2228.277,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, I cannot state expressly but it's my recollection and it's my belief that most states prior to 1955 --"
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2228.277,2228.368,Yes.
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2228.368,2229.182,-- require --
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2229.182,2229.305,Yes.
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2229.305,2230.01,-- the description.
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2230.01,2230.371,That's --
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2230.371,2238.035,"And that this was the frustrating experience for the Treasury Department, and as a result, Congress finally clearly expressed itself of 1955."
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2238.035,2239.32,Yes.
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2239.32,2242.652,"And I might add that since 1955, the problem does not exist."
1961.52,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2296.53,2310.167,"On that story, I understand your statute to permit acceptance of the lien so far as personal property is concerned without any description."
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2310.167,2314.966,I cannot answer that question directly Mr. Justice Whittaker.
1961.52,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2330.932,2347.827,"But this Section 7.751 shown at Appendix A, page 23 of your brief which seems to require a description only of default land, am I wrong about that?"
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2347.827,2353.834,"I believe that that is the Section which -- are you referring to page 23 of our brief, Mr. --"
1961.52,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2353.834,2354.599,Yes.
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2362.06,2364.492,Page 23.
1961.52,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2364.492,2379.947,"Appendix A, Section 7.751."
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2379.947,2388.062,"I believe that this, sir, quotes only that portion of the statute Mr. Justice Whittaker, which relates to land."
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2399.722,2407.992,"Mr. Butler, may I trouble you just once -- once more, you've taken care of the Jay Smiths in the community."
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2450.025,2502.037,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, I believe the -- I don't want to avoid your question but I believe the answer is best made indirectly by saying that if the ownership is undisclosed, the Government's lien is going to be much used to it at any event because it doesn't even know the ownership of the property, they'd have to bring tracing processes at which time they would have disclosure, but I believe more important, the answer to this whole situation where the Government seeks to build this up as enormous problem prior to 1955 has been answered in our brief where we point out that the only time the Government is going to have this problem is where these persons against whom the lien has been filed, either subsequently convey or subsequently mortgage, and many people against whom liens have been filed do neither."
1961.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2511.871,2512.483,Right.
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2512.483,2514.95,"But the statistics of it, we do not agree with it."
1961.52,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2522.848,2526.125,Does Michigan have a tax lien?
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2526.125,2528.098,"Yes, it does Mr. Justice Black."
1961.52,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2528.098,2534.002,Does it have a general tax lien which applies to everything everybody owns?
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2534.002,2535.476,"I do not believe so, Mr. Justice Black."
1961.52,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2535.476,2535.772,You don't?
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2535.772,2537.589,I do not believe it does.
1961.52,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2537.589,2540.636,"Alright, could you refer to that later?"
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2540.636,2541.521,I will endeavor to do so (Voice Overlaps) --
1961.52,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2541.521,2544.339,Do you have a judgment lien law?
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2544.339,2551.987,"We have a law which re -- no, the judgment in Michigan Your Honor does not become a lien automatically but --"
1961.52,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2551.987,2555.732,"After -- after its filed, after the notice was given, do you have one?"
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2555.732,2556.63,No.
1961.52,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2576.856,2580.341,Does the mortgage in Michigan valid or invalid?
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2587.712,2589.026,That would be an invalid mortgage in Michigan.
1961.52,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2589.026,2590.983,It has to be precise and certain under your law?
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2590.983,2594.341,"It has to be precise and certain to encumber the land, Mr. Justice Black."
1961.52,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2594.341,2599.439,"It might be good as between the parties, but not as against creditors, mortgagees, and the like."
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2599.439,2601.687,That is correct Mr. Whittaker -- Mr. Justice Whittaker.
1961.52,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2601.687,2603.993,Would it be good as between the parties?
1961.52,1,26478,h_william_butler,,2603.993,2610.661,It would properly good as between the parties if there were no intervening rights of bona fide purchases or others.
1961.52,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2627.229,2634.234,"Now, by a proper description, what does Michigan require, a complete metes and bounds description?"
