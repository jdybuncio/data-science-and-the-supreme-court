1990.89-1391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.658,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-1391, Irving Rust v. Louis W. Sullivan, and 89-1392, New York v. Louis W. Sullivan."
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,14.508,17.795,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,45.445,48.397,Are doctors always involved in Title X programs?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,48.397,49.631,"They supervise, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,157.0,157.635,Excuse me.
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,172.712,193.541,"Well, actually, Justice Scalia, the regulation makes reference to a 90-10 ratio, but, as the counsel for the Secretary explicitly conceded in oral argument in the First Circuit at footnote 59 of the Planned Parenthood brief, it's been a very long time since they have made any effort to live up with that."
1990.89-1391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,229.548,231.798,Where is the 90-10 pulled from?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,231.798,253.58,"The 90-10 does have, actually, a statutory origin, and there is some confusion, I understand, about whether the statute has been properly construed by the Secretary of HHS in allowing the reach of the Federal hand to exceed this 10 percent Federal fisk."
1990.89-1391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,275.493,290.92,"I suppose we ought to evaluate the Federal statute and the regulations under the Federal statute on the basis of what Congress contemplated when it passed it, and Congress appears to have contemplated a program that is at least 90 percent Federal money."
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,290.92,294.741,That has been argued in various courts.
1990.89-1391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,396.106,405.378,"Certainly the government in its brief, Mr. Tribe, and perhaps it is wrong, seems to take the position that this is basically a pre-pregnancy counseling program."
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,405.378,406.645,"That's right, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.045,413.132,"You say that that was not what Congress intended, or that's not what has happened in fact?"
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,413.132,413.815,I think neither.
1990.89-1391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.632,491.615,I don't see where this argument is going.
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,514.996,516.116,"No, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,518.984,520.534,"Well, it's where your argument leads."
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,526.555,528.257,"No, I didn't say that, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1391,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.847,645.834,But isn't the program permitted to respond to a question?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,654.321,655.107,"--No, they are not, Justice White."
1990.89-1391,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,724.567,732.957,Is your argument now suggesting that or arguing that the regulations are inconsistent with the statute?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,732.957,742.796,"--Well, we have argued throughout that the regulations go way beyond the statute, but I'm now arguing that, even if they didn't, that a government command--"
1990.89-1391,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,742.796,744.498,You're making a constitutional argument now.
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,744.498,744.965,--That's right.
1990.89-1391,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.015,750.735,Even though perhaps we should deal with the statutory question first?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,750.735,754.686,"--We'd be entirely happy to have you say that, to avoid the constitutional question."
1990.89-1391,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,754.686,757.924,Or are you just following the ordinary rule that you're arguing your strongest point first?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,757.924,760.876,"Well, I don't know whether that's the best rule."
1990.89-1391,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,800.351,807.588,"Mr. Tribe, do you concede that the way the Secretary originally interpreted it is constitutional?"
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,807.588,816.027,"We think in respect to that, Justice O'Connor, that permitting options to be presented is surely constitutional."
1990.89-1391,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.504,859.456,And why is that unconstitutional?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,859.456,869.062,"Because, I guess, as Justice Rehnquist said in his concurring opinion in Bolger v. Youngs Drug, the central purpose of the First Amendment is to prevent the suppression of information."
1990.89-1391,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.062,870.598,So this is a First Amendment argument?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,870.598,872.248,It's strictly a First Amendment argument.
1990.89-1391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,872.248,876.334,But is it peculiar to the medical situation here?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,897.081,898.831,Some of them don't seem to realize that.
1990.89-1391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,899.165,902.3,"Well, some of them may not realize it, but I think they'll soon learn."
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,902.735,903.352,That's right.
1990.89-1391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,903.352,908.806,Would you agree that is not unconstitutional?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,908.806,909.923,"Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,965.642,968.011,"You don't challenge the statute, though, do you?"
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,968.011,968.661,No.
1990.89-1391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,980.902,1011.79,"Under the Secretary's former interpretation, the one that you would like us to in effect go back to, suppose this medical care professional said, in our view, from your standpoint and your family situation, abortion is the recommended choice for family planning, and we urge you to have an abortion and here is the name of a place where you can obtain that."
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1013.856,1016.658,"I think not, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1047.011,1050.415,So that it's wrong to make a recommendation under the First Amendment?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1050.415,1053.117,--It's not wrong to make a recommendation.
1990.89-1391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1065.258,1077.565,"Well, I take it that a doctor could, under your view, under the statute as now interpreted or as previously interpreted, strongly recommend contraception."
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1077.565,1082.534,"There's no doubt that the doctor could say... however, if the--"
1990.89-1391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1082.534,1084.186,So that's not viewpoint-neutral.
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1084.186,1103.55,--Total viewpoint neutrality in this area I have to concede is difficult to achieve because the very fact that these are professionals and that laws of informed consent surround this area means that they can be required to provide information without which an informed choice can't be made.
1990.89-1391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1180.947,1191.052,"As a matter of public policy, that may not be a desirable thing, but the woman is in no worse position than she would have been in had the Title X clinic not existed."
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1211.733,1211.983,That's correct.
1990.89-1391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.511,1306.228,--Excuse me.
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1310.581,1311.948,"--Yes, I think it is clear, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1313.783,1314.066,Where is that?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1314.066,1327.626,"--Well, the Secretary's official explanation of the regulations said that they were designed to prevent any expression of medical indication for pregnancy, and I don't think there's anything in the regulations that would suggest that he could warn her in that way."
1990.89-1391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1330.745,1334.28,"You see, this is an important point you are on now."
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1353.777,1354.027,--Yes.
1990.89-1391,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1414.13,1430.491,"Suppose, Professor, that the doctor gives neutral advice or is permitted to give this neutral advice and provide all the information and then the patient says, well, look, I've been coming to you."
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1440.714,1453.357,"--I guess answering truthfully what his opinion is in a way that does not steer or encourage her... these are lines that are terribly hard to draw, which is why the government oughtn't to be in the business of editing these dialogues... I think is beyond what the government could forbid."
1990.89-1391,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.44,1456.492,"Well, the statute would forbid it."
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1456.492,1458.342,"--Well, I suppose you might--"
1990.89-1391,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1458.342,1464.479,I thought you said the statute was... you weren't challenging the statute.
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1464.479,1471.334,"--The statute would forbid encouraging or promoting, not necessarily when pressed saying his own truthful--"
1990.89-1391,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.334,1475.186,You don't think saying my opinion is you should have an abortion is promoting?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1475.186,1487.694,"--Justice White, I must say that I think there is no easy way to figure out where to draw that line, and insofar as the statute is read to control speech it raises a profound problem in any event."
1990.89-1391,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.851,1532.123,"Mr. Tribe, have you made a complete answer to Justice Kennedy's question of why wouldn't it not be equally viewpoint-neutral for these people to advise the use of contraceptives?"
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1532.123,1536.844,Why it would not be viewpoint-neutral to advise?
1990.89-1391,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.844,1542.331,"Yes, to take the position that it's appropriate for the people that visit the clinics to use contraceptives."
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1544.098,1548.319,"Well, the point isn't that the professional cannot advocate a viewpoint."
1990.89-1391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1567.63,1577.086,"Well, don' the regulations prevent the hiring of advice-givers who say the only form of family planning you should use is natural birth control?"
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1581.373,1585.825,"Well, the regulations do suggest that the full range of options--"
1990.89-1391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.825,1586.194,More than suggest.
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1588.41,1590.579,"--But that's like informed consent, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1590.579,1591.712,--Why is it like informed consent?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1597.232,1600.953,It's that you must provide the person with the full range of options.
1990.89-1391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1607.607,1609.123,I think the full range of options is not best.
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1617.213,1621.431,"--If the Court had before it a challenge, there is under the statute a conscientious exemption."
1990.89-1391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.337,1689.258,You say the First Amendment prevents the government from refusing to fund pamphlets that promote abortion?
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1689.258,1692.877,It's not that the government has an obligation to fund them.
1990.89-1391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.06,1698.181,"Well, I thought you just said pamphlets in the waiting room that advocated abortion."
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1698.181,1700.133,"--Paid for by private funds, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1750.463,1757.985,"Well, does it make any difference in constitutional terms whether these pamphlets in the waiting room are paid for by private funds or paid for by Federal funds?"
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1757.985,1768.191,"I think it makes a difference, Mr. Chief Justice, whether they attempt to extend their quite limited power to assure how Federal dollars are spent."
1990.89-1391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1788.938,1789.655,But you haven't.
1990.89-1391,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1790.557,1790.974,Thank you.
1990.89-1391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1790.974,1792.79,"Thank you, Mr. Tribe."
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1793.759,1798.193,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1391,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1997.054,2011.397,"General Starr, do you take the position that the way the program was being run before these current regulations went into effect somehow did not meet the requirements of the statute?"
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2011.397,2018.551,"I think the answer to that is yes in this sense, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1391,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2042.517,2060.311,"Well, you take the position that compliance with the memos that had been sent in prior years in response to questions about providing neutral information was itself in violation of the statute?"
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2060.311,2063.429,"I don't think at the time, Justice O'Connor, for this reason."
1990.89-1391,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2063.429,2066.547,"It would be now, but not then?"
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2068.417,2068.867,I think so.
1990.89-1391,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2076.187,2081.69,"Suppose a different rule had been adopted, one in accordance with the prior memos?"
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2086.293,2093.045,"--If it had had the effect of promoting or encouraging abortion, then I believe it would."
1990.89-1391,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2095.231,2098.933,I'm not sure that's responsive.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2098.933,2100.166,I'm sorry.
1990.89-1391,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2100.166,2107.972,Because the prior memos at least purported to say viewpoint-neutral information may be given.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2107.972,2110.158,That is exactly right.
1990.89-1391,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2165.341,2173.362,But could the Secretary have taken the position of that earlier response and been within the meaning of the statute?
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2173.362,2177.331,I think that's problematic.
1990.89-1391,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2191.574,2202.466,"Well, not if experience had shown that viewpoint-neutral information really wasn't consistent with the statute."
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2202.466,2221.177,"Well, especially, Justice White, and getting back to what this statute is all about, what the Secretary saw is that this is a statute about preventive pre-conceptional services, that is to say providing pregnancy care goes beyond the statute."
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2221.177,2238.889,"General Starr, can I ask you, on that very point, the regulations, at least as quoted in the briefs, say that once a client served by a Title X project is diagnosed as pregnant, she must be referred for appropriate prenatal and/or social services by furnishing a list of available providers that promote the welfare of the mother and the unborn child."
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2242.191,2244.043,"Yes, I think so."
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.67,2264.622,So the statute does require some post-pregnancy counseling?
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2264.622,2272.776,"In the sense of transition, transitional referral, and providing, I think the regulation goes on, Justice Stevens, to say--"
1990.89-1391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.776,2273.312,Never mind the regulation.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2278.764,2281.649,--I don't think it requires it.
1990.89-1391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.853,2320.274,"Well, then why would it prohibit giving necessary health information in that rare case in which abortion might be medically indicated?"
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2323.209,2326.078,"If there is an emergency, then it can be."
1990.89-1391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2326.078,2334.034,"No, it's not an emergency, but it's the better of two options just from a purely medical point of view, not for any family planning reason... just for the health of the mother."
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2341.539,2344.408,Post-pregnancy advice is terribly limited.
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2372.891,2374.125,But this is not?
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2374.125,2392.037,"I don't think so, and certainly they have not challenged the fact that the individual should be given enough information to maintain the status quo until that short period... and we hope it would be a very short period... until she could see a physician who is in fact outside of the Title X program."
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2392.037,2394.805,I don't understand what you mean by the status quo.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2402.811,2403.795,You are quite right.
1990.89-1391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2498.622,2501.86,It isn't an abortion neutrality.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2509.43,2511.899,It certainly tilts against abortion.
1990.89-1391,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2552.209,2554.359,But not as part of this program.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2554.359,2556.161,"Exactly, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1391,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2567.469,2577.658,Suppose the medical care provider in the Title X program ascertains that the woman is pregnant.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2595.202,2604.558,Not if in that latter capacity that provider's principal purpose or principal business is the providing of abortions.
1990.89-1391,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2604.558,2610.212,Then you are saying that this Title X grantee can still engage in abortion.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2614.014,2618.668,"But the list that can be provided, Justice Kennedy, I wouldn't focus on that one provider."
1990.89-1391,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.779,2645.219,"Well, the lady asks the doctor in one of these Federally-funded organizations, asks the doctor, well, could you tell me where I can get an abortion."
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2659.229,2659.995,That is correct.
1990.89-1391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2709.994,2731.741,"General, what do you say the statute and the regs permit in a situation in which the object is not simply to preserve the status quo but the situation in which the Title X physician in the course of his consulting or examination concludes that the mother is pregnant and in fact is in some imminent danger to health?"
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2759.141,2761.676,"Part B does, Part A does not."
1990.89-1391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2802.835,2808.656,Even in that case he's not counseling for the purposes of family planning.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2821.13,2828.801,"The problem is the context, that that advice is being given in the context of a Title X family planning program."
1990.89-1391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2847.864,2849.431,But isn't he going a step further?
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2885.489,2902.832,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because at that point the person, the physician in your hypothetical... I think it is an extreme hypothetical, but accepting it and facing it... I think in that hypothetical the physician has transcended the boundaries of Title X."
1990.89-1391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2917.425,2922.829,"The Secretary requires him to do that, as Justice Stevens' question earlier demonstrated."
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2927.531,2943.492,That you have to provide medical care that is needed during that interim period... I won't use status quo... during the interim period when an appointment is to be made.
1990.89-1391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2957.05,2962.47,But in my hypothetical the interim period may be extraordinarily short.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3007.916,3023.426,"I don't think that the program is prescribing professional speech, if I accept your hypothetical as not in fact permitting what the Secretary contemplated to take place."
1990.89-1391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3044.672,3049.243,It's one thing to say it may be required only to do that.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3062.451,3063.851,That may very well be.
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3063.851,3066.136,May I expand on that?
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3083.214,3084.666,I'm sorry.
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.982,3103.294,"What is the doctor's... how much freedom does the doctor have to explain to the patient that in the next 30 days you ought to have some tests to see whether or not it's appropriate to have an abortion, because that may be the only way to avoid a risk that is not today an emergency but may become an emergency in three weeks?"
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3103.294,3131.545,"I think that the physician is at liberty to provide medical information that is necessary, and so I think that the physician in that hypothetical could respond, provide that physician's best medical judgment, as long as the physician does not in fact steer the patient in the direction of an abortion, but, rather, steers the patient in the direction of an appropriate care provider."
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3131.545,3144.205,"Well, but may the physician... I don't want to use the word ""steer""... may the physician, as a part of his or her explanation of the problem, say that the reason I want you to see some other professional is I think it may be appropriate to avoid this danger by getting an abortion?"
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3144.205,3148.673,"I think that, in my judgment, that goes beyond what is permitted under Title X."
1990.89-1391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3148.673,3152.81,"Well, is it permitted for him to give any other medical judgment?"
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3163.249,3174.157,"He should not in fact, Justice Scalia, be in the business of treating pregnancy and caring for the person in her pregnant condition."
1990.89-1391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3174.157,3175.19,I thought he can only refer.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3175.19,3177.842,Exactly right.
1990.89-1391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3177.842,3188.316,"And in the event of an emergency of the sort Justice Souter was referring to he can refer even to, as I read the regulations, even to an agency whose principal business is abortion."
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3188.316,3192.018,I don't think that the regulations by their terms rule that out.
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3210.313,3211.213,Let me ask one other question.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3224.99,3225.307,Yes.
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3232.428,3235.464,"And suggest the proper solution, in his or her judgment?"
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3235.464,3241.801,I think at that point the physician may very well be going beyond what Title X is all about.
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3243.818,3248.938,"It's no longer family planning, but is it something that the statute would prohibit the doctor from doing?"
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3248.938,3252.39,--I think it goes beyond the terms of the statute.
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.276,3256.526,That's not my question.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3279.54,3280.623,I disagree with that.
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3292.098,3297.751,"Well, say it's appendix or say it's major surgery, you ought to have a bypass operation."
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3303.938,3304.338,--No.
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3308.623,3309.892,I understand he's going beyond what's been authorized.
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3313.944,3320.331,"I think it will violate the terms of the grant, because the grant is in fact... they are funding this physician to provide Title X services."
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3320.331,3323.283,So if he gave that kind of medical advice you could withdraw the grant for the future?
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3323.283,3326.319,"In terms of what... oh, I didn't say that at all."
1990.89-1391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3326.319,3328.437,Suppose I thought--
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3328.437,3328.721,Not at all.
1990.89-1391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3331.723,3335.425,--What are the consequences if violating the regulation about abortion?
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3337.541,3347.399,"The program may be the subject of an audit and then appropriate action taken, which could include not renewing the grant."
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3347.399,3354.569,"Could the same action be taken if he gave advice to have a tonsillectomy, and, if not, why not?"
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3354.569,3360.04,"Well, it might, because the individual is at that point transcending Title X."
1990.89-1391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3360.04,3373.883,"I presume you would certainly terminate the grant if indeed that were the regular practice, that people were coming in to get family planning advice simply because at the end of it the doctor said, by the way, while you're here, let me look at your tonsils."
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3384.858,3389.743,That is precisely why I was suggesting the possibility of a de minimis exception.
1990.89-1391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3392.778,3401.05,"With respect to abortion consultation, that is much more likely to happen regularly than is advice about tonsils."
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3401.05,3405.668,"--Individuals are coming in, exactly, for the purpose of receiving family planning."
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3405.668,3414.858,"Well, does it happen regularly that when a pregnant person comes in that there's a medical need unrelated to family planning problems?"
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3417.476,3420.345,"Well, the individual can again be referred out."
1990.89-1391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3439.425,3450.531,"Just if a doctor sees a medical problem, is the doctor permitted to tell the patient about the existence of the problem, with the normal recommended, what his professional advice is."
1990.89-1391,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3452.316,3458.57,He certainly is able to say I have spotted a tonsils problem and you should go have it attended to.
1990.89-1391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3570.94,3572.14,"Thank you, General Starr."
