1967.695,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,21.937,"Number 695 Charles C. Green, et. al., Petitioners, versus County School Board of New Kent County, Virginia et. al."
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,23.494,26.865,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1967.695,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,330.316,332.104,The Indians were assigned --
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,332.104,332.265,The Indians --
1967.695,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,332.265,333.571,-- to the white scholl?
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,333.571,337.272,The Indians were assigned to the white school beginning of this year.
1967.695,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,337.272,339.187,What was the reason for that change?
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,340.215,346.98,"I don't know whether there's pressure over in HEW where -- it probably was a requirement of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare."
1967.695,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,348.563,351.35,I see.
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,351.35,359.142,"Of such are the facts 14 years after this Court concluded that in the field of public education, the doctrine of separate but equal has no place."
1967.695,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,843.246,846.407,How did these two schools compare physically?
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,846.407,851.132,We assume physically that they compare that they're alike.
1967.695,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,855.717,862.306,"They're more like equivalent in quality and how about in capacity and size, about the same?"
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,862.306,864.051,Capacity is generally the same.
1967.695,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,865.814,866.667,They're more or less equivalent in physical facility.
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,866.667,868.294,They're more or less equivalent.
1967.695,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,875.82,881.107,You suggested Mr. Tucker that one of this might have been the high school and the other the elementary school.
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,882.608,884.646,Each one has an elementary and high school department.
1967.695,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,884.646,885.287,In both?
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,885.287,887.814,Yes.
1967.695,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,891.878,892.768,Can I ask before you get to that.
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,892.768,893.767,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1967.695,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,893.767,896.873,May I ask about the teaching staff?
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,900.806,918.512,"Today there is one teacher assigned to the Watkins School which is the Negro school and one Negro teacher as I take it be from the figures given is -- which is given as appoint two teacher -- appoint four, teaches two days a week at the New Kent School or maybe some other explanation would be practical."
1967.695,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,936.673,945.131,I notice in one of these cases at least the Negro teachers were paid about $200.00 less than the white teachers.
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,946.003,947.95,"I don't think that reveals there, no sir."
1967.695,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,947.95,948.809,There's nothing in this.
1967.695,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,948.809,950.733,Well is there any issue at all of faculty desegregation here?
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,950.733,950.953,No.
1967.695,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,952.865,953.728,No in this --
1967.695,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,953.728,966.139,The circuit remanded the case to the District Court to do something more about faculty desegregation but we elected to bring the student assignment picture here.
1967.695,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1236.049,1242.66,Mr. Gray.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1242.66,1246.989,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1322.33,1331.242,Is the game that you've mentioned had in mind that the players would try to repeat it accurately or that they would try to distort it?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1331.242,1335.74,"They attempt, Your Honor, I would suppose to be that everyone would try to repeat as accurately as possible."
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1335.74,1339.898,You think that is comparable to these segregation cases we've had in recent years?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1339.898,1347.97,"I think, Your Honor that the courts of this land have tried as accurately as they can to repeat what this Court has said, yes, sir."
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1474.717,1483.715,But what consideration did they give between 1954 and 1965 in this county?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1483.715,1485.987,In this county?
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1491.421,1493.109,I beg your pardon?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1493.109,1497.998,-- in New Kent County immediately following the Brown decisions.
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1550.971,1556.34,When was the -- when was that act repealed to the state --
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1556.34,1569.465,"Your Honor '64, I believe Your Honor, I believe it was '64."
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1710.878,1713.913,And has been uniformly accepted?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1715.035,1721.093,"I think, Your Honor, until the Jefferson case it has been generally very uniformly accepted, yes sir."
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1721.093,1722.577,In the Fifth Circuit?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1722.577,1723.014,I beg your pardon sir?
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1723.014,1723.547,In the Fifth Circuit.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1723.547,1725.053,In the Fifth Circuit in Jefferson County.
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1873.436,1878.201,"Mr. Gray, did you have freedom of choice before '65?"
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1878.201,1891.445,"For three years before '65 sir, the Pupil Placement Board, the State Pupil Placement Board accorded any child assignment to the school that he chose."
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1891.774,1896.006,"You didn't have freedom of choice before '65, right?"
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1896.006,1898.956,"The county did not have a freedom of choice plan sir, but --"
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1898.956,1906.158,And the first one that this county ever put on was '65.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1906.158,1915.358,The first time that this county had the authority after the Brown decision to assign children to school was '65.
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1915.59,1918.06,You didn't have it before '65.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1918.06,1929.26,The children had the right prior to '65 to apply to the State Pupil Placement Board which controlled the assignment of all children.
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1929.26,1929.75,"Well, do you --"
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1929.75,1930.331,And --
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1930.331,1941.229,-- now say that pupil assignment plan of 1965 was adopted without regard to race or color?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1941.229,1942.003,I say it's for the --
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1942.003,1942.986,Do you say that?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1942.986,1952.848,"I say it for that the pupil placement plan of 1965 accords to every child in New Kent County, Virginia."
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1962.251,1972.693,It had -- it was for the purpose of giving children freedom of choice and there was no question of the race problem at all.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1972.693,1972.913,It --
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1972.913,1974.056,Is that your position?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1974.056,1978.021,It was to give children freedom of choice to attend whichever school they want.
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1979.002,1987.402,Was it -- was it brought about because of the Brown decision or not?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1987.402,1991.215,"Oh, on question if it was brought about by the Brown decision, yes sir, because the --"
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1991.215,1995.902,So race was involved in the adoption of it.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,1995.902,2002.629,"Race had to be involved in adoption of it, sir prior to the Brown decision, the Constitution of --"
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2002.629,2002.683,Well was it --
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2002.683,2006.718,-- Constitution of the State prohibited the mixing of the races.
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2006.718,2018.138,"Well Mr. Gray, was it adopted with any purpose other than to perpetuate as much segregation as you could?"
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2018.138,2029.45,"Mr. Justice Marshall, let me ask you in this manner if I may, as I can see the situation in New Kent County as related to Brown."
1967.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2126.42,2129.567,Well is it quite -- is it quite like that Mr. Gray?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2134.39,2135.402,But for what reason Your Honor?
1967.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2135.402,2144.47,"Well I know, but you might create two school districts and you might say all the children who live in school district A without regard to color shall attend school district A."
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2153.686,2157.311,"Well, Your Honor that is the vehicle which would be used."
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2208.507,2214.308,Has there ever been a white child admitted to the colored school?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2214.308,2214.706,Yes.
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2217.002,2226.76,"That is, isn't in that result then that although they took down the fence, they put booby-traps in the place of it?"
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2226.76,2227.266,"No, sir."
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2227.266,2232.29,So that there won't be any white children go to a Negro school?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2232.29,2233.942,"No, sir."
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2233.996,2256.15,"Is in the experience of three years in that county where there never has been a white child go to a -- the Negro school, isn't that some indication that it was designed for the purpose of having a booby-trap there for them that they couldn't -- didn't dare to go over?"
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2256.15,2263.438,"If Your Honor please, if the free choice of an American citizen is a booby-traps and this plan has booby-traps."
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2263.438,2264.314,Yes.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2275.209,2277.471,The deliberate speed to what Your Honor?
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2281.359,2282.015,That's right.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2282.015,2285.04,-- not to the integration of a school system.
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2302.798,2307.812,"I think if I was a Negro in Kent County, I would say so."
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2307.812,2314.72,"But sir, by signing this piece of paper, you may go to either school that the county offers."
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2314.72,2324.955,But the social and cultural influences and the prejudices that have existed for century there are themselves written into that thing.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2324.955,2326.159,No.
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2342.381,2343.306,"Yes, yes."
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2343.306,2347.857,-- let me parenthetically explain that situation.
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2426.184,2443.252,"Mr. Gray, on this freedom of choice, so many Negro parents wants to choose to send his child to the -- what the label for the purpose is the previous white school."
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2450.332,2450.786,"No, sir."
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2452.494,2453.888,"Well, do you think that's happened?"
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2453.888,2455.805,"No, sir, I do not."
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2456.675,2461.615,This is a different county isn't it?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2461.615,2476.879,"Mr. Justice Marshall, in the case before this Court in the Fourth Circuit, there was an admission before the bar of the Court, Judge Hanesworth took into consideration the very pipe of factors that you are mentioning."
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2495.769,2496.761,Is that right here?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2496.761,2497.444,Sir?
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2497.444,2498.325,Is that directed before us?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2498.325,2501.112,That is in the appendix at page --
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2501.112,2501.58,Where about?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2501.58,2512.963,"-- 68 of the appendix, it's in the opinion of the Fourth Circuit and in the brief of the appellants in this case at page 22."
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2512.963,2514.267,22?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2514.267,2519.014,"No, in the appendix sir at page 68 is Judge Hanesworth's statement."
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2525.13,2526.751,Where is it?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2526.751,2538.179,"The white brief at page 22, they say, “To be sure each child was given the unrestricted right to attend any school in the system.”"
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2538.179,2547.02,"Well, I also see a quote down the bottom of the same page it doesn't seem to say the same thing."
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2559.142,2567.543,"They are quoting there, if Your Honor please, from the guidelines the Department of Health, Education and Welfare stating of this situation across the country general."
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2626.866,2634.764,Is this in the case any place the reason that this plan was chosen rather than some other plan?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2634.764,2636.148,I'm sorry that I didn't understand.
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2636.148,2646.542,Is there anything in the record to show that the school board of New Kent County adopted this plan rather than some other plan?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2646.542,2651.949,There is nothing in the record to show any reason why the plan -- why one plan was chosen over another?
1967.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2653.425,2659.375,There's nothing to show that there was any consideration at all of setting up school districts?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2659.375,2663.237,There is nothing to show why they chose the freedom of choice plan.
1967.695,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2665.571,2674.18,Do I correctly understand that now 115 Negroes attending New Kent School?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2674.18,2676.875,"115 Negroes attending New Kent School, yes sir."
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2691.699,2696.918,Is there anything in this record to show where the 115 Negroes live?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2696.918,2697.293,"No, sir."
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.134,2729.424,"Well I understand that, I understand that but are the 115 Negroes going to New Kent School most of the Negroes who live around that school?"
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2729.424,2732.361,There's -- I do not know sir and the record does not show.
1967.695,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2733.41,2734.517,If a Negro --
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2734.517,2737.335,Is there state transportation for --
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2737.335,2741.616,There're busses to take the children to both schools.
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2741.616,2751.135,And if Negroes living far in the Watkins end of the county could get transportation --
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2751.135,2752.279,Would be transported --
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.279,2752.862,-- to New Kent?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2752.862,2753.438,"-- yes, sir."
1967.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2753.438,2755.457,Along with the white children who live in the Watkins County?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2755.457,2756.052,"Yes, sir."
1967.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2756.951,2761.897,There must be a good many white children living in the Watkins end to attend the --
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2761.897,2769.583,"Yes, the busses serve the schools, if you go to the school that this bus is going to you ride that bus."
1967.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2771.727,2777.374,And I gather the colored children who live in the New Kent School area are bussed over to the Watkins area.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2777.374,2780.246,"Watkins area if that is the choice that they make, yes sir."
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.986,2814.11,"What would you say if the state said put out the free choice for them and then at the bottom the last line was “Why do you choose this school”, and the parents put down “I prefer to go to a white school”, and the Negroes put down “I prefer to go to a Negro school”, and transfers were allowed on that basis."
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2814.11,2829.516,"I think sir what the court would say, but I know what HEW would say, because they very specifically and of course in the adoption of the plan, we also adopt this provision."
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2837.75,2843.955,Well is there any evidence in this record as to why these choices were made?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2843.955,2850.614,"There's no evidence in this record Your Honor, but I can say to you why they were made."
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2892.872,2910.99,"Would you think it's unfair to say that the free choice plan, the way it operates here is in effect authority to the parents to make their choice based on race?"
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2910.99,2922.652,"Well, the white child parent certainly can not choose to go to a segregated school, because he does not go to segregated school."
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2925.441,2943.643,But it isn't if parents -- do you think it's unfair to say that or not to the parent to the extent their racial differences between the two schools is it an authority to parents to make that a fact there is --
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2943.643,2950.484,"If, Your Honor, if we were going to -- the only way you could do that is to say that no one but white will go here and this isn't the case."
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2950.484,2972.142,"But the state is saying to the parents “Now look, as long as you -- if all of you parents got together in the county, if you had a county-wide PTA meeting and you parents decided that we would just like to have a white school and a Negro school.”"
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2988.241,2988.936,"Yes, it would be for people --"
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2988.936,2991.974,Do you think how may have been decided to have --
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,2991.974,2995.568,"-- it would be permissible under this plan, and I think it would be permissible on the constitution."
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.561,3001.083,Go ahead.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3001.083,3020.525,"It seems to me that prior to Brown, the Government of my state and the Government of many states for reasons sufficient to the Government determined that it's better for one reason or another, it's better that white children go to one school and colored children go to another school."
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3047.004,3048.941,Who signs those forms?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3048.941,3049.309,I beg your pardon sir?
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.309,3050.991,Who signs those forms?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3050.991,3058.001,"The parent, guardian or if the child had reached the ninth grade or is 15 years old he may make his own choice."
1967.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3058.001,3058.429,Thank you.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3058.429,3058.529,Either the --
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3058.529,3079.273,"Mr. Gray, those things you outlined to Mr. Justice White about the feeling and on local rule community in Virginia and that they would prefer to go to their own school and all, would that be fair in assuming that the school board knew that when they adopted this plan?"
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3079.273,3081.025,"Yes, I think you would sir."
1967.695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3081.025,3085.889,Then the plan was conceived in an atmosphere of race.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3085.889,3098.89,"The plan was conceived sir by school board which had the duty, a sworn duty to try to preserve public education and to better public education in New Kent County."
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3175.676,3183.159,Can you say to us that there are no community attitudes to pervade that copy of --
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3183.159,3183.838,Mr. --
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3183.838,3193.488,-- which would militate against a Negro child saying that he wanted to go to the white school. Can you say that to us honestly?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3193.488,3196.844,I think Your Honor that I can't.
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3258.937,3274.651,"Don't we find though in many counties that the larger Negro population, percentage wise, the greater the animosity is toward their participation in things?"
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3274.651,3277.779,I think that in generally speaking sir that is true.
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3277.779,3278.073,Also the --
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3278.073,3278.411,I think --
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3278.411,3287.529,-- large size of Negro population in New Kent County wouldn't bring one normally to believe what you just said.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3287.529,3304.802,"Well, I can always say to you sir, as I have said before that this record in this lawsuit recites in the court's opinion and in the brief filed here they admitted in the bar of the Court they have free and unrestricted choice."
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3319.625,3331.64,But aren't we entitled to take into consideration what has happened in that County for a hundred years before?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3331.64,3334.86,I don't know what you mean about what's happened in that county for a hundred years before sir.
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3334.86,3341.366,"Your -- your segregation in all things, not only in schools but in everything."
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3344.344,3344.734,"Well, I think --"
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3344.734,3345.713,-- will you segregate those?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3345.713,3346.542,-- I think that is in your --
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3346.542,3347.596,Is in your title?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3362.567,3364.596,I think that it did that into consideration.
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3382.695,3385.063,Without relation to anything that's gone before?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3385.063,3386.859,To see if this plan is working fairly.
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3389.636,3401.733,Is it accomplishing the purpose of Brown or his progeny when there hasn't been a single white child go to that school that is entirely Negro?
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3406.376,3412.971,As I understand Brown its purpose was to strike down compulsory segregation.
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3416.938,3421.877,And it referred those cases to the District Court for accomplishing that purpose.
1967.695,1,23976,frederick_t_gray,,3424.28,3436.504,"The compulsory integration does not exist in New Kent County, Virginia."
1967.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3436.504,3441.811,Mr. -- Mr. Tucker?
1967.695,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3446.388,3451.03,We understood that the rebuttal would be done at the end of the three cases.
1967.695,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3451.03,3451.859,Oh!
1967.695,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3451.859,3453.014,After Solicitor General's argument.
1967.695,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3453.014,3453.126,Oh!
