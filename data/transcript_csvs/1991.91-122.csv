1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.189,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-122, PFZ Properties, Inc. v. Rene Alberto Rodriguez, et al.--"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,58.037,59.289,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,138.555,142.776,"Mr. Richichi, let me make sure I understand where you're drawing your facts from."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,146.494,147.244,That's correct.
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,148.327,152.731,"And therefore, ordinarily we would take the well pleaded facts in the complaint."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,152.731,153.914,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,153.914,157.699,"There was a pretrial order entered, was there not, specifying--"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,157.699,158.366,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.366,167.907,--What is your position with respect to whether that order may be relied on or not for facts in deciding the legal questions?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,167.907,178.529,"Mr. Chief Justice, it is well settled law that the pretrial order acts as an amendment to the original amended complaint and is in effect a pleading in and of itself."
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.321,223.91,"So you are now drawing your statement of facts that you make to us, then, from the pretrial order as well as from the complaint?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,223.91,229.279,"Well, the pretrial order... we would rely on the amended complaint, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,247.942,252.394,That is not to me an entirely satisfactory answer to my question.
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,260.25,260.899,That's correct.
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,260.899,267.17,"Is all of that derived simply from the amended complaint, or are you relying at least in part on the pretrial order?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,267.17,271.574,Some of the facts that we have relied upon are reflected in the pretrial order.
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,282.866,294.221,"Well, it may be sufficient to state a claim, but when you give us these statement of facts are you relying on anything that can only be divined from the pretrial order?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,300.475,301.343,"No, I don't believe so."
1991.91-122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,306.481,308.181,--May I just be sure of one thing?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,313.732,314.216,That's correct.
1991.91-122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,314.216,315.584,And where is the pretrial order?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,315.584,320.553,I do not believe the pretrial order was made part of the Appendix by the parties.
1991.91-122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,320.553,323.505,"So we really don't want to rely on that, then, if we can't have it before us."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,323.505,324.024,Right.
1991.91-122,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,361.113,367.617,"Well now, you're relying here on a substantive due process violation?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,367.617,369.386,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-122,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.386,377.158,"We didn't grant cert, I guess, on any procedural due process issue."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,377.158,383.228,We requested that the Court review this case because of the procedural due process violations that we have alleged below.
1991.91-122,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,391.665,408.444,"Well, on the substantive due process issue do you have to allege a property right in receiving the permit, the construction permit?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,408.444,415.697,--We believe that there is a property right that is protected and falls within the due process component--
1991.91-122,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,415.697,417.882,To receive the construction permit?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,417.882,419.099,--The property--
1991.91-122,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,419.099,421.084,A right to receive the construction permit?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,421.084,424.47,"--I would articulate it differently, Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-122,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,424.47,428.44,"Well, would you answer my question and then you can articular whatever you want?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,434.178,435.761,"Yes, there is."
1991.91-122,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,435.761,437.88,And what is that law?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,439.863,460.376,"That was cite... the law that was cited was in our reply brief at Note 5, page 4, and it indicates that when the Planning Board has acted and approved a project there is a vested right that accrues, that's 23 Laws of Puerto Rico Annotated, section 71."
1991.91-122,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,492.697,501.47,And you say that the law that you cite makes clear that there is no discretion at that stage in granting the permit?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,504.505,506.005,--Yes.
1991.91-122,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,508.707,509.826,That it's ministerial only.
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,509.826,510.543,--That is correct.
1991.91-122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,534.574,543.764,And I take it this substantive due process inquiry does not depend upon any showing that there was a taking of property?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,549.001,554.553,"Justice O'Connor, if we're talking about a taking within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment--"
1991.91-122,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,554.553,555.737,"No, that's Justice Kennedy."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,555.737,556.521,--I'm sorry.
1991.91-122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,604.052,612.658,"I take it inverse condemnation can sometime arise from improper governmental action, under the takings clause?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,612.658,622.597,"The Court has said that, in the takings context, that sometimes regulation can go too far if there is an improper exercise of the police power."
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,638.891,659.639,"As I recall the court of appeals' opinion in this case, they did not agree with you as to your submission as to the law of Puerto Rico, that that law was so flat out ministerial that it would, that you had a substantive right to a permit once your development project had gotten to the stage it did."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,659.639,679.052,"I think the... as I recall the opinion, Mr. Chief Justice, what the court of appeals said was they were assuming the existence of the property right, and even assuming the existence of the property right under Puerto Rican law that they did not feel that there was a claim that had been stated."
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,685.789,692.21,"Of the type of property right which Justice O'Connor questioned you about, do you think?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,692.21,702.299,"That is... well, I don't think the court was that specific, but I have to assume that that's what they're referring to when they said we assume the existence of a property right."
1991.91-122,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.299,703.684,"Well, the court of appeals actually said more than that."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,709.155,709.505,I believe that's correct.
1991.91-122,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,709.505,721.629,"And do you suppose that, do you suppose the... is it open in this Court?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,735.139,742.709,"I think the only issue is the latter, if there was a property right, was it taken."
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,772.394,784.536,"Well, stated that flatly, that there is a right to build on one's property, I mean you have to add any number of qualifications to that."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,792.892,797.26,"That is exactly correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-122,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,818.357,845.192,"Well, Mr. Richichi, I'm having trouble seeing where you draw the line between the property right that you are now describing, I think you're describing, and the property right which you described in answer to Justice O'Connor's question, because I understood your answer to her question to be that the property right you claimed, the denial of which you claim was the property in the permit, you had a right to get that permit and that was denied."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,885.599,890.353,"It is the right that you have described, the underlying right to use one's property."
1991.91-122,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,903.094,903.544,Okay.
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,903.544,906.296,--and we believe that the Court has indicated that is within the protection due process clause.
1991.91-122,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,906.296,921.491,"And you, would you... I think you agree but I want to be sure, that your complaint does not set out allegations from which on its face, if we accept them, one could say that you had claimed a substantive entitlement to this particular permit."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,929.662,937.6,"I think it goes to more than delay, because there was a denial of the permit after a legitimate use had been recognized."
1991.91-122,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,937.6,948.391,"But you don't, you don't claim in express terms in your complaint that you had on the merits met every condition necessary to get that permit."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,949.808,957.997,"I believe we do indicate, if the Court needs to go that far we did indicate that the required drawings had been submitted such that a permit could issue."
1991.91-122,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,959.866,962.649,Then I guess you're claiming both kinds of rights.
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,962.649,965.687,"--We believe we should prevail on both rights, that's correct."
1991.91-122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,996.872,997.522,May I ask this question?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,997.522,997.839,--Yes.
1991.91-122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,997.839,1009.28,"To the extent that you're relying on your response to Justice O'Connor, the specific right to have specific drawings of the project approved, why isn't a state law remedy an adequate protection for that?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1012.482,1030.193,"Well, in response to that question we believe that this Court has indicated under Zinermon that the Federal remedy is supplementary so that we are not required in the substantive due process context to first make use of state remedies, and we would submit that that is the appropriate rule."
1991.91-122,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.693,1034.395,"But you did resort to state remedies, didn't you?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1034.395,1036.512,"--Yes, we did, Justice White."
1991.91-122,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1036.512,1037.329,And you were turned down.
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1037.329,1046.118,"We sought reconsideration before the agency advising them, as the court below said unequivocally, that they had reviewed the wrong drawings."
1991.91-122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1068.901,1071.218,"You even, you went to the supreme court too, didn't you?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1071.218,1074.02,--That was a different circumstance.
1991.91-122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.45,1096.319,But maybe you're not required to exhaust.
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1105.241,1107.859,No.
1991.91-122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.975,1142.747,"But then you filed an action in the Puerto Rican circuit court, or whatever the name of the tribunal is, making these allegations, didn't you, that they had looked at the wrong drawings?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1142.747,1148.9,--We did bring an action in the Puerto Rican court asking them to exercise their discretionary review.
1991.91-122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.9,1157.356,"And they just didn't give you any judicial relief at all, or did they rule on the merits that they had looked at the right drawings?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1157.356,1162.66,"The, it is... I would compare the procedure to petitioning for certiorari before this Court and it being denied."
1991.91-122,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1202.368,1208.956,It sounds like you're trying to make a takings claim dressed up as a due process claim.
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1230.035,1233.471,"--Justice O'Connor, we do not allege that any property has been taken."
1991.91-122,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1243.945,1251.599,Is absolute the right to develop the property as proposed by your clients?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1251.599,1253.718,"--No, it is not an absolute right."
1991.91-122,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1265.025,1270.612,"Well, what you really quarrel with is that you didn't get adequate procedural due process."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1292.86,1297.014,--I would respectfully disagree.
1991.91-122,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1343.143,1354.766,"Well, was it still open under Puerto Rican law to Puerto Rico to set aside this area for some kind of wildlife preserve or something of the sort?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1354.766,1357.802,Puerto Rico certainly could have enacted legislation to do that.
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1373.061,1377.28,"That would have required a taking of, a condemnation of your land if they're going to turn it into a wildlife reserve."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1377.28,1383.417,"That would have required otherwise proper conduct, Mr. Chief Justice, as this Court said, and that is not what was present here."
1991.91-122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1404.782,1417.757,What is your best case for the proposition that the bad faith manipulation of procedural processes constitutes a substantive violation?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1417.757,1428.481,I think there is bad faith manipulation of procedures in this case because Puerto Rico did not--
1991.91-122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1428.481,1442.055,"But what's your best case from this Court, if there is one, indicating that that kind of manipulation constitutes not a procedural due process violation but a substantive due process violation?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1442.055,1447.376,--I would return to my response to Justice O'Connor's inquiry which I think was the same.
1991.91-122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1472.324,1479.414,"Well, based on that statement, what is your, what's the clearest authority from this Court that supports your position?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1479.414,1483.949,I think this Court has laid out the standard for evaluating that quite clearly in Ewing.
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.949,1488.353,"But Mr. Richichi, you have been asked to cite a particular case, what is your best case."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1489.62,1503.695,"I think Ewing lays out the standard to be applied in that particular instance, and the Euclid, Nectow, and State of Washington cases all, State of Washington v. Roberge, all recognize that there is a protected interest within the due process clause."
1991.91-122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1519.822,1524.44,Weren't those all cases where the allegation was that there was a taking under the takings clause?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1524.44,1553.709,"--No, Ewing was a, specifically a case in which this Court assumed that there was a substantive due process protected property interest, and in that case what the Court said was there is, if there is a question as to whether the decision, the adjudicatory decision was genuine, if there is a question as to whether it's in good faith, if there is a question as to whether judgment was in fact exercised by the decision-makers, then you would have, you would meet the test for a due process violation."
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.709,1556.661,What's the name of the other party in the Ewing case?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1556.661,1560.88,"I'm sorry, it's the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan v. Ewing."
1991.91-122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1562.749,1565.117,It's a case in which we rejected the substantive due process--
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1565.117,1565.651,--That's correct.
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1565.651,1569.553,--It isn't cited in the Table of Authorities.
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1569.553,1573.973,I'm looking in the brief.
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1573.973,1574.907,I don't see it here.
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1574.907,1576.409,It is a case which--
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1576.409,1577.109,This is your best case and it's not cited?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1577.109,1578.625,--With the Court's indulgence.
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1585.514,1586.18,"Oh, regents."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1586.18,1592.001,--and it is a principally relied upon case we have cited passim throughout the brief.
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1592.001,1592.801,Thank you.
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1592.801,1597.503,"That is the case that we would point out, we would point to which establishes the standard."
1991.91-122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.332,1627.688,"Mr. Richichi, who are the senior officials that you, that are involved here that you claim acted arbitrarily or in bad faith?"
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1627.688,1642.782,"This is the administrator of the agency who is no longer there, there is a gentleman also who was the regional administrator who is now the deputy administrator, and certain other assistant administrators, all senior officials of ARPE."
1991.91-122,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1642.782,1660.861,"Mr. Richichi, if instead of having the equivalent of cert denied when you went into the Puerto Rican courts the court had taken the case, it considered your claim that they looked at the wrong drawings and had rejected you in bad faith for that reason and had said no."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1689.01,1716.596,"If I understand the hypothetical correctly, I believe we would, because the remedy under the due, under section 1983 is supplementary, it is not derivative, and therefore if in fact there has been misconduct, and this is just the sort of thing that 1983 was intended to prevent, if there has been misconduct by the state and you can't get a fair hearing within the state, then you have access to the Federal remedy."
1991.91-122,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1716.846,1727.451,"But you're calling a fair hearing an unfair hearing, what could also and I think would normally be described as a claimed erroneous hearing."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1736.14,1737.259,--I understand--
1991.91-122,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1737.259,1750.667,"And it seems to me in my hypo the State of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is assuming that you have a property interest there subject to adjudication, and it is giving you process to adjudicate it."
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1761.375,1762.175,--No.
1991.91-122,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1776.148,1777.314,Then... I'm sorry.
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1777.314,1787.504,"--Under those circumstances, if it's a mistake or a good faith error or some misjudgment, then I don't think we would have stated a due process claim."
1991.91-122,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1787.504,1798.144,Then does your claim therefore here boil down to the fact that they did not give you any process at all and instead simply denied your opportunity to appeal on the merits?
1991.91-122,0,43258,thomas_richichi,,1798.144,1810.635,"That would be part of it, but we were denied... there was a decision by the agency denying us a use."
1991.91-122,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.641,1820.677,"Thank you, Mr. Richichi."
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,1823.879,1828.764,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-122,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1915.5,1957.513,"Well, Ms. Ramirez, I asked this question and was referred, I believe, to Note 5 on page 4 of the reply brief and the citation to certain laws and regulations in Puerto Rico that the petitioner says make clear that ARPE, if that's what we're calling it, lacked any discretion other than to determine whether the construction drawings had been assembled and submitted, and that they were required by Puerto Rican law to grant the permit."
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,1957.513,1959.929,"Well, it is not correct as a matter of law, Your Honor."
1991.91-122,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2064.913,2083.409,"Well, is it your view that ARPE has a wide range of discretion in reviewing construction drawings whether to grant the permit or not, even when the Planning Board has issued its approval?"
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2083.409,2096.301,"Yes, Your Honor, that is our position and in our brief in response, respondents' brief, this is, we cited to the precise statutory provisions that should indicate to the Court that ARPE is a separate agency."
1991.91-122,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2160.624,2171.098,The court of appeals didn't decide the case on the basis of an argument that you're making now.
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2177.919,2179.185,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-122,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.185,2180.037,--in this construction permit.
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2195.131,2197.583,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-122,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.583,2206.17,"Now, are you defending the court of appeals' basis for denying the substantive due process claim or not?"
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2206.17,2218.06,"I agree that the court below, although it was very skeptical that the petitioner had acquired an entitlement to the permit protected under the due process clause, they assumed for all purposes of the argument that--"
1991.91-122,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.06,2221.198,"All right, now let's assume there is a property right in the construction permit--"
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2221.198,2221.831,--What the court of appeals--
1991.91-122,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.831,2230.737,"--Now, do you defend the court of appeals' decision that nevertheless there is no valid substantive due process claim?"
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2230.737,2243.362,"--I defend it, Your Honor, because something more than an allegation of a 5-year delay must be shown, must be shown, because otherwise this is how a substantive due process is so marvelous--"
1991.91-122,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.362,2243.695,"Well, the court of appeals--"
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2243.695,2244.895,--Everything becomes constitutional.
1991.91-122,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2244.895,2251.099,"--The court of appeals said well, even if ARPE, or whoever it was, even if there was a violation of state law--"
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2251.099,2252.651,"State law, yes."
1991.91-122,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.651,2259.038,"--state law, Puerto Rican law, that doesn't necessarily entitle this developer to relief."
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2259.038,2263.49,The standard which the first circuit was using is one that this is not enough.
1991.91-122,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.679,2280.635,"You defend that, but you also say that you have another ground, namely that there wasn't any property interest at all."
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2280.635,2284.503,"Oh, yes, but this is because they assume the property interest."
1991.91-122,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.705,2301.18,"I take it as a respondent you are saying you can affirm based on the fact, based on the fact that there is no property interest at all in the construction permit."
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2301.18,2307.916,"The court could do it as a matter of law, but the problem is that when this case comes to this Court it is different."
1991.91-122,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2351.243,2389.051,"Ms. Ramirez, this perhaps follows up on Justice White's... the sentence, the last sentence in the court of appeals' treatment of the substantive due process claim says even assuming that ARPE engaged in delaying tactics and refused to issue permits for the Vacia Talega project based on considerations outside the scope of its jurisdiction under Puerto Rico law, such practices without more do not raise to the level of violations of the Federal Constitution under a substantive due process label."
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2394.955,2403.395,"That is correct, Your Honor, and that... yes, we are defending the standard from the policy of U.S. courts, but this is because they assumed the existence of the property interest."
1991.91-122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.33,2409.032,May I just raise a question here?
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2425.391,2428.243,--I think the court of appeals did not go beyond the pleadings.
1991.91-122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2490.9,2492.019,But may I interrupt again?
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2515.635,2525.923,"Your Honor, substantive due process, if it is conduct that shocks the conscience, a 5-year delay I would say does not shock the conscience."
1991.91-122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2528.008,2538.464,"Is that the question as you see it, then, whether a government agency can sit on its hands for 5 or 6 years without any reason at all, they just aren't going to do their work, whether that shocks the conscience or not?"
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2538.464,2539.666,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1991.91-122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2539.666,2540.3,Is that the issue?
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2540.3,2561.497,"--within the substantive due process context, but the petitioner was mentioning the Ewing case, Regents of University v. Ewing, and this is the case that most closely resembles our case in the sense that because we're not dealing here with application of a means-ends analysis to a piece of legislation, which was what was involved in the zoning cases, what do you have?"
1991.91-122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2638.847,2644.251,"He says he has no other state remedy, and you say he does have a state remedy?"
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2644.251,2644.718,"Well, he does."
1991.91-122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.186,2648.253,An action to make them look at the right drawings?
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2648.253,2649.387,"--he has tort damages, and accuse Mr. Rodriguez."
1991.91-122,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2815.362,2818.58,"Thank you, Ms. Ramirez."
1991.91-122,1,43663,vanessa_ramirez,,2818.58,2818.714,"Thank you, Your Honors."
1991.91-122,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2818.714,2820.897,The case is submitted.
