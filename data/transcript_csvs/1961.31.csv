1961.31,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,18.97,"Number 31, Gwendolyn Hoyt, Appellant, versus Florida."
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,23.211,26.018,May it please the Court.
1961.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,231.705,233.803,"There are additionally three states, are they not, Mr. Ehrmann --"
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,233.803,234.527,There are additionally --
1961.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,234.527,234.796,-- which should -- do not --
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,234.796,236.983,-- three states which exclude women entirely.
1961.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,236.983,238.291,"Right, right."
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,238.291,247.944,"So that there are six states today, which either exclude women entirely or provide that they must volunteer."
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,294.6,301.428,One of the argument as to women suffrage was that women would be more aggressive or at least more alert (Inaudible) than men.
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,301.428,301.699,Yes.
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,314.743,316.122,Don't stress that too hard.
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,316.122,316.905,Pardon?
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,316.905,320.334,Don't stress the equality of behavior between the men and women too hard.
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,320.334,323.074,"Well, I thought I qualified it by saying there are certain particulars."
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,323.074,324.216,You'd get into trouble (Inaudible) --
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,324.216,326.197,I'm afraid I would.
1961.31,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,330.187,337.296,"I don't suppose you can say either that women are less active in political life than men, would you Mr. Ehrmann?"
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,337.296,348.431,"I would say that they are less active for certain reasons of tradition, and custom, and culture, but that they are very active in public life today, extremely so."
1961.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,381.418,383.763,"Is that where, in the State of Florida, or in this county?"
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,383.763,384.58,That's in the county.
1961.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,384.58,385.518,In this particular county?
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,385.518,388.402,In this particular county.
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,403.812,413.979,"Have we got any -- have we any statistics as to the number of women that can serve, that are eligible in the federal courts in the Southern District of New York that can serve?"
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,413.979,415.758,"No, I do not have those statistics."
1961.31,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,580.503,583.404,When did the statute in Florida (Inaudible)?
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,583.404,586.208,"I think 1927, yes."
1961.31,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,586.208,589.266,(Inaudible)
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,589.266,591.221,I do not know.
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,593.585,595.512,"They probably exclude it altogether, weren't they Mr. --"
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,595.512,599.311,"I think that is so, but I would be guessing."
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1188.048,1193.016,"You sure you haven't -- you remarked a minute ago, that there's an incitement of breach of the peace."
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1194.829,1201.167,"It might be if I was ordered off the premises, if I follow the discussion right."
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1201.167,1202.867,And if you're a woman --
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1202.867,1203.326,Sir?
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1203.326,1204.435,And if you were a woman?
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1204.435,1206.964,And if I were a member of an excluding class?
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1206.964,1208.057,Yes.
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1208.057,1209.731,That is true.
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1482.117,1507.463,"Mr. Ehrmann, later -- December 1946, this Court didn't -- I think I was justified in saying it in my dissent, the court didn't rule that as a matter of due process which under the federal law impliedly include equal protection that the exclusion of women constitutes an inroad upon the Fourteenth Amendment or the Fourth Amend -- the Fifth Amendment."
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1531.995,1532.316,Well --
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1532.316,1535.076,"-- would catch-up with this movement of which you spoke, the --"
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1535.076,1535.567,Yes.
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1535.567,1536.015,-- what extent --
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1536.015,1536.246,Well --
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1536.246,1536.686,-- of the decision --
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1536.686,1536.897,I don't know but --
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1536.897,1539.046,-- exhilarate on constitutional grounds.
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1539.046,1546.94,"Well, the Fifth Amendment as I understand it has not been incorporated in the rule that it applies to states."
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1583.776,1606.183,"Is that a -- I can think of other justifac -- other consideration, namely, if women are as politically aggressive as they are, that they really want not to have a system like this operate whereby they have to come forward and say, I want to serve or that a legislature may take that into account."
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1622.355,1622.915,Why?
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1624.707,1624.842,No.
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1625.658,1628.574,-- where the control lies in the power of the legislature.
1961.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1655.076,1658.668,"Mr. Ehrmann, may I ask you please sir."
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1686.92,1689.127,"Mr. Justice, we do not know."
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1706.271,1709.126,There are of course two questions -- I beg your pardon.
1961.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1710.952,1712.464,Well that's -- that's alright.
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1712.464,1720.095,"But we only that in five years, only 35 women registered but whether any of them registered the last year just before this year, we don't."
1961.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1720.095,1735.173,"It was of significance to my way of thinking because suppose the administrators of the jury list said despite the fact women have elected to serve by registering, we're not going to pay any attention to it."
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1752.977,1762.155,"Well, where year after year for four or five years, they limit the number to 10, Your Honor I suggest that that alone would be discrimination."
1961.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1775.441,1783.206,"Yes, but there 60,000 men who are eligible you say and only 10,000 men and women on this list."
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1783.206,1783.633,That's right.
1961.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1783.633,1785.275,In the wheel as I would call it.
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1785.275,1786.927,Yes.
1961.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1786.927,1797.588,"So, there might be some disparity, but there wasn't an exclusion of either sex from the wheel?"
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1797.588,1803.41,"Well, there certainly wouldn't have been any exclusion of men, where 10, 000 names were put in, all male."
1961.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1821.103,1822.395,I don't know what the mathematics are.
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1830.723,1830.828,Yes.
1961.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1834.446,1839.765,And there were 10 out of -- 10 women and 990 men in the wheel.
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1839.765,1843.389,"Three tenth of 1%, approximately."
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1857.028,1861.042,May I ask you this question before you sit down.
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1880.817,1882.646,Yes.
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1882.646,1907.075,"The other question and which I wish without arguing, you just summarize what the -- what your case is, the other problem is that even that system, even that system which allows them and to come forward has been so administered that in its actual operation it doesn't give voluntariness an adequate chance to operate."
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1907.075,1911.457,"Well Your Honor summarized it so well, I see no reason why I should violate my red and white light and talk any further."
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1911.457,1913.953,You do not violate anything if you answer the question.
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1913.953,1916.038,"Well, I agree a 100%."
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1916.038,1929.639,"But if the -- what is the supporting evidence in the latter, for the latter statement namely, that as it operate -- as it was administered, the element of voluntariness wasn't actually operating."
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1929.639,1948.535,"Well, the only way that we can gauge this is by the -- is by the way the list itself was administered and they administered it by arbitrarily limiting to 10 each year, the number that were available."
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1948.9,1951.456,"Not even the same 10 or it doesn't matter, just --"
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1951.456,1953.069,It doesn't matter.
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1959.053,1959.578,So that the area --
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1959.578,1962.613,"But other than that, if there's no legal difference between the two."
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1962.613,1969.305,So that the element of chance by which you pull out one ticket rather than another was necessarily reduced if you only add 10 out of which to pay?
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1969.305,1969.862,Right.
1961.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1969.862,1970.478,That's your point.
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1970.478,1972.016,"That's it, exactly, yes."
1961.31,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1972.016,1972.852,Thank you Mr. Ehrmann.
1961.31,0,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,1972.852,1976.527,Thank you.
1961.31,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1976.527,1978.039,Mr. Georgieff.
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1978.039,1980.909,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.31,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2039.09,2040.618,Was the defendant there a woman?
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2040.618,2042.716,Yes indeed.
1961.31,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2187.902,2200.262,"I wonder if -- I wonder if that wouldn't be capable of other -- another kind of solution there, not everyone has small children that she has to raise."
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2238.946,2243.809,"I did not mean Mr. Chief Justice to start with that premise, carry it through or bring it up in the future."
1961.31,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2247.686,2248.151,"Oh, go ahead."
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2248.151,2250.766,"First, our statute does not exclude any women."
1961.31,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2429.267,2430.329,May I ask you --
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2430.329,2430.878,Yes sir.
1961.31,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2430.878,2438.489,"What would think about a law that said, “No men should serve on the jury unless they come up and say they want to do so.”"
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2438.592,2439.042,I should imagine that --
1961.31,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2439.042,2441.062,Would that raise any different question?
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2441.062,2444.841,"Not to me sir, no it wouldn't."
1961.31,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2448.552,2449.402,As to what?
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2449.402,2458.616,"Well, in other words, if I take the position that it makes the difference if we say that to men, then obviously my position now is got to be fallacious."
1961.31,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2480.588,2482.258,At least in theory.
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2482.258,2484.744,"Well, perhaps so."
1961.31,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2510.054,2519.787,"When you speak of infirmities, fundamental infirmities for this service, do you mean anything except that women are homemakers?"
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2519.787,2522.145,"No, an ill choice of word Mr. Chief Justice."
1961.31,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2527.167,2527.41,Yes.
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2527.41,2527.847,-- to raise children --
1961.31,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2527.847,2528.718,Yes.
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2528.718,2529.258,"-- keep the house, etcetera."
1961.31,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2529.258,2530.224,"Yes, yes."
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2530.224,2530.341,Nothing more.
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2530.341,2541.32,"Will you -- make a difference, how many women -- what the experience in other jurisdictions has it been as to excuses given by women to serve on juries where they're required to serve?"
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2541.32,2541.632,I'm afraid --
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2541.632,2541.825,Suppose --
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2541.825,2543.374,I don't quite understand.
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2543.374,2564.691,"Suppose -- I don't know what the -- that's why I asked a question to Mr. Ehrmann, suppose the experience has been because I'm quite sure it has been, that many more women ask to be excused from jury duty than men do, that would a relevant factor in shaping the kind of legislation that a state shape -- that a state shapes (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2564.691,2565.514,I quite agree.
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2565.514,2571.956,-- jury duty by women.
1961.31,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2571.956,2578.263,I think probably that was considered as a relevant factor in the Thiel case?
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2578.263,2588.316,"Yes, as a matter of fact it was, that was the case where the wage workers, the hourly wage workers were discriminated against, Thiel versus Southern Pacific I think."
1961.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2645.787,2659.048,"Well, the question you're talking about now, if I may say so, appears to me as answered by the proposition of whether there is an exclusion, isn't it?"
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2669.563,2676.528,"Mr. Justice Whittaker, I think I first said at least in the first few pronouncements that I've made that there was no exclusion of any kind."
1961.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2713.493,2737.406,Would you agree (Inaudible)
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2737.406,2741.188,"Well, I wonder how much mathematics would be involved before I answer that."
1961.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2745.938,2754.306,Suppose the population of the (Inaudible)
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2754.306,2755.364,Yes sir.
1961.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2755.364,2783.133,(Inaudible)
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2783.133,2787.931,"Well, again I've got to go back to the cases that they have cited in support of their condemnation."
1961.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2793.938,2796.727,(Inaudible)
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2796.727,2800.945,"Well, is that one -- just a one time, isn't that enough to condemn it, I say, “No.”"
1961.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2800.945,2802.543,(Inaudible)
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2802.543,2803.848,It's just my opinion.
1961.31,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2803.848,2816.437,Suppose you think for a series of -- through a series of years that they have 10 every year and no more.
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2816.437,2854.027,"Considering if they had up until 1952 and I maybe a little incorrect in my mathematics, in Hillsborough County they had -- let's say 228 less 35 that registered between 1952 and 1957 which is our critical year, considering that that was so, I should say that if they did that, did not add anymore than the ten, that if it was a requirement that they add, we'd soon run out of women's names if we have no further registrants, because it all turns on whether they come down to register."
1961.31,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2872.512,2889.786,"Well doesn't the fact that you always have 10 show some kind of a system whether it's systematic exclusion or whatever it is, if you always have 10 in the box over a period of years, isn't that some kind of a system?"
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2889.786,2891.734,It sounds -- some type of a continuous number.
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2965.582,2967.962,Why they didn't throw in all the 200 odd?
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2967.962,2969.222,"Well, that's a good question Judge."
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2973.462,2976.62,(Voice Overlap) -- the legal -- is it irrelevant?
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2976.62,2977.371,"Well, as I said before --"
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2977.371,2982.396,"(Voice Overlap) – we're not here to answer -- ask good questions, we're here to ask relevant questions."
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2982.396,2982.683,Truth of the matter is --
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2982.683,2983.394,(Voice Overlap) --
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2983.394,2986.237,-- it wouldn't have mattered a bit.
1961.31,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2986.237,2996.495,"I thought you explained a moment ago that the reason they didn't do it was because if they put more of them in, they'd soon run out of names entirely."
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2996.495,3000.77,"Well, I am still addressing myself to the proposition that this statute is constitutional."
1961.31,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3000.77,3015.084,"Yes, but Justice Frankfurter asked you why didn't -- if -- when you have so few women, why didn't you put in all the women and I thought a little while ago you said, if we kept putting in more and more, the first thing you know, we would -- there wouldn't be any women on the list."
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3015.084,3025.976,"Well, if we say, why did we not put in all the 228 or whatever it was, let's say 250 names, why didn't we go on ahead and put in the whole 114,000 qualified electors?"
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3027.47,3031.948,"Well, I don't understand -- I'm not questioning you, I just don't understand what that means."
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3051.09,3055.372,"Again, I must confess I don't think I understand the justice."
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3055.372,3060.694,"What would be the consequence if they put in all the available jurors that were on the list, in (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3060.694,3060.9,All of them?
1961.31,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3060.9,3061.553,The women.
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3061.553,3062.375,The women.
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3062.375,3062.543,The women.
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3062.543,3063.166,All the women.
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3063.166,3064.236,Alright.
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3064.236,3069.477,"What -- suppose that (Inaudible) -- and you carry on from there with this consequence, what would happen?"
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3072.188,3081.976,"Well, it would've increased the margin or the percentage opportunity that the appellant would've had of securing one when they drew the petit jury panel."
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3081.976,3085.295,"Well, but that's rather important, isn't it from the defendant's point of view?"
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3085.295,3093.237,"To be sure, but it would have been equally important if we had nothing there to prevent all of 46,000 women electors in Hillsborough County from being available."
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3093.237,3101.738,"But they weren't and they -- I'm assuming with you for purposes of my question, I'm assuming that the statute is constitutional."
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3118.432,3119.862,"Well, there's a difference judge and --"
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3119.862,3120.615,(Inaudible)
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3120.615,3122.495,"Its somewhere around 228, I think."
1961.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3122.495,3125.478,"No, no, no, in the total jury potential?"
1961.31,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3125.478,3126.295,Oh.
1961.31,2,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,3783.712,3791.203,"Mr. Chief Justice, I do not know whether you wish to have this information, but it's an answer to the question that you asked."
1961.31,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3803.087,3804.204,What county is that?
1961.31,2,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,3804.204,3805.096,Hillsborough County.
1961.31,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3805.096,3808.312,"Which -- well, what's the principal city in that county?"
1961.31,2,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,3808.312,3810.299,"Tampa, isn't?"
1961.31,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3810.299,3811.726,How large a county is it?
1961.31,2,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,3811.726,3822.19,"Well, about 400,000 -- I'm about to say Your Honor, about 300,000."
1961.31,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3825.385,3823.509,Yes.
1961.31,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3825.664,3828.165,Is that the county where this case was tried?
1961.31,2,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,3828.165,3828.702,Pardon.
1961.31,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3828.702,3829.966,Is that the county where this case (Voice Overlap) --
1961.31,2,26936,herbert_b_ehrmann,,3829.966,3834.323,That's the county where the case was tried.
