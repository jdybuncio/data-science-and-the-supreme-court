1997.96-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.122,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-1578, Thomas R. Phillips, et al. v. Washington Legal Foundation."
1997.96-1578,0,21049,darrell_e_jordan,,12.058,14.908,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.96-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,43.077,47.462,"But they're required to manage it as fiduciaries for the benefit of the clients, are they not?"
1997.96-1578,0,21049,darrell_e_jordan,,47.462,50.331,"That's correct, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,64.741,75.113,"Well, Mr. Jordan, by way of background, the IOLTA funds account also include deposits from corporations, do they not?"
1997.96-1578,0,21049,darrell_e_jordan,,75.113,76.798,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,76.798,94.26,"And as to the corporate moneys that are deposited as opposed to the share that's the result of deposits by individuals, is there a correspondingly larger amount of interest earned?"
1997.96-1578,0,21049,darrell_e_jordan,,103.632,114.257,"Justice O'Connor, we are not able to track what percentage of the IOLTA interest income that gets to the foundation comes from corporate or partnership deposits."
1997.96-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,114.257,119.308,Do you know what percentage of the deposits are from corporate as opposed to individuals?
1997.96-1578,0,21049,darrell_e_jordan,,119.308,130.366,"I only have my opinion, and that would be, Justice O'Connor, that probably about 60 percent or so do come from corporate or partnership--"
1997.96-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.366,162.42,"I was curious because the amounts of individuals that... of interest earned that wouldn't exceed the cost of establishment and maintenance of the fund nevertheless seem to be generating substantial amounts of money for these programs, and so it seemed to me very likely there were corporate deposits that were generating substantially more interest, and that's why so much was being earned."
1997.96-1578,0,21049,darrell_e_jordan,,162.42,202.981,"--One of the reasons, Your Honor, that IOLTA is able to earn interest for the foundation when it cannot for individual clients whose money is deposited, whose short-term and nominal funds are deposited in IOLTA accounts, is that it takes advantage of the changes in the banking law that occurred in 1980 where corporate and partnership accounts can be pooled with individual funds in an IOLTA account, and then, based on the tax ruling, there's no taxable transaction, the efficiency of the economy of scale where one pooled account and the recipient can be attributed to one foundation, all of this generates--"
1997.96-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.981,217.241,"Are corporations making these deposits, or anyone, for that matter, given an option about whether to have their moneys go into an IOLTA account or not, or is it required that they go into an IOLTA account?"
1997.96-1578,0,21049,darrell_e_jordan,,217.241,220.693,"--Justice O'Connor, the IOLTA program is mandatory for the lawyer."
1997.96-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.693,221.076,Right.
1997.96-1578,0,21049,darrell_e_jordan,,221.076,222.576,It's part of the disciplinary rules.
1997.96-1578,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1150.688,1158.811,"No, there's not, but there's also no requirement, State-imposed requirement that a client turn over money to the lawyer."
1997.96-1578,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1160.411,1161.913,What about federally imposed requirements?
1997.96-1578,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1189.396,1189.73,--I don't--
1997.96-1578,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.73,1196.384,"I mean, this whole thing works only because... because corporate money can't receive interest--"
1997.96-1578,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1196.384,1196.7,--Well--
1997.96-1578,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1196.7,1198.217,"--in immediate payment accounts, right?"
1997.96-1578,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1198.217,1198.752,--Right.
1997.96-1578,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.752,1207.691,"That rule is adopted, but if you allow those corporate funds to be used for something else, some good thing that the State wants to do, then it's okay."
1997.96-1578,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1207.691,1234.508,"Well, I think the basic point here is that the... whether the Federal Constitution requires the State of Texas to conclude that the interest generated by an IOLTA account, which State law declares to be the property of the Texas Equal Access to Justice Foundation, instead to be the property of the individual client, and it's important to remember that the question of whether a property right arises takes place in a... in two heavily regulated areas."
1997.96-1578,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1243.364,1246.399,"Well, but it's been... this isn't any regulation of banks."
1997.96-1578,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1248.032,1258.79,"No, but whether... the question of whether a client has a legitimate or a reasonable investment-back expectation in earning net interest necessarily arises against the background of the banking--"
1997.96-1578,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1258.79,1259.59,Well--
1997.96-1578,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1259.59,1260.991,--banking regulations and economic reality.
1997.96-1578,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.991,1269.847,"--Well, you could have said the same thing in Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, that the person had no expectation under State law because there was a State rule that said you didn't get it."
1997.96-1578,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1269.847,1270.214,Well--
1997.96-1578,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1270.214,1273.049,But that didn't control the result in that case.
1997.96-1578,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1273.049,1280.203,"--No, but there are several important distinctions between this case and Webb's, if I may highlight them, because I do think they're... they illustrate what's so different about this case."
1997.96-1578,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1307.12,1321.714,"Well, would this be a different case, do you think, if each person giving a lawyer money that might go into an IOLTA account were given a choice and asked to decide whether to agree with the IOLTA scheme or not?"
1997.96-1578,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1321.714,1354.185,"The difficulty with that option, Justice O'Connor, is that one of the important considerations in the IRS' approval of this and the revenue ruling 81-209 that we cite in our brief was that the client did not have control, because if the client has control as to... over whether the lawyer will deposit the money in the IOLTA account, then the income generated by that account, which goes to a charitable contribution, might be an assignment of income by the individual taxpayer, individual client, because the client would be exercising control over the disposition, so--"
1997.96-1578,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1354.185,1358.739,"Oh, but you said a moment ago, and I thought correctly, that the client does, in fact, have that option."
1997.96-1578,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1363.707,1364.041,--Right.
1997.96-1578,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1364.507,1366.293,"Oh, as opposed to assigning it to a--"
1997.96-1578,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1366.293,1366.743,--Right.
1997.96-1578,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1372.047,1382.252,--So under the IRS there's no problem in the client having a choice as to whether or not to take the money back as opposed to leaving it in in a way that will earn interest for this charitable organization.
1997.96-1578,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1383.935,1384.202,--Right.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,1726.579,1729.447,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.695,1757.68,Isn't that the premise on which the court of appeals decided the case?
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,1757.68,1760.632,"--The court of appeals said, even if that is the case, that is correct."
1997.96-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1760.632,1769.119,"They assume that, and we're asked to pass on whether their decision was correct on that assumption, and that's why the question was phrased the way it was."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,1771.738,1776.808,"That is correct, and we believe that the Court should uphold the Fifth Circuit's decision."
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1784.33,1787.865,"We don't have a factual record developed to support that, do we?"
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,1787.865,1789.832,"We do not have a factual record, and that was why--"
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1789.832,1792.584,Then I don't know why we would decide the case on that assumption.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,1807.158,1807.51,--The--
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1807.51,1808.91,--factual premise that we don't have before us.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,1808.91,1813.414,--The court of appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment to the petitioners.
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1837.779,1841.064,"It might be a correct reason for digging this case, too."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,1847.135,1851.337,"That is correct, and certainly that would be an option to dig the case, if Your Honor so chose."
1997.96-1578,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1867.381,1867.914,Mr. Samp--
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,1874.368,1875.335,"That is correct, yes."
1997.96-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1875.335,1876.737,You're still protected in that regard.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,1886.759,1886.993,Yes.
1997.96-1578,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1886.993,1896.965,I believe the complaint says a small amount of his money has been in an IOLTA account since May 1993.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,1896.965,1897.733,That is correct.
1997.96-1578,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1897.733,1902.018,We know there's no economic stake for the lawyer or for the organization.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,1906.856,1911.291,"The small amount is 1,000 dollars that has been in this account since 1993."
1997.96-1578,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1937.876,1945.897,But can we argue the case on the assumption that no net interest can be attributed to this client?
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,1947.833,1948.649,If you so choose.
1997.96-1578,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1951.165,1953.767,"On that assumption, why should you still prevail?"
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,1953.767,1963.742,"--Because it has been the common law rule for 250 years that if, in fact, interest is generated, that interest belongs to the client."
1997.96-1578,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1963.742,1969.027,"Well, if that's so, why... this is exactly the problem I'm having."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2029.017,2029.567,Justice--
1997.96-1578,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2029.567,2040.575,"So on any of those analogies, the answer is there is no property interest in what's used, what's gained, but the question is whether we can use the basic fund for that purpose."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2053.382,2081.735,"--Justice Breyer, the Court in its Webb's Fabulous Pharmacy case saw these two issues that you're presenting as really the flip side of each other, that really the reason that interest follows principal is because in effect the use of the principal is what generates the interest, and therefore the Government's temporary taking or use of the original principal is the same thing as the taking of the interest."
1997.96-1578,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2106.017,2115.873,"They take my water and they say, run it over the TVA dam, and as a result it makes electricity which otherwise couldn't be produced."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2125.163,2130.781,"--In all respect, the navigable... the water in navigable streams has never been though to be private property."
1997.96-1578,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2136.185,2139.137,It seems to me this case is something like an escheat.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2155.497,2159.032,"In the case of abandoned property, that is correct, and the rules of escheat--"
1997.96-1578,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2159.032,2175.874,"Well, isn't this something like abandoned property, because under the assumption... and I know you have an alternate base, but under the assumption that we... on which we're considering the case, you simply cannot trace and pay the interest, so it seems to me very much like an escheat."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2175.874,2182.064,"--Well, let me distinguish what... within the question presented from what all the facts of this case are."
1997.96-1578,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2192.37,2203.894,"I thought that we made it very clear that interest is earned, but that it's not net interest in the sense that the administrative cost of tracing it and paying it to the client will exceed the interest itself."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2206.096,2215.285,"And let me add, Justice Kennedy, that the underlying premise of IOLTA is that there will be these costs, yet those costs will exist in any event."
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2241.103,2247.423,"No, but the... when IOLTA talks about the offset it's talking about offsets beyond that."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2291.516,2293.885,"Justice Souter, I'd like to call your attention both to Rule 6--"
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2293.885,2295.487,"No, but isn't that the premise?"
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2295.487,2296.087,"--No, that is not."
1997.96-1578,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2336.045,2341.116,What is the Texas State law about interest following principal?
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2349.603,2349.972,--The--
1997.96-1578,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2349.972,2352.072,The Sellers case sort of sounds like that.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2352.072,2366.564,"--The Sellers case indicates that if a fund of interest is generated, the person responsible for generating the interest is entitled to take a reasonable fee for their expenses before paying on the interest."
1997.96-1578,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2366.564,2376.705,"I mean, if Texas law is to the effect that only net interest goes with the property, and if we take this case on the assumption that there isn't any net interest, then where does that leave us?"
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2376.705,2379.574,Texas law does not say only net interest.
1997.96-1578,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.211,2432.792,"Mr. Samp, can I... coming back to Justice Kennedy's escheat example, I was thinking that that differs from this in that the owner of a bank account that would be escheated has voluntarily let it go."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2447.468,2449.668,There is nothing voluntary about the IOLTA program.
1997.96-1578,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2478.004,2486.009,"Well, I thought that the statements made here say that it was just ordinarily funds kept for a very short time while a check cleared."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2488.559,2489.628,--They are still in the fund.
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2517.696,2521.266,"Does the State require him to pay the 1,000 dollars to the lawyer?"
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2526.416,2530.97,The State has stated that any money in a trust account must go--
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2530.97,2536.957,"Yes, but the State doesn't say that this 1,000 dollars has got to be paid to the lawyer and put in... to be put in a trust account."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2539.492,2545.98,"--Similarly, in the Webb's Fabulous Pharmacy case, there was no requirement that anybody make a claim against the--"
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2545.98,2566.659,"No, but there was a difference in Webb's, and the difference was in effect that there was a background of practice in dealing with money, and given that background of practice with dealing with money, it was the standard, the norm that the interest went to the person whose principal was earning it."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2578.617,2581.086,"--In all due respect, in Webb's there was no such history."
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2589.008,2607.386,"But there was a general background principle that sums of money capable of earning interest at commercial rates in substantial amounts, as a general rule, went to the... as a general rule under those circumstances the interest went to the person who owned the principal."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2608.603,2614.724,"--The background in Florida is precisely the same in Texas, and that is a general rule that interest follows principal."
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2615.992,2616.609,"No, but there is a--"
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2616.609,2619.075,--background principle that adds the caveats that you have suggested.
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2619.075,2645.692,"--But the question, I think, is whether we should say that the, I guess consistently different background treatment in commercial and legal practice here is not entitled to some constitutional significance, and we can't make that determination simply by saying this is like Webb's, because the question in this case is whether it is like Webb's."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2648.542,2651.194,Webb's did not directly address the issue here.
1997.96-1578,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2667.355,2670.057,"Mr. Samp, I'd like to ask you... your time is running out."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2693.256,2713.134,"--Precisely, and in fact that is the unanimous view of the court of appeals right now, is that prison accounts, when they are set up and they actually earn interest, the prison is entitled to take a reasonable administrative fee off of the top, but any interest that remains is the property of the clients, and they... generally courts of appeals have said that prisons may not take that money and use them as they see fit for the general benefit of the prison."
1997.96-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2713.134,2715.217,Is there any... please.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2730.846,2732.612,"Well, that's what they have done in this case."
1997.96-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2732.612,2733.179,Do you think they--
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2733.179,2735.548,"They have announced a rule repealing it, and the question is--"
1997.96-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2735.548,2742.202,"--The question is, as a matter of State... if they did it as a matter of State statutory law, say, you say they... the Constitution would permit or prohibit that?"
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2742.202,2746.154,"--They have done that, and it prohibits it, because this Court said in Webb's--"
1997.96-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2746.154,2750.64,But they do it by defining property in a way that doesn't include this category of interest.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2750.64,2765.067,"--Yes, and this Court in Webb's said that when you simply announce by ipse dixit that some piece of property that used to be protected by State law no longer is, that that is precisely what the Takings Clause was intended to prevent."
1997.96-1578,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2804.775,2805.442,Let me ask you this.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2813.846,2814.298,--Yes.
1997.96-1578,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2843.198,2843.983,"Well, is--"
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2861.862,2862.279,That's correct.
1997.96-1578,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2862.279,2865.581,It's conceivable that he has a property interest but that there hasn't been a taking.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2865.581,2866.514,That is correct.
1997.96-1578,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2866.514,2877.871,"Because since he could not harvest that property interest, so to speak, it was worthless to him, the holding below on remand could be there's been no taking of that property interest."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2877.871,2882.942,"While we would argue against that result, that is a possible result after a favorable decision to us today."
1997.96-1578,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2882.942,2888.262,"Okay, but you acknowledge that they are two separate questions, and all we're talking about here is whether there is a property interest."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2888.262,2888.879,That is correct.
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2888.879,2893.247,Do you think they are necessarily two separate questions for us here?
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2938.043,2947.214,I think it would be a preferable course for the Court to have a full record as to whether or not there was a loss to the client prior to making that determination.
1997.96-1578,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2966.109,2970.293,"The court of appeals made no effort to decide the second question, did it?"
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2970.293,2970.912,"That is correct, yes."
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2970.912,2972.712,"It expressly reserved it, as I recall."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,2973.112,2988.172,"That's correct, and they also, while they reinstated our First Amendment claim, they really had... had virtually no discussion of the First Amendment issue, so that regardless of how the Court rules today on the Fifth Amendment issue, we would hope that that issue would be... would still be open on remand."
1997.96-1578,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2988.172,3007.919,"There's a lot of law that concerns contracts and trusts, and misuse of trusts, and I take it it's common law in most States that if a trustee misuses your money and makes money out of it he's going to have to pay that to you, and that seems to help you."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,3007.919,3008.653,That is correct.
1997.96-1578,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3008.653,3009.204,All right.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,3079.449,3086.288,I am not sure that a decision in our favor in this case would constitutionalize the entire law of trusts.
1997.96-1578,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3111.07,3116.39,"Not the Taking Clause, just normal property law."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,3116.39,3116.69,--Yes.
1997.96-1578,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3117.057,3120.925,My worry was just the opposite of Justice Breyer's.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,3145.474,3145.907,--I--
1997.96-1578,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3145.907,3149.778,"But if there's no property interest, there would be no basis for such a rule, I assume."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,3149.778,3151.644,"--I agree with you completely, and it seems to me that--"
1997.96-1578,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3151.644,3166.454,"But Mr. Samp, I thought that the... once I... tell me if this is a wrong fix on the case, that it was a question between who was going to get this money, the Texas fund or the bank, that in no event was it going to enrich the lawyer or the client, so there were two choices."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,3176.727,3186.249,"--Perhaps that was a premise back in 1976, at a time when interest could not effectively be earned on accounts."
1997.96-1578,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3201.009,3201.375,But that's--
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,3217.301,3222.538,"--I don't believe he has an investment-backed expectation, and that goes to the issue of whether there is a taking."
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3257.775,3266.279,"Well, why wouldn't your case be basically the same even if there were no IOLTA and the banks were simply getting the benefit of the deposit?"
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,3275.301,3283.555,"The banking industry has always been subject to regulation, and if they are prohibited from paying interest, we don't claim that we would have any sort of claim."
1997.96-1578,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3292.66,3297.528,So interest follows principal only if there is a background practice of paying interest.
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,3297.528,3300.314,Any interest that is paid follows principal.
1997.96-1578,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3338.872,3339.622,"No, no."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,3348.661,3348.978,--And I--
1997.96-1578,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3348.978,3354.299,"I mean, whether the vegetables if they do use it, who they happen to belong to, I mean, I don't know."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,3369.308,3379.514,"--The... it's not the Constitution, it is common law and State law that has always said that the earnings of a fund, the earnings of property are the property of those who own the fund that generate it."
1997.96-1578,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3388.722,3398.578,"Yes, but because you can tell the Government to get out of your yard you're in the same position, it seems to me, that you're in here, when you can say to the lawyer, give me the 1,000 dollars."
1997.96-1578,2,40539,richard_a_samp,,3401.03,3406.433,"The Government hasn't even... the Government has said to the lawyers, you don't even have to tell me, so I don't even know that you're in my backyard."
1997.96-1578,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3412.218,3412.684,"Thank you, Mr. Samp."
