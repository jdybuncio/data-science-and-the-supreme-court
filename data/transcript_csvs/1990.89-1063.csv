1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.412,"We'll hear argument now on No. 89-1063, FirsTier Mortgage Company v. Investors Mortgage Insurance Company."
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,49.484,51.547,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,96.436,99.458,"There was more in that colloquy, wasn't there?"
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,99.458,99.608,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,99.608,100.239,Than what you've just--
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,100.239,102.081,And I'll... and I will get to that in just a minute.
1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,102.081,102.49,--Okay.
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,102.49,106.543,"Well, I'll get to it right now."
1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,137.254,140.356,"This was on a motion for a summary judgment, wasn't it?"
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,140.356,140.586,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,140.586,146.991,Does the district court ordinarily make findings of fact and conclusions of law in a motion for summary judgment?
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,146.991,151.415,"They don't have to, of course, under rule 56."
1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,152.807,160.381,I'd always thought of findings of fact as being something you have at the end of a bench trial where there are contested facts.
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,160.381,162.804,"--Yes, sir, and then I think the court it required to under the rule."
1990.89-1063,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,209.01,216.016,"You don't think you would have been at any risk if you had delayed filing your notice of appeal until after the formal entry of judgment, do you?"
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,216.016,226.203,"--The only risk that I see as a trial lawyer is the risk of misdocketing, the risk of mailing it late, the risk of running up a deadline."
1990.89-1063,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,268.664,276.179,"Yes, but you certainly can mark your trial... your desk calendar to file notice of appeal later."
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,278.342,279.462,"--No, Your Honor, you don't."
1990.89-1063,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,289.901,292.922,"Well, if you mark your desk calendar, you won't wake up in the middle of the night."
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,292.922,295.303,"Well, I do."
1990.89-1063,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,345.421,345.771,That settles it.
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,345.771,350.355,"Well, then we get the letter from the supreme... from the court of appeals."
1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,391.227,395.12,"1291 certainly speaks in terms of a final decision, doesn't it?"
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,395.12,395.31,Final decision.
1990.89-1063,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,413.422,423.709,"Well, surely, the case wasn't ready for review in a... by an appellate court based on Judge Bohanon's oral statement."
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,437.467,447.445,"--Well, I think that his decision was reviewable at that time, because he didn't have to enter... he could have changed his mind and just said I'm just not going to do findings of fact and conclusions of law."
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,461.102,471.661,"Now, Mr. Dawson, you're not arguing it was reviewable at the time of the oral... every case covered by this rule is not reviewable at the time of the oral announcement, because that clearly speaks to orders that are not yet final."
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,471.661,472.302,--I was only--
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,472.302,474.095,They're all prejudgment and oral announcements.
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,474.095,474.405,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,474.916,475.847,That's the whole purpose of the rule.
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,475.847,476.428,--That's correct.
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,492.993,494.944,But the rules doesn't say anything about journal entries.
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,496.316,496.867,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,500.529,503.461,And the question is whether this was an announcement within the meaning of that rule.
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,504.993,505.253,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,505.253,516.991,"Now, Mr. Dawson, do you think that a rule of appellate procedure can make appealable something which 1291 does not make appealable?"
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,516.991,517.782,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,518.633,521.875,"So, it would have to be a final decision before it could be appealed?"
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,521.875,523.847,--It would have to be an appealable decision.
1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,523.847,524.499,Well--
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,524.499,526.582,Interlocutory or collateral.
1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,526.582,526.742,"--Yes, yes."
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,526.742,527.373,--or something like that.
1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,527.373,528.663,"1291, 1292."
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,528.663,529.094,Yes.
1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,529.094,532.216,"You know, the rule itself could not enlarge what's appealable."
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,532.216,533.087,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,533.087,535.428,"No, but the rule doesn't purport to do that."
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,543.795,544.405,That's correct.
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,545.216,549.198,"So, it's perfectly clear there's no finality before the judgment was entered, no appealability."
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,559.048,561.259,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, I didn't follow."
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,561.259,566.784,"If your notice of appeal becomes effective as soon as the judgment becomes final, which is what the rule says--"
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,566.784,567.364,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,567.364,570.536,"--then, of course, you have a... then a final judgment to appeal."
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,570.536,570.887,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,570.887,572.649,Just what the rule says.
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,573.229,574.281,That's correct.
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,695.433,700.295,"I just don't understand that argument, because appealability and finality are the same thing."
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,708.164,715.08,"Well, there is... there is... there are a slim bunch of cases which is called the collateral order doctrine."
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,721.778,724.749,"Yeah, but if it's a collateral order doctrine, then it's final when it's entered."
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,726.591,726.872,--Well--
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.872,732.004,As I understand your position it's just it... it doesn't become final until the judgment's entered.
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,736.589,737.08,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,740.632,741.373,And that's what the rule says.
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,741.373,741.933,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1063,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,751.882,753.852,"Thank you, Mr. Dawson."
1990.89-1063,0,29972,jack_s_dawson,,756.924,760.097,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,813.2,815.822,"Mr. Roberts, that's not involved by your opponent's theory here."
1990.89-1063,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,820.236,821.145,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.145,823.388,And it doesn't become effective 'til the judgment becomes final.
1990.89-1063,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,823.388,824.588,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1063,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,830.344,833.957,And also the notice of appeal became effective on that same date under the rule.
1990.89-1063,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,833.957,834.969,"That's correct, Your Honor."
