1987.87-645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.637,"We'll hear arguments now in No. 87-645, F. Clark Huffman v. Western Nuclear, Inc.--"
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,14.162,17.213,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.87-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,123.214,126.965,What does that mean in the context of that finding?
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,134.942,142.806,"The meaning of viability is spelled out in some detail, first of all, by Congress."
1987.87-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.521,177.539,"Does the Congressional statute require that viability be determined by ability to meet national needs, rather than profitability?"
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,177.539,180.39,We think clearly yes.
1987.87-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.466,235.347,"It's a strange use of the word, I must say."
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,235.347,250.896,"Well, whether it's a strange use or not, Congress clearly set forth the criteria in 1982 which were to be used, and the criteria focused on things like the production capacity of the industry and its financial resources."
1987.87-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,250.896,258.442,"Mr. Merrill, in opposing the Motion for Summary Judgment, is that the position the Government took that that's what viability meant?"
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,258.442,266.106,The meaning of viability was never really confronted in this case.
1987.87-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.393,300.45,What my question really was directed to was what position the Government took in opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment.
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,304.05,315.719,"The Department's theory throughout this case has been that the statute, contrary to the lower court's, does not require restrictions be imposed whenever the domestic industry is not viable."
1987.87-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,352.583,354.594,I'm still not quite sure I've got an answer to my question.
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,373.097,374.078,I understand.
1987.87-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,374.078,376.469,Which if either of those two positions did you take in the trial court?
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,376.469,380.062,I'm not sure what position we've taken up to this point.
1987.87-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,381.281,382.753,I'm talking in opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment?
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,382.753,395.601,--Our position has been throughout that the statute requires an examination of the effects of restrictions and restrictions must be such as are necessary to insure the maintenance of a viable domestic uranium industry.
1987.87-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,397.113,409.21,"So you're saying that even if the restrictions might tend to improve the condition of the industry, they still would not be imposed unless they would have the ultimate benefit of making a non-viable industry viable?"
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,409.21,411.592,"Yes, we think that's correct."
1987.87-645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,470.651,489.982,"Mr. Merrill, on the meaning of viable question, it is a little hard to understand how a domestic industry could be available to meet national needs if it can't make any money."
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,489.982,501.54,"Yes, Your Honor, and in fact, one of the four factors that the Department of Energy looks at in determining whether or not the industry is viable are the financial resources of the industry."
1987.87-645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,505.062,515.17,"It just seems to be necessarily tied in if the companies simply can't make any money producing, how can they be available to meet national needs?"
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,515.17,517.02,"--We agree with that, Your Honor."
1987.87-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,569.784,583.084,So the reason for the non-viability determination by the Secretary is relevant to our consideration of this case and to the operation of the statute?
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,583.084,594.351,I don't think that the issue before this Court requires the Court to get into an analysis of the Secretary's reasoning about the effects of--
1987.87-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,594.351,596.702,"Not his reasoning, but his reasons."
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,596.702,611.361,"--Well, it requires of course that the Court consider the legal reasons that we're advancing for the proposition that Section 161(v) does not impose this automatic shutoff whenever the domestic industry is not viable."
1987.87-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,611.361,612.072,No.
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,629.874,632.045,"Yes, in that case it would, Your Honor."
1987.87-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,632.045,641.912,And so then it follows that the reasons that the Secretary gives for the non-viability determination should be consulted in determining the operation of the statute.
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,641.912,643.963,"We agree with that, Your Honor."
1987.87-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,693.394,700.82,"Well, should the case go back or should we assess the viability report here and say the statute cannot possibly operate."
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,701.691,702.21,No.
1987.87-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.334,777.12,"My problem, Mr. Merrill, is that to some extent, my determination of what the statute means when it says that they will provide it if necessary to assure the viability, depends to some extent upon what I think the statute means by viability."
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,790.758,799.436,"As best I recollect, the dispute that was raised in Count V of the Complaint in this case was a very narrow one."
1987.87-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,859.844,874.464,"Yes, but I'm still not sure if you're saying the statute does not operate here because of what was said in the report or because the ultimate finding of non-viability was made."
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,886.081,894.546,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that the issue before the Court is whether or not restrictions should now be imposed on domestic uranium."
1987.87-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,936.254,937.866,So you're asking for a remand?
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,937.866,938.835,Yes.
1987.87-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,945.64,961.722,"Has the Department's view of the necessity or propriety of restrictions, has that view always been held by the Department, or did it at one time have a different view?"
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,961.722,979.413,"We think that the Department and its predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, have always articulated a consistent vision of Section 161(v) which is that the statute requires an examination of the effects of restriction on the domestic industry."
1987.87-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,980.773,982.533,"Well, that isn't really my real question, is it."
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1007.321,1017.117,"--Well, in an appropriate case, if the Department found that the domestic industry was not viable and that restrictions would return it to viability and assure its viability, of course restrictions would be required."
1987.87-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.557,1019.288,"All right, all right."
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1026.734,1029.686,We are unaware of any statement that is inconsistent with what you just said.
1987.87-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.686,1036.872,And when did the rulemaking take place in this case?
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1036.872,1040.334,The rulemaking?
1987.87-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1040.334,1041.554,The current regulations.
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1041.554,1047.29,The current enrichment criteria were reconsidered in 1986.
1987.87-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.29,1049.401,Was that after the District Court action?
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1049.401,1052.312,It occurred in the middle of the District Court proceedings.
1987.87-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1057.975,1062.387,"Well, did the rule when it was made merely reflect what the practice had been before?"
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1062.387,1069.333,The 1986 rulemaking took a position which is completely consistent with the position which has been taken in this litigation.
1987.87-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1069.333,1073.998,"Well, that isn't did it just reflect what the prior practice was, or not?"
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1073.998,1084.103,The 1986 rulemaking retained in effect the enrichment criteria which had been in effect before.
1987.87-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1092.749,1093.94,Was that by a rule or?
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1093.94,1094.749,--That was by regulation.
1987.87-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.108,1142.64,"Well, as they phased out the restrictions, the industry went downhill."
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1142.64,1149.225,"Justice White, the industry really suffered a precipitous decline in the early 1980s."
1987.87-645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1149.225,1151.786,Partly caused by the removal of restrictions or?
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1151.786,1154.989,We think that really it had virtually nothing to do with the removal of restrictions.
1987.87-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.464,1293.699,"May I go back historically in the period before say in 1979, is it generally understood the industry was viable?"
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1293.699,1295.991,"I think, yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1304.936,1321.749,"Well, if it was viable then, and your test of viability doesn't depend on profits but rather on capacity, what happened to decrease the capacity of the industry to serve the possible national needs in the event that we had to shut off imports?"
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1321.749,1329.453,"--Well, the initial determination of non-viability was made in 1985 with respect to 1984."
1987.87-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.745,1353.049,So it was a financial problem rather than a physical exhausting mines or anything of that kind.
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1353.049,1373.793,"The Secretary has found that there are sufficient economic reserves, and that for present needs there is sufficient production capacity but the concern is that because of the financial weakness of the industry that somewhere down the future, it will not have sufficient productive capacity in order to satisfy the needs of the domestic industry."
1987.87-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1373.793,1384.948,"What it means is, if and I'm not suggesting they should but if the Government were willing to subsidize production costs or something, there's no suggestion that there isn't the physical capacity to make the industry viable in the sense of being able then to supply them."
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1384.948,1389.042,The physical capacity in the sense of reserves or?
1987.87-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1403.572,1412.448,"Mr. Merrill, if you mean by viability what you say you mean by viability, I find it very implausible that Congress intended what you say it intended."
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1469.706,1479.751,"Justice Scalia, I think Congress when it enacted Section 161(v) was basically concerned about two things."
1987.87-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1531.626,1543.454,"By viable you mean can fullfil a hundred percent of our capacity, and it is an accurate description of your position to say, Congress wanted this industry to be subsidized if it could fullfil a hundred percent of our capacity."
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1556.343,1560.775,"Well, I don't know, a hundred percent, 95 percent."
1987.87-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1581.769,1582.72,"Well, make it 80."
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1587.152,1590.955,--I think it's fair to say that Congress in 1964 thought that this tool would do the job.
1987.87-645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1610.227,1615.412,"--Well, Mr. Merrill, why isn't profitability part and parcel of viability?"
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1615.412,1618.063,"--It is, Justice O'Connor, financial resources."
1987.87-645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1618.063,1620.786,"Well, why wasn't that your answer to Justice Scalia?"
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1625.028,1628.37,"It is part of the inquiry, absolutely."
1987.87-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1642.761,1644.982,That's not my problem.
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1665.826,1669.358,"All I can say, Justice Scalia, is--"
1987.87-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.358,1670.168,"Is, yes."
1987.87-645,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1670.168,1675.31,--Is that I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
1987.87-645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1675.31,1678.963,"Thank you, Mr. Merrill."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,1680.996,1684.566,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1987.87-645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1775.605,1781.829,"Well, they had undertaken to make it."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,1784.852,1791.476,"The rulemaking proceedings, Justice White, commenced after the filing of the summary judgment and in the midst of the litigation."
1987.87-645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.078,1813.141,"Yes, but how about the prior practice?"
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,1813.141,1816.324,"The prior practice, Justice White, is--"
1987.87-645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1816.324,1827.851,"I would suppose that the Department said to the Congress, we'll watch over the industry, we'll impose restrictions if it is going down the tubes."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,1840.468,1842.732,--Not at all.
1987.87-645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1842.732,1844.642,"Well, that's what I want to know about."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,1844.642,1853.918,"In 1981, the Department explained that restrictions would impact its enrichment enterprise."
1987.87-645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.536,2028.202,What do you think the legal affect of what Congress did is?
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2044.945,2046.645,"I think that's correct, Justice White."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2051.687,2052.358,Don't defer.
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2052.358,2053.139,--Don't defer.
1987.87-645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2073.172,2077.773,Is there some legislative history about that statute or--
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2077.773,2079.175,"I don't believe so, Justice White."
1987.87-645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.763,2091.555,--Well considered.
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2091.555,2093.805,As well considered as most matters.
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2093.805,2098.868,Precisely what is the statutory provision that was enacted in 1986?
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2098.868,2101.8,The statutory provision--
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2101.8,2106.103,I don't mean the legislative history of the conference report but exactly what was enacted into law.
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2106.103,2111.046,--What was enacted into law--
1987.87-645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2111.046,2118.221,And where do we find it in the materials before us.
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2124.296,2139.055,"--It's in our Brief in Opposition and notwithstanding the effectiveness of the criteria,--"
1987.87-645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2139.055,2140.185,Where are you reading?
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2140.185,2145.269,--This is in 2A of the Respondent's Brief in Opposition.
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2164.831,2167.844,"Well, I was interested in the precise language that was enacted into law."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2167.844,2171.136,"Right, Your Honor But notwithstanding--"
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2171.136,2172.425,Now you're reading from page 2?
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2172.425,2173.196,--2A.
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2173.196,2173.927,2A.
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2173.927,2179.441,Down at the bottom.
1987.87-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.423,2214.233,It seems to me like Congress just wanted to duck responsibility.
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2224.942,2229.213,"These are the criteria, Justice White, that announce for the first time--"
1987.87-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.213,2230.054,In the rulemaking.
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2230.054,2236.687,"--in the rulemaking that the Department will not, in effect, impose the requirements of Section 161(v)."
1987.87-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2236.687,2240.561,It seems they won't take a position one way or another whether they're right or wrong.
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2240.561,2261.103,"I think it sustains our position because in effect when the Department for the first time over this long history of the statute put forward an interpretation which I suggest is not revealed in any of the legislative or administrative history, that Congress did not permit those criteria to go into effect."
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2270.44,2284.679,"I would have some doubt as to whether Congress had spoken very clearly in a continuing resolution appropriating money, we ought to defer to that speaking when it's talking about a particular case."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2292.446,2306.985,"Well, the reason it's important, Chief Justice Rehnquist, is that under 161(v), if the Congress had not taken this action under the terms of Section 161(v), the criteria would have become effective."
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2306.985,2316.67,"What if Congress says in an appropriations resolution, we want the Supreme Court to affirm the Tenth Circuit in a particular case?"
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2320.723,2324.095,Such weight as the Court believes it deserves.
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2325.776,2327.098,"Well, you're like Congress."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2327.098,2333.132,"--Mr. Chief Justice, this Court interprets the law."
1987.87-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2354.975,2356.146,"Well, not any more."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2372.998,2374.52,"I don't believe so, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2389.23,2392.101,They should have put it in the statute if they wanted it to have that effect.
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2409.623,2431.125,"I think it important, it bears on this question to review the Young case because the position taken by the Government I think is inconsistent with the decision of the Court in the Young case."
1987.87-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2480.249,2483.852,Could I ask you about your interpretation of viability?
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2504.324,2526.158,"Justice Scalia, I think it means both, but most importantly, it means the ability of the domestic uranium industry in times of total disruption, that is, a cut off of foreign uranium, to meet the civilian and military requirements of this country."
1987.87-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2553.876,2558.208,"So you agree with the Government, then, essentially, as to what viability means?"
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2558.208,2562.742,"--I think there's agreement on that point, yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.792,2682.149,"Well, you say we shouldn't defer to their judgment at all in this case."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2687.956,2720.076,"Well, I think, Justice White, the Court will find when it looks at the July 1986 rule that there's more attention paid by the Department of Energy to free trade, on non-proliferation, on the status of its enrichment enterprise, on the impact of imposing restrictions on various alleged GATT problems that the Department had rather than on the focus of the industry."
1987.87-645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.076,2735.925,"Well, maybe, but are you submitting here that the language of the statute with respect to restrictions just can't be read as the Department does?"
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2741.669,2744.17,We do not believe it's a defensible reading.
1987.87-645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2745.893,2749.564,"I know you think there's another better one, but do you think it's even defensible?"
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2749.564,2751.565,"--We don't believe it's defensible, Your Honor."
1987.87-645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.714,2790.251,"Well, but it does say that you are to impose those restrictions which are necessary to assure the viability of the domestic industry."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2791.951,2793.073,"It says that, Your Honor."
1987.87-645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2793.073,2812.735,"And the Department sits down and says, well, there's no number of restrictions, we can't think of any restrictions that would assure the viability of the domestic industry, and so we can't think of any that would even be necessary."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2815.177,2817.61,"I don't think they say that exactly, Justice White."
1987.87-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2851.401,2858.596,"Let me just be sure, let's focus on the statutory language for a minute."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2875.576,2877.197,That is our position.
1987.87-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2877.197,2889.245,"But then how do you get around the language that the purpose of the restriction is to create or maintain... they use the word, maintain... to create what does not now exist."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2904.004,2912.101,"First of all, Justice Stevens, I don't believe the Department contends that the restrictions are not necessary."
1987.87-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2923.338,2926.12,But viability is not in doubt in this case.
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2926.12,2929.603,"--Well, the Department should have imposed these restrictions some years ago."
1987.87-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.603,2931.042,"Well, maybe so, but--"
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2931.042,2942.91,"There is non-viability, and as the Tenth Circuit said, restrictions must be imposed going up to 100 percent until the industry is restored."
1987.87-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2947.893,2951.646,"--No, but you still haven't dealt with the problem I presented to you."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2959.372,2964.465,"--Then it is our position, Justice Stevens, that the Department must take that argument to the Congress."
1987.87-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2964.465,2969.417,"But the statute just says, I don't see how you get within the language of the statute."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2994.464,3002.239,What we're saying is that Congress assumed in 1964 that these restrictions would work.
1987.87-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3003.5,3008.884,"Well, you may be dead right that they shouldn't have taken off the restrictions, but that's past history now."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,3015.178,3024.873,"--Justice Stevens, Congress equipped the Department with the powers that could assure the viability of the industry."
1987.87-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3047.71,3048.889,Necessary to do what?
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,3048.889,3050.771,--Necessary to assure the viability of the industry.
1987.87-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3053.183,3054.923,Necessary to assure an unattainable goal.
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,3054.923,3065.462,"--Well, the unattainable goal that the Department talks about, Justice Stevens, is this 100 percent meeting of the civilian and military needs of the country."
1987.87-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3067.172,3069.593,Which you agree is the correct definition of viability.
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,3069.593,3072.885,--Absolutely.
1987.87-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3111.22,3132.475,"Actually, if I understand your position, I think I understand it even less than Justice Stevens does, because you're not just saying that if you can't make a hundred percent of total needs or 80 percent, pick your number, you still have to keep subsidizing."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,3157.869,3160.042,That's correct.
1987.87-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3160.042,3164.405,"We've got a clash of very difficult positions, here."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,3164.405,3166.175,"I believe so, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3166.175,3171.981,"I must say, I think you read the words, to the extent necessary, etcetera, out of the statute."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,3176.573,3187.61,It is our reading of the statute that Congress has made the determination that these restrictions are necessary and that they must be imposed.
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3187.61,3191.303,"Well, then why did they give the agency any discretion?"
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,3191.303,3196.134,They gave the discretion to the agency to determine what limitations should be imposed.
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3212.156,3218.071,"When you say, necessary, it means necessary in aid of some end."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,3230.35,3235.692,--The objective is obviously the viability of the industry.
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3235.692,3237.171,Which is a hundred percent?
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,3237.171,3239.885,I don't believe it's a hundred percent.
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3239.885,3240.745,"Well, then what is it?"
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,3240.745,3260.559,"There's no fixed percentage on it under the Department's determination but it is enough so that if there were to be a disruption in the imports of foreign uranium, this nation could be assured that the domestic industry was viable enough to meet the nation's needs."
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3260.559,3271.275,"But I thought a minute ago you said that even though the subsidies would accomplish not even raising it from 27 percent to 28 percent, they still would have to be allotted."
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,3271.275,3281.41,"In our view, Congress made the determination that these subsidies would work to assure the viability of the industry, and that other powers--"
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3281.41,3285.754,"Well, why would there be any hearing as to whether the subsidies ought to be imposed?"
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,3288.767,3298.614,"--In our view, Your Honor, when the Department concedes non-viability based on the criteria that are set forth in the 1982 amendments--"
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3298.614,3300.464,Then subsidies are automatic.
1987.87-645,1,38197,peter_j_nickles,,3300.464,3303.085,--That triggers the requirement to impose restrictions.
1987.87-645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3305.587,3307.878,"Thank you, Mr. Nickles."
1987.87-645,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3310.542,3325.491,"A good deal of the discussion here is focused on questions like what is the proper definition of viability and will the restrictions work or won't they work, and whether the 1986 criteria were proper or improper."
1987.87-645,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3384.749,3395.477,Would you say that the Department could have decided to impose a hundred percent restrictions even though the industry was not viable?
1987.87-645,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3397.708,3402.8,--The Department has a mandatory--
1987.87-645,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3402.8,3411.635,"Because if it is, if it isn't contrary to the statute, then the language of the statute just doesn't compel your result."
1987.87-645,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3411.635,3418.491,"--Your question, I take it is, even if we have no duty to impose, do we still have the authority to impose?"
1987.87-645,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3418.491,3419.713,Yes.
1987.87-645,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3419.713,3422.645,That I think is a close question.
1987.87-645,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3425.877,3440.386,"Well, if it's only close, I take it you think that arguably the language of the statute could be read as your opposition suggests."
1987.87-645,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3440.386,3441.014,No.
1987.87-645,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3451.252,3466.433,"Well, I know, but if the Department could impose the restrictions even though the industry is not viable, you're saying they could impose the restrictions even though they would do no good whatsoever, even though they would not restore viability."
1987.87-645,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3466.433,3467.883,I said it was a close question.
1987.87-645,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3481.172,3482.192,"Thank you, Mr. Merrill."
