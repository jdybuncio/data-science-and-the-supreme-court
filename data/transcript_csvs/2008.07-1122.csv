2008.07-1122,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.154,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1122, Arizona v. Johnson."
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,8.37,24.965,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner asks that this Court apply the principles established in Pennsylvania v. Mimms to uphold the pat-down search of a vehicle passenger seized during a lawful traffic stop."
2008.07-1122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,60.222,65.09,I -- I didn't hear your -- your first -- in your opening.
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,70.128,70.694,"No, no."
2008.07-1122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,72.446,75.232,"I'm sure it wasn't, but I -- I missed what you said on that point."
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,75.232,85.92,What I said is that Mimms establishes that a pat down is justified in the context of a traffic stop if the officer believes that the driver is armed and dangerous.
2008.07-1122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,85.92,86.872,Thank you.
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,86.872,87.489,Correct.
2008.07-1122,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,87.489,101.447,"Do you agree that there's a point in an interaction that begins with a traffic stop, begins with a seizure, at which the nature of that interaction is changed so that it's no longer -- so that it becomes a consensual interaction and--"
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,101.447,103.632,"That -- yes, Chief Justice."
2008.07-1122,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,115.04,117.142,--Maybe I should rephrase the question.
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,128.466,130.649,"No, I disagree with that, Your Honor."
2008.07-1122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,160.236,164.622,"So -- so in your view, or I suppose the government's view -- well, I'll let the government argue for itself."
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,183.667,190.44,--If -- if the officer possesses articulable facts that this person is immediately dangerous to that officer.
2008.07-1122,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.44,193.809,Then you're doing away with the first Terry factor altogether.
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,208.318,224.244,"Well, the first prong of the Terry analysis, Justice Ginsburg, is whether the officer's action is justified at its inception, and one way that it may be justified is if the officer possesses suspicion that criminal activity is afoot."
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,236.819,246.091,"Of course, for a Terry -- for a Terry pat down you don't need, do you, articulable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous?"
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,260.267,263.303,"I believe that's what Terry says, that you--"
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,263.303,265.238,Both armed and dangerous?
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,265.238,266.138,--Yes.
2008.07-1122,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,266.138,283.7,"Well, in your view if an officer was going down the street and he saw an individual as to whom he had no suspicion that a crime was being committed, had been or was about to be, but he said that -- that guy looks like -- like trouble for anybody who has anything to do with him."
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,295.024,307.482,"Well, he would also have to possess articulable reasons that a prudently -- a reasonably prudent person would be satisfied with that this person is an immediate danger to him."
2008.07-1122,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,307.482,313.402,What if the individual gives him -- gives him mean looks and he has a bulge of something on his hip?
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,313.402,317.123,"Well, that -- that could very well support a pat down."
2008.07-1122,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,317.123,320.492,Then you are doing away with the first Terry factor.
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,348.575,357.931,"What -- what I'm suggesting, Justice Ginsburg, is that the first prong of Terry is much broader than just suspicion of criminal activity."
2008.07-1122,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,357.931,362.485,"No, but in my hypothesis, there was nothing that would satisfy the first prong of Terry."
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,392.754,422.523,"Well, what I'm suggesting, Justice Souter, is that in the officer's community caretaking function, the officer is authorized to approach an individual that he -- he thinks is trouble, and in the course of asking neutral questions, if the officer believes that this person is immediately dangerous to the officer, then a pat down would be appropriate in that instance."
2008.07-1122,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,423.725,442.021,"Doesn't the officer need -- need justification for a stop, for a Fourth Amendment seizure, whether because of a traffic violation or because of suspicion of criminal activity and then, in addition to that, reason to believe that the person is dangerous?"
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,442.021,443.304,--In almost--
2008.07-1122,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,443.304,445.473,I thought that would be -- I thought that was your argument.
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,445.473,447.507,"--Well, that's--"
2008.07-1122,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,447.507,453.744,"In the context of a traffic stop, you don't need -- as to the passenger and the driver, you don't need suspicion of criminal activity."
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,462.184,482.146,"--What -- what I'm saying, Justice Alito, is that in this particular case we certainly have a legitimate stop, and under Brendlin we -- we also know that the passenger is seized during a reasonably routine traffic stop until the passenger is released."
2008.07-1122,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,532.411,540.017,But Officer Trevizo herself testified that she thought the seizure part was over.
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,553.194,554.36,Well--
2008.07-1122,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,554.36,569.62,"That after the initial seizure was over, and then she wanted to question him about gang -- his gang affiliations -- and didn't she testify?"
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,574.857,579.142,--She said that he could have refused to get out of the car.
2008.07-1122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,634.479,649.222,"I guess what you're saying is that if there is a -- a stop of the passenger and an interrogation of the passenger, the passenger can't say, incidentally, this is consensual, and thereby avoid a pat down?"
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,649.222,649.739,Correct.
2008.07-1122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,651.373,659.094,And -- and it seems to me there is some indication that that's what happened here if you credit the police officer's testimony.
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,659.094,659.879,--Right.
2008.07-1122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,661.229,671.152,"In other words, you can have consent within the -- the context of a stop that has not yet ceased."
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,671.152,672.037,--Correct.
2008.07-1122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,692.767,710.146,"May I ask if your -- your view of the law that, if the officer is pretty sure that the -- the -- that the person he's having a consensual encounter with has a gun -- he could see the bulge or something -- is that sufficient or does he have to have some proof the -- that the person is about to use the gun?"
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,710.146,726.006,"It would be -- in the context of a traffic stop, because of all the unknowns that an officer must face, a bulge is usually sufficient to justify a pat down."
2008.07-1122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.006,728.191,What about just meeting on -- on the street?
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,744.133,751.473,"In that instance, it may be the prudent course to at least ask whether the person is armed."
2008.07-1122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,753.439,754.258,What if he says yes?
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,754.258,761.495,"--Well, then the officer could ask something along the lines of whether he has a permit to carry a gun."
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.986,778.206,"Well, but I -- I thought you said that there has to be an articulable suspicion that he is armed and dangerous."
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,778.206,778.74,--Right--
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,778.74,786.194,"A bulge would not be enough to conduct a pat down after a Terry stop, therefore."
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,786.194,788.146,--That -- that's exactly -- exactly what I'm--
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,788.146,792.383,"Well, then why should it be enough to -- to justify a pat down here?"
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,792.383,795.918,"--Well, because -- well, there was no bulge in this case."
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.322,801.772,"No, I understand."
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,803.922,805.124,Okay.
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.326,809.843,Okay.
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,815.063,815.68,Right.
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,815.68,817.765,"--an articulable basis for the belief, right?"
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,817.765,818.665,Yes.
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.665,823.402,So I don't see why a bulge alone would -- would satisfy--
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,823.402,831.341,"Well, in Mimms it was just a bulge in the -- the driver's jacket that justified the pat down."
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.723,871.983,--We have a whole separate line of cases apart from the Terry stop cases which allow officers to protect themselves by conducting a search of the surrounding area when they arrest somebody.
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,876.87,877.906,Yes.
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,877.906,882.024,Whether or not they think that -- that he's about to -- to draw the gun and shoot them.
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,882.024,883.124,Correct.
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.726,888.845,Why wouldn't that line of cases be extendable to this kind of a situation?
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,888.845,902.021,"--Well, it's a matter of, during a traffic stop -- Brendlin even says that officers must be able to exercise unquestioned command of the situation."
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,902.021,921.149,"Why -- why during a traffic stop shouldn't they be able to ensure their own safety by -- by patting down the people who have been stopped, whether or not they have an articulable suspicion that they are about to draw and shoot?"
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,924.685,930.589,"Well, what I'm proposing is the -- the standard Terry test, that--"
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,930.589,931.374,Yes.
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,931.374,934.576,--the suspicion must be that they're armed and dangerous.
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.576,943.098,Why -- why go the Terry route instead of the route that -- that covers search of the area around the person who is arrested?
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,943.098,950.585,"Well, I believe that this -- the facts of this case fall pretty much under Terry."
2008.07-1122,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,987.46,989.643,When -- when did this end?
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,1010.641,1024.05,"--That's the normal situation, and usually that's the analysis that bears on whether the driver has given valid consent to a search of the automobile or something like that."
2008.07-1122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1035.041,1035.874,General Parkhurst--
2008.07-1122,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1035.874,1039.493,--Then how did the -- how did the officer come up with the marijuana as well as the gun?
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,1039.493,1046.332,"Well, because once he was arrested for the gun, then they did a search incident to arrest."
2008.07-1122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1046.332,1053.07,"--General Parkhurst, I -- I seem to be a little confused about the facts of this case."
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,1069.781,1071.281,She did not--
2008.07-1122,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.281,1075.249,"There seems some tension between being both in danger and saying, well, the arrest was all over."
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,1075.249,1078.518,"--No, she -- she did."
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1108.906,1116.326,Why -- why had this descended from a -- a seizure to a post-seizure consensual encounter?
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,1118.595,1123.166,"Well, we're arguing that the seizure was not over."
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.166,1132.188,"Well, it seems to me you're -- you're acknowledging that she said that it was a purely -- you're not arguing it as based on a purely consensual encounter?"
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,1133.222,1133.538,No.
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1141.544,1142.344,--Even though she said so?
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,1142.344,1147.531,"--Correct, because we don't have to necessarily take her word for that."
2008.07-1122,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.531,1148.114,Okay.
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,1148.114,1149.347,That's a -- that's a legal--
2008.07-1122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1149.347,1150.649,The white light is on.
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,1162.041,1162.841,--I -- well--
2008.07-1122,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1162.841,1167.076,"If the officer believes that a person is armed and might be dangerous, then they can pat down."
2008.07-1122,0,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,1169.528,1171.563,--We believe that that is true.
2008.07-1122,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1193.493,1194.428,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1199.999,1206.57,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The decision in this case should be reversed for one of two independent reasons."
2008.07-1122,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1241.659,1252.682,Do you agree that there is a point at which the encounter initiated by the traffic stop changes in some way that a pat down is no longer justified?
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1252.682,1258.103,"--We certainly agree, Mr. Chief Justice, that at some point the encounter is over, and that if it's in fact not over, the--"
2008.07-1122,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1258.103,1263.573,"Well, if the encounter is -- by ""the encounter is over"", do you mean that they separate; they're no longer together?"
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1274.297,1278.082,--We agree that at some point a seizure can morph into a consensual encounter.
2008.07-1122,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1297.413,1305.334,"I suppose there's an argument, anyway, that even though the initial seizure is over, the consensual encounter continues."
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1312.255,1318.843,"Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, and that's our -- the second argument, which is at the end of the day, we don't think it matters whether he's seized."
2008.07-1122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1326.647,1337.038,"Let me ask you -- suppose it's a roadside encounter in which the driver is changing a flat tire and the officer stops and wants to talk to him for a while and then he suddenly thinks, well, maybe this guy's armed."
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1339.74,1343.942,"--Well, I guess the first thing I want to say, Justice Stevens, is it's not okay to think maybe he might be armed."
2008.07-1122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.144,1348.012,"Well, maybe he has an articulable suspicion."
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1348.012,1348.545,Okay.
2008.07-1122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1351.88,1354.832,Is that any different from meeting somebody on the -- on the street corner?
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1354.832,1357.034,--It is different in the sense that--
2008.07-1122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1357.034,1359.486,The flat -- my flat tire example.
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1359.486,1364.022,"--It is different because it's a roadside encounter, and this Court has recognized again and again and again--"
2008.07-1122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.022,1367.14,But those are roadside encounters after a traffic violation.
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1367.14,1376.663,"--I -- I agree with you, Justice Stevens, which is why at the end of the day we don't -- we think that the officer, in basically those facts, should be able to perform a frisk on the street as well."
2008.07-1122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1380.317,1382.717,So you don't rely at all on the fact this is a traffic stop?
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1382.717,1384.602,--We do rely on the fact--
2008.07-1122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1384.602,1385.752,"On your second point, that is."
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1385.752,1389.505,"--We think this case is substantially easier because it's a traffic stop, because this--"
2008.07-1122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1389.505,1390.389,Why is it easier?
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1390.389,1394.457,--Because this Court has recognized again and -- let me give you the example of Wilson.
2008.07-1122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1401.063,1405.432,"Yes, but those are all cases in which there's a violation of law that preceded the activity."
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1405.432,1406.099,I--
2008.07-1122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1406.099,1413.371,I asked you about cases in which there's nothing other than the officer's interest in patting down the guy because he thinks he has a gun.
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1413.371,1422.661,"--Justice Stevens, I think Wilson is highly significant in this regard, because the Court went out of its way in Wilson to point out that there's no reason to suspect a passenger with any illegal activity at all."
2008.07-1122,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1428.547,1429.464,"No, I disagree with that."
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1438.403,1441.538,"--Justice Kennedy, I guess I would say we disagree with this."
2008.07-1122,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1456.734,1460.519,"Well, even -- even if that's true, why don't we accept Mimms with the gloss of Brendlin?"
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1460.519,1468.624,"--We think that Brendlin is of course absolutely correct, and we think the passenger was seized, and we think fundamentally that's why this case is fairly easy."
2008.07-1122,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1468.624,1471.993,"But you say -- your brief goes much, much further."
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1521.926,1535.834,"Justice Ginsburg, we agree that that is ultimately the correct Fourth Amendment rule, but what we're saying is that the Court doesn't need to decide whether it agrees with us on this point -- that point, excuse me, to resolve this case, because there are two very important distinctions between this case and that one."
2008.07-1122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1562.567,1567.888,"Yes, but you'd apply the same rule if the -- if the officer just stopped to help the guy change his tire."
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1567.888,1584.417,"--We do think that at the end of the day, Justice Stevens, the overriding command of the Fourth Amendment is that a police officer's conduct must be judged by a reasonableness standard, and we think that overriding command allows police officers to take limited and appropriate steps to protect their own safety."
2008.07-1122,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1584.417,1617.304,"But I take it, if I understood your earlier answer, you would extend the application of the rule as you understand it to the encounter simply on the sidewalk by a police officer who has no suspicion that the individual he wants to talk to has been, is, or is about to commit a crime, but if the -- if the officer chooses to initiate the conversation, he then, in effect, if he can articulate any suspicion, like we'll say the dirty look and the bulge on the side, he can go ahead and -- and pat down."
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1618.121,1620.273,"At the end of the day, Justice Souter, that is our view."
2008.07-1122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.849,1638.301,May I ask you if the Department of Justice has ever taken this position before?
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1638.301,1641.769,"I'm not aware of whether we've had to take this position before, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-1122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1641.769,1642.705,I'm asking you whether you have.
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1645.657,1653.394,"I'm not aware of whether we've taken this position or not in any previous case, because I'm not aware of any case that raises the issue that's raised by the going up to someone on the street hypothetical."
2008.07-1122,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1682.913,1705.612,"Well, there's something fundamentally wrong probably about that, but the -- the -- I think the problem that sort of drives the questioning is that if you extend the rule as far as you want to extend it, we have to take into consideration that the standard of articulable suspicion is the standard that, in practical terms, can pretty well always be met."
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1716.118,1719.403,"Well, I -- I certainly would add, Justice Souter, that it has to be a reasonable person."
2008.07-1122,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1725.741,1731.961,"Yes, but what the officer cites is going to be a matter of fact, and the facts at that point are gone."
2008.07-1122,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1761.98,1773.622,"Well, I -- I guess, Justice Souter, to the extent you're concerned about that, I would say the same thing is true about whether you have articulable suspicion of criminal activity, and the Court has decided that that risk is worth, you know, dealing with under the context of that question."
2008.07-1122,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1804.407,1805.343,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1814.615,1837.73,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the other side made clear that its principal argument is that Terry should be revisited and that the two tests that Terry prescribed for a pat-down search, that there be reasonable suspicion -- a crime is afoot and reasonable suspicion of armed and dangerous be revised so that all that is required for a pat-down search is the second Terry standard."
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1838.28,1843.384,What if -- we've been talking about the officer approaching somebody on the street who has the bulge in his pocket.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1852.84,1855.025,"--No, I don't think so, Your Honor."
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1857.476,1863.029,This is -- this is like the rule in the Old West that the sheriff has to wait for the defendant to draw first?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1863.029,1878.641,"--No, I think the officer can -- if -- I think it's important to make clear that the sliver of cases we're dealing with here are cases where there is a reasonable suspicion of armed and dangerousness but not a reasonable suspicion that crime -- criminal activity is afoot."
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1878.641,1880.757,So in response to my--
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1880.757,1881.426,If there really is--
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1881.426,1882.659,--One moment.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1896.185,1904.006,"--If he reasonably believes he could be shot, Your Honor, then probably there is reasonable suspicion of criminal -- that criminal activity may be afoot because he'll have--"
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1904.006,1910.426,"No, no, let's just say it's like this case: The guy coming up -- he's wearing the colors of the -- of the Crips gang, and he has a bulge in his pocket."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1927.288,1932.526,"--Well, Your Honor, I think this goes a little bit to Justice Souter's comment in the first part of the argument."
2008.07-1122,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1949.987,1964.663,But that's not what Mr. -- Mr. Parkhurst said in his opening that the traffic stop is the equivalent of the articulable suspicion that a crime was afoot.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1989.078,2001.77,"I -- I think that you're right, Justice Ginsburg, that's the second argument that they make, and -- and our answer to that argument is that we don't think that Mr. Johnson was seized at the time the pat down occurred, as the court of appeals here found."
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2010.509,2011.811,Can we pursue that for a minute?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2018.798,2020.249,--Yes.
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2020.249,2042.747,"And my -- my question which -- which goes to who's right about whether the seizure -- the legitimate seizure had stopped and the consensual encounter had begun, my question is what is it beyond the conclusory statement of the officer that in effect justifies drawing that conclusion, that the stop was over?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2042.747,2044.865,"Well, a couple of things, Your Honor."
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2052.721,2055.923,Do we know -- do we have any evidence about duration here?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2055.923,2065.545,"--We don't have any duration, but the question -- but I think an important question is does the seizure of the passenger necessarily in all cases coextend with the seizure of the driver?"
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2092.213,2105.087,"My -- my problem in this case, I guess, in taking your position is I don't think we have got an evidentiary basis to conclude that what we start by assuming is a legitimate stop has in fact run its course."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2106.855,2107.672,"--Well, Let me tick off some--"
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2107.672,2108.305,That's what I'm getting at.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2108.305,2109.824,"--the factors that we -- we rely on, Your Honor."
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2147.916,2151.634,"Well, then, in other words, you -- you are -- I -- I'll be candid with you."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2183.605,2186.557,--We're not relying entirely on -- on what I just said.
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2187.274,2189.093,"Well, I think -- I think you're rejecting it, aren't you?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2189.093,2191.628,"--No, we're not relying -- we're rejecting that assumption."
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2204.453,2205.053,Okay.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2206.055,2224.266,"--Well, basically there was this interaction separate from the interaction with the driver to the extent the passenger -- Brendlin says the passenger, one of the reasons the passenger would feel that he or she is seized is because of his or her relationship to the driver and to the stop here."
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2225.549,2226.382,Are you saying--
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2226.382,2226.884,--proceeded separately.
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2226.884,2253.452,"--Are you saying if there's -- if there's a driver and a passenger and there are two police officers, and one police officer is dealing with the driver, saying, you know, where's your insurance papers and so on, and at the same time the other officer is questioning the -- the passenger, are you saying that that independent questioning of the passenger in effect eliminates the -- the passenger's seizure as -- as following from the seizure of the driver?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2253.452,2258.254,"I think it's -- I think it's part -- as the lower court found here, it's part -- it's a relevant circumstance."
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2265.593,2266.293,I -- I don't get it.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2295.129,2301.1,--To the extent -- I think the question here is what's -- one question is what's communicated to the passenger.
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2301.1,2301.567,Yes.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2301.567,2321.513,"If the officer had said in terms, would you mind stepping out of the car so I can ask you some questions unrelated to the stop about your hometown, it seems to us that that statement by the officer would provide some pretty strong indication that the seizure was over and that this was a separate investigation, having nothing to do with the seizure."
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2321.513,2339.225,"But we accept as hornbook law when they are -- when the police are -- are questioning one individual whom they've stopped, let's say for a traffic violation, that during that period of seizure, the reasonable period of seizure, the officer can ask questions about other subjects, and that doesn't end the seizure."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2339.225,2340.641,"Well, the--"
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2340.641,2341.825,So why should--
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2341.825,2342.343,--The Court has said that the officer--
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2342.343,2343.477,--it be any different for the passenger?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2343.477,2345.629,--The Court has said that the officer can ask those questions.
2008.07-1122,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2364.34,2391.074,"I don't want to -- I don't want to take up your whole argument on this hobbyhorse of mine, but I mean my -- my only problem is I don't see that we have got an evidentiary basis here to say that, because of the duration or the mere fact of the questioning, there is a reason to say that as to the passenger, a reasonable passenger could say, I am no longer seized, and -- and this encounter is totally consensual."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2397.395,2398.764,It is subjective.
2008.07-1122,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2431.151,2442.357,"And then don't you lose under that line of cases, Bostick and -- this is the picture that the officer was painting, or I thought it was, to bring this within the"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2446.725,2447.091,--Right.
2008.07-1122,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2447.091,2447.993,So he says yes.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2465.353,2473.542,"I think it's quite clear, Justice Ginsburg, that there's no question here that -- that there was a consent to the pat down."
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2507.631,2509.665,"You're giving up a shield here, I take it?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2517.571,2525.077,"--Well, you know, Berkemer says, in the context even of a -- of a traffic seizure, Miranda warnings aren't necessarily necessary."
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2548.442,2556.529,What are the facts that show that a reasonable person in the passenger's position would have believed himself free to terminate the encounter?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2556.529,2559.048,"I'm sorry, Justice Breyer--"
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2559.048,2562.6,"What are the facts that show that the person who was searched, what's his name?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2564.302,2564.818,--Yes.
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2564.818,2572.058,"Well, what are the facts that suggest that he thought he was free to terminate that encounter with the police?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2572.058,2576.093,That the -- that the interaction with the officer had nothing to do with the subject of the stop.
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2576.093,2576.71,All right.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2593.221,2594.637,"Well, I--"
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2594.637,2595.589,I was lawfully stopped.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2598.625,2605.462,--That the officer herself believed that she had communicated the fact that the interaction was voluntary.
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2605.462,2607.397,"The question is, how did she do that?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2607.397,2608.047,Well--
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2608.047,2608.714,"She said,"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2610.064,2611.647,--She did not do it that way.
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2611.647,2612.08,No.

2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2650.853,2651.305,What's the fourth?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2653.038,2656.607,--I think we've gotten them all out onto the table.
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2656.607,2656.959,Okay.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2673.051,2674.587,"Well, Your Honor--"
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2674.587,2676.737,I -- can we not reverse that?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2676.737,2679.122,"--Well, Your Honor, a couple of things."
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2702.405,2718.247,"No, I'm saying if the question is whether the person reasonably thought at the time of the search he could leave, there's certainly a strong claim here that he could not reasonably or he did not reasonably think he could leave."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2743.315,2757.907,"Well, I -- I guess a couple of answers to that, Justice Breyer: First of all, if this is just a case about whether the lower court made a correct determination about whether there was a seizure or not, there's not -- maybe there's not much to the case."
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2786.207,2791.978,"Well, if you look at the first part of that, what somebody in Mr. Johnson's position would believe, how does he tell?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2836.24,2842.511,"--Well, I -- that may not be -- by itself, it may not be enough."
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2845.213,2845.83,"Well, what else?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2845.83,2863.242,"--Well, the fact that the officer believed, therefore her tone, we have to assume, the way she -- that she spoke in the way her subjective intent indicated, that she believed that what was going on here was a conversation in -- in an effort to get gang information--"
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2863.242,2866.526,He is supposed to assume that it's not about him because of her tone?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2866.526,2871.763,"--No, he was supposed to assume that -- that it was consensual because of her tone, because that's -- that was her intent."
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2871.763,2873.465,Suppose we go beyond.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2942.894,2968.677,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I think that -- first of all, a couple of reactions: First of all, I think that it is important, and I -- I alluded to this earlier, the -- the sliver of cases we're dealing with here are cases in which there is reasonable -- allegedly a reasonable suspicion that someone is armed and dangerous, but not reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot."
2008.07-1122,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2987.973,2991.709,"Mr. -- Mr. Pincus, I want to go back to the previous subject for a minute."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3007.152,3014.223,--That the -- the court of appeals here determined -- its decision rested on the fact that this was a consensual encounter.
2008.07-1122,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3014.223,3015.492,But that -- but that--
2008.07-1122,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3015.492,3019.36,"Now, in order to contradict that, would we have to find that that's clearly erroneous?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3019.36,3022.996,"Well, I think it's a mixed question of fact and law, Your Honor."
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3027.816,3029.834,Is there any dispute on the underlying facts?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3029.834,3031.184,--No--
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3031.184,3031.951,No.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3031.951,3033.036,--I don't think the underlying facts are disputed.
2008.07-1122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3033.036,3036.071,"Well, there is a dispute as to whether the man thought he was free to leave."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3038.205,3042.309,That is -- that is the disputed question: Whether -- or whether a reasonable person in his position--
2008.07-1122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3042.309,3042.742,Did he testify?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3042.742,3045.177,"--No, not at the suppression hearing."
2008.07-1122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3045.177,3048.963,So nobody asked him whether he thought he was free to leave -- which would have solved a lot of problems.
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3051.331,3056.569,Your hypothesis about why she -- why he was free to leave is because of the tone of the arresting officer?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3057.652,3062.889,"It's the totality of the circumstances: the tone of the officer, the fact it was in an urban area where there were some place to--"
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3062.889,3065.425,"--And there's no finding about the tone of the officer, right?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3065.425,3069.96,"--Well, the -- the officer herself testified about what her intent was."
2008.07-1122,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3075.363,3082.367,"Well, you keep emphasizing that this is an urban area, and it seems to me that's going to lead to a test that's impossible to administer."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3123.261,3127.081,"Well, Your Honor--"
2008.07-1122,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3127.081,3131.783,All of those things would -- you'd have to draw a line taking all of those things into account?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3131.783,3137.204,--It -- it would be a factual question in every case as it is in the typical Fourth Amendment arrest case about whether someone is seized.
2008.07-1122,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3138.171,3140.806,"--Well, we didn't think it was a factual question in -- in Brendlin."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3164.188,3166.04,"--No, Your Honor, I'm absolutely not."
2008.07-1122,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3174.229,3179.364,Brendlin says no passenger would like -- would feel free to leave during the course of the investigation.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3193.207,3198.777,"--Well, I mean, I think it -- it may depend upon the other facts in that -- in that situation, Your Honor."
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3199.327,3199.994,"Here, what are the facts?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3204.498,3205.498,--We don't know.
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3205.498,3206.281,We don't know.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3216.606,3218.675,"We -- we actually don't, Your Honor."
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3218.675,3219.358,We don't?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3219.358,3219.775,We don't.
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3225.245,3225.795,Yes.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3225.795,3227.864,We don't know how they -- how long they--
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3227.864,3230.164,"Well, is there any reason to think it was half an hour?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3230.164,3231.299,--We just don't know.
2008.07-1122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3233.767,3238.386,"Mr. Pincus, do you agree with your opponents that if you lose on the seizure issue, you lose?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3238.386,3256.514,"Well, Your Honor, we think if -- if there was a seizure, then -- then we think there is a second question, which is even if the person was seized, the -- it's not clear to us that the Court's precedents say that -- that that automatically permits a pat down on armed and dangerousness."
2008.07-1122,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3311.868,3333.348,"I guess what about -- I -- I guess if we held that you could do this, this pat-down search here, it would probably carry forward to any other kind of seizure like a -- a roadblock to inspect for drunken driving or anything like that?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3333.348,3335.3,"Well, that's -- that's part of the concern, Your Honor, that--"
2008.07-1122,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3335.3,3345.256,"We would say the same thing: That if there is a passenger in that car, you could tell the passenger to get out and conduct a pat-down search."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3345.256,3350.16,"--Yes, even though -- even though, again, there's no particularized suspicion about that passenger."
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3375.393,3383.031,"Why isn't the -- why isn't the ""seizure"" and the ""consensual"" aspect also mutually reinforcing but kind of blurring into each other?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3395.089,3402.194,I'm -- I'm not sure that I understand what you are -- what you are getting at in your -- in your question--
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3402.194,3411.55,"Well, you seem -- your argument assumes a fairly bright line between the point at which the individual is seized and the point at which the interaction becomes a consensual search."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3416.454,3420.839,--As it is blurry when the -- in the converse situation when the question is--
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3420.839,3421.572,No.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3434.563,3436.28,"--No, I'm talking about the Drayton situation, Your Honor."
2008.07-1122,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3459.761,3466.184,"You -- you don't concede in this case, or do you, that Trevizo had a reasonable suspicion that Johnson was armed and dangerous?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3468.034,3468.467,Absolutely not.
2008.07-1122,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3468.467,3468.934,--for purposes of--
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3468.934,3471.486,The lower court assumed it for the purposes of decision--
2008.07-1122,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3471.486,3474.755,"--So even if you do not prevail, we would have to remand on that point?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3474.755,3478.075,"--Yes, that point would have to be remanded so that the court below could address it."
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3512.98,3514.582,Is it lawful to possess a firearm?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3514.582,3516.8,--If you're a convicted felon?
2008.07-1122,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3517.184,3518.85,Was he a convicted felon?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3518.85,3521.636,He had admitted to the officer that he had engaged in burglary.
2008.07-1122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3552.005,3555.809,"Mr. Pincus, I have difficulty accepting your suggestion that there is a sliver of cases."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3564.831,3574.187,"--I think it is the dangerousness element, Your Honor, if they are ""armed and dangerousness"", which is the test that the Court set out in Terry and that the -- it's the test that my colleagues are asking for."
2008.07-1122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3584.376,3588.196,"Well, do you argue that in -- in all of this, this guy was not dangerous?"
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3588.196,3589.696,We -- we agree.
2008.07-1122,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3605.64,3609.194,How could he not be dangerous?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3631.107,3636.861,"--Well, let me give three quick answers to those: First of all, he looked -- this was an unmarked car, Your Honor."
2008.07-1122,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3673.969,3674.936,Not so fast.
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3697.252,3701.787,"I don't think this Court has come down one way or -- or the other, Your Honor."
2008.07-1122,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3701.787,3701.987,What do you think?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3701.987,3706.691,I -- it seems to me there -- there is a requirement of immediate danger.
2008.07-1122,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3706.691,3711.143,It's -- it's not enough if you think he's -- he's Al Capone?
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3711.143,3713.845,"I don't think if he's just a fishy character, it's enough."
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3716.13,3717.797,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1122,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3717.797,3718.115,Thank you.
2008.07-1122,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3718.115,3720.031,"Mr. Parkhurst, you have a minute remaining."
2008.07-1122,3,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,3720.031,3724.985,This -- this case falls directly under Mimms and Wilson.
2008.07-1122,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3766.312,3775.835,"What do you -- what do you say about the other -- the other side's point that in the case of a Terry stop, there's a -- a mutually reinforcing aspect?"
2008.07-1122,3,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,3781.637,3782.105,Well--
2008.07-1122,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3782.105,3788.809,"--the suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous; whereas, here, you know, it's a traffic stop, is all."
2008.07-1122,3,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,3788.809,3792.028,"--The -- yes, that's true."
2008.07-1122,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3792.811,3802.985,So what -- what is required where you think criminal activity is afoot is not necessarily going to be the same as what's required when you -- when there's just a traffic stop.
2008.07-1122,3,32424,joseph_l_parkhurst,,3802.985,3812.424,--She -- Officer Trevizo testified repeatedly at the hearing that she did not believe he was actually about to commit a crime.
