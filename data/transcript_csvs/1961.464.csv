1961.464,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,404.022,404.513,Yes sir.
1961.464,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,404.513,406.119,Same day as the walkout.
1961.464,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,406.119,407.331,"Yes, the same day."
1961.464,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,558.435,560.702,Was there a collective bargaining agreement --
1961.464,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,560.702,561.212,No sir.

1961.464,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,562.504,563.39,"No sir, there was not."
1961.464,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,769.525,770.854,"Mr. Manoli, may I ask --"
1961.464,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,770.854,770.866,Yes sir.
1961.464,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,770.866,779.282,"May I ask you, is there anything about the Universal Camera, the principle there would justify the Court of Appeals'?"
1961.464,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,779.282,781.501,"Well, I don't think we have a fact issue in here Your Honor."
1961.464,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,781.501,782.304,You think it is not (Voice Overlap) --
1961.464,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,782.304,785.63,I think substantially basic facts are undisputed.
1961.464,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,792.428,797.8,I know but you don't -- there's no reference to Universal Camera or its principles in either brief.
1961.464,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,797.8,802.204,I don't -- we don't believe that Universal Camera is involved in this case.
1961.464,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1227.419,1228.61,Mr. Bair.
1961.464,1,38761,robert_r_bair,,1228.61,1232.078,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.464,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1881.423,1886.503,What -- what significance if any do you attribute to the foreman's remark --
1961.464,1,38761,robert_r_bair,,1886.503,1886.765,Your Honor --
1961.464,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1886.765,1889.52,"-- if those fellows had any guts, they would go home?"
1961.464,1,38761,robert_r_bair,,1889.52,1908.307,"I think the significance there is that it presented to the men a challenge or a dare or an encouragement, and that the men may very well have left because of that and but for that, they might not have left."
1961.464,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1920.029,1928.225,Do you think it could be interpreted reasonably as indicating that if they wanted something done about this and then -- for them to do is to go home?
1961.464,1,38761,robert_r_bair,,1928.225,1931.497,No Your Honor I do not.
1961.464,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2308.865,2336.031,"What do you do Mr. Bair with the finding of the Board as quoted by Mr. Chief Judge Sobeloff in his opinion on 124 of the record where he says, ""The trial examiner found, and we agree, that the respondent violated Section 8 (a) (1) in terminating the employment of seven complainants who were engaged in protected concerted activity under the Act."
1961.464,1,38761,robert_r_bair,,2379.679,2380.855,Mr. Chief Justice --
1961.464,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2380.855,2381.453,Yes.
1961.464,1,38761,robert_r_bair,,2381.453,2387.758,"The -- with reference to the complaints about the cold, I have already addressed myself to."
1961.464,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2387.758,2389.259,"But you have, but --"
1961.464,1,38761,robert_r_bair,,2389.259,2389.297,The --
1961.464,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2389.297,2398.885,-- hasn't the Board some discretion in determining whether a matter -- a thing is a complaint or a mere -- mere casual discretion?
1961.464,1,38761,robert_r_bair,,2425.562,2427.539,I understand Your Honor and I agree with you.
1961.464,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2437.866,2459.857,"Well I suppose if they called it to the attention repeatedly of their foreman who represents the employers that the Board would at least have the right, would it not, to consider those things as complaints particularly when it got down to 15 degrees, that's pretty cold for people to work in without the heat?"
1961.464,1,38761,robert_r_bair,,2459.857,2468.425,"Well, that is so Your Honor, but -- but that was a very special day, occasioned by very special circumstance."
1961.464,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2514.234,2539.08,But the Board have -- would the Board have a little more discretion in determining whether these were complaints or not but we're dealing with unorganized men who have no one to represent them on the other hand where they have a union with a shop steward whose duty it was to carry complaints to the management?
1961.464,1,38761,robert_r_bair,,2578.725,2601.746,"Well Your Honor, in that situation, I fall back on the other phase of the argument that even if there is, even if you can say that this is a current labor dispute, you still have to look to the reasons for the discharge which are, the right to discharge for cause being protected by Section 10 (c)."
1961.464,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2697.072,2698.109,Mr. Manoli.
1961.464,2,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,2698.109,2702.422,"If the Court has no questions, I have no further to add."
1961.464,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2702.422,2706.234,We'll recess then.
