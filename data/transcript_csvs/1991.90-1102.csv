1991.90-1102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.457,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-1102, Robert Gibson v. the Florida Bar."
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,46.752,56.557,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1102,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,110.234,128.055,"The context of the case has very much changed in... well, I'll ask you, in light of the Florida supreme court's order that the State bar not engage in nonbar-related activities."
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,136.731,138.083,"I... I don't think so, Your Honor."
1991.90-1102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,187.564,189.757,Why would the... why would... is that clear?
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,191.608,191.888,That's--
1991.90-1102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.888,192.419,It seems so silly.
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,192.419,192.579,--That's--
1991.90-1102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,192.579,193.729,It achieves nothing--
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,193.729,193.939,--That's--
1991.90-1102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,193.939,196.039,"--to say, you have to be partially constitutional."
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,196.039,203.135,--The... the problem arises because the bar's procedure addresses only legislative issues.
1991.90-1102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,203.135,205.807,"Well, I can't imagine that that's what... that's what the Florida courts mean."
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,216.005,218.068,"Your Honor, I don't agree that that's correct."
1991.90-1102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,262.179,263.749,"Well, you can't say, though--"
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,263.749,263.909,And--
1991.90-1102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,263.909,281.67,"--That if a... if a court has ordered the bar to stay within constitutional bounds right across the board, that a... that a bar association that claims it's living up to the law could predict in advance that it's not going to."
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,281.67,282.191,--Your Honor--
1991.90-1102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.191,290.518,"Now, how could... how could you expect a bar to remit something in advance that it has no intention of owing you?"
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,290.518,306.557,"--Because the bar... as in any circumstance where the State authorizes a situation which makes it possible for First Amendment rights to be infringed upon, the State also has an obligation to provide procedures--"
1991.90-1102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,306.557,307.077,"Well, all right--"
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,307.077,309.679,--that reduce the risk of that infringement.
1991.90-1102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,309.679,317.466,--But you... but I would think you... you claim that there should be a reduction in advance.
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,317.466,318.467,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-1102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,318.868,332.406,"But you... but you can't... even if the... if the bar says we're not going to engage in any of the things that would... would make us refund part of your dues, how can--"
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,332.406,332.516,--How can--
1991.90-1102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,332.516,342.373,--How can you ask them to then estimate how much they're going to break the law in advance?
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,342.373,351.869,"--In the same manner that this Court held that the unions could do it in the compulsory dues cases, that is, based upon prior experience."
1991.90-1102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,371.564,375.936,"There's a big difference in the union cases, because there was no prohibition against engaging in the activity."
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,380.83,383.633,"I don't think the case is that different, Your Honor."
1991.90-1102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,460.267,477.267,"--Yes, but supposing they send a notice out to the membership, we... our legislative program for 1992 contains the following 10 items, and we think they're all permissible under the Florida supreme court's decision, there's no reason why everybody shouldn't contribute, and... period."
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,479.237,481.27,"--But that's not the notice here, Your Honor."
1991.90-1102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,506.999,511.361,"No, but I'm trying to figure out what happens under the new... new regime in Florida."
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,517.833,521.178,"At the beginning of the year, which they don't do now, Your Honor."
1991.90-1102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,521.178,526.51,"They send out a dues request, send in your $ 100, or whatever it is, and by the way here's our legislative program."
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,529.094,530.163,"What more should they do, Your Honor?"
1991.90-1102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,554.62,555.792,"Yes, but... but they don't raise chargeable expenses."
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,558.215,561.237,--If... if they're claiming that all of their expenditures are chargeable--
1991.90-1102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,561.237,563.087,But this is why it says they are going to presume they're going to try and--
1991.90-1102,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,563.087,573.746,"--If they're claiming that all of their expenditures are chargeable, then they should not simply make that a boldfaced... as I say, bluff, by saying all of our expenses are chargeable--"
1991.90-1102,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1703.745,1707.588,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.708,1777.438,That seems to me very perceptive.
1991.90-1102,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1778.98,1779.941,"--I can read, Your Honor."
1991.90-1102,2,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3016.502,3020.394,I'd like to very quickly make two or three points.
