1988.88-616,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.679,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-616, Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services v. Elmer Hudson."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,12.258,15.511,Thank you.
1988.88-616,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,156.388,159.53,"Mr. Kneedler, what does the phrase ""or otherwise"" mean?"
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,159.53,168.316,"Well, the model rules promulgated by the Administrative Conference of the United States and followed by federal agencies, including HHS, have given content to that."
1988.88-616,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,216.922,218.524,"Has that ever happened, Mr. Kneedler?"
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,225.068,243.28,"Well, I'm informed, for example, as particularly relevant here, the legislative history of the 1985 Reenactment refers to a special experimental program set up by HHS in the Social Security context in five regional offices whereby the Agency was represented in ALJ hearings."
1988.88-616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,258.142,267.797,How come you can say the United States doesn't take a position in passing on the claim?
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,267.797,277.714,"Well, there is no advocate for the government, from the perspective of the government seeking to deny a claim in an administrative hearing."
1988.88-616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.997,290.651,And you don't think... you don't think in denying a claim the United States has taken a position?
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,290.651,299.397,"Well, I suppose that the ALJ as a judicial officer could be said to be rendering a decision that the claimant is not entitled."
1988.88-616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,327.428,331.632,And so the proceeding really isn't adversary unless the United States is separately represented?
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,331.632,331.883,That's correct.
1988.88-616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,333.295,347.705,"Mr. Kneedler, the adjudicative agency proceeding that is being considered here for purposes of attorney's fees is one that occurred on remand as a result of the civil litigation."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,348.586,349.077,That's... that's right.
1988.88-616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,349.077,364.637,And I take it there is no final judgment for purposes of determining the attorney's fees under EAJA until the district court finally enters the judgment at the conclusion of the proceedings on remand?
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,364.637,365.728,Yes.
1988.88-616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,366.297,367.299,Is that right?
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,367.299,369.502,--A final judgment for purposes of awarding the fees.
1988.88-616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.502,369.682,Yes?
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,369.682,372.105,Not a final judgment for purposes of appeal.
1988.88-616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,376.858,378.828,"But for purposes of awarding fees, am I correct?"
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,378.828,379.068,That's correct.
1988.88-616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,381.872,395.23,"Well, why... why isn't it the case then that the court in the civil action retains jurisdiction and why isn't this remand proceeding in essence part of the civil action?"
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,396.98,397.12,Okay.
1988.88-616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,442.513,451.388,"Oh, and presumably to make sure that the proceedings on remand were in accordance with the court's view of the overall relief that should be granted."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,451.388,458.133,"But the way the procedure operates is that when the case goes back to the agency... for example, what happened in this case."
1988.88-616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,483.691,488.125,"Yes, but it's very easy to consider this thing as just part of the civil action."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,488.125,496.41,But both EAJA and the Social Security Act clearly distinguish between civil actions and proceedings before the Secretary.
1988.88-616,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.964,609.61,"Mr. Kneedler, did the Eleventh Circuit here, when it remanded to the Agency, make any special statement saying this Court is retaining jurisdiction over this case, or is whatever retention of jurisdiction it had simply the normal retention of jurisdiction that occurs by operation of law, if any?"
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,609.61,610.951,The latter.
1988.88-616,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.224,625.663,"So this is no different from a court of appeals, let's say the D.C. Circuit remanding an agency rulemaking, reversing the rule and remanding for further proceedings before the agency?"
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,625.663,628.484,I think that's essentially correct.
1988.88-616,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.375,656.815,"Are there... are there any instances to your knowledge... I seem to recollect some... in which a court doesn't just remand, but remands with some special indication that it intends to oversee further developments in the case?"
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,656.815,658.287,I suppose that could happen.
1988.88-616,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.112,689.287,Do you think courts can retain jurisdiction and in effect have the Executive Branch operate under the court's supervision thereafter?
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,689.287,690.229,I think not.
1988.88-616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,759.087,768.421,"Well, certainly her attorney was needed on remand to accomplish the ultimate goal of the litigation."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,768.421,780.78,"First of all, in this case it's not at all clear that an attorney was required because it's particularly vivid that the proceedings on remand in this case were non-adversarial."
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,873.176,878.341,"Mr. Kneedler, could I interrupt to get your help on one part of the 2412(d)(3)."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,882.763,882.983,Yes.
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.983,891.01,"But those proceedings, under the statute, had to be judicial review of an adversary adjudication, did they not?"
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,891.01,907.481,"No, No. 2412(d)(3) refers to circumstances in which a court may award fees for services performed before the agency; 2412(d)(1)(A) is the section that provides for fees awarded in the judicial proceedings themselves."
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.481,907.632,"Oh, I see."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,912.847,913.057,Yes.
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.634,923.295,"Oh, I see."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,923.295,939.027,But 2412(d)(3) is significant in our view because it is a provision of the Act that specifically addresses the circumstances in which a court may award fees... in which a court may award fees for services performed before an agency.
1988.88-616,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,963.252,985.567,"In the program, the pilot program that you described to Justice Scalia, would the attorney's fees... could attorney's fees be awarded in that instance, where these representatives of the government weren't present assuming other conditions are satisfied that the government's position is not substantially justified?"
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,985.567,988.308,If there had been an attorney present in the experimental program?
1988.88-616,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,988.308,988.899,"Well, yes."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,990.257,990.488,Non-attorneys.
1988.88-616,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,990.488,991.199,--representing the government.
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,991.199,996.112,"Well, there is a separate threshold question which we identify in a footnote in our brief."
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1046.161,1057.418,"Although the government does use ALJs in all those proceedings, it's not confident enough about its position on that point that it doesn't decline to use ALJs who are usable only for 554 proceedings."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1057.418,1061.16,"Well, at least for the--"
1988.88-616,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.16,1064.822,"If it was not a 554 proceeding, you could have any agency officer conduct the hearing, right?"
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1064.822,1066.204,--Yes.
1988.88-616,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1067.634,1068.255,And the government always uses ALJs.
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1068.255,1072.94,--I believe there is separate statutory authorization for the use of Administrative Law Judges in Social Security programs.
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.582,1089.941,"Mr. Kneedler, going back to the text... and I thank you for calling my attention to the right provision on page 2 of your brief... 2412(d)(1)(A), including proceedings for a judicial review of agency action."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1098.067,1102.689,They terminated when the case was remanded back to the Secretary.
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.689,1109.914,"And the... and the filing the order later on and getting fees for the work during the judicial, that was not part of the judicial proceeding?"
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1109.914,1113.648,"Well, it was part of the judicial proceedings only for purposes of the award of--"
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1113.648,1113.788,Well--
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1113.788,1114.357,--attorney's fees.
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.357,1116.23,--when did they terminate for all purposes?
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1116.23,1120.66,"Well, for all purposes, including attorney's fees, it terminated when the fees were awarded."
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1120.901,1124.123,Which was after the remand proceedings had taken place?
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1124.123,1124.384,--Yes.
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.384,1130.548,But you say that part of the proceeding is kind of carved out because it was before the Agency rather than before a court?
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1130.548,1133.012,"The proceedings on remand, yes."
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.012,1133.37,Yes.
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1133.37,1134.221,Not... not carved out.
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.784,1138.936,"Well, that's the issue, I guess."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1138.936,1139.086,Right.
1988.88-616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.571,1207.807,"Well, there is no claim in this case for a fee on the initial administrative proceeding."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1207.807,1208.805,That's... that's correct.
1988.88-616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1223.476,1227.529,"Well, really... really, the claimant is in a much stronger position."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1230.852,1231.5,Yes.
1988.88-616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1232.131,1234.064,"So, the result is preordained."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1234.064,1235.353,--It's not preordained because--
1988.88-616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1235.353,1235.904,"Well, it's close."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1236.435,1242.779,--The court... the court may have... the court may have disagreed with the Secretary on certain legal issues--
1988.88-616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1242.779,1242.929,Yes.
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1242.929,1245.233,--as was true here in considering several impairments.
1988.88-616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1284.989,1285.81,"Well, the claimant has got a judgment too."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1285.81,1289.082,The claimant has a judgment and the issues have been narrowed on remand.
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.317,1300.341,But the way the issues have been narrowed is they have to... further proceedings have to be in accordance with the opinion of the court of appeals or the district court.
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1302.915,1309.247,"They are, but that's no different from the fact that the ALJ has to conduct the hearing under certain legal rules at--"
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1309.247,1320.606,"Yes, but the difference, I suppose, is that the... I think if you were a lawyer representing a client in that position, you'd really have a professional duty to be sure that the standards that you fought for in the litigation were carried out and were interpreted properly."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1320.606,1321.065,"--Well, and--"
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1321.065,1323.518,It's kind of strange for the lawyer to just go home and sit around.
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1323.518,1325.159,"--No, no one is suggesting that."
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1340.211,1345.296,"But are the claimants in all these proceedings, these vast number of proceedings, in the initial stages typically represented by counsel?"
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1345.296,1358.553,"The figures that the Social Security Administration gave me is that in about 65 percent of hearings the claimant is represented by counsel, and about another 18 percent represented by some other form of representative other than counsel."
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1358.553,1361.164,"Those are in claims that go to hearing, of course."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1361.164,1362.166,"Claims that go to hearings, yes."
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1362.166,1362.897,Before an ALJ?
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1362.897,1363.467,Before an ALJ.
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.467,1369.413,"So there would be an awful lot of them denied before that, or granted before that, and I suppose that in most of those there probably would not be counsel."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1372.085,1373.565,"Before the ALJ, yes."
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1373.565,1373.735,Yes.
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1373.735,1375.805,A lot of them are not represented by counsel--
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1375.805,1375.996,Yes.
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1375.996,1377.207,--in that.
1988.88-616,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.521,1443.173,"So, this was a House Committee discussing it?"
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1443.173,1443.995,--Yes.
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1488.356,1491.259,"Let me just make sure I understand one other thing, Mr. Kneedler, about the scheme."
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1506.548,1506.768,That's correct.
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1509.971,1516.635,So that the status of the claimant as a prevailing party in the last analysis depends on what happens in the administrative proceedings on remand?
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1516.635,1517.707,--That's correct.
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1517.707,1517.897,Yeah.
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1517.897,1522.762,But that's just to determine whether he's a prevailing party for fees in the judicial proceedings themselves.
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.762,1525.183,"Yes, but that is not part of the judicial proceeding in which--"
1988.88-616,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1525.183,1527.474,That is... what happens on remand is not part of the judicial proceeding.
1988.88-616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.474,1528.595,--in which they become a prevailing party.
1988.88-616,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1528.806,1532.85,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1534.162,1537.664,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1577.431,1585.047,"Excuse me, but the Act does not provide compensation in that situation so long as there is no attorney."
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1602.917,1605.631,"That's correct, and we don't dispute that at all."
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1605.708,1609.541,"--Well, but doesn't that cast some doubt on... on what you're saying?"
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1609.541,1609.762,--No.
1988.88-616,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1694.464,1702.669,"Mr. Coleman, the court below relied instead on the Agency adversary adjudication section."
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1715.455,1716.687,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-616,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1716.687,1733.979,"So, you agree essentially with Mr. Kneedler, then, that the United States was not represented otherwise within the meaning of the adversary adjudication provision before the Agency?"
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1733.979,1741.835,"Well, not exactly because our position is that Section 504 is not relevant to the remand proceedings."
1988.88-616,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1789.878,1798.973,And how do you respond to the language in the House report that is cited on page 26 of the government's opening brief?
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1798.973,1808.23,"That report is cited... first of all, it's edited in the government's brief in a way that distorts the meaning."
1988.88-616,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1874.074,1874.305,Mr.--
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1874.305,1876.594,--can only refer to the administrative proceedings that--
1988.88-616,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1876.594,1876.825,--Mr. Coleman--
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1876.825,1877.305,--came first.
1988.88-616,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1877.305,1881.699,"--Mr. Coleman, are you paraphrasing now the language of a House Report or are you quoting directly?"
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1881.699,1883.67,"Well, I can quote it directly."
1988.88-616,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.94,1884.641,"No, I was just curious."
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1884.641,1885.833,--I was paraphrasing.
1988.88-616,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1885.833,1886.023,You were paraphrasing.
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1886.023,1886.744,I was paraphrasing.
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1922.362,1926.064,How do we know that was a typographical error in the House Report?
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1926.064,1931.258,We... we cite in our brief the supplemental House Report which makes the correction.
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.258,1931.527,Oh.
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1933.901,1942.806,"Well, I assume what it proves is that the initial word... that the word ""initial"" was intended to be judicial."
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.806,1945.959,"Or, at least, the later House Committee thought it should have been ""judicial""."
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1945.959,1948.0,"No, it was... I'm sorry... it was the same committee."
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.0,1948.51,The same committee--
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1948.51,1948.971,It was a supplemental--
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.971,1949.111,--later?
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1949.111,1949.712,--Yes.
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1954.686,1955.276,Uh-huh.
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,1955.276,1960.552,Section 504 of Title--
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.552,1976.5,"Mr. Coleman, can I ask you about the... what seems to me to be the logical basis for your case is that everything that happens until the judicial proceeding is terminated, is part of the judicial proceeding."
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2027.857,2035.353,"--Well, that is what we're saying, but I don't think the analogy with what happens when this court or a court of appeals remands a case."
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2182.606,2189.662,"Mr. Coleman, I'm a little troubled by the consequences of the rule that you're urging for as far as the governmental fiske is concerned."
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2238.863,2240.155,--That's not the case.
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2249.182,2251.282,You acknowledge that they have to win when they get back?
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2251.282,2251.452,Yes.
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2276.028,2276.258,Couldn't happen.
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2276.258,2277.27,--not result in attorney's fees.
1988.88-616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2549.129,2564.499,"If the government had given up after the... after the decision on appeal and just paid the claim, they could have done that."
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2564.499,2565.281,They could have done that.
1988.88-616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.281,2566.863,And there would have been a final judgment.
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2566.863,2571.437,There would have been a final judgment in that instance and we wouldn't have this case.
1988.88-616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2575.88,2581.165,"Well, there was a final judgment of the court of appeals on the law."
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2581.165,2582.234,--That's correct.
1988.88-616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2600.957,2601.137,Was entitled to benefits.
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2601.137,2601.477,--benefits.
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.725,2619.269,"Could the government, in your view of the thing, have taken an appeal on the merits from the court of appeals immediately without--"
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2619.269,2620.831,I'm not--
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2620.831,2621.512,--going through the remand?
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2621.512,2625.084,--I'm not sure that the government could have.
1988.88-616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.953,2638.555,A court of appeals judgment doesn't have to be a final judgment.
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2638.555,2641.075,--Yes.
1988.88-616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2641.365,2642.577,"I mean, it's appealable."
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2646.538,2647.299,--That's correct.
1988.88-616,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2770.523,2776.119,But the district court doesn't make the initial determination of whether she's entitled to benefits.
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2777.409,2777.799,That's correct.
1988.88-616,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2777.799,2780.862,And what's the standard of review in the district court?
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2780.862,2783.856,Whether or not it's supported by substantial evidence.
1988.88-616,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2801.097,2803.959,"Well, you use the term ""limited remand""."
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2809.911,2810.282,Yes.
1988.88-616,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2810.282,2812.676,What would be an example of one of those?
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2812.676,2822.831,"For example, where the Secretary makes a ruling of law that terminates the proceeding prior to a final decision."
1988.88-616,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2866.751,2874.407,"So, in your first example of the unlimited remand... there, would the decision of the Secretary have been final on remand?"
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2874.407,2884.655,"It would be a... It would be a final decision, but it would not be a final decision with respect to the claim that the claimant is disabled."
1988.88-616,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2934.078,2937.839,"Mr. Coleman, may I interrupt you because I'm not sure I follow part of your argument?"
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2957.536,2962.529,"I think so, because the relief that you... the relief that you sought--"
1988.88-616,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2962.529,2969.942,But now would the district judge be allowed to give you that award of fees without waiting to see if you prevail at the actual hearing?
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,2969.942,2970.423,--Yes.
1988.88-616,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2994.499,3003.746,"But then, conversely, you are agreeing with the government, I guess, that in that sort of case you would not be entitled to fees in the remand proceedings before the Agency?"
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,3003.746,3014.973,That's correct because the remand proceeding then is simply a continuation of the one that had begun but in which the Secretary had not reached a final decision on the question of whether the person was disabled.
1988.88-616,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3014.973,3016.004,And then one other question.
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,3020.178,3026.283,I think that they probably fall neatly within one or the other.
1988.88-616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.606,3111.681,Do you think it's critical that we consider the proceedings that went on after remand to be part of the judicial proceedings?
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,3111.681,3112.463,"Well, it's--"
1988.88-616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.463,3129.952,"Or are you... I understood your brief to say that once the government has ever taken a legal position, then any administrative proceeding that occurs after that, whether the government is represented or not, is... is subject to a fee award."
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,3152.537,3153.399,"--Well, we think the--"
1988.88-616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3153.399,3155.339,But you think you have a better ground?
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,3155.339,3155.97,--That's correct.
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3166.809,3178.455,"Mr. Coleman, all of this argument has assumed that you can't get fees just from the court... just for the court proceeding until you get your award."
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,3206.743,3213.298,This... This Court has not addressed the question of at what point do you become a prevailing party in a Social Security case.
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3213.298,3217.461,"Well, how we come out in this case very much depends on how we would come out in the other one, doesn't it?"
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,3229.15,3230.569,"Well, there wouldn't be less reason."
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3244.64,3246.581,"Well, the appeal wouldn't be over."
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,3252.884,3254.354,That's correct.
1988.88-616,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3267.004,3267.164,It would make it a lot weaker.
1988.88-616,1,29444,james_e_coleman_jr,,3267.164,3283.306,"--In effect it would... it would be in the nature of interim award of fees, such as is done under the Civil Rights Act where fees can be obtained on an interim basis for significant successes short of actually winning on the merits."
1988.88-616,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3283.306,3286.368,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
1988.88-616,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3289.23,3292.272,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.88-616,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3322.834,3323.012,Mr. Kneedler--
1988.88-616,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3323.012,3323.783,--not judicial proceedings.
1988.88-616,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3323.783,3333.6,"--would you respond to Justice Scalia's question about... would it be open to this Court, given the statutory scheme, to hold that your opponent became a prevailing party when the case was remanded?"
1988.88-616,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3333.6,3334.332,"No, it would not."
1988.88-616,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3339.837,3346.569,"Say, if we don't... if we don't look at legislative history, as some of us don't like to, and just looked at the text of the statute."
1988.88-616,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3348.632,3350.053,"--Yes, there--"
1988.88-616,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3350.053,3350.193,You say--
1988.88-616,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3350.193,3352.263,"--is the statutory phrase ""prevailing party""."
1988.88-616,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3359.68,3363.303,--But he's prevailed on the only issue that was adjudicated in the judicial proceeding.
1988.88-616,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3363.303,3370.116,--But he has filed a claim for benefits and he hasn't prevailed on his claim for benefits.
1988.88-616,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3389.87,3393.352,"Well, that's sort of an argument that the judicial proceedings are part of the administrative proceeding."
1988.88-616,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3393.352,3395.634,"No, it's not."
1988.88-616,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3449.369,3449.918,I agree with all that.
1988.88-616,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3463.909,3473.874,"Well, Congress, in our view, did precisely that because the administrative proceedings are separately dealt with in Section 504, and the word ""prevailing"" carries two meanings here."
1988.88-616,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3521.498,3522.57,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
