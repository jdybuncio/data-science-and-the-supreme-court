1978.78-437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,16.027,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 78-437, Califano against Westcott and the consolidated case."
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,21.279,24.707,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-437,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,208.229,218.013,"In both cases, the mothers and the appellee family would've qualified under the statute had they have been fathers instead of mothers, correct?"
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,218.013,220.094,That's correct.
1978.78-437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,281.669,284.485,"Now, but under what provision of the Constitution?"
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,284.485,292.881,Under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the equal protection component of that Due Process Clause.
1978.78-437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,292.881,295.893,Because it discriminated on the basis of gender?
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,295.893,297.804,Correct.
1978.78-437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,333.647,336.84,"Mr. Alsup, is “impact” a verb?"
1978.78-437,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,336.84,338.445,It is these days.
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,338.445,340.8,I think that's -- It has been recently.
1978.78-437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,398.028,406.783,"Some reports of the Secretary or a Congressional Committee indicated that that was rather pervasive, did it not?"
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,406.783,407.514,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,655.738,658.11,"Well, let me have that again."
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,659.854,661.306,Aid to the families.
1978.78-437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,661.306,661.987,Yes.
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,668.185,677.759,You're absolutely correct Your Honor and I misspoke and it is important to emphasize that this is aid to the families and not to any particular individuals within that family.
1978.78-437,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,778.167,779.488,How about the other 29%?
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,779.488,788.837,In 19.5% both were present and in 10% both had deserted or neither was present.
1978.78-437,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,788.837,797.097,I thought the program up until then was applicable only to families and which there was one parent and only one parent.
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,797.097,810.087,That's principally correct except for the incapacity point if a parent is incapacitated if they were not able bodied and therefore they were able to qualify.
1978.78-437,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,817.488,820.297,"Well, some 29% of the total, we're not one parent family."
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,820.297,823.815,"No, it's 19.5%."
1978.78-437,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,823.815,826.794,"70% were no father, 1% were no mother?"
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,826.794,827.465,And 10% was in neither.
1978.78-437,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,827.465,828.99,And 29%?
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,828.99,835.343,And 10% of those were neither that means that the children were living with relatives and not with the parents.
1978.78-437,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,835.343,838.965,With or such family with kinfolk?
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,838.965,839.582,Correct.
1978.78-437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,839.582,841.304,Or foster homes?
1978.78-437,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,841.304,842.592,Wouldn't apply in foster homes?
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,842.592,843.511,Not to a foster home.
1978.78-437,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,929.977,933.359,"Mr. Alsup, can I ask one question about the facts to this case?"
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,942.117,947.823,That is correct.
1978.78-437,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,950.086,953.111,"Under the original concept the families would then become eligible, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,953.111,956.057,That's correct under the original program.
1978.78-437,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,961.253,974.366,"No, but to the extent you're emphasizing the desire to prevent a paternal desertion from qualifying a family the statute really doesn't accomplish anything in this particular case and does it, because the incentive is still aware?"
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,974.366,975.457,That's correct.
1978.78-437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1233.994,1236.514,"Mr. Alsup, could I ask you a question?"
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,1242.074,1242.427,Correct.
1978.78-437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1242.427,1256.762,And it did define the class as all Massachusetts families who would be eligible for the AFDC-UF and therefore medicate benefits except for the requirement 407 that the unemployed parent be a father?
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,1256.762,1257.963,I believe that's correct.
1978.78-437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1257.963,1269.859,"So that yes, it's the relief that granted and its decision really went far beyond the facts of this particular case, did it not?"
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,1269.859,1271.269,That's correct in this sense.
1978.78-437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.686,1333.131,"Mr. Alsup, your opponent's brief says that the tax for zone sex discrimination of the civil rights division last October made in this report to the President made a flat statement that the statute overtly and sub-sensitively discriminated against women, do you have any comment about that?"
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,1333.131,1335.779,Yes.
1978.78-437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1398.044,1402.537,Does the Department of Justice assume any responsibility for what the task force?
1978.78-437,0,43774,william_h_alsup,,1402.537,1410.846,"Well, of course the Solicitor General speaks for the United States and the Department of Justice before this Court with respect to one of our legal positions are."
1978.78-437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1420.956,1448.507,Mr. Johnson.
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1448.507,1451.554,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.367,1533.233,Do you agree that then that the challenge provision is unconstitutional?
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1535.93,1539.235,We incorporated United States' arguments before the District Court.
1978.78-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.937,1545.745,That isn't quite what I've asked you.
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1545.745,1551.003,We have no objection to the District Court's ruling on the unconstitutionality of the provision (Voice Overlap) of the Congress.
1978.78-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1552.237,1555.815,Will you get reimbursed with regards of how it comes out on that point?
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1555.815,1559.625,"Well, we get reimbursed to a 50% rate, Your Honor."
1978.78-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1567.575,1573.895,Whether reversal on the federal appellant's appeal moot your client?
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1573.895,1575.6,"Yes, Your Honor it would."
1978.78-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.6,1578.0,And save this amount?
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1578.0,1583.655,"It would be a less expensive program, Your Honor."
1978.78-437,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1614.69,1638.076,"Well, Mr. Johnson, didn't they District Court's remedy do no more than provide that the existing statutory framework shall be applicable when -- to unemployed, to situations where the mother is not employed as it has been in passed to situation for the father's unemployment."
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1638.076,1640.483,"That was the District Court's remedy, Your Honor."
1978.78-437,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1641.224,1648.229,"In other words, even today under the existing statute quite apart from -- I mean assuming it's all valid."
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1658.185,1658.902,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-437,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1660.224,1664.132,"But the District Court did no more than I suggest, isn't that correct?"
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1664.132,1664.922,"Your quite correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-437,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1664.922,1671.366,Having found it invalid and so far is that didn't -- discriminated against the women.
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1680.189,1700.556,"Yes Your Honor, but that rather straight forward attempt to extend to extend the statutory classification, ignores the fact that 1967 Congress at it's level made a decision that families would not get benefits simply because the mother whom Congress assumed to be a secondary --"
1978.78-437,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1700.556,1713.511,"The Government says of course that that's perfectly valid legislation and that is my brother White suggests would be the end of your case if we agree with the Government of United States that this is not unconstitutional, then that's the end of it."
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1713.511,1716.842,But Congress has always meant the AFDC-U program.
1978.78-437,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1716.842,1729.437,Congress also in 1967 enacted the law that said these AFDC payments shall be made only when the father is unemployed but that was held unconstitutional?
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1729.437,1734.614,"Yes, Your Honor, but in order to fashion a remedy which stays true, the Congressional intent."
1978.78-437,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1734.614,1742.847,If we state true the Congressional intent we'd reverse the District Court's judgment holding that the intent of Congress was an unconstitutional.
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1742.847,1755.066,But a remedy -- the remedy of extension finds its fountain of justification in what Congress would've done if they had known that the program is written was incorrect.
1978.78-437,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1769.576,1782.088,"But in fact under the assuming the validity of the present program if the principal wage earner was in fact the mother, nonetheless AFDC payments are payable if the father is unemployed, isn't that right?"
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1782.088,1783.733,"That practice has been tolerated by the Congress, Your Honor."
1978.78-437,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1783.733,1788.769,"Well, isn't that true in the statue not the practice being tolerated, isn't it with the statute provides?"
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1788.769,1790.96,"Well, statute simply says the father's --"
1978.78-437,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1790.96,1791.434,Unemployment.
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1791.434,1792.08,-- unemployment.
1978.78-437,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1792.08,1792.482,Right.
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1792.482,1811.619,"But the legislative reports in 1967 when that term came in specifically said the reason for this was because states had abused the term “parent” by providing benefits to families where the mothers are unemployed even though that principle wage earner, the presumed principle wage earner the father was still working."
1978.78-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1853.255,1862.6,Some of your arguments make me wonder why you did not appeal on the constitutional question instead of just on the remedy.
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1862.6,1873.281,"Your Honor, I think that may highlight the fact that the Commissioner differs tremendously with the Secretary and the Solicitor General on his reading of legislative history."
1978.78-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1884.319,1886.822,The simulated desertions you mean?
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1886.822,1887.316,Pardon?
1978.78-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1887.316,1890.156,"The simulated desertions, the synthetic --"
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1890.156,1890.166,Yes.
1978.78-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1890.166,1891.215,-- as they were called?
1978.78-437,1,38034,paul_w_johnson,,1891.215,1892.458,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2154.714,2160.472,"Very well, Mr. Johnson."
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2172.74,2176.035,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2274.85,2280.552,Was Orr against Orr was not a case involving a government largesse?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2280.552,2284.403,That's correct Your Honor that was in a case involving claim between parties.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2284.403,2310.249,"Right and then in any events it was, what that did was limited discretion of a divorce court judge no matter what the situation was he was simply not prohibitive from ever awarding alimony in favor of a husband against (Voice Overlap) wife but that involved private property of two other people, this involves government largesse and there are opinions in that area or somewhat -- it was somewhat different cast, don't they?"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2310.249,2324.033,"Well, there might be somewhat more division it is still clear that the Orr decision was applying to test that it previously been applied by this Court in Califano versus Webster, Califano versus Goldfarb cases involving the Social Security Act."
1978.78-437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2367.343,2374.925,"Well, does your argument boil down all to at what point you slice this thing so to speak?"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2382.365,2386.658,For purpose of this case we would argue it doesn't matter as of what you determine there it.
1978.78-437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2406.595,2413.408,But I thought you are arguing is the overall purpose of AFDC program which I understood was adopted in 1935?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2413.408,2418.227,That is correct and the AFDC-U program is a sub-program clearly sub-program of the AFDC.
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.303,2496.955,But in fact it was?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2496.955,2498.456,Indeed it was.
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.456,2499.419,"So, I mean --"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2499.419,2505.182,But nowhere did Congress say we are cutting back on the program because we believe they are needy children whose needs we don't want to meet.
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.182,2506.695,But Congress did cut back in the program --
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2506.695,2507.011,It certainly did.
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.011,2508.836,-- whatever that be or you wouldn't be here?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2508.836,2513.383,That's correct and but we're trying to discern is why the Congress cutback on the program.
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2513.383,2517.282,As a representative of the people of the United States he did.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2517.282,2518.324,It had power to act.
1978.78-437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2530.287,2539.072,"Well, are you telling us that there is something to this Court knows that Congress didn't know about what its purpose was in 1967?"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2539.072,2587.529,Not at all with this Court has to do is to read the act which tells us that the purposes to aid dependent children and then look at legislative of history and attempt to discern why wasn't that Congress made the change that it did in 1967 and then does the gender classification substantially served that purpose and when we look at the legislative history in 1967 as I was saying refined no indication that there was desire to move away from needs meeting purpose and move as the Solicitor General argues to an anti-paternal desertion purpose what we do far is that the debate was pervaded by sex stereo typing that the words “father and parent” were used interchangeably without any indications or sense that something different was being said.
1978.78-437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2587.529,2595.712,"Well, what do you say the purpose of Congress in 1967 was when did enact this as reflected in the legislative history?"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2595.712,2632.739,"We would say that the purpose of the introduction of the gender classifications was consistent with the general concern that Congress had in 1967 as regard to AFDC-U program that some states were qualifying families for benefits on the basis of the so-called unemployment of a family member who they assume to be homemaker, the housewife when that person really had no prior task into the workforce and was not the type of person whom Congress saw as unemployed who was losing income and therefore someone who created the need that Congress was to meet."
1978.78-437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2679.106,2687.837,"Well, are you saying that where legislative history is not clear you're not free to look at language of the statue itself?"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2687.837,2703.864,"Not on the list, not on the list the argument is that the language of the statute demonstrates concern about need caused by deprivation and the Solicitor General is arguing that the purpose here was to deter desertion and we looked at the language of the statute and no where do we see any discussion of that."
1978.78-437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2708.074,2712.963,Do you have difficulty finding that concept in legislative history?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2712.963,2714.229,The deterrence of desertion?
1978.78-437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2714.229,2714.712,Yes.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2714.712,2715.726,Not all.
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2843.031,2848.059,"Supposed in 1961, was it this first adopted in 1962?"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2848.059,2849.36,At 1961 for one day.
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.36,2870.601,"1961, suppose the 1967 has been adopted the 1961 and the 1967 form and were perfectly clear from legislative history which you dispute that the reason they want to adopt it was to aviate the desertion of fathers."
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2877.027,2883.319,We certainly would Your Honor for at least two reasons.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2931.223,2944.327,What is true that up until 1961 if two parents were in the home even though the father became unemployed they were totally ineligible for AFDC payments?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2944.327,2945.094,That is correct.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2945.094,2964.846,Until 1961 unemployment didn't have any thing to do with it if both parents were there and therefore if an unemployed father became unemployed prior to 1961 there would be an incentive for him to leave home and so it will be a single parent family so they'll be eligible?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2964.846,2969.776,There was an equivalent incentive for the mother to leave home and the point is that there is no gender discrimination.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2976.922,2986.112,"Well, up until 1961 the family was eligible only if there was a single parent it was not eligible if they were -- if both parents were in the home even though unemployed."
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2986.112,2987.988,Unless one was incapacitated of course as you pointed out before.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2987.988,2989.08,Right.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,2989.08,2989.397,That is correct.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2989.397,3006.939,"But after and that was the problem to which Congress is addressing itself because that prior to 1961 regime provided an incentive to unemployed father who became unemployed to leave home so his family would be eligible, isn't that right?"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3008.242,3013.22,You are right that the eligibility is based upon there being a parent absent.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3013.22,3014.637,"Away, physically gone."
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3014.637,3015.784,That is correct.
1978.78-437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3076.086,3088.444,Are telling us that this counterfeit or synthetic desertion pattern was not part of motivation of Congress?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3088.444,3105.833,We do not believe that the record shows that the motivation of the committees who adopted this legislation as the Congress has adopted that the motivation was affected in any significant way by concern about desertion real or synthetic.
1978.78-437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3240.96,3259.261,"Mr. Freedman, isn't that somewhat inconsistent with your use of the word “archaic” if in your view the Congress had used correct perceptions of male and female roles in 1935 and 1961 and 1962?"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3270.454,3273.689,It certainly is and we really have no explanation for that.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3303.736,3316.879,I think you said that you understood the Solicitor General's argument to be entirely based upon this legislative purpose with which you disagree.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3353.049,3354.492,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, we were struck --"
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3354.492,3355.682,Isn't that their argument?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3355.682,3362.689,We were struck by the fact that what appears to be a major argument in their brief that there's no gender discrimination in this case at all.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3363.842,3366.656,No gender discrimination with respect to the benefits are not payable?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3366.656,3368.723,Distribution of these benefits.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3371.162,3377.257,Because the beneficiary is maybe at least half have more female and maybe in of any particular case 100% of them are.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3377.257,3386.539,"Well, indeed in every family their argument is that in every family where unemployed mother is denied benefits there is a father also because by definition we're talking about two-parent families."
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3386.539,3389.727,"And there are children, there may be boys or girls."
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3389.727,3391.761,"Maybe boys, maybe girls."
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3396.301,3400.52,But didn't you understand that to be a large part of their argument in their brief?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3400.52,3405.608,"That's right, Your Honor and I did not address it this morning because they seem to have pretty much abandon this morning --"
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3405.608,3408.896,"Well, I think they filed their brief here and I don't think they withdrawn any part of it."
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3408.896,3422.614,Fine and our response to that is that the benefits that are issue in this case are benefits based upon past employment when Government distributes benefits on the basis of past employment.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3428.91,3431.033,But this is not employment compensation?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3431.033,3431.357,"No, it is not a normal compensation."
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3431.357,3433.181,This is not based upon past employment?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3433.181,3445.6,"It is based upon past employment and need Your Honor that the federal government has by statute determined that certain people are eligible for benefits and the criteria for illegibility are essentially for its purposes, its need and past employment."
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3445.6,3449.439,His need unlike Social Security payments and unlike unemployment compensation.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3449.439,3455.348,It is need and past employment there's a specific past employment test 6 out of 13 quarters.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3455.348,3458.537,There's a test as to where -- when a person is unemployed.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3458.537,3459.707,That is correct.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3464.275,3464.38,No.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3464.38,3466.533,It is based upon past employment.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3472.135,3474.991,It is not unemployment but isn't it?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3474.991,3476.039,But that is defined in terms of past employment.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3476.039,3476.852,Yes.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3476.852,3477.897,There's no question --
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3477.897,3480.29,(Voice Overlap) its present unemployment?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3481.265,3481.707,Yes.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3481.707,3482.69,Yes.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3482.69,3502.84,"And we would submit to that is no different from the kind of discrimination that this Court has found in many previous cases in Goldfarb and Wiesenfeld for example, the Court found that there was discrimination against one particular category of family, that and which the female spouse is the wage earner."
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3506.56,3508.169,"(Voice Overlap) there's a compensation, were they not?"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3508.169,3510.131,"Well, these are different cases."
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3516.445,3517.897,Military compensation?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3517.897,3527.455,"But they were benefits that went to the family not every person, not every serviceman or servicewoman received those benefits."
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3704.279,3716.5,Do you have another case where the Federal Court ordered the state to remedy an equal protection violation one way or another?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3716.5,3725.385,Where a Federal court ordered this time I mean all of the Social Security Act cases before this Court extension has been the remedy and of course --
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3725.385,3725.639,"(Voice Overlap) Well, give me --"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3725.639,3741.183,Example in the residency cases the duration of Shapiro against Thompson and so forth involved state AFDC and other public assistance programs and the remedy there was to extend to those who had less than a year's residence in the State.
1978.78-437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3784.786,3788.44,Denied that opportunity by whom the Pennsylvania legislative?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3788.44,3802.357,"No, no if the Court's order were to invalidate the AFDC-U program the state then could only provide benefits to families of the unemployed by using its own money entirely had been denied the opportunity to request federal reimbursement in effect."
1978.78-437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3813.141,3827.527,"Well, why doesn't the state and invariably want the broadest possible option in terms of invalidation and if it's purely optional with the state and if it's just a question how much extra federal money of the state can pick up?"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3827.527,3835.572,"Well, the argument here is apparently the State of Massachusetts would like to get some federal matching for certain families but not for others."
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3858.723,3859.366,Right.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3859.366,3865.896,"And there's no really much complication, you're rather with the State of Massachusetts has said is why were added."
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3905.559,3915.672,If you say the judge may add father and mother the Congress clearly meant father but you said the judge you can order those words that one word to mean mother and father?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3915.672,3917.96,That is extending the benefits to the classes it's been excluded.
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3917.96,3918.473,No.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,3931.582,3970.372,"That is what the state is saying but we did run in many ways runs a file of the test for remedies starting with the separability clause that is in the Social Security Act itself which provides that the invalidation of any provision of the act and we are discussing remedy of course only if the provision of the act has been held invalid as it applies to certain persons shall not effect its application to others and yet with the state is arguing for is determination of benefits to many families currently receiving them because there some reason the father, well unemployed and while his unemployment has made the family needy the father does not satisfy the primary wage earner test for some reason."
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3997.784,4005.323,"Mr. Freedman, what is the -- please refresh my recollection as to what is the procedural posture of this case, it was a class action?"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4006.791,4008.306,And injunctive relief.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4008.306,4013.05,A declaratory judgment that this statutory scheme was constitutionally invalid?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4013.05,4015.09,Correct.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4015.09,4024.119,And that's -- the Court so found wouldn't that -- shouldn't that as a matter of appropriate exercise of the judicial power be the end of it?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4024.119,4031.488,"Well, it really was the end of it Your Honor, that the Court entered its injunction on April 20th and at least I think the United States and plaintiff thought the case was over."
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4043.498,4048.147,"Why didn't the court just say I enjoin enforcement of this statute, I just found them constitutionally."
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4048.147,4049.726,Because it's unconstitutional.
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4049.726,4050.699,Why didn't you say that?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4056.708,4061.423,"Now, the Court did not rewrite it, the Court decided as between the choice it could either invalidate --"
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4061.423,4065.299,"Yes, but the statute still enforce."
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4065.299,4067.494,After it's been held invalid.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4067.494,4071.32,"The statute, the statute of the AFDC program was continued in effect but the (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.78-437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4071.32,4074.126,(Voice Overlap) statute.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4077.183,4081.026,"To the extent that changed the word “parent to father”, yes but not the rest of the act."
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4081.026,4083.087,"Well, so that reinstated the earlier?"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4083.087,4083.353,That's correct.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4083.353,4085.014,"1961-1962, I see."
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4085.014,4086.535,That's correct.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4086.535,4088.677,"Although that have been repealed, haven't it?"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4088.677,4094.133,"It had been repealed by the -- or it's been amended by the change of father, I don't believe it's been repealed the --"
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4094.133,4094.314,But --
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4094.314,4095.053,-- word have been changed.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4095.053,4095.723,-- in effect it had.
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4095.723,4105.589,"Well, why -- that still doesn't explain why they needed and injunction to require the inclusion of women?"
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4105.589,4113.209,"Well, the injunction was needed both as against the state to have it so long as it had in AFDC-U program to provide benefits in the sex (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4113.209,4115.154,Why?
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4115.154,4119.804,That that doesn't more than reinstate the 1961 law.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4119.804,4122.25,"Well, no the state could off out of the program in any time."
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4130.841,4132.412,Now been rendered the --
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4132.412,4133.68,By the Court's decision.
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4133.68,4143.216,-- now been held unconstitutional (Voice Overlap) to say I enjoined the enforcement of this unconstitutional statute.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4143.216,4146.206,Why I think the result would've been the same as this we're arguing before in this case.
1978.78-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4148.481,4153.97,Why would the state within had to decide what to do about it?
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4153.97,4156.582,"Well, to size up inner out which still the decision that it has."
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4159.02,4170.738,"Well, the Congress wouldn't to decide it, wouldn't it if the Court had held this statute, this 1967 statute is unconstitutional and I enjoined its enforcement for that reason period."
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4175.807,4177.542,That would have been invalidation of the program.
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4177.542,4177.964,Correct.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4177.964,4178.194,One of the two remedial choices (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4178.194,4184.154,It would because it was held to be unconstitutional.
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4184.154,4185.018,It would've been the sex discrimination --
1978.78-437,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4185.018,4204.954,"Then about (Voice Overlap) whether they have anything at all, any AFDC-U or to put in a sex neutral one or none at all but until the Congress acted this 1967 statute would've been held unconstitutional and the District Court would've enjoined its enforcement for that reason."
1978.78-437,2,27030,henry_a_freedman,,4204.954,4215.505,"That is not the course of course it is been followed in any of the prior cases in Weinberger against Wiesenfeld for example, the Court had the option of denying benefits to all young widows who were carrying for children in the home."
