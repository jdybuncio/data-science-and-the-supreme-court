1957.75,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,98.412,99.181,Where is that?
1957.75,0,46246,william_garth_symmers,,99.181,105.667,It's on the record at page 84.
1957.75,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1390.333,1390.865,May it please the Court.
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,3660.815,3664.774,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1957.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3892.947,3897.489,"I don't quite understand why you say -- why you say the Ryan case, I (Voice Overlap) --"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,3897.489,3898.647,In the -- in the Ryan --
1957.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3898.647,3908.437,But I had solely held that it was -- he was negligent during the work that created -- that was (Inaudible) of the contract.
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,3908.437,3916.841,"Well, the Ryan case dealt with negligence in doing the exact work to -- the substantial work which they were employed to do."
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3945.389,3953.125,Suppose -- suppose putting up this winch shelter a part of the stevedore's function?
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,3953.125,3957.311,It was -- it really didn't -- it was nobody's function.
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3966.833,3973.781,"Well, but it was -- it was something done by the stevedore in carrying out his stevedoring service, isn't that a fair statement?"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,3973.781,3975.266,It was -- it was a collateral --
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3975.266,3975.807,Fair statement?
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,3975.807,3977.176,"Yes, it was a collateral (Inaudible)."
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3977.176,3978.512,"Well, it's a --"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,3978.512,3982.847,"It was according to this -- same to say, construction employees in cold weather."
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4003.842,4022.93,"You mean to say that if I hire a contractor to build my house and his work -- and put some scaffolding in a careless way and that does damage to the house and set fire to the house, I couldn't say that he wasn't at fault of his contract."
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4022.93,4023.332,"Oh, I would think in that --"
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4023.332,4025.564,How could you bring it up and say this is collateral?
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4037.219,4038.549,"That's a breach of contract, yes."
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4038.549,4049.989,"Well, but a third outsider testify who's heard by -- he can only sue on the basis of -- of a state imposed liability to where it's tort."
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4049.989,4050.129,And --
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4050.129,4056.333,"But if I hire him to do a job well, he has to do the job well in all these incidences."
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4056.333,4057.235,I would think so.
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4107.904,4112.987,"But when it got to Boston, when it got to Boston, a new situation was (Voice Overlap) --"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4112.987,4114.296,"Yes, when at that -- when it goes --"
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4114.296,4129.189,"And the fact that the ship was negligent in not removing it, I'm assuming that, on the trip from Boston, from New York to Boston doesn't obliterate the meaning of what happened after they got to Boston."
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4129.189,4137.202,"No, when it got to Boston Your Honor, the ship turned it over to the stevedores for use as a shelter."
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4184.511,4188.147,Were those equipments furnished by the ship?
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4192.871,4193.991,In New York.
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4194.134,4204.756,"All right, it's there, when it got there, it didn't therefore as a matter of law necessarily forever made that shelter a part of the ship's equipment, did it?"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4204.756,4205.83,"No, Your Honor."
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4213.419,4216.489,"Oh, the weather in Boston can be awfully bad, isn't it?"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4216.634,4218.398,They -- they -- hasn't -- it come --
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4218.398,4225.665,"Therefore -- therefore, it became the equipment or the shelter put up there by the ship because they didn't take it off, is that it?"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4225.665,4225.832,No.
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4230.389,4237.851,"But while the ship was in -- at berth, it was the stevedores who were in charge of unloading or loading, whatever they did in there."
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4237.851,4238.966,That's right Your Honor.
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4238.966,4248.864,And it was their people who are -- who are -- who found this shelter which was put up for their comfort against the elements and there are elements also in Boston Harbor.
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4248.864,4250.297,That's correct.
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4285.31,4292.884,You can't infer because we erected a shelter that we put boards on top of it which are no essential part of the shelter's structure.
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4292.884,4302.403,"And is the jury's finding that -- that structure wasn't so much part of the ship or to allow the recovery for unseaworthiness, isn't it?"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4302.403,4305.385,There is no finding by the jury that this was part of the ship (Voice Overlap) --
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4305.385,4305.683,"Well, I mean --"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4305.683,4306.817,-- so as to render it liable.
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4306.817,4308.119,-- contrary finding.
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4308.119,4310.124,There's a -- they find it that it was not unseaworthy.
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4310.124,4313.495,"(Voice Overlap) -- not being a part of a -- of the ships (Inaudible), isn't it?"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4313.495,4313.973,That's correct Your Honor.
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4313.973,4315.5,(Voice Overlap)
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4315.5,4334.684,But there is a finding that the ship furnished it to the stevedores for use which was the basis for the finding of negligence because the Court charged the jury that unless they found that the ship furnished this for use to the stevedores and that it was defective and that the ship knew it was defective then there could be no recovery.
1957.75,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4335.101,4352.796,(Inaudible)
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4352.796,4353.278,"That's right, Your Honor."
1957.75,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4353.278,4357.306,(Inaudible)
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4357.306,4359.73,"That's correct, Your Honor, at least that the inference is correct."
1957.75,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4359.73,4371.729,(Inaudible)
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4371.729,4375.853,I don't think it makes any difference that they're a different sets of employees.
1957.75,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4386.203,4400.093,What -- what (Inaudible)?
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4400.093,4408.666,I think it's legally different Your Honor because the -- the ship had gone through a very rough voyage from New York to Boston.
1957.75,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4415.164,4417.55,(Inaudible)
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4417.55,4420.796,The -- on -- the evidence as to the condition of the weather.
1957.75,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4420.796,4422.985,(Inaudible)
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4422.985,4432.24,"Not as to those -- as a matter of fact, the evidence as to the shelter brought by the ship was that it wasn't there that there was no shelter on -- on the ship when it got into -- into Boston."
1957.75,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4437.638,4463.801,(Inaudible)
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4463.801,4464.724,The ship -- the ship would --
1957.75,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4464.724,4465.722,(Inaudible)
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4465.722,4472.476,-- would be liable if -- if it had no notice or a constructive notice of the condition.s
1957.75,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4472.476,4477.464,Wouldn't you then be liable over in that position?
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4477.464,4477.858,I would --
1957.75,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4477.858,4478.329,The ship coming --
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4478.329,4484.282,"And under those circumstances I think if the -- it was shown that we erected the structure in that way, I think that we'd be liable."
1957.75,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4484.282,4487.375,(Inaudible)
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4487.375,4497.565,"I think the difference is that there is -- that there is no proof that the -- first of all, there is proof of the ship's negligence in failing to remove that shelter."
1957.75,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4510.65,4512.384,(Inaudible)
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4512.384,4523.736,Except the proof of the captain's -- the captain and the crew that the -- this canvas on top would have not stayed on there and then the winds that they encountered unless something were to put on to hold it down.
1957.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4539.302,4552.832,"May I ask you the -- as I understand it, what you say is, there was evidence from which it could be firmed that you had not put this (Inaudible) on top of this thing, whatever it's for."
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4552.832,4553.864,That's right Your Honor.
1957.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4553.864,4560.418,But that maybe the shipowner has done it and that they owed you some kind of duty there.
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4564.863,4572.346,"Well, I think that that would -- to find that we put the boards on top, there would be a sheer speculation."
1957.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4584.29,4587.304,"So you built the shelter and when it got to Boston, it had these things on top of it."
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4587.304,4588.589,It had the -- yes.
1957.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4588.589,4602.111,"What you're claiming is it that the evidence showed beyond any doubt so that nobody could doubt it, no reasonable man could find that you had put this up on the tarp?"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4602.384,4602.838,I don't quite --
1957.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4602.838,4613.376,"Suppose you -- suppose your company put it on top, back in New York and stayed there, (Inaudible), hits your people."
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4613.376,4614.101,In New York?
1957.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4614.101,4614.454,Yes.
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4641.299,4652.15,"Well, Your Honor, I think in the -- in the -- in connection with that that the ship had a -- a contractual duty to us to remove that -- that shelter --"
1957.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4652.15,4652.512,Suppose you did?
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4652.512,4653.56,-- not to leave it there.
1957.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4653.56,4661.996,Suppose you did and yet you worked on it for some days and it has not been done.
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4673.306,4680.942,"Well, I think there would be no evidence to sustain a jury finding that we knew it was on top as to whether we should have known."
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4734.455,4752.383,"Your -- your argument if I appreciate it, I'm trying to follow it, is in effect would be -- is in effect saying that there was no shelter in New York."
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4768.283,4768.311,That --
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4768.311,4773.781,"Do you think that -- that -- you're reducing it to a situation that's just like that, isn't it?"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4773.781,4774.624,What?
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4779.917,4780.773,I understand it.
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4780.773,4781.862,And became responsible for its condition.
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4781.862,4800.571,"And that when you -- when they got to Boston there, it is as though this had been put up by the Steamship Company and it -- and it -- the result was that your man was hit and therefore it's like some other negligently constructed contrivance onboard the ship, that's (Voice Overlap)?"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4800.571,4801.818,"That in -- in effect, Your Honor."
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4801.818,4802.282,That in effect --
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4802.282,4804.172,That -- that is the -- that is the argument.
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4804.172,4805.966,That's what you're saying.
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4805.966,4820.788,"I think that in failing to remove it, that the ship adopted it as its own and in furnishing it to this -- to the stevedores for use in Boston without inspection, it was guilty of independent negligence and guilty of breach of contract which deprives us on the right to indemnity."
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4820.788,4826.148,"Well, independent, sole, that you have nothing to do with it on -- if you're right --"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4826.148,4828.251,On that -- on that basis of --
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4828.251,4828.909,"Sole, you have (Voice Overlap) --"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4828.909,4831.327,-- whatever had happened before that would have been eliminated.
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4831.327,4833.207,Yes.
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4833.207,4833.222,Then --
1957.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4833.222,4836.267,What about what happened afterwards?
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4836.267,4838.501,"Well, what happened afterwards depends, Your Honor."
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4850.269,4859.566,"Well, certainly if you had nothing to -- certainly, you have no duty of inspection if in fact you took something that the company gave you, which is your argument."
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4859.566,4860.367,"That is the argument, Your Honor."
1957.75,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4860.367,4861.338,All right.
1957.75,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4861.338,4865.511,"Mr. Gibbons, do you also say that this was a hatch tent?"
1957.75,2,37938,patrick_e_gibbons,,4870.189,4880.252,"Well, I -- I think Your Honor that it was conceded on the trial that this shelter was not a hatch tent as defined as mentioned in the contract."
1957.75,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4898.365,4900.437,Mr. Symmers.
1957.75,3,46246,william_garth_symmers,,4900.437,4906.488,I believe that Mr. Chief Justice's overview or Justice Black asked about that hatch tent question.
1957.75,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4909.202,4919.03,"The reason -- the only reason I asked it, I understood Mr. Colby to say ordinarily it was -- it was this kind of a -- of --"
1957.75,3,46246,william_garth_symmers,,4919.03,4919.418,That was a --
1957.75,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4919.418,4923.547,"-- is a closure was one, but more particularly it was the other."
1957.75,3,46246,william_garth_symmers,,4925.404,4925.775,Immediately --
1957.75,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4925.775,4926.195,-- tell me about it.
1957.75,3,46246,william_garth_symmers,,4926.195,4935.652,"-- immediately after -- the -- in the record, immediately after -- where the contract is spelled out as to what the shipowner will supply and what the stevedore will supply."
