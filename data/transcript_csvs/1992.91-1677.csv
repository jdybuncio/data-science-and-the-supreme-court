1992.91-1677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.569,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 91-1677, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Keystone Consolidated Industries."
1992.91-1677,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,12.689,15.201,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,78.252,80.974,"Mr. Wright, can I just get one question out of the way early?"
1992.91-1677,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,88.29,90.912,"Yes, the trustee could have."
1992.91-1677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,91.382,94.652,"So, this was acceptable to the trust to accept the assets in this form."
1992.91-1677,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,94.652,102.589,"--In this case, the trustee, who is also a director of Keystone Consolidated Industries, accepted the property."
1992.91-1677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,102.589,104.098,You mentioned the director.
1992.91-1677,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,113.114,113.405,No.
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,1577.188,1589.215,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1717.009,1719.831,Did it issue an opinion letter?
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,1720.582,1721.043,Yes.
1992.91-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1721.043,1724.764,--that an opinion letter issued before this transaction took place?
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,1724.764,1742.997,"The sole position administratively of the Department of Labor is the two private advisory opinions, one issued in 1981, 3 years before, approximately, these transactions occurred, one issued in 1990, 2 weeks after my client filed a motion for summary judgment in the tax--"
1992.91-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1742.997,1747.431,"Well, do we owe deference to the DOL opinion letter of 1981?"
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,1747.431,1747.919,"--I don't think so, Your Honor--"
1992.91-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1747.919,1748.53,Why not?
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,1748.53,1749.381,--for two reasons.
1992.91-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1852.478,1864.006,"Well, are you making an argument that somehow the taxpayer here did not have fair notice of the coverage of 4975?"
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,1864.006,1866.217,"--I would so argue, but I'm really making an argument--"
1992.91-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1866.217,1868.029,You have not made that argument really.
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,1868.029,1868.28,--No.
1992.91-1677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1972.255,1975.207,Is that something different than an ordinary tax then?
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,1975.207,1975.627,Yes.
1992.91-1677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.084,1985.926,"Well, the statute refers to it as a tax."
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,1989.328,1994.912,Because it... because of the magnitude and because of the purpose of the statute.
1992.91-1677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2011.471,2012.393,The what case?
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2012.393,2013.883,"--The Acker, Acker."
1992.91-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2054.389,2055.449,Is that 100 percent?
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2055.449,2059.402,"It is 5 percent for a number of years, plus 100 percent."
1992.91-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2059.402,2060.114,Of course--
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2064.045,2065.007,Correct.
1992.91-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2081.987,2088.21,Is that because Keystone has never agreed to correct the situation?
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2088.21,2089.652,--Keystone has made an effort to determine.
1992.91-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2114.371,2123.104,"Mr. Wexler, the consequence of the argument you're now making, however, is not that the section should be interpreted the way you want to interpret it."
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2133.602,2136.103,One could reasonably conclude--
1992.91-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2136.103,2138.093,"It would be a prohibited transaction, and you would have to undo it."
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2141.426,2153.394,"--No, no, no, but I think that if the statute is penal in nature, then it is a statute that ought not assess a tax unless it is fairly clear on the face of the statute that the tax is owed."
1992.91-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.394,2166.133,"So, the consequence is you don't owe the tax, but in addition to that, should we make nonprohibited what are prohibited transactions just because they haven't been made prohibited clearly enough?"
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2166.133,2169.786,Let me talk then about why we believe that they are not prohibited transactions.
1992.91-1677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.013,2442.645,This is in section 412 you're speaking?
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2442.645,2443.015,(b).
1992.91-1677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2443.015,2444.906,412--
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2444.906,2446.207,(b)(3) I believe.
1992.91-1677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2446.207,2451.23,"--Well, now the Government's petition sets out section 412(a)."
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2453.431,2455.785,412(a)... it doesn't.
1992.91-1677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2457.484,2460.457,--Where is 412(b) set out in your brief?
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2460.457,2463.309,--It is not set out in our brief.
1992.91-1677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2476.078,2480.469,"If you're going to rely on some section of the statute, you ought to set it out."
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2480.469,2485.253,My colleague advises me on pages 7 and 8 of our main brief.
1992.91-1677,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2485.253,2486.072,7 and 8.
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2488.265,2489.645,"Yes, our only brief."
1992.91-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.586,2585.258,But they don't need that for that purpose.
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2592.504,2593.454,Except for the fact that--
1992.91-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2593.454,2594.446,Why doesn't that suffice?
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2594.446,2607.221,--there was no indication... there's not a single word... and I mean a single word... in the legislative history that indicated that (c)(1)(A) was intended to apply different rules to defined benefit as opposed to defined--
1992.91-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.221,2616.438,"That doesn't carry a lot of weight with me, but it does eliminate your argument that they... I agree that there's some difficulty in figuring out what happens to the four extra parts."
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2629.588,2631.819,--But it is a strained explanation.
1992.91-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.316,2673.566,Sales or exchanges to whom?
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2683.302,2694.87,"--In order to reach that argument, they have concluded that there is an underpinning in the income tax sales or exchange cases that looks at to whom the sale or exchange is between."
1992.91-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2712.312,2714.563,"Of course, the tax cases don't--"
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2714.563,2715.034,Moreover--
1992.91-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2715.034,2720.978,"--go into to whom it is because it's irrelevant for taxation, but you have to make the decision for purposes of ERISA."
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2720.978,2730.744,"--However, if a mortgage... if a property is transferred to a pension plan subject to a mortgage, it is crystal clear who that sale or exchange is between."
1992.91-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2755.839,2762.063,I don't agree with what you just said if the mortgage is in a lesser amount than the equity in the property.
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2764.875,2771.36,"The... when a mortgage is assumed, the party assuming it pays the liability."
1992.91-1677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2828.637,2840.644,"Well, Mr. Wexler, you don't say that the only kind of sale or exchange, as described in 4975(c)(1)(A), is one that meets the definition in (f)(3), do you?"
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2840.644,2841.235,No.
1992.91-1677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2865.321,2872.817,"So, our... we simply have to figure out or courts have to figure out what the term sale or exchange in 4975(c)(1)(A) means."
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2872.817,2873.106,Exactly.
1992.91-1677,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2875.45,2885.674,I suppose there wouldn't be any question about whether or not you could satisfy any funding obligation by furnishing of goods or services.
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2885.674,2888.586,"Correct, because that is prohibited under a different section."
1992.91-1677,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.586,2899.322,"Yes, but that's just because you really know what furnishing of goods or services is."
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2899.322,2899.713,Correct.
1992.91-1677,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2899.713,2901.876,And the same with leasing--
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2901.876,2902.565,Correct.
1992.91-1677,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2902.565,2904.618,--under (1)(A).
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2904.618,2905.577,Right.
1992.91-1677,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.125,2968.248,"So, under (1)(A), leasing would be prohibited, but transferring fee title would not be."
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2968.248,2973.714,"Correct, or transferring mortgaged property would not be permitted."
1992.91-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2973.714,2980.116,"Well, Mr. Wexler, what if the employer just outright sold to the plan a piece of property?"
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2980.116,2980.987,That would be prohibited.
1992.91-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2980.987,2990.504,"And yet, it would be prohibited because it's a sale or exchange?"
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,2990.504,2993.156,For consideration I would assume.
1992.91-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2996.378,3000.93,"And yet, you continue to take the position that a transfer to meet a funding obligation--"
1992.91-1677,1,40736,raymond_p_wexler,,3000.93,3002.392,Is not intended to be.
1992.91-1677,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3248.715,3260.244,Mr. Wexler acknowledged that sale or exchange has for 50 years been construed by the courts to include a transfer of property to satisfy an indebtedness.
1992.91-1677,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3279.235,3280.707,Can I just be sure of one thing in my mind?
1992.91-1677,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3287.891,3294.136,"If it fulfills a current... if it fulfills a funding obligation to the defined contribution plan, it is."
1992.91-1677,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3294.136,3299.249,"Then why isn't (c)(3), or whatever the number is, superfluous?"
1992.91-1677,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3299.249,3308.055,It is not superfluous because there are contributions made to defined contribution plans that do not fulfill any current or future funding obligation.
1992.91-1677,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3308.055,3330.08,"--say, Mr. Wright, the language, sale or exchange or leasing, the words leasing coming after sale or exchange, does seem to me to indicate that they're talking about a person-to-person transaction, not just the regular contribution that the employer makes."
1992.91-1677,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3330.08,3337.085,"Well, those are certainly also prohibited, but sale or exchange is a phrase that's used throughout title 26."
1992.91-1677,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3346.609,3357.708,It seems to me strange to use that highly technical meaning which would cover any contribution to the plan which elsewhere is referred to as contributions in the statute.
1992.91-1677,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3357.708,3365.743,"Well, Your Honor, sale or exchange has a settled meaning, and I'm not sure it's fair to characterize it as technical."
1992.91-1677,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3393.141,3407.64,"Mr. Wright, what's your response to the argument that 412(b)(3) does say that the funding standard shall be credited with the sum of the amount considered contributed?"
1992.91-1677,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3407.64,3414.085,"Employers make large payments to pension plans, not all of which actually go into the plans to pay pension accounts."
1992.91-1677,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3432.688,3436.4,"Well, but I mean, it seems to me that that's a simple bookkeeping entry."
1992.91-1677,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3436.4,3436.931,"--Well, and--"
1992.91-1677,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3436.931,3439.763,The amount contributed... it's either contributed or it isn't.
1992.91-1677,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3439.763,3442.845,--The amount considered contributed to the plan.
1992.91-1677,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3475.727,3477.88,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
