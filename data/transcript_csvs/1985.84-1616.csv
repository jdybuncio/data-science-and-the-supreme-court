1985.84-1616,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,2.016,We will hear arguments next in Parsons Steel against First Alabama Bank and Edward Herbert.
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,9.189,23.346,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the decisions of the courts below in this case destroy the balance between the coexisting equal independent court systems that form the basis of our federal system."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,142.34,144.04,What relief was sought in the federal case?
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,144.04,150.01,"Damages on behalf of the parent corporation only and its stockholders, nothing on behalf of the trustee."
1985.84-1616,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,150.01,153.914,"Now, you said they were similar facts."
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,157.849,162.17,"At the time the complaints were filed, they were, very similar facts."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,244.322,247.091,The judgment was on the state matters.
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,247.091,248.876,"--Yes, sir, state law grounds--"
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,248.876,250.895,A recovery on state law grounds?
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,250.895,262.786,"--Yes, sir, on state law grounds, but the federal issue, that is, the preclusive effect of the first federal judgment, was fully litigated there in the state court as an affirmative defense by the bank."
1985.84-1616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,262.786,269.022,"May I just ask there, do you agree that the preclusive effect of the federal judgment was a federal issue?"
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,269.022,271.724,"Absolutely, without question."
1985.84-1616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,281.38,296.774,"Mr. Wilson, would you be good enough to tell us if the record reflects when the state court decided the respondent's post-trial motions, and when the appeal was filed?"
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,296.774,305.196,"--At the time the respondent sought the injunction in federal court, its post-trial motions were pending in state court."
1985.84-1616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,319.122,334.899,"Well, I guess the respondents take the position that the state court's res judicata determination was not final at the time that the federal injunction issued."
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,334.899,336.815,"They take that position, and as a matter--"
1985.84-1616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,336.815,342.553,But I couldn't find dates in the record to know whether that has some validity or not.
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,342.553,345.088,--It is factually correct.
1985.84-1616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,358.514,359.63,And so you agree--
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,359.63,360.514,--I agree absolutely.
1985.84-1616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,360.514,361.097,--with that?
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,361.097,361.966,Yes.
1985.84-1616,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,361.966,367.953,Exactly at what stage was the state court proceeding when the federal court entered its order?
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,367.953,374.524,The bank had filed its postjudgment motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdicts.
1985.84-1616,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.524,376.792,Judgment had been entered then or the verdict.
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,376.792,377.159,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,442.915,452.104,"Mr. Wilson, now, is a nonfinal judgment given preclusive effect under the full faith and credit clause?"
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,452.104,462.312,--A nonfinal judgment is not given preclusive effect under the Full Faith and Credit Act.
1985.84-1616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,462.312,467.882,And you concede that this was not a final judgment.
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,492.081,496.383,"Justice Rehnquist, I would confess that I have difficulty with that issue."
1985.84-1616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,517.746,532.539,"Well, so when you are talking about a final judgment, you are talking about how the Alabama court system would view that particular... what if a judgment had gone exactly as far as the one in which your client participated in the Alabama court system?"
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,539.312,539.762,Certainly.
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,554.154,562.758,What are you saying was the binding state ruling that the federal court ignored?
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,563.46,570.747,"I am saying it was the trial court's entering a final judgment on the jury verdict, the--"
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,570.747,573.349,On the state law issues?
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,573.349,581.389,"--And on the federal law affirmative defense asserted by the bank there of collateral estoppel, the preclusive effect of that earlier federal judgment."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,585.341,593.047,You would be arguing the same thing even if the affirmative defense had never been presented and ruled on.
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,593.047,598.081,--I would still be arguing that this is too great of an intrusion into state court system.
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.472,612.324,So you say the state court may finally determine the federal question--
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,612.324,612.841,--Certainly.
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.841,617.228,"--in a way that the federal court must observe, must respect."
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,617.228,617.762,Certainly.
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.762,619.514,Because of the Full Faith and Credit Act.
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,619.514,625.251,"Absolutely, and that is the nature of the independent... the independent nature of the two court systems."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,632.422,642.193,I suppose you would say then that the federal court could have enjoined the state action before judgment.
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,642.193,646.931,"As far as the bar of the Full Faith and Credit Act, yes, they could have."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,646.931,647.281,Yes--
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,647.281,647.881,I would still--
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,647.881,654.52,--It is only when they rule finally on the res judicata question.
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,654.52,662.857,"--On the merits, and that is the point that is made by Judge Hill in his dissent in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals opinion, and I think it is a good one, that you can resolve the two acts."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,691.293,713.19,"So you say that a federal court might have concluded before judgment in the state court that as a federal matter, that state court judgment should not... that state court suit should not proceed to judgment, and it would have been, as far as the Full Faith and Credit Act was concerned, that was a permissible ruling, and it involves a ruling on a federal issue."
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,713.19,715.209,"Correct, as far as the Full Faith and Credit Act."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,715.209,728.318,"But the next day, in a similar action, if the federal court waits until after judgment and the state court rules quite contrary to the federal court's view yesterday, the federal court must still observe it."
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,728.318,744.411,"I do, and I think that the reason is that the independent nature of the court systems are destroyed if you allow the Federal District Court to sit in effect in appellate review of that issue when it has been determined on the merits by the state court."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,754.184,779.667,"What if in my first example where the federal court issued the injunction before the judgment in the state court, suppose there is an appeal, and it comes up to this Court, and this Court rules that in these circumstances, in these circumstances, on the federal issue, any further litigation is precluded because the state cause of action should have been presented in the federal case?"
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,789.957,794.427,"I am sorry, Justice White, but I did not follow your question."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.014,815.338,"The federal injunction in my first example is appealed up here, and we say, well, that is quite right, as a federal matter that federal judgment precludes any further litigation on issues arising out of the same facts, period."
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,815.338,818.457,Let me ask you this.
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,822.861,823.244,Right.
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,824.111,824.963,In doing that--
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,824.963,829.765,"An injunction issued, but it is before judgment in the state court."
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,837.954,844.524,"--In that instance, there would have been no conflict between action by the state court and action by the Federal District Court."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,848.059,860.386,How about in the next case on very similar facts except that the federal court doesn't issue its injunction until after the state court rules and says there is no res judicata?
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,873.027,886.87,"--Certainly if this Court... if this Court has ruled on the issue of the preclusive effect of that federal judgment, then any court on either side of the dual system must of course respect this Court's decision on that issue."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,886.87,896.559,"I take it you say that our problem here is just to rule on the Full Faith and Credit Act, and not on the merits of the federal issue."
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,896.559,897.409,I do say that.
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,898.492,901.694,You think we should not ever reach that.
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,901.694,920.005,"I say you should not reach that in this case, because that issue, you should allow the state courts the opportunity to resolve all issues before them before a federal court intervenes to correct any wrongdoing this Court might ultimately find."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,920.005,925.642,"I see, so if the state court made a mistake, it should come up through the state system and then come here?"
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,925.642,929.696,"Yes, sir, that is exactly my position, and there is a reason."
1985.84-1616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.838,955.329,"May I ask one other question about when the timing... if I understand, for purposes of your full faith and credit argument, if the injunction had issued before the state court judgment had entered, it would be permissible."
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,955.329,958.281,"If it were permissible, and if it met all the other requirements, yes."
1985.84-1616,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,959.715,965.1,And your point is that it was after the judgment but before the posttrial motions were ruled on.
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,978.027,983.913,"That's correct, but that raises the same question as raised by Justice Rehnquist's earlier question."
1985.84-1616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1113.296,1139.097,"Mr. Wilson, would you tell me, because I am not sure if you did before, and I want to get back to my question, the respondents cite an Alabama case for the proposition that the making of a judgment... of a motion post-judgment for a new trial or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict means the judgment in Alabama law is not final for purposes of res judicata."
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,1150.487,1174.453,"--It is my understanding that the question was the res judicata effect for purposes of preclusion... excuse me, for purposes of a final judgment for collection purposes and enforcement purposes."
1985.84-1616,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1183.293,1189.279,You don't have contrary opinions of the Alabama court to cite to us on this point?
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,1189.279,1193.331,"No, I do not, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.645,1248.235,"That is a little bit different argument than you have been making, because up until now it wouldn't make any difference whether he was party to the federal suit or not."
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,1248.235,1248.918,It would make no difference.
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.411,1276.235,"Before you leave that other, do posttrial motions challenge the ruling on the res judicata point?"
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,1276.235,1278.604,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.678,1529.101,Do you argue that the court was just wrong in saying there was res judicata at all?
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,1529.101,1529.701,Certainly.
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1530.786,1539.04,Because you can withhold your state causes of action if you want to.
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,1539.04,1540.392,--My argument there--
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.392,1543.527,What about Atlantic Coastline?
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,1543.527,1551.782,"--Atlantic Coastline in my opinion, Justice White, would form a better set of circumstances to justify an injunction than this case does."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1553.232,1557.686,"Atlantic said no, did it?"
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,1557.686,1565.44,"--It did in fact, and it said that because the... as I read Atlantic Coastline, the state issues had never been heard."
1985.84-1616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.728,1616.273,"Do you think Atlantic Coastline stands for the proposition that plaintiff, like in this case, can go in and litigate his federal bank holding company issues and if he loses or if he wins, he still is free to go into the state court on his state causes of action."
1985.84-1616,0,24750,frank_m_wilson,,1620.991,1625.027,Are you assuming that he litigates those and then files a state court action?
1985.84-1616,1,36395,m_roland_nachman_jr,,1711.901,1741.337,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in 1941, this Court in Toucey against New York Life decided to answer negatively the question, does a federal court have the power to enjoin state proceedings which seek to relitigate a claim which has previously been adjudicated by a federal court and reduced to judgment in the federal court."
1985.84-1616,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.141,1779.645,"That may solve your problem under the Anti-Injunction Act, but it doesn't really cover the res judicata point, does it?"
1985.84-1616,1,36395,m_roland_nachman_jr,,1779.645,1786.383,"Yes, sir, We submit that the res judicata point is simply a red herring here."
1985.84-1616,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1794.822,1805.362,"In the Toucey case, which it's my understanding that change was designed to overrule, the state court proceedings, I don't believe they had gone to judgment."
1985.84-1616,1,36395,m_roland_nachman_jr,,1805.362,1809.698,"With all respect, Your Honor, that is not correct."
1985.84-1616,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.129,1859.247,So you say Toucey is on all fours with this case?
1985.84-1616,1,36395,m_roland_nachman_jr,,1859.247,1874.874,"Toucey is on all fours with the petitioner's argument in this case, and the Congressional response to Toucey, the enactment of the relitigation exception in Section 2283 is on all fours with this case, because that is exactly what we have here."
1985.84-1616,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1888.933,1900.074,Do you say that that is true even if there were a final judgment in the state court before the application to the federal court for the injunction?
1985.84-1616,1,36395,m_roland_nachman_jr,,1900.074,1926.808,"--Yes, indeed, Justice O'Connor, because the very thing that Congress did in 1948 was to adopt the dissenting opinion of Justice Reed and the other dissenters to the effect that a plea of res judicata and subsequent review of that plea in the state court was not an adequate remedy to protect the federal judgment, and we don't have to speculate about what the Congressional history was."
1985.84-1616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1980.21,1987.43,If you win on your... suppose you win on your full faith and credit issue.
1985.84-1616,1,36395,m_roland_nachman_jr,,1987.43,1988.632,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.632,1999.338,You still have the question of whether the federal court is right in saying that the federal judgment should preclude further state litigation.
1985.84-1616,1,36395,m_roland_nachman_jr,,1999.338,2004.508,"Interestingly enough, Your Honor, and we don't understand it--"
1985.84-1616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2004.508,2005.258,I don't either.
1985.84-1616,1,36395,m_roland_nachman_jr,,2005.258,2007.86,--but the petitioners don't even present that question for review.
1985.84-1616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2007.86,2009.129,"Well, he said he did."
1985.84-1616,1,36395,m_roland_nachman_jr,,2009.129,2015.699,Their brief says that they don't.
1985.84-1616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.28,2047.254,"It seems to me that the validity of the injunction rests not only... depends not only on the Full Faith and Credit Act, but on whether they were right on saying it was res judicata."
1985.84-1616,1,36395,m_roland_nachman_jr,,2047.254,2050.206,"--Well, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court was correct."
1985.84-1616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.206,2050.989,"Well, I know."
