1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2461.479,2475.003,(Inaudible) ought to be able to sue to set aside an arbitration award.
1963.17,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,2475.469,2485.915,"I am not arguing that, the duty to fair presentation if it were violated would provide the basis I believe pursuing satisfy an arbitration award."
1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2485.915,2492.115,There are some -- there are some cases in which the individual may bring a 301 suit set aside.
1963.17,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,2492.115,2492.718,I don't think --

1963.17,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,2493.201,2500.249,-- set aside an arbitration award for breach of the duty of fair representation as a suit that lies under Section 301.
1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.002,2510.52,"Well -- well again then, are there any suits that the individual may bring under Section 301?"
1963.17,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,2510.52,2517.091,Not to set aside or to defeat the product of federally protected collective bargain.
1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2517.143,2517.463,Because of --
1963.17,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,2517.463,2519.636,-- defeat it -- not to frustrate it.
1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.636,2526.471,The difference there is it -- wouldn't you say it's not a 301 suit rather than he wouldn't have a standing with the right to sue.
1963.17,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,2526.471,2527.36,That's right.
1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.961,2550.96,But the employer pays the arbitrator to -- or the union pays the arbitrator or somebody pays the arbitrator to come to a certain conclusion.
1963.17,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,2553.578,2563.522,"I don't think that's a breach of any right of the individual has by virtue of the contract, no, I think that that maybe very well amount to a breach but its owed to him under the duty of fair representation."
1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.839,2582.537,"No, for whatever reasons an arbitration award might be vulnerable, do you think that it's never vulnerable under Section 301?"
1963.17,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,2582.537,2583.755,That's right.
1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.771,2591.074,Would be vulnerable under -- under -- in what kind of an action?
1963.17,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,2591.074,2600.984,"Well, it might be vulnerable if it's brought in an action in the federal courts with violations of the union's duty of fair representation and it seems to me that a consequence of violation (Voice Overlap) --"
1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2600.984,2601.447,What if it's the employer?
1963.17,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,2601.447,2603.079,-- it might be set aside the award.
1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2603.079,2609.861,"What if the union is -- what if the -- its employer that's involved, assume that the employers paid the arbitrators, what happen then?"
1963.17,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,2609.861,2614.338,Well if the employer has -- either the union is involved in that adversity or it is not.
1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.338,2616.27,"Well, let's say it isn't."
1963.17,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,2616.27,2629.902,"Then it seems to me that you have a question under the union standing to sue or to get redress and the employee acting against the union, it has powers to secure redress against the union, and the union certainly has power to (Inaudible) --"
1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.902,2630.152,The -- it is --

1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2631.214,2640.328,"If the union isn't involved at all, no claim is made, your attitude is the employee hasn't -- no standing at all because it's the union who can take the action."
1963.17,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,2640.328,2647.602,"I think that we confuse the problem when we talk in terms of an arbitration award, Mr. Justice White."
1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.005,2648.293,"Well, I thought --"

1963.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.487,2651.125,-- we're talking about in this case (Inaudible)
1963.17,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,2651.125,2654.738,Well I -- I don't see this case as involving an arbitration award.

1963.17,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3306.39,3307.362,-- of the opinions.
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,3307.362,3318.019,"They cited an opinion that you had used and I think it was the Lucas Flour case, that's the case against the Brick and Clay Workers in which --"

1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4141.897,4160.283,I would say that you do not have the same situation as exists here because you got one employer and one group of employees and I would say there that the union procedure would govern that unless I don't think the union by negotiation has any right to change the plain wording of a contract.

1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4696.798,4697.31,(Voice Overlap) --
1963.17,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4697.31,4699.47,I'd like to ask you one -- I'd like to ask you one question.
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4699.47,4700.424,"Okay, alright sir."
1963.17,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4700.424,4708.928,Did the -- did either or both of the companies take a position in these proceeding on behalf of their employees?
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4708.928,4712.402,Neither of the companies took any position.
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4750.843,4759.812,"If this was a merger situation, I suppose you would concede that the provision in the contract would -- would apply?"
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4759.812,4765.928,"Mr. Justice White, if it had been a merger situation out of the older men, you'd have to buy it because of the merger."
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4765.928,4770.508,"Alright now, whom -- who do you suppose has the duty of deciding when it is a merger or not?"
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4770.508,4771.993,I think the Court does.
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4773.624,4783.112,You don't think the -- you don't think this joint -- this joint Committee has the -- has the authority under the contract to decide to what situation Section 7 applies?
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4783.112,4783.747,I do not.
1963.17,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4788.932,4789.455,"No, you have five --"
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4789.455,4789.722,Five --
1963.17,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4789.722,4790.035,-- minutes more.
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4790.035,4791.557,Yes.
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4791.557,4791.848,You got five minutes.
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4791.848,4799.166,"Well, I -- I think they've got to decide within the meaning of the contract."
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4800.477,4802.51,So they had the initial authority to decide.
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4806.091,4809.985,Well I think if they make a perfect ridiculous construction --
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4809.985,4810.176,And you could just --
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4810.176,4811.304,-- that a Court can stop it.
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4811.304,4812.216,And you think this one works.
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4812.216,4822.878,"I think it is a perfect -- just like in Saint Louis, they ran this new man, the oldest man on this new company is younger in employment than the youngest man in the old company."
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4822.878,4823.034,"Well, it seems like --"
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4823.034,4826.397,But the Detroit committed gives the young ones seniority over he old.
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4826.397,4826.477,"Well, if they --"
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4826.477,4828.145,I say that's something the court ought to correct.
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4828.145,4838.71,"Essentially, what the joint Committee did was, say, I suppose that this is the -- this is a type of an amalgamation or of an absorption to which this provision applies."
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4849.053,4849.349,Asuuming --
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4849.349,4849.822,Now --
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4849.822,4850.0,That the --
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4850.0,4851.256,"That's what they said, isn't it?"
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4851.256,4851.974,That's right.
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4852.501,4855.136,Do you say this was the -- this was a -- this is ridiculous that the court ought to --
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4855.136,4860.11,What would be wrong with them dealing fairly with their employees and telling them to begin with?
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4861.724,4862.908,"Well, this is another --"
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4862.908,4869.283,"-- the record shows that -- that Paul Priddy told the company representative down at Louisville, that's what he's going to --"
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4869.283,4870.518,Well then let me ask you this then.
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4870.518,4870.657,Yes sir.
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4870.657,4882.114,"Assuming that there had been fair -- in your mind, fair representation of both groups of employees before the Committee, the joint Committee."
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4887.368,4888.624,"Mr. Justice White, this question --"
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4888.624,4889.792,Would you still be here?
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4889.792,4899.339,I -- if I thought that they had -- had fair representation and that they had come to a conclusion and according with the contract.
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4899.339,4901.23,"Well, I know but that's another -- but sort of a --"
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4901.23,4902.902,Only a court can decide that.
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4903.952,4905.08,So you would still be here even --
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4905.08,4910.618,I would still be here if they've handed down a ruling that conflicts with that contract.
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4930.809,4945.013,"So even though a contract -- a contract says that if a particular board or Committee is to have to authority to interpret the contract and that both parties agreed that their decision would be final, the court could nevertheless second guess them."
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4945.013,4945.542,I wish I had time --
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4945.542,4946.267,On the interpretation.

1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4967.624,4967.865,"Well, I thought --"
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4967.865,4974.077,-- an allegation like that in a -- in a complaint that there has been collusion or something but who is -- who --
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,4974.077,4977.087,I did make the allegation in the complaint as strong as a -- and you have (Voice Overlap) --
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4977.087,4978.153,What kind of collusion is that in here?

1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5033.192,5034.135,-- should supervise the --
1963.17,2,29214,john_y_brown,,5034.135,5044.647,"I -- look, I still think that you haven't had fair representation if the deciding authority says that black is white and the contract says its black."
1963.17,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5056.569,5069.507,"Of you are -- your arguments about the fairness of this Dealers employees would be the same if there had been merger, a good energetic group of young employees get -- because they have been successful yet lose their job."

1963.17,3,37091,newell_n_fowler,,5525.326,5547.34,"Well, I think that the union certainly owed a responsibility to the Dealers' employees if they saw that there was a dispute that they should have deadlocked the national Committee and made the -- have the thing go to arbitration."
1963.17,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5550.791,5558.491,What is the remedy if that was not done and the workers have been deprived of their right by chicanery and fraud on the part of the union --
1963.17,3,37091,newell_n_fowler,,5558.491,5558.914,Alright.

1963.17,3,37091,newell_n_fowler,,5645.493,5653.32,I don't see how there could be a remedy if the -- if a board or a third party arbitrator decided --

1963.17,3,37091,newell_n_fowler,,5704.909,5720.437,"Well, that was the grievance of the E & L employees who sought to have the seniority lists of the two companies, telescoped or sandwiched in as its known in collective bargaining."
1963.17,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5720.437,5722.28,"Well, you had an organization there."
