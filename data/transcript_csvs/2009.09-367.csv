2009.09-367,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.57,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-367, Dolan v. United States."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,7.254,24.881,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Mandatory Victim Restitution Act makes restitution a mandatory part of a defendant's sentence for certain crimes, and it sets out two paths by which a district court can meet its responsibilities."
2009.09-367,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,65.025,86.456,Excuse me.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,105.0,105.783,--No.
2009.09-367,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,105.783,108.802,--that it's now barred from entering that judgment?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,108.802,109.335,No.
2009.09-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,133.681,135.9,And the sentence is not final until then?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,135.9,137.667,That's our position.
2009.09-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,137.667,145.238,And -- and what if -- what if the court does set a date for additional sentencing?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,148.04,149.924,"No, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-367,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,164.582,168.2,I -- I'm not sure I understood your response to my question.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,176.973,177.806,"--Yes, that's correct."
2009.09-367,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,177.806,184.56,So it can't hold a hearing over from the 90th day to the 91st day?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,184.56,185.71,"No, it cannot do that."
2009.09-367,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,199.136,208.075,"Your position is that if the court puts off the order of restitution for 90 days, during that period, the defendant cannot take an appeal?"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,208.075,213.71,"--If the court has announced at the initial sentencing that it intends to do so, no, then it cannot."
2009.09-367,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,213.71,219.345,Isn't that dramatically contrary to the way criminal appeals have been handled for a long time?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,236.139,238.175,"No, Justice Alito."
2009.09-367,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,252.666,253.351,"Yes, I understand that."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,267.759,272.496,"--I believe that's correct, because he has to have a final judgment before he can appeal."
2009.09-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,272.496,296.928,"Well, what -- what do you do about the further provision that at any time later, if the government -- or the victim finds additional basis for restitution, so long as after discovering it, within 60 days after that, the victim can come to the court and ask for restitution?"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,298.261,298.961,Well--
2009.09-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,298.961,303.496,"--I mean, doesn't that necessarily mean that there are indeed two final judgments?"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,307.215,318.756,"--That's correct, but section 3664(o) of the statute says that the initial restitution amount constitutes a final judgment, even though there can be amendment after it's been entered--"
2009.09-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.756,318.839,Where is that?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,318.839,323.223,"--In our brief, it's on page--"
2009.09-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.223,323.823,Oh.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,325.289,326.205,--It's on page--
2009.09-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,326.205,327.072,"""-- is a final judgment, notwithstanding the fact that-- """
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,327.072,329.072,"--Yes, petition appendix 60a."
2009.09-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,329.072,329.738,--Got you.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,329.738,335.928,"So that's why that has to be in there, because otherwise the defendant really would be in the position that Justice Alito--"
2009.09-367,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,335.928,349.918,"Is there any circuit court who has addressed this issue of when an appeal is timely, in a situation in which a restitution order has not been entered at the initial sentencing?"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,349.918,353.036,--Not in precisely that way.
2009.09-367,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,390.209,397.565,"In this -- when the judge did not enter a date for restitution, did you object to that?"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,397.565,400.433,"--We were not required to do so, so we did not."
2009.09-367,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,400.433,401.317,"Well, why not?"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,411.306,417.543,"Well, that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but the statute doesn't say when he has to set the date."
2009.09-367,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,430.035,432.569,"Well, I thought it says -- maybe I am misreading it."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,444.608,445.441,--Yes.
2009.09-367,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,445.441,446.708,--talks about what you do when sentencing it.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,446.708,447.158,Right.
2009.09-367,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,447.158,449.16,"And the statute says,"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,454.813,457.598,"That's correct, he did not set it."
2009.09-367,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,484.946,485.696,"No, I think that's right."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,486.779,487.062,--Yes.
2009.09-367,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,487.062,492.783,"In other words, the final determination -- the date for the -- the final determination can't exceed 90 days--"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,492.783,493.8,Right.
2009.09-367,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,493.8,500.789,--but that doesn't mean that the provision saying the court shall set a date can wait -- that he can wait 89 days to do that.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,500.789,513.596,"No, I think it would be very unwise for a district court to do that, but the court can't really set the date until it receives the information that it hopes to receive from the probation office or from the victim."
2009.09-367,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,514.263,516.315,"No, no, no--"
2009.09-367,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,516.315,517.365,It can say 90 days.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,517.365,518.75,"--It -- it could, yes."
2009.09-367,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,530.725,536.379,"This is a -- this is, in one respect, Ms. Karlan, a technical argument, is it not?"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,550.769,552.888,Yes.
2009.09-367,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,577.387,587.478,"How is your position -- how is your position consistent with the thrust of the victims' rights legislation that Congress has enacted in recent years, including the statute that's before us here?"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,615.478,616.497,"--No, I don't--"
2009.09-367,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,616.497,618.014,Do you think that's what Congress had in mind?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,618.014,621.199,"--I don't say that, and I don't think that's what Congress had in mind."
2009.09-367,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,639.862,651.301,"Yes, but wasn't -- wasn't the whole thrust of the victims' rights legislation that up to that point, Congress thought prosecutors were not sufficiently attending to the rights and the interests of victims?"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,671.964,673.416,"--No, that's not what I'm saying."
2009.09-367,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,685.307,689.676,"Well, you're not really -- you're not really answering Justice Alito's question."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,705.619,706.369,--It's--
2009.09-367,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,706.369,710.923,"And you, it seems to me, have to say: So be it; the technical rule prevails."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,713.406,719.243,"--No, my argument is Congress struck that balance, and in some cases, yes, too bad--"
2009.09-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.243,734.805,"Of course, the same thing would happen if the trial judge makes a mistake of law which causes the -- the defendant to be acquitted, so that he not only escapes the liability to the victim, he escapes any -- any criminal punishment."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,738.907,742.042,"--That's correct, and Congress here has said 90 days."
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,748.846,763.872,But Congress says -- to paraphrase and not get it accurate -- that the Department of Transportation shall enact a rule governing tire safety within 9 months from the effective date of this legislation.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,773.663,776.198,"No, generally, under this--"
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,776.198,776.548,"Of course, it isn't."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,776.548,777.048,--Because that's--
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,777.048,778.132,So how is this different?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,778.132,783.619,"--Well, this is a criminal sentencing statute which is different than a civil agency action."
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,783.619,784.888,I understand that point.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,787.238,790.625,"That is the incredibly relevant difference, for the following reason--"
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.625,790.958,Because?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,790.958,798.378,"--that finality in sentencing is important, because otherwise a defendant cannot even appeal his conviction."
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,798.378,799.128,Why couldn't he?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,799.128,800.313,Because he--
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,800.313,801.547,You just read us the provision.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,801.547,802.515,--It's not a final--
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,802.515,805.149,"The judge enters a -- an order, a final order."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,838.955,848.478,"--What's contrary to that is that the Federal courts of appeals only have jurisdiction to decide cases that come up, in criminal cases, on final judgment or under the collateral order."
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,848.478,849.144,That's right.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,849.144,849.83,This is not--
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,849.83,856.984,"It's a final judgment, and because there is another provision that says an order of restitution is itself a final judgment."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,856.984,857.65,--No.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,862.304,862.821,You read it to us.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,863.754,864.34,--No.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,865.14,865.756,What?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,865.756,879.182,"--that a sentence that includes a term of restitution can be a final judgment, even though that 60-day provision to which Justice Scalia pointed is on the books."
2009.09-367,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,890.721,891.156,"Well, why isn't the--"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,891.156,895.108,"Justice Scalia, I believe, was referring to the 60-day provision."
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,895.108,896.208,"Yes, the same problem."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,896.208,903.612,The 60-day provision is specifically immunized from the final judgment rule by section 3664(o) of the statute.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,914.734,915.336,I see.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,915.336,916.652,--and a mandatory prison sentence.
2009.09-367,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,925.541,927.809,--But isn't there a difference between those two situations?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,968.698,973.002,"Well, because this judgment of restitution is not a civil judgment."
2009.09-367,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1002.787,1009.258,"But, functionally, isn't it a substitute for the remedy that the victim of a crime might have?"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1025.768,1030.47,"That's certainly Congress's purpose, but they did it within the context of sentencing."
2009.09-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1088.774,1094.245,"Now, what -- what can the defendant do within that 90 days?"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1099.28,1099.813,That's correct.
2009.09-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1101.732,1102.565,That's 3 months that--
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1104.284,1105.167,That's correct.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1105.167,1106.469,Where does it say that?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1106.469,1109.438,"Well, the final judgment rule says that."
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1109.438,1112.207,"Well, this is a court-made rule of what counts as a final judgment."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1112.207,1112.673,Right.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1133.351,1113.79,All right.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1143.123,1143.99,--Well--
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1143.99,1156.18,"And then later on, just as in (o), if the judge does impose an order of restitution, then of course, that's appealable, and that's a different judgment."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1161.001,1164.136,--I think two things prevent that interpretation.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1164.136,1164.47,Yes.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1164.47,1166.488,"One is this Court's precedent, and let me talk about that."
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1173.559,1174.026,So you have precedent.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1174.026,1182.332,"So the precedent is, for example, this Court said in Parr v. United States, which is cited on page 12 of the reply brief, among other places, that"
2009.09-367,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1210.582,1218.671,"--So you can -- under your view, you can change the amount of jail time up to the point at which you have to set the restitution."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1233.514,1236.232,"I believe, Your Honor, that he can."
2009.09-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.152,1267.285,Must take it into account--
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1267.285,1268.287,Yes.
2009.09-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1268.287,1270.472,--if you read 3553 the way it's written.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1270.472,1271.889,"Yes, I think they must take it into account."
2009.09-367,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1274.508,1296.604,"Is there no -- is there no possibility that a judge could say: I want to make this analogous to 54(b) under the civil rules; that is, I don't want to delay the time that the defendant can appeal from the -- from the -- from the sentence."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1311.364,1328.808,"--I'm unaware of any criminal rules analogue to Rule 54(b) in the civil context, because in general, as I understand the way this Court's precedents have worked, there have been what might look like interlocutory appeals in criminal cases, but they've always involved collateral issues."
2009.09-367,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1347.436,1360.494,So the judge -- but the judge could say -- once she thinks she needs -- that they need time for more information: I'm going to defer the whole sentencing.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1384.543,1397.386,"--There's a slight complication there, but I think the answer to your question is yes; that is, the judge could delay the entire sentencing under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32."
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1403.022,1403.439,All right.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1414.145,1415.264,That's correct.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1415.264,1415.997,--for 100 days.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1415.997,1416.747,That's correct.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1416.747,1420.834,"And your remedy, then, might be to ask for mandamus, if that was too long a period?"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1420.834,1421.334,It -- it might be.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1421.868,1425.02,And -- and -- so why wouldn't that be similar here?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1434.642,1437.261,--Because you have to follow the rules as laid down.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1437.261,1437.461,"No, no."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1439.313,1439.646,Yes.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1439.646,1440.196,--and that's--
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1440.196,1442.247,"--that is, there are many mechanisms for ensuring that a victim--"
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1442.247,1444.013,"--But I mean, if I thought, for argument's sake--"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1444.013,1444.397,--You can't--
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1444.397,1456.388,"--that Congress doesn't care about whether it's after 90 days -- it was just to sort of speed things up -- on that assumption, wouldn't you still have a remedy, because it would be like the unreasonable continuance?"
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1456.388,1457.507,--That's correct.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1457.507,1458.34,That is correct?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1458.823,1462.292,If -- if you -- you can't have a continuance from the 90 days.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1463.124,1463.508,"No, no."
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1463.908,1464.408,--of sentencing itself.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.408,1465.576,--I'm thinking of the general problems--
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1465.576,1466.009,Yes.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1466.009,1467.726,--of continuances for sentencing.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1467.726,1468.392,"Yes, that's correct."
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1468.392,1471.344,And your argument is that 90 days is long enough?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1471.344,1472.078,That's correct.
2009.09-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1472.078,1472.494,Okay.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1472.494,1473.51,And I'd like to reserve the remainder--
2009.09-367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1473.51,1474.944,May I ask you one question?
2009.09-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.944,1476.296,I -- I have a question going just to that.
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1509.55,1518.906,"--I think the way that the statute is written contemplates that the judge will do the regular sentencing at which he imposes these other terms, but may keep it open for 90 days."
2009.09-367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1518.906,1521.206,May I ask this question before you sit down?
2009.09-367,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1534.248,1539.502,I'm not aware of a case that does that directly under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act.
2009.09-367,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1539.502,1541.419,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1545.639,1556.345,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To begin by addressing the question just raised by Justice Stevens, the government agrees that we are not aware of any cases that directly confront this finality question."
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1577.508,1579.108,Was it within the 90 days?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1579.108,1579.624,No.
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.043,1582.243,The restitution sentence was after the 90 days?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1582.243,1583.078,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1583.745,1589.982,"In those -- in those -- in that case, or any of those four cases, did they discuss the problem of whether there was -- both appeals were proper?"
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1589.982,1592.118,"--Justice Stevens, I'm not aware of any case that squarely--"
2009.09-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.118,1593.184,They just went ahead and consolidated?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1593.184,1594.117,"--That's correct, Justice Stevens."
2009.09-367,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1597.286,1610.444,"Under your view of things, however, that's fortuity that the underlying conviction was still in the appeal process, because there is no statute of limitations under your reading."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1622.351,1623.203,--The statute--
2009.09-367,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1623.203,1626.321,"And absent prejudice to the defendant, that would be okay?"
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1626.321,1629.107,"--Absent prejudice or some sort of double jeopardy problem, that's correct."
2009.09-367,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1638.546,1644.367,"I'm sorry, that's 60 days after the restitution order has been issued."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1644.45,1646.15,"--I believe that's incorrect, Your Honor."
2009.09-367,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1670.583,1675.634,--That 60 days says after there has been an -- a restitution order.
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1679.604,1681.154,That's correct.
2009.09-367,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1681.154,1684.592,That says there's no restitution order.
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1688.21,1689.927,"It is -- it is certainly not okay, Your Honor."
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1703.404,1709.658,"But it -- it -- it's sort of a ridiculous consequence that 5 years later, and the judge who tried the original case is dead."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1735.439,1736.808,"--Your Honor, I don't think it is our proposal."
2009.09-367,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1746.645,1752.549,"Well, the consequence is the usual consequence when trial courts make errors, which is to appeal."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1752.549,1772.628,"--Your Honor, I think this Court said in Montalvo-Murillo what the consequence is in this category of cases, which is when a trial court fails to comply with a mandatory time limitation for doing something that the court is required to do, the remedy is -- unless Congress provides otherwise, such as it does in the Speedy Trial Act, the remedy is not a loss of the power on the part of the court to act."
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1772.628,1775.98,Doesn't the statute establish time limits for filing an appeal?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1775.98,1777.432,"The statute does, Your Honor."
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1777.432,1779.316,Does it -- does it state a remedy for it?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1784.353,1785.003,Justice Scalia--
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.003,1785.603,Same thing here.
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1785.603,1794.359,--There's a critical difference between a statute of limitations for filing a notice of appeal and what's happening here that's illustrated by the example given by Judge Gorsuch in his opinion for the courts of appeals.
2009.09-367,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1819.093,1828.365,"Except that that was a bail question, where there's not issues of finality at play, and bail is a question that repeats itself throughout the proceedings."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1873.511,1875.863,--We cited the things we cite in our brief.
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1920.308,1934.549,"Okay, now suppose -- now we're getting to exactly the point where I thought your co-counsel, your sister counsel had a good point that I wasn't -- hadn't thought through, and that is what happens now in -- on day -- we're finished the trial."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1957.331,1957.847,Yes.
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1957.847,1960.199,The answer is because of this provision?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1960.199,1963.335,We think because of that provision and because of general principles of law.
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1963.335,1963.601,"Whoa, whoa."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1988.2,1990.902,That certainly establishes the general rule that this Court has said repeatedly--
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1990.902,1991.235,Yes.
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1991.235,1993.52,--that the jurisdiction of the Federal courts is established by Congress.
2009.09-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1993.52,1994.686,"Well, I just want to make clear where we are."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2001.79,2003.959,The defendant in our view is required to appeal--
2009.09-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2003.959,2004.376,Must?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2004.376,2016.783,"--Once the district court enters a judgment that imposes a sentence of imprisonment, if the defendant wishes to appeal that sentence of imprisonment he has 14 days to do so following the entry of the judgment, yes, which is the normal rule in Federal criminal cases."
2009.09-367,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2016.783,2017.468,And if he misses--
2009.09-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2017.468,2023.789,Even though -- even though he says the restitution shall be held in abeyance pending receipt of information?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2023.789,2030.109,"Well, to the extent that he has an objection to the district court's -- it depends on the precise circumstances of the case, Justice Kennedy."
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.299,2041.584,Let me see if I understand this.
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2058.276,2058.878,Absolutely.
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2058.878,2064.532,"On the same grounds on which he would have appealed the -- the sentence of imprisonment, right?"
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2064.532,2066.632,"Well, it -- to the extent--"
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.632,2070.27,"If -- if it's an error in the trial, he claims: I was innocent."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2070.27,2071.536,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2071.536,2071.97,No?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2071.97,2080.476,"To the -- his time for appealing from the judgment of conviction runs from the entry of the judgment of conviction, which is contemporaneous with the imposition of the sentence of imprisonment."
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2083.578,2086.88,"Well, I suppose it's no -- no imprisonment; it's supervised release."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2088.232,2093.534,"--If it's -- if the judge imposes a sentence of supervised release, I am not aware if there is a specific statute."
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2093.534,2106.959,"Yes, but I mean, what's bothering me about this, and I'm not aware -- but you're quoting a sentence that wasn't in your brief and what I hadn't taken in at all is the extent to which this is inextricably mixed up with the rules of appeals, which are very important."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2130.742,2134.361,"Justice Breyer, first and foremost, the Court doesn't need to say anything about any of these issues."
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2134.361,2134.777,Why not?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2134.777,2141.364,For one very simple reason: The only thing that this defendant has ever attempted to appeal at any point is the order of restitution.
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2143.63,2162.028,"Yes, but if -- but I have to be able to write my reasons, and in doing that I have to respond to the argument of the other side, which is that the strongest reason for thinking Congress intended this to be final and not beyond 90 days is that if you don't do that, you muck up the rules of appeal."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2164.744,2178.72,"A couple of reasons, Your Honor: First of all, I think it's actually one of the strongest arguments against their position, because it creates the unlikely scenario where it will be routinely -- we know that Congress has authorized these determinations to be made up to 90 days after the imposition of sentence."
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2190.445,2193.647,Which is just what you say he has to do if the sentence is supervised release.
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2193.647,2198.117,"What I'm saying, Justice Breyer, is I -- I -- I know there is a statute that governs imprisonment."
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2201.319,2203.355,What was that statute on imprisonment?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2203.355,2206.39,"18 U.S.C. 3582(b), Justice Scalia."
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2219.614,2220.147,I've got it.
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2220.147,2224.248,--which is the rules governing finality with regard to an order imposing restitution.
2009.09-367,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2224.248,2241.944,"--Mr. Heytens, one problem with the -- we have said that notice of appeal -- that that time limit is jurisdictional, which means if the defendant misses that deadline, no appeal."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2291.858,2293.626,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.09-367,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2305.515,2327.095,"But that -- that would mean even if the judge says, I'm going to impose the restitution order 10 days from now, defendant's time clock for notice of appeal would begin at -- at the time the sentence is imposed, not 10 days later when restitution is--"
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2327.095,2328.28,--That's correct.
2009.09-367,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2351.175,2362.447,"Counsel, let's -- let's suppose there's no 3664(d)(5), and we're back to just 363(a)(1), which says when sentencing a defendant, the court shall order restitution."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2370.47,2372.171,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2009.09-367,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2372.771,2380.342,"So you think even without 3664(d)(5), the judge can say: I know it says when I'm sentencing I've got to order restitution."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2382.377,2384.479,"--Mr. Chief Justice, let me amend my answer slightly."
2009.09-367,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2387.098,2388.381,"Yes, but nothing happens if he doesn't."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2389.064,2390.216,"--Well, the question then becomes one of a remedy."
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2408.862,2410.463,Why don't we go back to my hypothetical--
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2410.463,2410.797,Sure.
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2410.797,2413.665,"--and just substitute the word ""fine"" for ""supervised release""."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2413.665,2426.223,"Justice Breyer, I'm -- I'm fairly certain there is a statute that addresses the finality when it comes to a sentence that imposes a term of a fine, which is similar to the statute that addresses finality of a judgment of conviction that imposes only a term of imprisonment."
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2426.223,2430.608,"I'm not -- I'm not an expert in this area, as you can see."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2448.839,2453.557,"Justice Breyer, to address your very specific fine question, there is in fact a statute that addresses that as well."
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2476.756,2480.124,Can the (o) -- you remember -- you know what I'm referring to by (o)?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2480.124,2481.124,"--Yes, Justice Breyer."
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2481.124,2481.29,All right.
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2489.23,2490.296,"Absolutely, Justice Breyer."
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2522.784,2523.834,Even though there's no amount given?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2523.834,2525.069,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2533.759,2534.542,May I ask this--
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2534.542,2542.28,"Simply because when you state an amount, that amount can be amended later, that leads to the conclusion that you need not even state an amount?"
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2552.053,2555.022,"Well, Justice Scalia, the district court is not permitted to do any of this."
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2557.455,2560.49,"I understand that, but district courts don't always do what they are supposed to."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2562.523,2565.859,"--It's true that, regrettably, district courts sometimes don't do what they are supposed to."
2009.09-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2576.683,2577.599,--May I ask this hypothetical?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2591.776,2601.631,"--Justice Stevens, just to make sure I understand -- I want to make sure I understand the hypothetical -- it's that the district court sentences him, enters a judgment of conviction, and then 90 days later imposes an order of restitution?"
2009.09-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2601.631,2601.931,Correct.
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2601.931,2602.381,Okay.
2009.09-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2610.32,2613.289,But he -- he can appeal just the restitution order.
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2613.289,2614.972,"Just the restitution order, in that situation, yes."
2009.09-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2619.443,2619.809,"No, I understand that."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2619.809,2621.009,--in the circuit court of appeals.
2009.09-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2621.009,2629.549,You attach no significance to the fact that in this case the judge said: I shall order restitution?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2634.285,2641.356,"We think this makes it an easier case, in terms of it establishes that there is no conceivable prejudice to Mr. Dolan as a result of the delay in this case."
2009.09-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2641.356,2652.997,"Let me ask you this question: If we conclude there's a hole in the statute that Congress has to amend, is it more likely that Congress will cure the statute if we rule for you or if we rule against you?"
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2656.716,2657.568,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
2009.09-367,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2670.726,2676.279,"--So this then becomes a goal, not a time line -- a deadline?"
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2676.279,2680.647,"--I think -- at some point, it becomes a debate over precise wording, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.09-367,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2694.84,2709.684,"--So a -- a defendant who is sentenced to a week in prison, and he decides, that's no big deal, I'm not going to appeal, and then finds out, you know, 90 days later he has got to pay a million dollars in restitution, is just out of luck, right?"
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2709.684,2712.184,"--Well, that would be -- yes."
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2782.76,2785.11,"Look, you straightened me out, from your point of view."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2787.479,2788.012,Sorry.
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2788.498,2793.3,Because I think you said that the defendant is just out of luck.
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2808.31,2809.327,That's our--
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2809.327,2817.581,"And then you said (o) applies, and (o) says that a sentence that imposes an order of restitution is a final judgment."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2842.199,2842.466,--No--
2009.09-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2842.466,2843.499,I've got to figure this out.
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2843.499,2844.835,"--I apologize, Justice Breyer."
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2888.444,2895.415,--This criminal judgment of restitution -- I assume it's the judge who finds that the victim suffered so much money?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2895.415,2896.698,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2896.698,2898.8,Does he find that beyond a reasonable doubt?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2898.8,2899.6,"No, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2900.319,2901.469,Just more likely than not?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2901.469,2902.969,"--That's correct, 366."
2009.09-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.969,2905.271,And it's a criminal -- it's a criminal judgment?
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2905.271,2906.587,That's what Congress has provided.
2009.09-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2924.748,2943.712,"I suppose that an answer to the Chief Justice's concern about the 1-week sentence and -- and he's not concerned -- is that all criminal defendants know that an adjudication of guilt is preclusive of later issues with -- with respect to civil -- civil liability, and they take their chances."
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2962.572,2964.607,"That's certainly correct, Justice Kennedy."
2009.09-367,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3069.751,3075.822,"So, your argument is 90 days> [""] means the same thing as ""without undue delay""?"
2009.09-367,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3075.822,3078.707,"We don't think it means the same thing, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.09-367,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3095.384,3097.336,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3099.169,3109.791,I have three points -- excuse me -- to make: The first goes to what the remedy is here and what the error is here.
2009.09-367,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3130.269,3134.156,They couldn't do that until the end of the 90 days.
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3140.81,3152.052,"No, Justice Sotomayor, because had the -- had the government on October 28 looked and said, there's no restitution order in this case, they could have filed an appeal then under Rule 4, and they would have won."
2009.09-367,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3154.435,3163.591,"Well, that's rather theoretical because if that -- I mean, the -- the judge surely would have acted before he could process an appeal."
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3163.591,3167.478,"--Well, he lacks actually the -- the power to do that."
2009.09-367,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3177.249,3177.999,But that's not true.
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3182.337,3183.337,"--Yes, I have."
2009.09-367,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3183.337,3189.157,"--Those do appear to say that once there's a term of imprisonment, that that constitutes a final judgment."
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3189.157,3196.728,"But they do so in the context of Section 3553(a), which is cited on page 6 of the yellow brief, which says"
2009.09-367,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3221.895,3222.328,It can also include forfeiture.
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3224.678,3227.713,--I don't know the rule for forfeiture.
2009.09-367,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3258.882,3270.307,"What is the difference -- in response to the last argument that your opponent made, what is the difference between the provision here and Rule 32(b)(1) of the criminal rules, the court must impose sentence without unnecessary delay?"
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3270.307,3274.259,"--There, the question is, did it do it without unnecessary delay?"
2009.09-367,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3281.079,3283.198,So if the -- I didn't understand the answer.
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3289.701,3291.051,No.
2009.09-367,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3299.455,3303.025,"Before you do that, tell me what the government appeal would consist of."
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3304.575,3307.477,--And the judgment of August 8th became final.
2009.09-367,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3307.477,3313.297,--And you -- you tell me the court -- the court has no ability to impose restitution after 90 days.
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3313.297,3313.73,That's right.
2009.09-367,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3314.097,3314.666,What's the use of appealing?
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3314.666,3319.884,"--Because on appeal you say the court erred, and it imposed an illegal sentence--"
2009.09-367,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3319.884,3320.903,And the appellate court says too bad--
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3320.903,3321.32,--No--
2009.09-367,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3321.32,3322.036,--90 days are up.
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3322.036,3323.605,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-367,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3335.227,3337.096,There is no time limit on the mandatory minimum.
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3337.096,3354.807,"But the -- but -- but, Your Honor, if the government appeals an illegal sentence, that sentence can be corrected and the new mandate from the court of appeals saying you erred in not imposing mandatory restitution starts the 90-day clock again."
2009.09-367,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3356.423,3358.759,"Could you go back to -- could you go back to Justice Alito's question, because--"
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3358.759,3359.009,--Yes.
2009.09-367,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3359.009,3361.127,--that was exactly the same thing.
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3385.093,3385.676,No.
2009.09-367,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3385.676,3394.181,"And if you read it that way, it's fairer to the defendant, and you don't have to worry about the restitution appeal because of (o)."
2009.09-367,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3399.752,3407.672,The principle that there must be one sentence that determines each of the punishments for a particular crime.
