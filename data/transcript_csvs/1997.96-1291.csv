1997.96-1291,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.946,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1291, Delores Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc.--"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,10.068,12.469,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1291,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,63.573,81.554,"What would happen in the case if the day after the release is signed, but before any money changed hands, the employer says, we've made a mistake, it's a good faith mistake, we didn't know about the ADEA, we want to rescind the release?"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,81.554,88.02,"Well, Your Honor, pursuant to the statute there is a revocation period of 7 days after the release is signed."
1997.96-1291,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,88.02,88.639,"No, but this is the employer."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,88.639,89.991,I understand.
1997.96-1291,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,92.943,94.035,"Well, let's change the hypothetical."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,96.145,97.347,--7 days after it.
1997.96-1291,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,114.327,115.418,But in other words you couldn't have--
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,123.884,124.645,"No, sir."
1997.96-1291,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,132.54,134.83,"Well then, he wouldn't have to pay... he wouldn't have to pay any of the money, either?"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,138.384,145.859,"--Well, the problem with not having to pay the money, Your Honor, is that the waiver includes, and particularly in this case, many other actions, other than a waiver of ADEA--"
1997.96-1291,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,145.859,150.781,"That's, it seems to me, one of the points, is that this might very well be valid as to everything but the ADEA."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,150.781,151.543,--And I believe that--
1997.96-1291,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,151.543,158.616,"There's a lot of talk on void and voidable, but this covers so many claims that it seems to me that's something that may be more of a problem for the respondent than for you."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,158.616,161.758,--I believe it would be void to the ADEA claims.
1997.96-1291,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,162.409,182.483,"As to them, then, the employer can, on day eight, say, I'm not going to pay anything insofar as it might be attributable... let's assume, keep the example, that he broke down the various considerations and said, with respect to this particular claim I'm not going to pay anything because it's void, because it violates the statute."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,186.215,191.117,"--That's correct, Your Honor, that would be, and the plaintiff can go forward and pursue their age discrimination claim in court."
1997.96-1291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.117,213.082,"But in order to determine how much harm we're doing by saying these things are void from the outset I think we should be realistic and know that most of them do not assign a certain amount of money to the ADEA release and a certain amount of money to various other releases, and I doubt very much, when it's not broken out that way, whether you can say the contract is valid in part and invalid as to that one little item."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,228.822,236.668,"Well, I think Congress has clearly spoken here that if the waiver drafted by the employer does not comply with the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act--"
1997.96-1291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,236.668,237.048,Right.
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,237.048,240.13,--That waiver is nonenforceable--
1997.96-1291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,240.13,243.621,"Therefore that portion of the contract is bad, and I would say the whole contract is bad."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,243.621,247.224,--because I do believe the other portions of that waiver remain valid.
1997.96-1291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.55,262.775,"So all the employers who have these, have made these commitments can now simply stop paying money."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,262.775,276.523,"If they choose to stop paying money and have not enumerated out which moneys are going to be designated for which rights are being waived, then I believe the plaintiff has a simple right of breach of contract for all other rights that they had signed, if the money has stopped."
1997.96-1291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,276.523,280.096,"No, but a contract is... you can't pick apart a contract like that."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,281.578,282.537,"Well, I--"
1997.96-1291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.537,283.308,"What do you mean, he's breached it?"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,288.313,288.824,--I--
1997.96-1291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.824,289.252,The full amount?
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,289.252,299.28,"--I agree, Your Honor, I believe that's one of the practical problems of this case, and that's why the tender back at the very beginning of a case to bar plaintiff to going into court is very prac... impractical."
1997.96-1291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.28,316.37,"What I am worried about is, you are destroying cause... you are destroying entitlements to these payments on the part of all older workers who have been terminated, including the majority of them who do not have any ADEA claims."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,327.198,331.24,"Well, I believe that's what Congress has established--"
1997.96-1291,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.24,344.45,"Well, Ms. Haynie, we aren't sure about that, because Congress did not expressly say such an agreement that fails to comply with these requirements is void, as they have done in some other legislation."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,357.787,358.368,--That's correct.
1997.96-1291,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,358.368,361.269,Voidable at the option of the person defrauded.
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,368.205,379.753,"I believe the phrase, may not waive, is tantamount to announce, or proclaiming void any waivers which do not comply with the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act for those rights secured under the ADEA."
1997.96-1291,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,379.753,380.424,But why?
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,477.29,479.75,"Your Honor, with regard to the practical--"
1997.96-1291,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,479.75,486.503,"It's not practical, it's legal, and what I'm asking is, why would Congress have wanted that result?"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,486.503,496.54,--Congress was very clear in enacting this statute to protect the rights of older workers when negotiating with employers when they're forced out of the work place.
1997.96-1291,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,531.112,532.845,We're not talking about the same thing.
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,567.827,568.538,Well--
1997.96-1291,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,568.538,574.311,So what is the big problem about... that you're worried about?
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,574.311,577.654,"--The problem is twofold, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,594.244,596.806,"Well, can a proportionate share be determined?"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,599.988,606.342,"The proportionate share can be determined at the end of the litigation, when a trial judge has taken into--"
1997.96-1291,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,606.342,611.465,"Well, I thought courts have routinely said they are unable to make that kind of a determination."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,612.837,614.366,"--Well, if you--"
1997.96-1291,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,614.366,618.441,"You get a... you either have to give it all back or none, as I see it."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,620.691,634.222,"--If you require the plaintiff to tender back all the money received, then it is the employer who receives the windfall there, because the employee has waived many other rights under that waiver."
1997.96-1291,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,637.244,648.039,"But if you say the contract is void, then what you're doing is saying that the ADEA tail wags the State law dog with respect to all releases."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,656.985,659.357,"No, I don't believe that, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,666.292,667.363,"Ms. Haynie, suppose--"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,699.554,710.13,"No, I am making that argument, Your Honor, that again the statute speaks specifically to ADEA claims, and those are the... that is the waiver that is void."
1997.96-1291,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,722.129,734.175,"What if it was just an ADEA claim here, so that we didn't have the problem of breaking out a partial amount, and the... would you say that the employee did not have to tender it back?"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,734.175,736.197,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,745.584,749.206,"The plaintiff just gets to keep it, then?"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,749.206,751.467,"--Well, there's a concern with regard to equity amongst the parties."
1997.96-1291,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,751.467,752.609,"Well, there's a considerable concern."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,752.609,754.73,It can come at the remedial phase of the trial--
1997.96-1291,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,754.73,755.03,"Well, but--"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,755.03,755.942,--with either an offset--
1997.96-1291,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,755.942,758.974,"--Well, supposing the plaintiff loses at the trial."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,758.974,770.74,"--I believe that part of the incentive in complying with the statute is a loss of that money, the severance pay, if you do not draft a valid waiver under the Older Worker Benefits Act."
1997.96-1291,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,770.74,771.081,You mean--
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,774.381,778.295,"Well, this is... we're not dealing with the law of contracts."
1997.96-1291,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,778.295,783.208,"Well, you may be dealing with the law of contracts except as Congress has otherwise provided."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,787.791,791.344,"I believe, Your Honor, that it's warranted in this case."
1997.96-1291,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,796.229,797.921,We don't ordinarily get into legislative history.
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,797.921,802.574,"And I understand, Your Honor, but Congress' intent to occupy this entire area."
1997.96-1291,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,814.791,837.378,"No, but you don't have to have judicial common law development with respect to the protections of this statute, I suppose, in order to recognize that if on a void contract there is a total failure of consideration the employer at least would have the right to bring action for the return of the consideration that he has furnished, and do you deny that he would have such an action?"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,837.378,841.89,"Your Honor, to require the tender back would be to engraft on the statute--"
1997.96-1291,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,841.89,842.972,I'm not talking about tender-backs.
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,885.999,892.754,"--Well, Your Honor, there may be some State claims in restitution or unjust enrichment that the employer could bring."
1997.96-1291,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,892.754,893.652,That's what I'm talking about.
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,893.652,894.113,Certainly.
1997.96-1291,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,894.113,894.954,"You're not denying that, are you?"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,894.954,896.604,"No, certainly I'm not denying that."
1997.96-1291,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,896.604,897.345,Okay.
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,897.345,897.866,And to try to place the--
1997.96-1291,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,897.866,908.712,"And you're not denying, in fact I think you suggest it, that if your client should win, quite properly if the employer has brought his claim there could be a set-off against the recovery."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,908.712,910.044,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,910.044,910.865,"Ms. Haynie, could I--"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,924.126,929.349,"It's possible, Your Honor, but I believe the trial court will be in the best position, after all the evidence is taken in--"
1997.96-1291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.349,929.86,Well--
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,929.86,931.44,--to assess the values of this claim.
1997.96-1291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.44,932.171,--is that right?
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,956.785,958.547,"Well, Your Honor--"
1997.96-1291,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,958.547,968.594,"I mean, that is what is called an aleatory contract, a contract that depends on future events to some extent, as does any waiver of rights."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,985.215,988.187,--I believe that is what the trial court is going to be charged with doing.
1997.96-1291,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1010.212,1011.844,Let me ask you a factual question.
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,1061.965,1071.843,"Well, I could tell you factually for this situation she was an at-will employee, and certainly these waivers contain... I've never seen a waiver that just contains an ADEA waiver."
1997.96-1291,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1071.843,1072.143,Right.
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,1072.794,1074.774,They contain numerous other waivers with regard to Worker's Compensation.
1997.96-1291,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1074.774,1075.645,"--be crazy not to, but in fact, do you--"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,1075.645,1076.276,All other waivers.
1997.96-1291,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1076.276,1080.078,--Is there any way for us to know whether it's really covering anything else in most cases?
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,1080.078,1082.571,I believe that the language of the waiver--
1997.96-1291,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1082.571,1096.72,"Oh, I know what the language of the waiver says, but I mean, in fact, are there any real claims... is there any way for us to know whether there are in fact any substantial claims in most of these cases, other than the age claim?"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,1096.72,1105.845,"--Well, if the plaintiff brings the suit, obviously, or files her claim against... files her claim with the EEOC, or, you know, the State regulatory agency--"
1997.96-1291,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1105.845,1109.366,"This would waive title VII claims, too, I suppose."
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,1115.661,1116.642,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1116.642,1128.409,"But apart from State law claims and title VII claims raised with sex discrimination, would there be anything else that might be included in that?"
1997.96-1291,0,17730,barbara_g_haynie,,1128.409,1131.331,"Well, there's Workers' Compensation claims."
1997.96-1291,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1134.594,1136.013,"Thank you, Ms. Haynie."
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1140.598,1145.02,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1291,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1196.116,1197.996,"Well, is it void or voidable?"
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1211.997,1212.656,We believe--
1997.96-1291,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1212.656,1215.307,So why isn't it voidable at the instance of the employee?
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1215.307,1222.793,"--Your Honor, we do believe it goes beyond that, the requires provision of information, a lot more protection than the common law."
1997.96-1291,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1224.263,1224.884,"Well, is it void?"
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1224.884,1228.207,"--We believe that the waiver of the ADEA claim is void, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1247.541,1252.172,"What is it... is it divisible in most cases here, do you think?"
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1252.172,1253.474,I think it may very well be.
1997.96-1291,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.632,1301.468,"Ms. Brinkmann, if the void waiver leaves the parties where they were, then doesn't someone who is asserting that the waiver violates the statute by bringing a lawsuit, doesn't that person have to return... in order to be consistent in the pleading, doesn't the person have to return whatever money that person has acquired under the contract?"
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1301.468,1302.577,"--Your Honor, we--"
1997.96-1291,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1302.577,1303.188,You say it's void.
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1303.188,1304.66,--No.
1997.96-1291,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1311.744,1312.214,Right.
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1312.214,1315.618,And that means that that waiver violates the statute.
1997.96-1291,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.618,1315.958,Right.
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1315.958,1317.918,So it's an illegal waiver.
1997.96-1291,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.918,1318.9,Right.
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1323.803,1324.544,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.544,1325.993,Otherwise you're being inconsistent with your theory.

1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1343.617,1344.645,--The problem--
1997.96-1291,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.645,1350.21,"And then if you lose you keep the money, but if you win, oh, I'll cough up the money, but I'll get more."
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1350.21,1351.862,"--The problem is the statute, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.851,1354.904,The Congress... the statute says nothing about this.

1997.96-1291,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1355.465,1356.473,The statute says nothing about it.
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1356.473,1366.381,"--But you are creat... you would be creating another condition precedent to bringing suit, and Congress was very clear about what was required in that event, and it--"
1997.96-1291,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.381,1368.772,Where was that clarity manifested?
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1368.772,1369.453,--We believe in--
1997.96-1291,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.453,1370.353,What section of the statute?
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1370.353,1371.855,"--In 626, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.491,1390.697,"We know that, but you're saying that Congress made expressly clear that no tender back would be required."
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1391.405,1393.488,"--Well, Your Honor, we believe that--"
1997.96-1291,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1393.488,1396.461,I thought you said Congress made expressly clear.
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1396.461,1397.592,--Yes.
1997.96-1291,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1415.735,1418.035,What does that have to do about tender back?
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1418.035,1425.852,"--Because tender back, Your Honor, was to put up the money to counter the presumption of the validity of the contract, and here it's to the contrary."
1997.96-1291,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1429.315,1432.427,"That certainly is not an express provision about tender back, is it?"
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1432.427,1434.758,"--No, but Your Honor, in case--"
1997.96-1291,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1434.758,1435.439,I thought you said it was.
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1435.439,1443.045,"--No, because I think that the tender back clearly conflicts with the purposes and the construct, the mechanism which Congress created."
1997.96-1291,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1443.684,1446.566,"Ms. Brinkmann, may I ask you to address a specific point there?"
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1481.861,1482.851,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1519.755,1523.537,"In other words, I will... I offer to pay you back if I get the money from which I can do it."
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1523.537,1534.655,"That's an offset remedy, and I just have to urge the Court to realize that to adopt the court of appeals approach would be to put the workers exactly back where they were before enactment of the statute."
1997.96-1291,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1534.655,1547.121,"Well, are you saying that we have to enact as a matter of Federal common law some rule about tender-back, or do we look to State law to see what the normal contract situation would be?"
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1547.121,1547.802,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1551.795,1555.937,"Well, we... suppose we don't find an express provision in the statute governing tender-back."
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1560.802,1561.453,"--No, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1561.453,1564.953,Or do we try to create some Federal legal principle to cover this?
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1564.953,1565.444,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1569.497,1571.489,"Well, where do you get the offset authority?"
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1571.489,1574.07,--The equitable authority of the court.
1997.96-1291,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1576.811,1580.054,Why does the court have equitable authority at the end of the case but not the beginning?
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1580.054,1601.699,"Congress gave it remedial authority in 626(b)... or... yes, 626(b) of the act, and made clear all the remedies that the court could give, and it's important to realize that at this point if this worker has to make a choice of whether to have the severance pay or a waiver, that worker is exactly where they were before passage of the act."
1997.96-1291,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1601.699,1602.48,I don't understand that.
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1667.521,1668.192,Your Honor--
1997.96-1291,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1668.192,1675.638,"Now, that seems to me an obvious point, but no one mentions it, and therefore I must be missing something, so I want you to tell me what I'm missing."
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1675.638,1682.291,--I think Your Honor is pointing out the fact that it's unclear whether a worker could even avoid this waiver if they wanted to enforce--
1997.96-1291,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1682.291,1682.562,No.
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1705.469,1707.158,"--Again, Your Honor, we don't believe so."
1997.96-1291,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1710.601,1716.094,"If it's not enforceable, why... it's the fourth time I've said the exact... I must be not be saying it well."
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1734.067,1735.068,"--Your Honor, may I answer?"
1997.96-1291,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1735.068,1735.597,Yes.
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1735.597,1740.892,At common law there could... we don't want to preclude that there would never be an unjust enrichment situation.
1997.96-1291,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1751.378,1753.391,"Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann."
1997.96-1291,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1753.391,1753.93,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1753.93,1757.212,"Mr. Phillips, we'll hear from you."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1757.212,1759.712,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1777.395,1781.768,"Mr. Phillips, let me just raise a question that... you know somebody's got to ask you a question about this."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1806.803,1809.536,--If they do not pay it... no.
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1821.085,1823.276,What is your defense to the suit?
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1825.239,1826.098,No.
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1832.112,1835.205,Why should she have to... what in the statute compels her to tender anything back?
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1835.205,1837.168,Nothing in the statute compels her to tender it back.
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1839.679,1843.76,"You say she has not... you say there's just no waiver issue at all, then."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1843.76,1844.671,"I've lost the waiver issue, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1870.607,1873.129,But if she had never signed a contract she wouldn't have to do that.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1876.542,1878.752,If we had given her money in return--
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1878.752,1884.876,"Say she signed no document whatsoever, and you just said to her, we think you've been a wonderful employee, we don't think you're going to sue us, here's a lot of money."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1886.168,1888.258,--Of course she'd have to give that back.
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1889.75,1891.231,To bring an ADEA suit?
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1896.583,1897.635,--As I understand the State common law--
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1897.635,1901.329,"Would you... I'm asking you, would you have a defense to this case if she had not signed a release?"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1901.329,1903.269,--If she had not signed the release.
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1907.162,1910.903,So the heart of your defense is the fact she signed a document that she has not rescinded.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1910.903,1912.005,"--No, but that's not... no."
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1928.205,1930.527,If you want to avoid a release.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1937.633,1942.427,"--You can construe it that way, but that's not the way the common law views it."
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1944.859,1945.367,I agree with you on the common law entirely.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1953.845,1975.778,"--I will go back to the Court's opinion in United States v. Olano, which draws a clear distinction between waiver, which is the knowing and voluntary relinquishment of a known right and the implications of that, and it's a narrow concept, and a forfeiture of your rights which arises because you don't fulfill your independent common law duties, and that's what we have here, is an independent common law duty to put forward the consideration."
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.778,1978.83,But that duty would not arise unless she'd signed a waiver.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1978.83,1980.242,That--
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.242,1984.993,"Mr. Phillips, your argument does not assume that the waiver is valid."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1984.993,1985.785,--No.
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.785,1988.106,It just assumes that the waiver was signed.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1988.106,1988.647,Correct.
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.647,1989.766,Isn't that quite different?
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1989.766,1990.477,Yes.
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.938,1992.688,It's essential to your case that she signed a piece of paper.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1995.821,1996.392,That's correct.
1997.96-1291,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1996.433,1996.843,But it--
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1996.843,1999.444,"--Indeed, we readily concede that it's an invalid waiver."
1997.96-1291,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2000.256,2007.07,"--It's essential to your case that she signed the piece of paper, and that the piece of paper has the effect that Justice Stevens has been positing in his question."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2012.234,2025.032,"I understand that, Justice... Your Honor, but the bottom line here, the problem with that is, is how far are you going to take statutory language to do damage to the common law, and basically what this Court--"
1997.96-1291,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2025.032,2052.958,"Or you might pose the question, how far are you going to allow a common law process in effect to thwart the statute, and if, in fact, we are correct in the intuitive assumption that has been suggested here, that in most of these cases in which this is going to be a serious question the worker is simply not going to be in a position to make the tender, then, in fact, on your theory the statute is a dead letter."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2052.958,2058.416,"--Well, let's step back for a second, because that is... there is no support anywhere, empirical, that I know of, that that's true."
1997.96-1291,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2064.617,2065.118,"Yes, but the statute hasn't been."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2078.167,2084.601,"--Well, no, but there have been principles by which one can void or declare unenforceable contracts for 200 years, and there has been a tender-back requirement that applies to that."
1997.96-1291,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2084.601,2086.072,But the tender-back--
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2095.178,2096.069,"Yes, that is my general understanding."
1997.96-1291,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2096.069,2099.09,So there might not be a tender-back requirement.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2099.09,2099.581,"Right, if it... if--"
1997.96-1291,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2099.581,2101.291,If it were totally void.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2101.291,2102.671,"--That's correct, if it's totally void."
1997.96-1291,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2109.936,2114.771,But your argument depends upon our determining that the waiver is voidable.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2114.771,2115.823,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2116.771,2119.032,"And if, in fact, it's void, we're faced with something else."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2119.032,2119.663,--That's correct.
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.663,2120.394,Why--
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2120.845,2122.355,"I agree with that, because--"
1997.96-1291,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2122.355,2134.714,"--In response to Justice Stevens' point that I still think we'd better get straight, if we're the trial court, you don't say that the suit cannot proceed because the money was not paid back."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2142.628,2144.14,--That's correct.
1997.96-1291,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2144.14,2146.791,But the statute says the individual can't waive.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2146.791,2158.669,"But the point of the ultimate... the significance in terms of how the law operates, and it's true in Louisiana as it is in every other State, that is, if... you know, the fundamental principle is, you pay back as a condition."
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.217,2170.598,Mr. Phillips--
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2172.227,2186.696,"Well, the FELA is exactly on point in my favor on this, Your Honor, because there the language of section 55 says as plainly as possible any contract or device to limit the liability of an employer is void, and it says it in so many words."
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2186.696,2188.769,But that's significant in this case for another reason.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2201.649,2204.64,"Well, that goes back to Justice Scalia's question about severability."
1997.96-1291,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2204.64,2208.684,Your point is that the FELA language about void does not find a counterpart in the ADEA.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2208.684,2209.245,Exactly.
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2224.054,2224.873,But there's a very good reason.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2234.83,2235.381,But it doesn't--
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.381,2236.192,It didn't say void.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2236.192,2236.561,--It doesn't say that either.
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2236.561,2239.823,"It says, it shall not operate as a waiver of this narrow claim."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2239.823,2240.124,Right.
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2241.536,2245.546,"But you can't give effect to that language, as I understand your position, and still say she has to tender back."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2245.546,2256.236,"--But Your Honor, if the position of the common law would have set aside the contract for reasons of coercion or duress or fraud or any of those other reasons, it's still, under those circumstances, no more than voidable, and so it would seem--"
1997.96-1291,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2256.236,2283.403,"We have an example, Mr. Phillips of State law... of a State law that says may not waive, do you agree that that's... the essence of this case is for us to construe what those words mean, may not waive, and I take that to be an instruction to the employer as well as to the employee, so may I ask you to respond to the question that I put to Ms. Haynie?"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2329.032,2339.36,"--Because the language has to be... I mean, you can look at may-not-waive on its own, but the truth is, it's a part of a provision that is designed to modify a very discrete element of the common law."
1997.96-1291,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2363.186,2364.415,"No, just may not waive this one claim."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2364.415,2366.198,But this one claim is--
1997.96-1291,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2366.198,2367.277,And you think they can waive... they can waive it?
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2367.277,2369.4,"--No, of course not."
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2397.908,2398.459,Mr. Phillips--
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2398.459,2400.429,The context is very narrow and specific.
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2400.429,2410.809,"--Mr. Phillips, I am surprised at your concession that if this contract is void the employee can keep all the money that he received."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2419.357,2419.665,Right.
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.665,2424.881,"--If I hire you to murder someone and give you money, I can't get my money back, or--"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2424.881,2426.791,That's what I thought the question--
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2426.791,2427.642,--if I pay you to fix prices or something like that.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2427.642,2428.013,--Right.
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.013,2436.387,"But where a contract is void because the deal between the people is not... for example, void for want of consideration."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2443.721,2444.021,No--
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.021,2444.803,--Can I not get my money back?
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2444.803,2447.404,"--No, I was using void in the much more stringent term."
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.404,2447.684,"Well, I--"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2447.684,2449.286,"Which is the one I think that the question invited, was--"
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2449.286,2450.737,"--Well, let me put it to you squarely."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2455.041,2455.438,--Of course.
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2458.48,2461.553,Then you can't say that a void contract leaves everybody where they are.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2463.155,2464.645,"--No, you're absolutely right."
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.121,2473.009,Not every void--
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2473.009,2473.36,"--No, you're right."
1997.96-1291,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2473.36,2488.681,"--And this is not one of those, so in this case I take it your position... is it your position in this case that if this Court holds that the entire waiver is void, that any employer can sue to get the entire... in effect can sue to rescind the contract?"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2488.681,2490.984,I would assume that that follows quite naturally.
1997.96-1291,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2490.984,2491.373,All right.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2491.693,2493.896,And frankly I haven't heard word one from the other side to counter that.
1997.96-1291,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2493.896,2496.268,--My question is... and I don't know the answer to this.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2528.638,2532.87,"No, that... no, and I don't know who taught you first-year contracts, but my understanding--"
1997.96-1291,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2533.361,2533.992,He was very good.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2537.795,2545.051,"But my understanding of first year contracts is that if you come forward you have to bring back the entire consideration, and that is clearly the law--"
1997.96-1291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2545.051,2545.802,Wait... wait.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2563.343,2563.874,--I would say voidable.
1997.96-1291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2563.874,2564.585,It's invalid.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2564.585,2565.306,"Invalid, un--"
1997.96-1291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2565.306,2565.507,It's gone.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2566.598,2567.139,--Correct.
1997.96-1291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2567.139,2602.711,"At that point, we have a human being called a worker who has some money that the employer paid him, and I would have guessed, because I don't remember the course that well, that he is entitled, the employer, to get back the money to the extent that the employee has been unjustly enriched, and I would think that he has been unjustly enriched only to the extent that he received money for a promise not to sue which is invalid, i.e., only in respect to the ADEA claim."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2602.711,2603.122,He--
1997.96-1291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2603.122,2613.028,"And therefore, what happens all the time in unjust enrichment, we have difficult questions to look into, and therefore he wouldn't get back [dollars] 6,000 here."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2618.363,2623.206,"--Well, I mean, that is a rule that could have been adopted, but it is not the rule that was adopted--"
1997.96-1291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2623.206,2623.567,Where?
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2623.567,2625.176,--and I think the reason is is because these are difficult--
1997.96-1291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2625.176,2626.919,Which rule wasn't adopted where?
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2626.919,2631.66,--The tender-back requirement requires you to tender back the entirety of the consideration.
1997.96-1291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2632.021,2633.731,Entirety of consideration for what?
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2633.731,2636.272,--For the severance that you signed.
1997.96-1291,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2636.272,2638.105,"Well, but severance only if the--"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2640.516,2644.329,"Well... no, we didn't... no, that's not true, Your Honor."
1997.96-1291,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2644.329,2644.62,I'd--
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2644.62,2646.179,The assumption was that it is unenforceable.
1997.96-1291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2646.179,2648.25,"--All right, I'll take it... I'll go to voidable, and--"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2648.25,2648.581,Right.
1997.96-1291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2672.336,2673.938,--The entirety of the consideration for?
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2673.938,2676.78,For the underlying dispute between the parties.
1997.96-1291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2676.78,2677.431,For that portion--
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2677.431,2678.16,"No, I don't think it is."
1997.96-1291,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2678.16,2695.872,"--In other words, if he was paid [dollars] 10 million as part of a golden parachute, and the entire... and just in that golden parachute contract, which is 48 pages long, there's only one line talking about a promise not to sue, he has to give back the whole [dollars] 4 million, or [dollars] 10 million?"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2695.872,2710.711,"It seems like an unjust result, but as I understand the basic hornbook rule... I'm not saying there couldn't be exceptions that would exist, but if you're looking for the hornbook rule, and the rule as it exists in Louisiana, at least in cases that don't pose that question, it's pretty consistently that you bring back the entirety of the consideration, and let's be--"
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2710.711,2713.583,"Mr. Phillips, I used to teach first-year contract--"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2715.196,2716.766,--I must say I'm happy I--
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2716.766,2717.276,He was not my teacher.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2755.311,2755.692,--That's correct.
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2755.692,2759.525,"And the one horse that did win, I only paid 20 percent of the whole thing for that ticket."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2766.541,2774.996,"No, and I don't mean to press that rule, and I ought to step back, because it seems to me what this tells us is you ought to look to the common law, and you ought to see how the States apply these principles rather than--"
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2774.996,2775.984,I'm interested in that.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2786.122,2797.369,"--No, although that might be a suitable vehicle for deciding this case, but as it happens the law in Louisiana is exactly the Federal common law, law rule, and so it doesn't make any difference."
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2800.281,2801.093,It's nice to know what we're doing.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2810.249,2811.589,"--Oh, absolutely."
1997.96-1291,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2811.589,2812.78,--to several questions--
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2812.78,2813.281,Absolutely.
1997.96-1291,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2813.281,2814.39,--that it didn't cover in the statute?
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2814.39,2816.622,"Absolutely it did, but the real question is, if you--"
1997.96-1291,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2816.622,2823.415,"Well, do you think... are we really dealing here with whether we should construct some principle of Federal law to fill in a gap?"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2823.415,2824.006,--No.
1997.96-1291,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2824.006,2824.887,Is that what we're talking about?
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2824.887,2825.218,No.
1997.96-1291,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2843.4,2843.841,May I ask--
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2853.748,2855.912,--Right.
1997.96-1291,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2855.912,2863.995,"The other case is a case like this in which, let us say, there might have been some substantial State law claims that were released as well as the ADEA claim."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2868.029,2869.459,Yes.
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2886.061,2888.002,"Mr. Phillips, can I ask you another question?"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2916.911,2919.234,"Well, that doesn't answer the question, though."
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2920.723,2921.374,What question doesn't it answer?
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2921.374,2925.738,It doesn't answer the question whether you have an obligation to tender back as a precondition--
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2925.738,2930.922,"It says it shall not be enforceable, period, regardless of whether you're able or willing or not to tender back."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2936.746,2943.329,"--No, because that gives a meaning to the word waiver that is much broader than that term is entitled to carry."
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2943.329,2945.571,"The meaning is, it shall not be enforceable as to that narrow claim."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2945.571,2946.041,That's correct.
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2946.041,2946.77,Yes.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2946.77,2947.451,But it doesn't mean--
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2947.451,2950.473,And that's much broader than the statutory language that says you may not waive that claim.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2950.473,2956.397,"--But all that says is... and again, I think it's inappropriate to read that just as, may not waive."
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2968.227,2975.941,"Which, they put the employer on notice that if they want this to cut off the ADEA claim they must comply with these provisions, which your client didn't comply with."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2975.941,2976.502,--That's correct.
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2976.502,2980.182,"Therefore, you have a perfectly valid document as to everything except the ADEA claim."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2980.182,2980.753,Right.
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2980.753,2984.616,So I don't understand why that doesn't fit the plain language of the statute.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2984.616,2990.601,"Because what fits the plain language, Justice Stevens, is, in the ordinary case she has an age discrimination claim."
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3038.976,3042.368,"It's the last part that's not in the statute, that you're bringing in against those common law doctrines."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3048.593,3049.182,But I--
1997.96-1291,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3049.182,3050.764,--which your client did not comply with.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3050.764,3068.074,"--But... and I understand that, but then I go back to the Court's opinion in United States v. Texas, where it says, when Congress sits down and tries to modify the common law, we do not presume that Congress means to undo any broader than Congress states expressly in the language of the statute itself."
1997.96-1291,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3086.748,3133.408,"But if the common law in a State were not the unreasonable position that a may-not-waive provision leaves both sides powerless, so the contract is construed, as Justice Stevens suggested, to cover everything else that could be covered to dispose of anything the parties could dispose of, but just as though it weren't there, the thing that they can't dispose of, so the common law, let's, say, in New York or New Jersey was not as you described it to be in Louisiana, could we then say that for these kinds of claims the Age Discrimination Act is going to mean one thing in one State, another thing in another State, or that there will be the Federal common law so that you'd have the same rule in all the States?"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3133.408,3146.965,"I think the farthest you can go with Federal common law is to deal with precisely how you analyze the precise waiver, because that comes from the statute, and if you have interstices within the application of 626(f), it seems to me those you would clearly fill in by reference to--"
1997.96-1291,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3146.965,3162.797,"Well now, in Hogue, which you say doesn't directly apply here because in FELA Congress said it's going to be void, but nonetheless at the end of the day in Hogue the Court said we're going to require an offset at the end of the day."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3177.275,3184.809,"--Well, it seemed clearly to be crafting a principle of Federal law, and I'm not sure the approach the Court followed there would necessarily be the course they would follow here."
1997.96-1291,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3184.809,3186.201,Maybe it should do that here--
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3186.201,3186.631,No.
1997.96-1291,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3186.631,3188.062,--and does that partially meet your concern?
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3188.062,3207.396,"Well, obviously, as between having an opportunity to get some money back at the end of the day or not, undoubtedly my client would prefer that alternative, but the truth is, what we seek to have vindicated here is the common law rule, recognized in all 50 States and as a matter of Federal common law, that you must come forward with the consideration at the outset of the litigation."
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3207.707,3217.123,"Mr. Phillips, to come back to Justice Ginsburg's question, what if there were different rules in Louisiana and New York, would a suit in New York come out differently?"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3217.123,3218.852,--If we're talking--
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3218.852,3219.513,If New York did not--
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3219.513,3221.374,--If we're talking about no tender back requirement?
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3221.374,3222.696,"--No... well, a proportionate tenderback."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3225.557,3229.301,"Yeah, my instincts are to say there ought to be different rules in those cases, that Congress--"
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3229.301,3229.842,For different States.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3229.842,3232.153,"--Yes, because Congress would have looked to the State--"
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3232.153,3248.212,"What if New York had only adopted that rule for this statute, for an ADEA case, could it... could New York say, in ADEA cases, given the nature of this statute and what-not, we're going to adopt that rule, although in all other cases in New York we won't do it?"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3248.212,3251.604,"--I mean, they... well... can they adopt that rule, that question is yes."
1997.96-1291,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3270.628,3274.621,I think maybe we'd get into a lot of difficult questions if we say this is governed by State-by-State law.
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3275.01,3285.738,"--Well, but that's true in lots of Federal statutes, Your Honor, and at least with respect to 626 and the important elements of protection of Federal law that are embodied in there, I'm not saying you look to State-by-State law there."
1997.96-1291,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3292.322,3292.541,--Could this--
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3292.541,3300.607,"But when you get out of that mold, then it seems to me you almost certainly in general look to State law, because that really will tell you the answer for most day-to-day primary activities--"
1997.96-1291,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3300.607,3301.076,--Mr Phillips--
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3301.076,3302.068,--and that's my personal preference.
1997.96-1291,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3302.068,3310.743,"--Could we solve the problem this way, by saying that the tender-back requirement can be looked at as essentially a remedial condition."
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3343.705,3346.256,"What's wrong with that is, that's not the scheme Congress adopted."
1997.96-1291,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3346.256,3348.568,"Well, it's also, what if the plaintiff loses the suit?"
1997.96-1291,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3348.568,3350.28,That's the other side of it.
1997.96-1291,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3375.517,3376.158,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
