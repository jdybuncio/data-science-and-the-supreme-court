1982.81-827,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.041,We will hear arguments next in Jefferson County Pharmaceutical against Abbott.
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,82.682,86.386,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-827,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,127.335,146.72,"I suppose on the status of this case, which was decided basically on the basis of the complaint, we have no idea what percentage of the pharmaceutical products were sold to indigent sick or what part to the public in general."
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,146.72,167.118,"Justice O'Connor, we do not have any firm statistics with that regard, although a thorough investigation was made prior to filing the complaint, and that investigation did reveal plenty of facts sufficient to substantiate the complaint, with the exception, of course, the ruling of the district court."
1982.81-827,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,167.118,184.783,Would you agree that many states or local governments in states do and have traditionally undertaken to provide medical care and services to the indigent sick?
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,184.783,194.824,"I would agree, Justice O'Connor, that many states have undertaken to provide care to the indigent sick."
1982.81-827,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.337,212.785,"You would concede that it is in some states, I suppose; those who since statehood have assumed that responsibility?"
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,212.785,224.218,"--I agree that some states have assumed part of that responsibility, but I could not agree that it was a traditional governmental function of states or counties to provide--"
1982.81-827,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.218,227.327,Even in states which have done it since statehood?
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,227.327,240.728,"--Well, Your Honor, I state this based on not only... with regard to indigent services, that may be true."
1982.81-827,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,489.907,498.825,"Mr. Tucker, if you prevail here, will there be any spill-over effect on military exchanges?"
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,498.825,501.636,"No, sir, I don't think that that would apply."
1982.81-827,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,502.447,503.055,Why?
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,503.055,523.299,"--The case of Champaign-Urbana News I believe spoke to that issue, a similar issue, except that in that case, Champaign-Urbana News sought to apply the Robinson-Patman Act to the Secretary of the Army and Secretary of the Air Force."
1982.81-827,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,531.406,537.277,"Did you, by any chance, have lunch in the Court cafeteria this noon?"
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,537.277,538.681,"No, sir, I didn't."
1982.81-827,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,538.681,540.198,You know we have one here in the building?
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,540.198,541.353,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-827,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,541.353,550.24,"If you prevail here, do you think there would be a spill-over effect on the cafeteria here?"
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,550.24,553.472,"No, sir."
1982.81-827,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,557.816,566.642,Would you distinguish it on the grounds that that's maintained chiefly for the convenience of personnel working in the building?
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,566.642,567.546,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-827,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,575.591,581.069,But it is open to the general public and is used by the general public.
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,581.069,582.414,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-827,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,582.414,586.084,Did the Chief Justice say the cafeteria was maintained chiefly or cheaply?
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,612.293,622.774,"If that were the case, Your Honor, and they were in direct competition, of course, the difference here is federal versus state and local."
1982.81-827,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.548,662.163,"Well, in the Chief Justice's example, there's still the possibility that the Robinson-Patman Act might not apply where there are sales to a government entity which then itself engages in activity that is competitive with private business."
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,669.803,671.051,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-827,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.812,687.826,They aren't just buying for the purpose of running a hospital.
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,687.826,689.106,"--No, sir."
1982.81-827,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,689.106,697.899,"Which... the hospital would be competitive, perhaps, but they nevertheless aren't... here they're reselling."
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,697.899,721.062,"The hospital may be competitive with other hospitals, and I think that from Justice O'Connor's comment there has been some recognition that some hospital activities, although it's not, according to the case of Swain versus Milford City Hospital, Inc., it's not a traditional governmental function."
1982.81-827,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,737.807,765.918,"Would you concede that to the extent that the state operated its public hospital and its pharmacy within that hospital only for the benefit of the indigent sick that the state undertook to care for, that even under your test, the Robinson-Patman Act would not apply?"
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,765.918,771.26,"Your Honor, I think that would depend entirely on the facts of the case."
1982.81-827,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,779.212,786.925,Or sold very cheaply to people who qualified as indigents who couldn't afford otherwise to buy them.
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,786.925,805.057,"--Well, I would have to say, Your Honor, that if drugs were sold and they were sold in competition with private enterprise and they were obtained through discriminatory price bidding, then they would have to fall within the proscriptions of the Robinson-Patman Act."
1982.81-827,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,806.309,819.162,Wouldn't that have the effect of discouraging states and local governments from providing certain forms of assistance to the indigent sick?
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,819.162,822.192,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe so."
1982.81-827,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,987.921,998.761,"Your case only reaches situations where the resale is available to the public generally, I take it."
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,998.761,1000.418,That's correct.
1982.81-827,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1000.418,1006.416,"So you don't think it would reach post exchanges, which are just restricted to the military."
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1006.416,1007.539,That's correct.
1982.81-827,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.539,1009.087,Or whoever they're restricted to.
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1009.087,1009.742,That's correct.
1982.81-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1020.049,1024.829,"Well, what if the University of Alabama said we'll only let students patronize the drug store?"
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1024.829,1030.265,--They would only let students patronize the drug store?
1982.81-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.265,1030.779,Yes.
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1030.779,1034.511,I don't think the students would be covered.
1982.81-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.511,1038.01,"Well, the students aren't covered, but are the drug stores covered?"
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1049.271,1050.207,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1050.207,1057.925,So I take it you've just excluded the University of Alabama drug store if they say nobody but students can buy here.
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1061.937,1066.0,Faculty and staff members could purchase.
1982.81-827,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1066.0,1066.546,Yes.
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1068.967,1069.872,That's right.
1982.81-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.872,1071.889,And how about students?
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1071.889,1080.276,"In my understanding of students, it would not apply, according to my reading of Abbott Laboratories versus Portland Retail Druggists."
1982.81-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.276,1091.503,"So then, the only competition you're talking about is the extent to which the university drug store sells to members of the general public who are not either students or faculty."
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1091.503,1093.301,That's correct.
1982.81-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1093.301,1096.409,What about families of the faculty or families of the students?
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1096.409,1099.251,"They could purchase, also."
1982.81-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1105.482,1108.856,"If that's the case, it's construing an exemption from the Act."
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1110.559,1111.417,"--No, sir."
1982.81-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1119.977,1125.694,"Well, this is a very different theory from Mr. Teegarden's theory that you quote I think three times in your briefs."
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1135.798,1143.655,"Well, Your Honor, I would say that Mr. Teegarden's theory is what I'm saying--"
1982.81-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.655,1145.561,"You see, his theory came before there was any 13c."
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1145.561,1146.529,--Right.
1982.81-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1165.224,1167.755,What is the legal basis for your saying this?
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1180.046,1181.469,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-827,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1245.456,1250.845,Is it possible that it was enacted only to aid the charitable institutions?
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1254.14,1272.165,"--Well, if I may point to the legislative history of that, Justice O'Connor, Representative Walter's testimony... and that's found on pages 8 and 9 of our Reply Brief, and on pages 11 and 12 of the Amicus Brief of the National Association of Retal Druggists."
1982.81-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1392.975,1394.772,Let me interrupt a minute.
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1404.721,1405.94,"--I think so, Your Honor."
1982.81-827,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1674.968,1679.251,--May I ask you a question before you sit down?
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1688.543,1690.618,"No, sir, we did not get that far."
1982.81-827,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1690.618,1693.055,"You don't have any record other than the pleadings, do you?"
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1693.055,1695.163,No record other than the pleadings.
1982.81-827,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1695.163,1697.195,Decided on the motion to dismiss.
1982.81-827,0,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,1697.195,1698.693,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-827,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1698.693,1709.081,Mr. Klingsberg.
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,1709.081,1712.486,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1859.282,1876.495,Do you have any instances in that legislative history of where the committee reports or individual congressmen or senators addressed expressly the sales for resale matter?
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,1881.21,1884.848,--There was discussion--
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1884.848,1887.987,"--I've read your briefs, but I didn't notice you ever picked out a particular instance like that."
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,1887.987,1888.331,--Right.
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1895.998,1901.543,"That may have been in a hearing, but nothing on the floor or in any committee reports."
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,1901.543,1917.694,"--Well, in the committee... in a written brief which Mr. Teegarden submitted, he was asked the question: would the bill prevent competitive bidding on government purchases below trade price levels."
1982.81-827,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2024.93,2038.317,"Mr. Klingsberg, with respect to the instances in 1951 and 1953 where you say that Congress rejected efforts to amend the Act, were there bills that actually were... hearings were held on in committee?"
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2040.049,2054.59,"--Not in the 1951 and 53, but in 1968 and 69, there were extensive hearings before a subcommittee of Congress on small business which dealt with this very problem."
1982.81-827,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2154.44,2158.235,What was the purpose of that committee report?
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2163.811,2180.946,"--I think the purpose was to consider the problem which was set before it at great length and to make recommendations which was a recommendation to the administrative agencies that they should enforce the Act as against the private, charitable hospitals."
1982.81-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2370.477,2390.907,"Mr. Klingsberg, isn't it possible that in 1938, Congress didn't particularly consider the primary line competition problem because your principal focus was on the secondary line I think, in the Teegarden testimony at least, and that the assumption that it didn't apply was simply based on the assumption that you wouldn't have competitive injury in the normal case where there are sales to the government."
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2390.907,2404.325,"--Your Honor, I think there are government agencies, in addition to the three that might be governmental in that Act, which compete, would sell for resale--"
1982.81-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2404.325,2406.852,"I understand it's conceivable, as this case demonstrates."
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2418.742,2422.427,"--Well, public transit competes with private buses."
1982.81-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2442.31,2443.324,That's my very point.
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2456.489,2459.566,"Why would they pick, for example, libraries?"
1982.81-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2461.098,2462.097,That was in 38.
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2462.097,2463.536,--In the 38 Act.
1982.81-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2537.911,2542.582,What do you think is the strongest case or opinion supporting your position?
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2542.582,2550.889,"If Your Honor please, I think that there has to be a conglomeration of all of the factors we have here."
1982.81-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2554.483,2558.277,I understand the accumulation of arguments.
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2564.665,2566.837,--One--
1982.81-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2566.837,2572.912,"If you had to pick out the one authority that you wanted to really rest on, would you pick one?"
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2572.912,2579.722,"--I don't think I could pick one more than the other, except perhaps Mr. Teagarden's written statement."
1982.81-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2579.722,2583.909,"But he emphasizes competition, is the problem with that."
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2587.75,2589.654,He says that's a further reason.
1982.81-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2589.654,2590.484,Yes.
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2590.484,2594.777,But I think that really--
1982.81-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.777,2598.746,He doesn't categorically say that no sale to government could ever be covered.
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2598.746,2609.412,"--Well, he says that eliminates the possibility, meaning there is no possibility, but I prefer to take the conglomeration of facts."
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.903,2634.31,Could I ask you--
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2634.31,2635.074,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.074,2652.693,"--what you think the limits of the exemption for sales to churches and eleemosynary institutions, do you think... an exemption for purchases that have... and use that have some relation to their function?"
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2652.693,2667.531,"I think Your Honors defined that in the Abbott case, in a very complicated way for hospitals, and I suppose if that were, contrary to the plain wording of the statute, extended to every single governmental agency--"
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2667.531,2671.731,"Well, I just want to talk about the eleemosynary institution."
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2688.459,2689.801,--They wouldn't be exempt.
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2689.801,2691.193,Why not?
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2691.193,2693.424,Because it wouldn't be for own use.
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.424,2698.142,"Well, they are certainly using them to make some money."
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2698.142,2699.986,I think own use means--
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2699.986,2707.981,"So you think that that exemption then is limited to own use, the '38 Act."
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2707.981,2709.389,--That's what the statute says.
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.389,2714.882,"Yes, and you wouldn't include within own use resales."
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2714.882,2717.132,Not for profit.
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.132,2722.771,"But you think the exemption for governmental institutions, which you say was pre-existent--"
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2722.771,2723.71,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2723.71,2726.6,--covers resales as well as anything else.
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2726.6,2730.816,"I'd say it covers everything, that it was never intended to be covered in the first place."
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2735.644,2755.788,"Yes, yes, but why do you... but you yet have to come up with some support in the legislative history to indicate that the government exemption which you say existed from the very start covers purchases for resale as well as just purchases."
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2755.788,2756.618,--Yes.
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2768.474,2792.745,"I know, but I still want you to find me some express mention of purchases for resale anywhere in the legislative history, where somebody gives the opinion that the government may decide to go into competition with private industry and purchase goods for resale and direct competition, and that that was exempt."
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2792.745,2793.977,--I can only--
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2793.977,2795.492,"Well, there isn't any, is there?"
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2795.492,2797.602,--There is not any explicitly.
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2799.443,2803.269,Any more than there is for private institutions.
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2803.269,2807.005,--In the original statute?
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2807.005,2809.316,"No, under the '38 Act."
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2809.316,2812.234,That's explicit in the Act.
1982.81-827,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2812.234,2827.496,"Are you speaking, strictly speaking of an exemption in the same sense that the '38 Act conferred an exemption on eleemosynary institutions, or are you speaking simply of a failure to include within the Act in the first place?"
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2827.496,2829.337,"The latter, Your Honor."
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2829.337,2838.785,Although it is pretty hard to say that the literal words of the statute doesn't cover sales to government.
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2847.879,2848.331,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-827,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.408,2851.315,But the words in plain black and white--
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2851.315,2881.582,"--The Court in the past has said, for example, in regard to the Sherman Act where there is no expression of intent one way or the other, that that would apply to cities, for example, in the Lafayette and Boulder case, but here we have a whole host of indicia which the Court has traditionally applied in terms of analyzing the purpose, context, legislative history, post-enactment history, et cetera, and--"
1982.81-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2881.582,2884.674,"--Mr. Klingsberg, may I ask you a question--"
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2884.674,2885.002,--Yes.
1982.81-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2885.002,2886.192,--just give you a chance to comment on it?
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2905.681,2913.882,"I don't know if this is proper argument, but I spoke to them... I spoke to the proper person in the Justice Department, and they said, this is a question of pure statutory intent."
1982.81-827,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2918.44,2924.376,"Within context, when--"
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2941.012,2972.937,"Your Honor, Representative Patman stated in his book that the Attorney General of the United States has ruled that the Act does not apply to government, meaning federal government, and it may be presumed that his reasoning may also be applied to municipal and public institutions, so Representative Patman said in 1938 that he, the sponsor of this bill, the man whose name appears, did not think that it applied at all to governmental purchases."
1982.81-827,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2972.937,2976.34,"That is somewhat post-legislative history, isn't it?"
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,2976.34,3024.149,"But it's the same time, Your Honor, as the 1938 Act was proposed, and it doesn't seem to make any sense to say that Congress in 1938 would have had a partial exemption for just three kinds of governmental entities and left the dozens of other governmental entities subject to the Act without any even own use exception, which would be a very far-reaching kind of holding, and very unfair and illogical to have in the one sense transit, parks, recreation, et cetera, et cetera, all apply without any exception at all, and to just pick these three, schools, hospitals, and libraries, and say, well, those are the only three to which we will give a partial exception."
1982.81-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.106,3133.904,May I ask you one other question that I have thought of and that is not discussed in the brief?
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,3151.331,3158.97,"--Yes, Your Honor, and as a matter of fact, this very point was brought to the attention of Congress at great length in the 1968 hearings."
1982.81-827,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3467.925,3470.234,May I just put one extreme example?
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,3470.234,3471.376,Yes.
1982.81-827,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3471.376,3504.376,"Assume that the post exchanges that are now all over the world where there are government forces stationed were proving to be modestly profitable, and the government decided to go into the supermarket business, calling them post exchanges, and opened them in competition with the chains of food supermarket stores around the United States, so that you had a Safeway and a Giant and a government PX, all open to the public."
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,3511.201,3512.562,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-827,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3531.692,3534.957,They do not sell to retired reserve officers.
1982.81-827,1,21071,david_klingsberg,,3536.598,3561.665,"But that's the kind of issue which, like the sales to the states and political subdivisions, we suggest, involves so many far-reaching political and economic issues that that should be considered by Congress and has been considered by Congress, and not after 46 years of inapplicability be taken up and altered by the Court at the present time."
1982.81-827,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3562.511,3564.211,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Tucker?"
1982.81-827,2,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,3564.211,3565.729,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-827,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3631.649,3632.667,Do you think we are bound by that?
1982.81-827,2,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,3632.667,3633.228,Sir?
1982.81-827,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3633.228,3634.445,Are we bound by that?
1982.81-827,2,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,3634.445,3635.852,"No, sir, but I think that--"
1982.81-827,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3635.852,3636.648,Do you think he is bound by it?
1982.81-827,2,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,3636.648,3637.069,--I think--
1982.81-827,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3637.069,3638.645,Could he withdraw that motion if he wanted to?
1982.81-827,2,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,3638.645,3644.381,--I think at this point that it at least serves as an admission that--
1982.81-827,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3644.381,3646.331,"Well, it is not a binding admission."
1982.81-827,2,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,3646.331,3648.221,--they thought it applied at that time.
1982.81-827,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3648.221,3651.111,Whoever drafted that motion thought it applied when he filed that motion.
1982.81-827,2,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,3651.111,3652.156,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-827,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3795.975,3804.424,"Well, your argument would require us to say that the states and federal government were subject to the Act even on purchases for their own use, wouldn't it?"
1982.81-827,2,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,3804.424,3805.563,"No, sir."
1982.81-827,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3805.563,3812.34,"Well, because the '38 Act just doesn't cover the government, that one that exempted the eleemosynary institutions."
1982.81-827,2,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,3812.34,3819.308,"Well, the legislative history seems to believe that it... seems to say that it does cover governmental agencies."
1982.81-827,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3827.1,3830.524,Do you think the language of the '38 Act lends itself to that construction?
1982.81-827,2,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,3830.524,3831.257,Sir?
1982.81-827,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3831.257,3838.097,"Do you think the language of the '38 Act lends itself to that construction, that it includes the government as an eleemosynary institution?"
1982.81-827,2,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,3838.097,3864.664,"In those areas, yes, sir, government hospitals, in the instances referred to by Justice O'Connor for health care, for the indigent, it would be covered and they would be exempt under the Non-Profit Institutions Act for that purpose, but I am not by any means trying to say that it should be applied to government institutions where they are purchasing for their own use."
1982.81-827,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3866.695,3867.553,"Thank you, gentlemen."
1982.81-827,2,33235,joe_l_tucker_jr,,3867.553,3867.989,Thank you.
1982.81-827,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3867.989,3868.988,The case is submitted.
