1984.83-1368,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.224,We will hear arguments first this morning in Northwest Wholesale Stationers against Pacific Stationery and Printing Co.--
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,15.093,23.763,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the petitioner Northwest Wholesale Stationers is a non-profit purchasing cooperative."
1984.83-1368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.983,195.875,"Mr. Sweeney, I take it there is nothing in the record to support the District Court's observation that the exclusion of Pacific didn't affect competition."
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,195.875,204.396,The District Court in its oral opinion made no specific findings of fact or--
1984.83-1368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.396,205.296,"Well, I know that."
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,208.098,210.134,"--Your Honor, yes, there is."
1984.83-1368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.272,249.842,Would there be enough then in the record to even apply the kind of quick look analysis the SG is suggesting should be applied?
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,249.842,259.281,"--I believe that there would be, because we submit that it must be the plaintiff's burden to show in fact what competitive impact has occurred."
1984.83-1368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.057,281.361,"But if a per se rule is applied, that burden doesn't exist, I suppose."
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,281.361,303.727,"--I would... arguably, although I would submit that there must be a showing of an impact on competition to act as a predicate for any antitrust injury, so that if in fact there was no showing of anticompetitive injury, then antitrust liability would not follow from that."
1984.83-1368,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,394.617,398.236,"Mr. Sweeney, do you agree that this is a concerted refusal to deal?"
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,398.236,408.025,I believe that there are a number of factors which would take it at least out of the traditional paradigm of consorted refusal to deal.
1984.83-1368,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,414.079,416.214,Do you think you could answer my question yes or no?
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,416.214,418.732,Traditionally yes.
1984.83-1368,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,419.932,421.268,You think it is a concerted refusal to deal?
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,421.268,425.07,"Well, I guess... let me back up."
1984.83-1368,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,437.544,440.913,"Well, if it is not a concerted refusal to deal, isn't that the end of the case?"
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,440.913,442.265,--It may very well be.
1984.83-1368,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,443.932,445.467,Maybe it is really a very easy case.
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,445.467,446.45,--I hope so.
1984.83-1368,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,574.067,587.076,"Mr. Sweeney, procedurally, there are motions to dismiss, there are motions for summary judgment, there are motions for partial summary judgment, there are trials, there are judgments after trials."
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,595.098,599.15,"It could fit nicely there, under a motion for partial summary judgment."
1984.83-1368,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,635.906,648.547,"You see it as simply a motion on a question of law that is involved in the case, that the trial judge could decide that question of law at any stage of the trial just like he might decide any other question of law."
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,648.547,658.605,I see it can be utilized in that function and at that level so that he could funnel down this important issue.
1984.83-1368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,897.776,906.197,"Don't you think the Court of Appeals said that there was a competitive impact, adverse competitive impact because of denial of a rebate?"
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,908.999,912.118,"--They said that, Your Honor, but there is no reasoning behind that statement."
1984.83-1368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.118,916.505,"It is a fact, though, that they were denied a rebate."
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,916.505,918.089,They were denied the ability--
1984.83-1368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.089,928.897,And you think that it is just really an unsupported inference that denial of a rebate that competitors are getting would hurt the competitive position?
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,928.897,931.432,"--I believe it is an unsupported inference, Your Honor."
1984.83-1368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,934.301,946.958,"Well, you may argue what the significance of the evidence is, but that is what the Court of Appeals relied on, and said that absent the Robinson-Patman Act exemption, there would be a per se liability."
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,950.226,952.012,"--They held that, but--"
1984.83-1368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,952.012,959.916,And then said they couldn't take advantage of this so-called exemption because of procedural default.
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,959.916,970.057,"--In essence, where we submit the Ninth Circuit went afoul, Your Honor, is that they made no competitive impact analysis, and we believe it is--"
1984.83-1368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,970.057,971.374,You mean beyond saying that--
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,971.374,972.509,--Beyond simply--
1984.83-1368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.509,978.58,--Beyond saying that there was a denial of a rebate which had an anticompetitive impact.
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,978.58,980.562,"--Really, beyond saying that there was a lack of--"
1984.83-1368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,980.562,982.364,That is what they relied on.
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,982.364,985.399,"--Well, we submit that they also relied on--"
1984.83-1368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,985.399,987.185,How much more analysis do you want?
1984.83-1368,0,21469,david_j_sweeney,,987.185,998.124,"--We want an analysis, Your Honor, of what in fact happened on competition, how the loss of a rebate affected Pacific, and there was no discussion of that."
1984.83-1368,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1004.361,1017.704,Mrs. O'Sullivan.
1984.83-1368,1,19736,catherine_g_osullivan,,1017.704,1036.332,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the fundamental reason for concern in this case from the government's perspective is that an overly literal application of the per se group boycott label to conduct of joint ventures threatens to substantially undercut their procompetitive potential."
1984.83-1368,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.386,1071.12,"Mrs. O'Sullivan, do you think it covers the conduct in this case?"
1984.83-1368,1,19736,catherine_g_osullivan,,1071.12,1074.29,I think that is a question of characterization.
1984.83-1368,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1082.61,1083.812,Do you think it should be?
1984.83-1368,1,19736,catherine_g_osullivan,,1083.812,1093.835,"--Our view is that from the record that stands before the Court, it is not possible to say whether the net result of this conduct is procompetitive or anticompetitive."
1984.83-1368,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1093.835,1096.62,Surely it is possible to say whether it is a concerted refusal to deal or not.
1984.83-1368,1,19736,catherine_g_osullivan,,1104.726,1109.011,"It is possible to characterize it that way, but if that characterization--"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1708.092,1720.216,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to begin with a brief summary of our position."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1731.358,1732.541,You say classic.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1735.493,1740.379,"Mr. Justice Stevens, there are a number of cases which are like this case."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1755.406,1756.306,Not just a refusal to admit.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1759.691,1760.877,"--Precisely, Your Honor."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1760.877,1764.829,"And this co-op does not refuse to sell goods to your client, did it?"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1764.829,1769.964,"I was listening to your questions to petitioner, Your Honor."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.134,1834.406,"This is a partial refusal to deal in your view because it is a refusal to sell at the same price that they sell to everyone else, in effect?"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1835.925,1838.71,"--No, Your Honor, I think we would characterize it differently."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1843.595,1847.214,"Refusal to deal, but what did they refuse to sell to your opponent?"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1852.685,1860.124,--They refused to sell the same goods that they were selling to every one of Pacific's competitors at the same price.
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.124,1862.326,It is a price discrimination case.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1862.326,1865.076,"No, it is more than a price discrimination case, Your Honor."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1890.226,1893.928,Is it your view that such a group has a duty to admit anyone who applies?
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1893.928,1896.464,"Your Honor, that raises different problems."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.134,1902.684,Do you have a view on my question?
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1902.684,1913.525,--I would think in this case there might be reasons that the defendant cooperative might not have had to admit the plaintiff in 1978.
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1919.179,1926.233,"Specifically, could they have had a rule that we will not admit combination wholesalers and resalers, we will just admit retailers?"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1927.518,1930.737,"--I am not prepared to answer that question, Your Honor."
1984.83-1368,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1971.464,1975.932,"What does the absence of due process, as you put it, add to the concerted refusal to deal?"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,1988.74,2009.737,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, one response might be, if they had gone through that elaborate procedure, and if in fact the facts which are suggested in the record, which suggested that the expulsion of the plaintiff Pacific was inappropriate, had that hearing been held, our suggestion is that the plaintiff would never have been expelled from the organization."
1984.83-1368,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2009.737,2015.743,"Yes, but my question was, what if after such a hearing the board reached exactly the result that it reached here as you claim without due process?"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2015.743,2018.209,"Well, the Silver case talks to that."
1984.83-1368,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.209,2020.778,Does the Silver case make much sense in this context?
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2020.778,2023.913,"Your Honor, Silver addresses two very--"
1984.83-1368,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2023.913,2026.115,"Well, do you think it makes much sense in this context?"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2026.115,2027.551,"--Short answer, yes."
1984.83-1368,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.867,2029.767,Go ahead.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2029.767,2031.502,"--so into a little more detail, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.7,2064.056,But now where is your correlative self-regulation function in the case of cooperatives?
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2064.056,2070.043,"Your Honor, that is not necessary, because I am going to suggest that Silver stands for two very separate propositions."
1984.83-1368,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2144.008,2147.293,I had thought due process applied to state action.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2156.566,2161.47,"--Justice O'Connor, in fact, in the Silver case, where the Court suggested--"
1984.83-1368,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2161.47,2175.527,"Oh, but that was the Securities and Exchange Act, which had certain provisions that certainly aren't applicable here, and I can't imagine that we would want to extend that on, nor do I think it is necessary to your Sherman Act argument."
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2175.527,2180.031,"--Well, I was merely addressing myself to your state action question, Your Honor."
1984.83-1368,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2185.918,2197.976,That is why the decision may be one that relies particularly on provisions of the Securities and Exchange Act and isn't really relevant to this situation.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2197.976,2215.604,"But in the Silver case, what the Court recognized was the importance of due process even in those kinds of private transactions to ensure that persons did not engage in anticompetitive conduct, and so to return to Justice Rehnquist's question, our suggestion here is--"
1984.83-1368,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2215.604,2225.96,"Why don't we return to whether it is anticompetitive conduct, because it seems to me that is the fundamental inquiry that is at issue here, whether it is anticompetitive."
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2233.399,2237.101,"--Well, Your Honor, there is more, and I would like to amplify on--"
1984.83-1368,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2237.101,2237.918,"Well, what?"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2237.918,2240.487,--What happened was that--
1984.83-1368,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2240.487,2247.843,Just spell out in brief form what harm occurred other than the loss of rebates.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2247.843,2275.643,"--Well, in addition to the loss of rebates, since Pacific was no longer a member of... excuse me, was no longer a member of the cooperative, and as a practical matter then was precluded from buying, not that it could not, but that as a practical matter, given the elevated prices, it would not buy, what happened was, Pacific then had to engage in greater inventory, had to expand what went on in their own warehouses."
1984.83-1368,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2275.643,2276.226,"Well, let's see."
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2285.868,2287.618,"No, it is not quite right, Your Honor."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2384.948,2388.233,Do you think that would have violated the Sherman Act without the grandfather clause?
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2388.233,2394.969,"If they had adopted the new bylaw in 1974, Your Honor, and then because of the--"
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2394.969,2398.771,"And not grandfathered, so this of course means that you have to get out because you have a dual operation."
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2398.771,2400.807,--We would maintain absolutely.
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.277,2407.194,And that is the anticompetitive purpose you are talking about?
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2407.194,2407.994,Absolutely.
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2409.229,2415.4,Could they have organized in the first instance having that anticompetitive rule in the bylaws?
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2417.919,2420.804,"--I didn't want to answer you before, and I am not sure I--"
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.804,2422.554,Even though it is the heart of your case when they make the change.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2422.554,2423.073,--Excuse me?
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2423.073,2427.958,Even though it is the heart of your case when they make a change in the bylaws to impose that requirement.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2427.958,2443.736,"Well, our proposition, Justice Stevens, is the following, that what you have here is an organization composed of members designed to confer competitive advantages on one another by coming together and amalgamating their joint buying power."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2450.906,2452.223,"Well, you say arbitrarily."
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2460.379,2466.65,"--Now we are talking about a concerted refusal to deal, and we are getting closer to the Topco case, and I guess if this is like Topco--"
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2466.65,2468.018,You are getting closer to a concerted refusal to deal.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2468.018,2469.385,--I would say absolutely.
1984.83-1368,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2595.033,2599.835,"That is a matter of Oregon law, isn't it, whether they are entitled to throw him out under the rules of the cooperative?"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2599.835,2612.745,"Well, it is clear that under Oregon law cooperatives can adopt bylaws, and it is clear that under Oregon law a coop can regulate itself, but I would have thought that the antitrust laws supersede the Oregon laws under the supremacy clause."
1984.83-1368,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2612.745,2624.553,"But what in the antitrust laws, the Sherman Act or the Robinson-Patman Act talks about applying due process to private corporations other than the very unusual facts of the Silver case?"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2624.553,2634.508,"As I suggest, we do not assert that the conduct is unlawful because of the absence of due process, and so I want to make that clear."
1984.83-1368,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2698.268,2705.004,Isn't a necessary element of your argument there that they threw him out in a way that they didn't throw other people out?
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2705.004,2710.556,"--Well, in fact, Justice Rehnquist, they did not throw anybody else out."
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.645,2762.174,"Are you defending the Court of Appeals' judgment, I take it, that if there had been a hearing, and it had come out exactly the same way, that then there wouldn't have been a per se... it wouldn't be a per se case, but a rule of reason case, because of the Robinson-Patman Act?"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2763.524,2765.709,"Absolutely not, Justice White."
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2765.709,2769.41,I didn't think... you are not defending the Court of Appeals across the board.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2769.41,2770.362,"No, we are not."
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2773.998,2800.882,"Well, it also sounds to me as though you are saying that this whole cooperative, this joint venture of competitors is itself in violation of the Sherman Act, and suppose some supplier that the cooperative refused to deal with because it could get a cheaper price from somebody else, suppose some supplier sued them under the Sherman Act."
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2808.571,2810.587,"--No, Justice White, that it not what we are saying."
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2848.612,2855.2,I can't imagine why you would make a serious argument that the per se rule ought to apply in this case.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2855.2,2858.818,Because what we are challenging is very limited conduct.
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.187,2867.323,"Well, that just sounds like that on the facts of this case, there ought to be antitrust liability under the rule of reason."
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2867.323,2869.775,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2887.237,2890.356,Did you cross-appeal here?
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2890.356,2892.073,"--No, we did not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2892.073,2895.241,"Well, you want more relief than the Court of Appeals would give you."
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2895.241,2900.562,"No, in fact, the Court of Appeals decision... let's--"
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2900.562,2908.15,You say that this is a classic refusal to deal and it wouldn't have made any difference whatsoever whether there was a hearing or not.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2908.15,2912.036,"--Let's go back to the trial court for a moment, Justice White."
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.036,2913.888,Let's go back to the Court of Appeals.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2915.988,2933.85,"Well, the reason I wanted to start at the trial court was, at the trial court level there are cross motions for summary judgment, but in the District Court all that the plaintiff sought, all that we sought was partial summary judgment with respect to liability and no determination with respect to the damages or injunctive relief."
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2960.683,2963.052,Do you want us just to affirm the Court of Appeals?
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2963.785,2964.571,--Absolutely.
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2964.571,2973.443,And then say that the reason that the per se rule applies here is that there was not due process?
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2973.443,2974.093,No.
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2974.093,2977.211,"Well, that is what the Court of Appeals said."
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2977.211,2982.282,I would ask you to affirm the judgment of the court but not necessarily its reasoning.
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.282,2986.4,"Well, that is giving you more than you would get under the Court of Appeals judgment."
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,2986.4,2990.935,"Well, I think the relief we are asking, Your Honor, is precisely the same."
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3007.813,3017.935,"Well, yes, but if it goes back under the Court of Appeals position, with a hearing they could keep you out."
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3017.935,3020.751,"--No, as I was saying, because--"
1984.83-1368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.751,3021.52,You don't want that.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3021.52,3029.124,"--I don't think that the Court of Appeals has... I don't think the Court of Appeals decision is, give these guys a hearing and try over again."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3133.643,3135.893,Is it not true that its business has flourished?
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3135.893,3139.761,It is true that its business has prospered.
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3140.611,3142.713,More relatively than others.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3142.713,3145.415,--We have no evidence whatsoever in the record about the others.
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3145.415,3145.815,I see.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3145.815,3152.486,There is evidence in the record as to the percentage increase that the plaintiff's business.
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3152.486,3155.105,"And the dollars are much larger than the dollar amount of the rebates, aren't they?"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3155.105,3159.758,The actual dollar increase of sales is larger than the amount of rebates.
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3181.772,3189.861,"But if you make that argument, isn't Justice White right that you will always have that kind of competitive impact, and if that is enough, why then that is a per se rule?"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3189.861,3190.978,"Well, in fact--"
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3190.978,3192.478,"That is what you are arguing for, I suppose."
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3192.478,3198.315,"--That may well be a part of our argument, Justice Stevens, but I would make a different argument as well."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3228.567,3229.686,Let me stop you right there for a moment.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3236.257,3240.392,"Well, but this case perhaps raises a different kind of question."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3242.494,3249.315,"Let me just ask, could a co-op put a size limit on and say, we won't have big members who exceed a certain sales volume?"
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3249.315,3256.17,"--The answer, Your Honor, yes, if there is a reasonable procompetitive justification for doing it."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.17,3258.203,Why do you have to have a procompetitive justification for that?
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3269.311,3279.0,"Again, you are asking a third time a question I haven't answered... I recognized the first two... which is, is there a difference between admitting members and expelling members?"
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3282.136,3284.488,And does the Sherman Act require open membership in co-ops?
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3286.79,3290.824,"--I think... the answer is that they do not, and I will stand by that."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3315.457,3324.729,"In Topco, of course, there were agreements restricting where the members could sell, the territories in which they could sell, and the like, which you don't have here, and that is why you don't rely heavily on it, as I understand it."
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3324.729,3325.162,--That's right.
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3377.844,3383.165,"Well, they just said to him, we will sell to you like everybody else on the track, but we are just not going to invite you to dinner."
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3385.534,3405.363,"--I would suggest, Your Honor, that the analogy is a little closer to saying, we will let you run, but we will put three-pound weights in your shoes, because what they are doing is, they are saying, we will sell to you, but we will sell to you at a substantial competitive disadvantage, and we are selling to you at such a disadvantage that no rational business person would do that."
1984.83-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3405.363,3407.763,Sounds like a price discrimination case.
1984.83-1368,2,29194,joseph_p_bauer,,3407.763,3414.969,"If it were not for the exemption, Section 13B of the Robinson-Patman Act, it would be, and we would have added that count, too."
1984.83-1368,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3485.982,3487.098,Very well.
1984.83-1368,3,21469,david_j_sweeney,,3490.934,3492.552,"Briefly, Your Honor."
1984.83-1368,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3538.617,3544.604,"Mr. Sweeney, don't you think the record does raise an inference that the reason this man was excluded was because he was a partial wholesaler?"
1984.83-1368,3,21469,david_j_sweeney,,3550.156,3553.71,--The record reflects that that was discussed.
1984.83-1368,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3555.277,3556.412,And we are on summary judgment.
1984.83-1368,3,21469,david_j_sweeney,,3556.412,3557.512,We are on summary judgment.
1984.83-1368,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3557.512,3566.267,"So conceivably that... but it seems to me that nobody really argues about it, but is that permissible or not, to exclude somebody for that reason?"
1984.83-1368,3,21469,david_j_sweeney,,3572.188,3577.992,"No, we would... it is not on this case, Your Honor, whether--"
1984.83-1368,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3577.992,3587.098,"Well, if it is in the record, and there is an inference there that would raise a question of fact of summary judgment, I would submit it is in the case."
1984.83-1368,3,21469,david_j_sweeney,,3587.098,3600.006,"--Well, if there is an inference there on a summary judgment record, those inferences at this Court have to be weighed most favorably with Northwest, since summary judgment was rendered against Northwest--"
1984.83-1368,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3600.006,3601.874,"Yes, but are you asking... what are you asking for?"
1984.83-1368,3,21469,david_j_sweeney,,3603.976,3605.009,--What we are saying for--
1984.83-1368,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3605.009,3607.359,You don't take the same position the government does as I read it.
1984.83-1368,3,21469,david_j_sweeney,,3607.359,3607.759,--No.
1984.83-1368,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3612.996,3614.198,You would rather try the case and lose.
1984.83-1368,3,21469,david_j_sweeney,,3614.198,3628.707,"--if the Court feels that the record is equivocal or not strong enough, we submit the inferences, if there are, should be accorded to Northwest, and that the case should be reversed and remanded for decision by the trial judge."
1984.83-1368,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3649.454,3652.656,What about an admission policy excluding dual distributors?
1984.83-1368,3,21469,david_j_sweeney,,3654.273,3655.608,"Just in the abstract, Your Honor?"
1984.83-1368,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3655.608,3661.612,"In this case, that they had an out and out... this very bylaw they have got in this case."
1984.83-1368,3,21469,david_j_sweeney,,3663.179,3671.717,The exclusion of a wholesaler-retailer combination I think can be justified economically on a number of different grounds.
1984.83-1368,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3730.173,3730.923,"Thank you, gentlemen."
