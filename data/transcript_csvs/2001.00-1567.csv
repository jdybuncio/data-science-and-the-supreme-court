2001.00-1567,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.885,"We'll hear argument now in No. 00-1567, Cornelius P. Young v. the United States."
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,9.371,18.166,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a case about discharging taxes in a bankruptcy proceeding."
2001.00-1567,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,60.807,63.324,"Well, they also filed an earlier bankruptcy petition, didn't they?"
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,63.324,64.522,"They did indeed, Your Honor."
2001.00-1567,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,98.735,103.903,"Well, why was the first Chapter 13 petition dismissed?"
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,103.903,111.128,--It was dismissed at the behest of the Youngs for a variety of reasons that did not appear in the record.
2001.00-1567,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,154.762,170.405,"But there was also the fact that they... in addition to dismissing the Chapter 13, the day before that order was entered granting the dismissal at their request, they started a new bankruptcy proceeding."
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,181.212,187.002,The... the bankruptcy... the Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed.
2001.00-1567,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,225.179,235.687,"Do you have authority for that, for saying that... that it's not the date that the bankruptcy was closed, but some... the earlier date when they... when they made that motion?"
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,235.687,236.308,--Yes.
2001.00-1567,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,243.572,247.287,"Is the filing of the notice of dismissal, which was October 23?"
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,247.287,247.537,--Yes.
2001.00-1567,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,274.945,276.887,Did anyone object to the notice of dismissal?
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,276.887,285.553,Not in a... not in a Chapter 13 where the debtor seeks dismissal.
2001.00-1567,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,292.49,300.125,"You used the term seek dismissal, move to dismiss in October, and then the proceeding was actually dismissed in March."
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,306.813,317.754,"Yes, I am in this situation, Mr. Chief Justice, because of... the bankruptcy rules are a little... were a little vague at that point in time."
2001.00-1567,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,340.992,343.388,"Well, this whole sequence of events seems a bit gimmicky."
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,343.388,371.457,"Well, if... if there are gimmicks, if somebody is trying to manipulate the system, to game the system, certainly the Government... any party in interest who was affected by the gaming, the manipulation... can object, can take... can move to dismiss... to convert the case, for example, which--"
2001.00-1567,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,371.457,375.089,"I thought there was a finding of good faith here, wasn't there?"
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,375.089,376.22,"--Yes, there was, Your Honor."
2001.00-1567,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,376.22,382.536,Was it a finding of good faith or... or a finding that he was making no finding of bad faith?
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,382.536,383.346,No.
2001.00-1567,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,414.115,416.411,Is it bad faith to look for a tax loophole?
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,418.268,428.399,--It's certainly not in our view bad faith to look for a tax... for a way to get a grant of a discharge of an obligation that you formerly owed.
2001.00-1567,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,428.399,432.675,Do you think that that's what the judge meant... meant by not attributing bad faith?
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,441.47,451.705,"The case... Justice Scalia, the case came before the court, before the Bankruptcy Court, on a motion for summary judgment by the motion... by the Government."
2001.00-1567,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,476.392,480.684,"Well, would it be manipulative or abusive just to take advantage of the provision of the statute?"
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,480.684,482.708,"No, Your Honor, it would not be."
2001.00-1567,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,482.708,484.77,"So, the finding doesn't make any difference one way or the other, does it?"
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,484.77,487.538,When bankruptcy... bankruptcy debtors take advantage--
2001.00-1567,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,487.538,489.146,You're just saying you have a statutory right to do what you did.
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,489.146,490.632,"--That's exactly right, Justice--"
2001.00-1567,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,490.632,497.319,"Why should we read the statute regardless, when it's good faith or bad faith, as allowing the following?"
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,549.969,569.577,"--Justice Breyer, you would have to look at what happened in the prior bankruptcy I think to see why the debtor was able to stay in bankruptcy for the length of time that the debtor did and thereby supposedly prevent the Government from collecting taxes from the debtor."
2001.00-1567,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,638.375,640.891,Do they get the payments back if they--
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,640.891,641.347,No.
2001.00-1567,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,661.425,669.044,--How much of the... how much of the tax liability did the Government receive during the course of the first bankruptcy?
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,669.044,673.957,"In the Youngs' case, the Government did not receive any payments whatsoever."
2001.00-1567,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,696.925,699.054,Did you... did you seek confirmation?
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,699.054,706.734,"The confirmation hearing had been set by the court at the outset of the case, and it was scheduled for November 15 of--"
2001.00-1567,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,706.734,715.938,But it was... it was the debtors' voluntary action that stopped the Government from getting any payments under that plan.
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,715.938,718.91,"--It was... in this particular case, yes, Your Honor--"
2001.00-1567,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,718.91,720.109,Could the judge--
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,720.109,722.254,--for the... because they had not gotten to confirmation.
2001.00-1567,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,722.254,755.775,"--When the debtor asked to have the Chapter 13 dismissed, could the judge have said, I will enter the dismissal order, the closure order, but only on condition that you do not attempt to assert a time bar, should you... as everybody knew was... that was going to happen, go into a successive bankruptcy proceeding?"
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,758.53,760.892,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.00-1567,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,776.124,781.343,"Well, then why is the dismissal automatic, which is what we talked about at the very first?"
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,781.343,802.669,"Well, because the debtor... I think the procedural problem here is because the request... the rules, at least at the point of this request for dismissal was... was made, were a little vague as to how you request or move for a dismissal."
2001.00-1567,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,802.669,803.162,All right.
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,803.162,806.423,But the debtor has the absolute right to request the dismissal.
2001.00-1567,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,820.269,825.249,"Well, the debtor... the debtor has a right to reject that condition and say, if that's the condition, I don't want to dismiss, I assume."
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,829.912,832.595,I don't... I think the--
2001.00-1567,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,832.595,842.998,"If he has a right to reject that condition, then once you say the judge may impose a condition, you have to say that... that dismissal does not occur automatically once you request it."
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,842.998,846.919,--I think in that--
2001.00-1567,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,846.919,847.219,You can't have it both ways.
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,847.219,852.946,--I... I'm not saying it's... I think what I'm saying is that the court has the ability to put a condition on it.
2001.00-1567,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,857.776,861.758,"Right, and we don't know, until the judge enters an order of dismissal, whether he's going to put a condition on it."
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,866.216,881.72,"I'm saying it's... Justice Scalia, I'm saying it's automatic in the sense that the... the debtor has an absolute right, quote/unquote... and that's not an absolutely absolute, but the debtor has a right under Chapter 13 to have his case dismissed."
2001.00-1567,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.72,886.566,"No, but... no, but you say he doesn't because the judge can say, I'll let you dismiss it if."
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,892.122,896.331,"Well, it's... I think it is an absolute right or nearly so."
2001.00-1567,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,901.782,911.524,But it doesn't mean that you can't equate the date that you file the motion to dismiss with the termination of the Chapter 13.
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,923.535,938.7,"I think the... well, I don't know that the judge could withhold or... or delay the entry of a dismissal order."
2001.00-1567,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.266,947.933,Let's say we disagree with you and we find--
2001.00-1567,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.933,949.458,--Have you cited any cases in which this kind of condition was imposed?
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,949.458,957.831,"--I do not know of any cases where, in a Chapter 13, a condition has been imposed."
2001.00-1567,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,957.831,960.415,"So, this is totally speculative, really, I think."
2001.00-1567,0,25115,grenville_clark_iii,,970.885,982.523,"Well, I think no... no judge is going to impose the condition I think under section 349 unless the IRS comes in and makes a motion or brings it to the attention of the court that--"
2001.00-1567,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,982.523,982.523,"But then the lawyers have never had enough sense to do this, as I understand it."
2001.00-1567,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1814.332,1830.967,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to address first the... there's been some discussion about protections that maybe or maybe could not occur in a Chapter 13 proceeding to prevent the... the Government from losing its claim."
2001.00-1567,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.373,1854.662,"Well, sure you can."
2001.00-1567,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1866.14,1866.8,I think--
2001.00-1567,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.8,1872.206,Or that that be a condition of... of the dismissal that you not... that you not refile.
2001.00-1567,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1872.206,1886.119,"--I think there's two difficulties with that approach, and the first that it would be an enormous burden in every Chapter 13 case that is filed and then sought to be dismissed... and an awful lot... the vast majority are... to have that inquiry undertaken."
2001.00-1567,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1898.955,1920.875,"But, I mean, let's assume someone has in all good faith commenced a Chapter 13 and has in all good faith dismissed it because, part the way through it, said, you know, I think I can make it on my own now, and... and then, you know, sometime after that, decides, no, I can't make it and... and files another bankruptcy proceeding under 7."
2001.00-1567,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1933.318,1938.808,We would... we would want the 3-year lookback period to tolled during the time the automatic stay prevented us--
2001.00-1567,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1938.808,1939.989,That's not what the statute says.
2001.00-1567,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1958.11,1959.02,"--Well, as the Chief--"
2001.00-1567,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.02,1959.02,"I mean, that's the fun of practicing tax law."
