2008.07-1309,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.468,"We'll hear argument in Case 07-1309, Boyle v. United States."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,6.737,28.4,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a case about a defendant's right to an independent jury determination of each essential element of a RICO offense, specifically a pattern of racketeering and a separate enterprise that is more than just a duplication of the pattern."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,48.647,50.183,Mr. Fernich--
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,50.183,51.449,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,51.449,56.937,--are we talking just about the instruction to the jury?
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,74.231,80.952,"I am not suggesting, Your Honor, that there was insufficient evidence of -- of enterprise to go to the jury."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,85.237,92.391,"So you're saying if a proper charge had been given, this jury on this evidence still could have convicted the defendant."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,92.391,98.061,"--We contend, to be sure, that the evidence was legally insufficient under rule 29."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,105.715,108.083,Did you make that -- did you make that objection in the trial court?
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,108.083,112.304,"Yes, we did, and we preserved it in the court of appeals as well."
2008.07-1309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,142.34,150.595,The error was the failure to give the instruction that appears on page 95 of the joint appendix?
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,152.862,154.631,"Not merely so, Justice Alito."
2008.07-1309,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.32,193.422,What -- what do you mean by that precisely?
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,233.916,246.641,"To be sure, we would contend that it would be a question in the first instance for a properly instructed jury, but without more on the hypothetical that Your Honor has posited, the answer to that question is no."
2008.07-1309,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,253.663,257.115,Except insofar as it's directed to the Brinks job.
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,257.115,263.536,"Except the degree of organization, I should say, inherent in each individual predicate act."
2008.07-1309,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,263.536,270.189,"But -- but you -- you imported -- I'm looking at your quotation from -- from Turkette, on page 5 of your brief."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,295.424,313.951,"To be sure, Your Honor, we don't contend that Turkette is directly controlling of the issue, and we go through a lengthy textual exegesis in our brief of why we think that implicit in the factors of ongoing organization and continuing unit is a structure requirement."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,342.138,343.388,"What -- what does ""structure"" mean?"
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,351.91,354.362,"It could mean that in an appropriate case, Your Honor."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,355.895,361.099,What is -- what is the minimum to qualify as having a structure?
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,361.099,384.882,"--The minimum is a separate, ongoing, continuing existence apart from the commission of the predicate acts themselves, and the members necessary to commit those predicate acts, because that by -- by definition, I should say, is the pattern of racketeering activity, and moreover, it is also inherent in any criminal conspiracy that extends over time."
2008.07-1309,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,408.497,416.186,"So all you have to do, to pick up on Justice Scalia's hypothetical, just not the Brinks job, but you have to have one more crime, and that's it."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,418.736,429.077,"No, that -- that's, respectfully, not what we contend, although in an appropriate case it's conceivable that a properly instructed jury may find structure on those facts."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,457.18,461.148,But does the jury -- the words that you asked for -- what was it?
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,472.689,475.824,"--I'm -- I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,475.824,480.526,Those were the words that you wanted the judge to include in the charge--
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,480.526,481.295,To be sure.
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,481.295,494.786,"--and your request for the charge, as to say to have an enterprise you need to have -- the group has to have an ascertainable structural hierarchy."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,497.988,501.709,"Well, respectfully, Your Honor, it goes beyond that, because the end of--"
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,501.709,503.775,But those -- but you did ask for those.
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,503.775,505.177,"--I did, and--"
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,505.177,508.629,"And now I'm asking you, what does that mean?"
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,519.92,521.12,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,549.19,553.392,"And some of those examples, it seems, are present here."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,601.038,609.994,"Your Honor, first of all, to -- to get right down to the nitty-gritty of the verdict in the case, it's important to focus on what the jury actually found."
2008.07-1309,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,654.857,655.959,Why -- why do you need a hierarchy?
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,666.415,673.421,--We don't contend before this Court that it must be hierarchical per se.
2008.07-1309,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,674.421,675.404,"Well, that's what you requested."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,676.639,677.022,--I -- I--
2008.07-1309,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.022,678.039,--instruction you requested?
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,678.039,688.096,"--On the facts of this case, consistent with the examples that are spelled out comprehensively in both the opening brief and the reply brief, that is the one that we focused on."
2008.07-1309,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,702.923,707.408,"Well, you -- you couldn't, could you, because the -- an organization can consist of an individual."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,718.615,726.888,"--An individual, Your Honor, is -- is a legal entity under the first clause of 1961(4)."
2008.07-1309,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,736.994,743.683,"Well, if I set up a newsstand, it's a sole proprietorship and that's all I have to do."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,768.565,771.683,--And that is not an absurd result.
2008.07-1309,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,784.925,785.958,"Oh, absolutely."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,819.331,826.252,"To be sure, Your Honor, we're only calling -- and the problem only arises in the context of an association-in-fact enterprise."
2008.07-1309,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,846.748,849.95,"Oh, I agree, but an individual can be an -- an enterprise."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,849.95,851.219,A legal enterprise.
2008.07-1309,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,851.219,855.754,And -- and an association-infact can be an enterprise.
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,877.952,881.904,"We don't -- we don't press that contention, Your Honor."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,940.86,944.162,"So would -- would it include, let's say, a street gang?"
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,949.882,951.216,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,951.216,957.47,"It was an Alec Guiness movie, The Lavender Hill Mob."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,957.47,966.725,"Oh, well, certainly we don't have any quarrel with the proposition of street gangs, and many of them are cited in our briefs."
2008.07-1309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,988.507,1004.516,"If hierarchy isn't required, then I'm not clear what more -- what you think needs to be shown beyond the fact that there was an association in fact and whatever continuity needs to be shown in order to establish the pattern."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1008.568,1009.754,"Well, Your Honor--"
2008.07-1309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1009.754,1013.389,What needs to be charged to the jury that they must find beyond that?
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1013.389,1020.812,--We contend that they must be charged that there has to be a structure separate from the commission of the predicate acts themselves.
2008.07-1309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1027.982,1029.182,But what does that mean?
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1029.182,1046.593,"--It means -- and -- and I would take the test most prominently from Your Honor's own home circuit, as -- as spelled out in the Riccobene case: a -- an ongoing decisional-making apparatus to guide the affairs of the enterprise, a directional mechanism."
2008.07-1309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1057.401,1058.268,I -- I--
2008.07-1309,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1058.268,1061.537,It seems to me you've described this -- this gang.
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1076.363,1085.569,The gang has no structure aside from that which is a necessary incident to the commission of each racketeering act.
2008.07-1309,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1095.507,1102.43,"Isn't it pretty clear that if the -- the person who's supposed to be the lookout doesn't perform his job, he's not going to be included in that next heist?"
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1102.43,1106.632,"There's no evidence of that in the record to my knowledge, Your Honor."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1106.632,1118.54,"Isn't there a record that this is a more or less steady group that hangs out together, except when one of them gets caught and put in jail, and then they replace someone?"
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1125.094,1133.383,"Your Honor, the testimony about the Brooklyn Social Club is -- is a little bit overdrawn, I would say."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1153.03,1154.746,But one of the members owned the club.
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1155.398,1156.998,--Yes.
2008.07-1309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1172.008,1181.882,"--Suppose you have a gang that gets together every Friday afternoon, and by democratic means, they decide what crime they're going to commit that weekend."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1201.611,1216.353,"It sounds to me like a jury could -- if they're having regular Friday meetings and they're using sophisticated means to canvas the RICO statute with a degree of -- of complexity and sophistication to figure out what they're going to do or maybe even try to evade the statute, it probably--"
2008.07-1309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1216.353,1216.972,All right.
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1228.511,1230.88,--If a jury--
2008.07-1309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1230.88,1232.732,Does that -- does that have an ascertainable structure?
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1232.732,1248.925,"--If a jury were properly instructed that there had to be a structure separate and apart from just that which is inherent in the commission of each act, a properly instructed jury probably could well find the requirements satisfied on -- on the hypothetical that Your Honor has posited."
2008.07-1309,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1259.632,1261.065,"Well, what structure would there be there?"
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1267.053,1274.225,"--The ongoing existence, the regular meetings, and the degree of sophistication employed."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1300.809,1303.161,How about during the period that this man -- what was his name?
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1307.53,1309.648,"Mangiavillano, Your Honor."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1309.648,1310.165,--Yes.
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1320.088,1327.027,"Your Honor, the testimony in the record is that -- again, what was found by the jury here."
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1353.844,1355.327,That wasn't what I meant.
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1355.327,1355.879,--Okay.
2008.07-1309,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1355.879,1373.941,"I meant, would the organization, as it was described to exist at the time Mangiavillano was there -- would that have satisfied the definition of ""structure"" because it had a leader?"
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1373.941,1388.434,"It may have at that point, but there was no evidence -- and -- and because it's outside of the time frame of what the jury has found, there's a lot more diversity in the criminality that was alleged during that period."
2008.07-1309,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1417.185,1419.036,Can you try something out in your mind?
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1459.963,1464.332,"Certainly the defense would take a ruling like that, but--"
2008.07-1309,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.332,1475.29,"Well, I know, but I'm -- I'm trying to work out in my mind is that a sensible thing to say because the trouble with the word ""structure"" is everything in the universe has a structure."
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1481.71,1489.05,"--A structure -- the structure, I don't think, entails necessarily rules, regulations, et cetera."
2008.07-1309,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1490.35,1490.9,That isn't what I said.
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1519.569,1522.854,"--Is Your Honor's question is that a sensible definition of ""structure""?"
2008.07-1309,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1522.854,1523.321,Yes.
2008.07-1309,0,35838,marc_fernich,,1523.321,1524.806,"Yes, it is a sensible definition of ""structure""."
2008.07-1309,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1528.441,1529.658,"Thank you, Mr. Fernich."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1540.416,1553.14,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An association-in-fact enterprise need not have an ascertainable structure distinct from the predicate acts of racketeering committed by one of its associates, whatever that means."
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.194,1587.213,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1608.96,1611.329,--That goes to my second reason.
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1611.329,1613.281,"Oh, so we'll forget about your first one."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1613.281,1615.733,"Well, let me -- let me go to -- which I think it addresses the second reason."
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1672.402,1684.127,"When you say individual, the first part of the definition of enterprise speaks about any individual partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1684.127,1684.693,That's correct.
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1684.693,1696.101,"So then, I've read somewhere that people feel that where that individual is involved, the individual is acting as an -- a legal entity such as a sole proprietorship."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1697.251,1703.172,"An individual can be an enterprise as a sole proprietorship, if that's the question."
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1703.172,1704.706,I'm talking about a legal entity.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1718.883,1719.9,That's correct.
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1740.064,1740.58,What appendix?
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1741.78,1742.416,--Excuse me.
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.616,1745.299,All right.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1745.299,1745.933,The government gray brief.
2008.07-1309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1796.733,1797.983,So then you'd have an easy time before the jury.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1811.826,1816.464,"We don't say that it's not a separate element, and we also don't say that a pattern necessarily--"
2008.07-1309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1816.464,1819.582,"Well, you say that it's not distinct from the underlying offenses."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1819.582,1823.201,"--No, I -- I don't believe so."
2008.07-1309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1831.473,1834.841,"But they don't have to be separately instructed that they have to find that, do they?"
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1834.841,1835.658,"--No, they do."
2008.07-1309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1838.043,1842.095,What is the instruction that the Seventh Circuit and the Eighth Circuit give that you don't think is necessary?
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1842.095,1849.351,--The instruction is the pertaining to an ascertainable structure distinct from the pattern of racketeering.
2008.07-1309,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1889.743,1907.806,Would you agree there -- there can be a situation in which an individual engages in a pattern of racketeering activity together with other people and yet is not participating in the affairs of an enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity?
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1907.806,1919.179,"Well, I think that's the case that we gave -- an example that we gave in our brief, which is, say, an individual commits a very long string of bank burglaries and -- actually, make it robberies."
2008.07-1309,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1942.945,1945.497,And what is -- why would it not?
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1946.348,1948.064,Because there would be -- you would--
2008.07-1309,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1948.064,1948.515,--What's lacking there?
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1948.515,1959.839,--What would show is that the individual is not working in concert with others to achieve an end because there's no -- no parallel identity between any two of the crimes except for the individual acting alone.
2008.07-1309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1959.839,1963.024,I thought an individual could -- I thought an individual could be the enterprise?
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1963.024,1965.393,One -- he could be--
2008.07-1309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1965.393,1968.178,He's an independent contractor rather than an employee.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1968.178,1988.441,"--He could be an enterprise but not one -- when an individual acts alone as an enterprise, the individual is not liable for racketeering acts under 1962(c) under this Court's decision in Cedric Kushner, because there's a requirement in 1962(c) that the individual has to be employed by or associated with the enterprise."
2008.07-1309,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2004.601,2015.326,"What if he has a list of -- of 25 people who may, on various occasions, want to participate with him in bank robberies?"
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2025.599,2031.602,"I guess it's -- it's unlikely that the government, if that were the only facts, could show an enterprise."
2008.07-1309,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2041.476,2043.512,"Yes, but what's the element then that's missing?"
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2043.512,2059.788,"Well, what's -- what's required under this Court's decision in Turkette, which we think flows directly from the language, any group of individuals associated in fact, is that the group of persons must be associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct."
2008.07-1309,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2086.172,2086.605,Why?
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2090.374,2094.611,It would be difficult to show an associated -- association-in-fact.
2008.07-1309,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2111.454,2119.476,Then why don't you dispense with the association-in-fact category and simply go with the individual?
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2119.476,2129.867,"That was my answer to the Chief Justice's question, because under 1962(c), there has to be distinctiveness in that context."
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2129.867,2133.585,Two people -- two people walk along the street and know each other.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2157.601,2159.218,No.
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2159.82,2160.67,"Well, what is it that keeps them out?"
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2160.67,2164.439,"--Well, RICO requires, among other things, a pattern of racketeering."
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2164.439,2168.826,"Well, here we have two -- two -- two related crimes."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2168.826,2176.329,"Well, they can be related, but under this Court's decision in H.J., you also have to show continuing criminal conduct."
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2176.329,2177.681,There was between the two.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2177.681,2178.914,"Well, no, no."
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2185.168,2186.454,"Well, that is the bribery."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2192.274,2205.249,"Well, again, I'm not sure that that would meet either the continuing aspect, either because it's a threat of continuing activity or because it would satisfy the close in continuity."
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2205.249,2207.451,"Well, I mean, you're quite right."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2246.676,2249.111,I think I agree with that proposition.
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2249.111,2250.011,--You agree with the first part?
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2250.011,2254.931,But -- but the -- what needs to be shown is that there needs to be an enterprise.
2008.07-1309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2292.122,2297.025,I thought your friend said the period that the jury found was just a couple of months.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2297.025,2297.458,--Yes.
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.702,2341.804,"And -- and were -- were they shown to the jury, all of those bank burglaries?"
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2341.804,2343.406,"--Oh, there were many things shown to the jury."
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2343.406,2348.393,So it is not at issue in this case whether -- whether the entity can be--
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2348.393,2349.31,I have to say--
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2349.31,2350.943,--derived simply from the predicate acts.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2350.943,2360.868,--I have to say that the -- I'm a little perplexed at this stage in the litigation based -- how -- how we got here based on the objection that was made to the district court.
2008.07-1309,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2432.047,2452.061,"Before you do that, Mr. Yang, could you give us a sense, if you know it, about the practical results of the different formulas that -- there are at least three formulas, I take it, that the different circuits have approved."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2462.566,2465.018,It will make a difference in some cases.
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2545.586,2550.89,"What did you think -- what did you think of the -- probably not much of it, but what did you think of my effort there?"
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2626.689,2631.926,"Let me first address what I think is your underlying concern, that there's a problem."
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2641.984,2642.7,That's different.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2657.494,2668.634,"--That problem does not exist as well, because the relevant -- the relevant pattern of racketeering activity that is the element of the crime is something committed by an individual."
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2717.464,2717.864,"No, no."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2717.864,2719.9,So -- so the element -- it doesn't change.
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2743.015,2751.602,"Well, I mean, that -- always, in a case where you sue the investment company because of their one letter used four times, it's the act of the individual."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2758.941,2759.891,--But if you have--
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2759.891,2765.762,"And he has to be associated, however, with an enterprise for it to fall within RICO, and there also has to be a pattern."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2765.762,2766.678,--If you take the--
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2766.678,2767.295,Let's go back--
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2767.295,2773.766,"--my -- my hypothetical with the individual transporting the -- the money alone across State lines, you have a pattern."
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2801.685,2810.457,"--That's right, and our problem is he's doing it with one other person whom he met once, and they agreed to do it, and that's a common law conspiracy."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2833.739,2834.506,--Let me--
2008.07-1309,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2834.506,2835.839,You might come back and tell me it should be.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2835.839,2838.358,--Let me try to approach that in two separate ways.
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2935.386,2937.655,"Mr. Yang, I am -- I am really confused now."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2964.539,2965.741,--No.
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2969.209,2969.926,Yes.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2969.926,2978.232,"--It's very -- I have to say it's difficult for me to understand what is being proposed by the other side, particularly once you've lost hierarchy."
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2980.417,2980.934,Right.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2980.934,2986.155,"But if you're talking about structure, structure could mean relationship between individuals that enable them to--"
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2986.155,2987.021,"Right, right."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2987.021,2987.371,--commit their crimes.
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2988.238,2988.988,Yes.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2988.988,3007.984,"--I don't see why a jury cannot infer from the fact, over a long period of time, that the -- the alleged members of this group have operated as a unit and have committed acts of racketeering, from that coordinated conduct that you're not able to infer that they had a means of acting as a group."
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.984,3011.536,"No, but you can tell the jury -- you would have to tell the jury you have to find it."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3018.626,3019.842,Must -- must the jury--
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.842,3026.696,"--Be told it's not enough, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, for you to find that these predicate acts occurred."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3040.372,3041.289,--What does that mean?
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3041.289,3042.407,I don't know.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3044.407,3051.847,Because Turkette makes very clear that an association-in-fact enterprise can exist for wholly criminal acts.
2008.07-1309,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3067.023,3067.523,Right.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3067.523,3068.223,All right?
2008.07-1309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3130.197,3130.647,Not at all.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3141.086,3154.076,"--But there's nothing -- there's -- in order to find an organization, you're not going to see any more from criminal acts that are not racketeering versus criminal acts that are."
2008.07-1309,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3154.845,3181.08,"But you -- you would instruct the jury that if these three thefts that are covered by RICO occurred over a period of a year, and they involved lookouts and scanners and so forth, you may infer from these acts an enterprise as defined by the statute."
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3181.08,3182.996,--They might.
2008.07-1309,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3182.996,3184.448,You would allow that instruction.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3184.448,3186.448,"You -- yes, but there has to be more."
2008.07-1309,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3193.47,3201.224,"Where -- where in your briefs or in the materials do we find the definition of what the enterprise is, other than in the statute, other than the terms of the statute itself?"
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3201.224,3204.945,--I believe page 17.
2008.07-1309,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3204.945,3210.949,"I mean, what -- what do I refer to in order to supplement the instruction that I just noted -- that I just suggested?"
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3210.949,3216.836,Page 17 of our brief reiterates the standard.
2008.07-1309,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3234.547,3243.403,It's at the bottom of 111 where he said that you can look to see what it does and make the inference rather than have -- I forget -- an abstract analysis?
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3243.403,3260.882,"But it goes on to say that you must -- the government must prove that there is an ongoing organization with some sort of framework, formal and informal, for carrying out its objectives, and various members and associations of the association function as a continuing unit to achieve a common objective."
2008.07-1309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3303.006,3303.692,That's an enterprise.
2008.07-1309,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3308.494,3319.534,--It is different in the sense that you can have a series of predicate acts without an enterprise; you can have an enterprise without a series of predicate acts.
2008.07-1309,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3350.687,3351.339,"Thank you, Mr. Yang."
2008.07-1309,2,35838,marc_fernich,,3353.589,3354.875,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.07-1309,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3632.938,3634.805,"Thank you, counsel."
