2004.03-855,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,9.12,"We will now hear argument in case of City of Sherrill, New York against the Oneida Indian Nation of New York."
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,11.974,14.358,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-855,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,79.618,89.074,"Well, is it your position that whenever an Indian transfers land in violation of the Nonintercourse Act, that that's a valid transfer?"
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,91.33,91.581,No.
2004.03-855,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,175.682,182.861,Why does not having a possessory right mean that the city could tax them or the state?
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,182.861,193.053,The basis for the tax immunity here is that this land does not have Indian country status.
2004.03-855,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,218.451,232.584,"No, I'm just thinking, suppose you have a reservation but the tribel doesn't have a possessory right because in the middle of the reservation, there is some kind of long term lease or sale to a house that's owned by somebody else who is not a member of the tribe."
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,239.598,240.74,I absolutely agree with you.
2004.03-855,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,240.74,241.022,All right.
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,254.574,263.177,"But your hypothetical, Your Honor, presupposed the existence of the reservation and presupposed a possessory right subject to lease."
2004.03-855,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,275.23,294.836,"It couldn't be enforced against certain innocent purchases but when the land is reacquired, then it seems to me we have to ask whether there was an extinction of aboriginal title and whether the reservation was at some point subsequently disestablished by federal act."
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,323.62,328.335,--I think that you have to look at the definition of Indian country.
2004.03-855,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,335.978,361.754,"So you're saying if the original establishment of the reservation was simply a continuation, was literally a reservation from a transfer of land to the state of New York and that the Indian title was a purely aboriginal title, not a title conferred by a federal act creating reservations but it cannot be Indian country, is that correct?"
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,361.754,368.96,"If I understand the question that you asked, Your Honor, if the title came from the state of New York, for example--"
2004.03-855,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,368.96,371.147,Let's assume the title is aboriginal.
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,394.715,395.355,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-855,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,412.918,425.937,"So this part of your argument depends on our accepting your position of the treaty of Fort Schuyler as being a conveyance of all property and a later retrocession, is that correct?"
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,429.857,439.724,"What extinguished the aboriginal title with respect to this aspect of the argument, and then I will move on to the treaty of Fort Schuyler and the treaty of Canandaigua."
2004.03-855,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,491.889,506.476,I know that but I mean it seems to me one thing that Oneida establishes is that the whole title doesn't just disappear if nothing else happens simply because of the passage of time.
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,506.476,511.943,"I think what this appears, Your Honor, is the right to possess."
2004.03-855,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,511.943,515.346,And we agree with that or I hypothetically agree with that.
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,555.634,561.298,What impacts the expectations is the following.
2004.03-855,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,595.096,606.75,"It is a matter, is it not, of whether the tribe now has sovereignty over this parcel of land, is that's what's at the bottom of the question?"
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,606.75,614.484,"I think in terms of the problems for the citizens of the City of Sherrill, taxation is part of it, and sovereignty is part of it, they go hand in hand."
2004.03-855,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,614.484,624.921,"If the tribe has sovereignty status with regard to this property, then presumably this city can't tax it."
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,627.886,629.038,"Yes, you do, Your Honor."
2004.03-855,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,629.038,634.606,What do we do with the Oneida II case decided in 1985?
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,634.606,639.033,The position we're taking here is fully consistent with Oneida II.
2004.03-855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.818,673.285,Why not?
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,691.285,692.016,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.365,731.434,"But that wouldn't have been a violation of federal law if this were not Indian country, if this were not an Oneida reservation when the transfer occurred."
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,731.434,736.101,"Your Honor, that might or might not be correct, depending on how one used the scope of the Nonintercourse Act."
2004.03-855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.461,766.341,Is that the application of the Nonintercourse Act?
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,770.229,774.187,"Well, this Court has not dealt with that issue and for our purposes."
2004.03-855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,774.187,774.629,How does it read?
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,789.766,800.55,"The Nonintercourse Act in effect at the time prohibited the purchase of lands from Indians or Indian tribes, to paraphrase."
2004.03-855,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,803.387,809.014,Unless made by treaty or convention entered into pursuant to the constitution.
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,809.014,811.569,"--Yes, unless subject to federal approval."
2004.03-855,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,811.569,828.129,"And the idea of precisely what's at stake within the Oneida litigation, as I understand it, the counties and the municipalities in the City of Sherrill would not be left in the end having to pay, New York would."
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,828.129,832.001,The City of Sherrill is not a party in the land claim litigation.
2004.03-855,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,832.983,840.785,"From the county's point of view, I'm asking who pays at the end of the month and it seems, in the Oneida case, it's the state."
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,846.737,858.535,"--What we are talking about... to answer the first portion of your question, Justice Ginsburg, I think ultimately the citizens of the state of New York would pay but the judgement would be against either the state of New York or the against the counties in the land plat."
2004.03-855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,858.535,861.229,What goes with the taxes?
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,880.877,881.463,"Correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.463,890.557,"Which, of course, makes it a lot easier for them to buy it because it's much less expensive for them to hold that land."
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,895.006,903.592,"The town can't regulate it and if they are running a business on it, we believe this is contrary to state law, they are running a business out there, they are not collecting sales taxes."
2004.03-855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,903.592,909.688,And I assume that also means that that land cannot be repurchased by non Indians?
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,909.688,915.688,"The tribe has changed its position on that, I believe, in the course of the last 30 years but that is their current position."
2004.03-855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.939,1045.086,You're a good lawyer that they hired and the Oneidas may not have hired as good a lawyer.
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1048.499,1050.281,"I'm sure it was not, Your Honor."
2004.03-855,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1075.732,1079.081,"When you say terminated the title, you mean by the conveyance of all lands?"
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1079.081,1081.961,"Yes, they had the exact same language in Article 1."
2004.03-855,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1139.684,1144.42,Was there ever any federal superintendent of the land?
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1144.42,1163.487,"If you count an agent going on the land, there was an agent going on the land, but what happened with this land in terms of federal superintendents is that this land has been superintended, and supervised whether in tribal hands or otherwise by the state of New York and local governments since 1788."
2004.03-855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1192.964,1197.252,Isn't the FBI that keeps peace on other reservations.
2004.03-855,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1201.668,1212.148,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-855,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1219.087,1221.156,"Thank you, Mr. Sacks."
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1223.428,1233.919,"Justice Stevens, may it please the Court:"
2004.03-855,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1255.748,1263.188,Is sovereignty something that the tribes can lose by inaction over a period of time?
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1263.188,1278.372,"--I believe that it is, Your Honor, for the reasons that are laid out in petitioner's brief but regardless of what the Court decides about that question, the Treaty of 1838 clearly disestablishes the reservation which terminates all sovereignty prospectively."
2004.03-855,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1296.319,1310.505,What you seem to be asking is to infer from that treaty that the prior unlawful land sales of the Oneida's New York reservations were somehow ratified.
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1310.505,1314.543,"No, Your Honor, ratification is not presented squarely in this case."
2004.03-855,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1327.231,1338.229,"But if you're right about Buffalo Creek, it would mean that the effect of the government's decision to repossess something in Kansas was to leave the Oneidas without any land."
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1338.229,1339.632,"--Well, at that point--"
2004.03-855,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1339.632,1342.955,It certainly wasn't that clear from it.
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1354.075,1374.929,"--With regard to the 5,000 acres that they occupied as of 1838, one could read Ransom Gillet's assurances to the Oneidas as allowing them to continue to retain occupancy over that narrow place of land but what that cannot do is change the language of the treaty which makes clear that the reservation is otherwise entirely disestablished."
2004.03-855,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1394.049,1394.604,Sure it can.
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1403.702,1415.702,This Court held that Article 13 of the treaty which provides that the Oneidas agreed to remove was sufficient to effect the present grant of the Kansas land and to avoid any forfeiture.
2004.03-855,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1419.526,1424.588,So you're saying there is no consideration if they simply agree to remove if they want to remove.
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1424.758,1428.166,"No, they did receive consideration and the Court made sure--"
2004.03-855,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.166,1429.585,"They gave none, I'm talking about."
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1429.585,1431.457,"--Who gave none, Your Honor?"
2004.03-855,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1431.457,1431.996,The Indians.
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1437.734,1438.593,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-855,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.593,1440.017,I'm trying to help you here.
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1440.017,1443.164,"Then in that case, I suppose I should agree."
2004.03-855,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1491.879,1503.393,"I thought that perhaps the Treaty of Buffalo Creek is thinking of 50,000 acres where these particular Indian tribe members have their homes or at least arguably."
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1510.812,1514.972,"I believe the text and the historical background suggests otherwise, Your Honor."
2004.03-855,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1539.244,1553.276,"Well, It means that that's what was intended but what do you make of all of the testimony about the representations made by... I forget the man's name, the government's representative, to the effect you don't have to leave."
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1553.276,1556.86,"That related only to the 5,000 acres that they occupied at that time."
2004.03-855,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1559.847,1562.45,I guess I just want to get to the point.
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1572.647,1574.354,"No, Your Honor, it doesn't."
2004.03-855,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1648.343,1655.138,What is the precise language that you think relinquished changed the sovereignty?
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1655.138,1656.215,"I think there are several provisions, Your Honor."
2004.03-855,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1713.191,1724.146,There are implications from Oneida to case that the Indians can reacquire land and assert some kind of possessory right.
2004.03-855,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1724.146,1727.336,--With regard to a narrower parcel of land than what's at issue here.
2004.03-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1806.819,1811.107,"Thank you, Ms. Halligan."
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,1814.681,1817.305,"Justice Stevens, may it please the Court:"
2004.03-855,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1857.913,1866.201,So you're saying your position was and is that it's not inalienable without the approval of Defense?
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,1866.201,1866.612,Yes.
2004.03-855,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.457,1887.46,But the portion within the reservation you claim is alienable so long as it's not owned by an Oneida.
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,1891.012,1896.154,"Your Honor, the point of Oneida II... the answer is yes."
2004.03-855,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1896.154,1897.503,Like it was strange?
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,1897.503,1899.29,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-855,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1930.064,1945.594,"Well, if you prevail in this case, then could suits be brought by the tribe to evict current owners of land on this historical Oneida 300,000-acre reservation?"
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,1945.594,1946.853,"--No, Justice O'Connor."
2004.03-855,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1956.533,1964.768,"But if it's owned by the state of New York, if it's been acquired somehow by the state, then what?"
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,1964.768,1967.13,We are not asserting a right to evict.
2004.03-855,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1986.202,1989.936,What happens about... suppose... I just want to follow this.
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2015.835,2017.926,Let me give you a concrete answer.
2004.03-855,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2034.875,2036.87,What was the acreage there?
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2036.87,2040.353,"--Approximately one fourth... the answer is 64,000 acres."
2004.03-855,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2040.353,2043.015,That may not be worth as much.
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2058.513,2059.521,Correct.
2004.03-855,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2070.647,2074.226,"No, no, of course the people who are there have it, maybe it's not Buffalo."
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2095.975,2096.978,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-855,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2105.229,2107.058,"On the whole 300,000?"
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2107.058,2115.154,"--Well, there is one plus part of it that we have not sued upon because there was a 1798 federal treaty that validated the transfer."
2004.03-855,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2132.685,2138.567,Do the Oneidas have a claim to tax the current property owners?
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2138.567,2139.565,"No, sir."
2004.03-855,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2139.565,2140.359,Why not?
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2140.359,2152.402,The decisions of the Court in cases like Atkinson and Montana address the lack of power of a tribe with respect to non Indian freelance within a reservation.
2004.03-855,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.194,2192.85,"Mr. Smith, isn't there any principal of laches that comes into effect here."
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2227.224,2238.44,"The issues of laches in time is not within the questions presented in this case, notwithstanding that it has been identified in earlier decisions and was actually raised by the counties in this Court in the last go around."
2004.03-855,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2262.424,2273.186,"The case also held that because of the passage of time and the reliance interest that has developed, we are not going to give you possession."
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2297.784,2312.402,The equitable principles that would inform remedy in an action brought by a tribe out of possession don't apply when a tribe is in possession or else there has been a judicial extinguishment of an underlying right that's only within the power of Congress to extinguish.
2004.03-855,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2362.248,2378.04,"Mr. Smith, at first, would you clarify how much land is now claimed as Indian... within the tribe's aboriginal right?"
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2386.6,2387.822,--They did.
2004.03-855,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2411.363,2419.432,Some of that you said was taken up by an approved transfer in 1798?
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2419.432,2422.072,"Yes, and that's why I'm not saying 300,000 acres."
2004.03-855,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2424.579,2426.526,But something around 275?
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2426.526,2428.995,--Around 270.
2004.03-855,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2428.995,2438.878,"And the figure, the 250 million is for the rental... what is that... what is that for?"
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2438.878,2441.299,"In the Cayuga case, there were two elements of damages."
2004.03-855,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2493.752,2498.595,"Which New York State paid, and that's the end of it."
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2498.595,2500.921,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-855,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2502.719,2503.156,"Wall, that's not the end of it."
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2508.729,2509.108,Correct.
2004.03-855,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2526.479,2549.727,"What do you say are the merits, then, to the claim that there were 300,000 of these acres in 1838 or with the Treaty of Buffalo Creek... there were 300,000 acres that nobody was paying any attention to because there were no tribe members that lived there, so that when you have language in the treaty, under those circumstances, that says their home is now... where was it?"
2004.03-855,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2550.543,2552.021,Kansas.
2004.03-855,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2552.021,2552.351,--Kansas.
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2581.994,2583.087,--There are a lot of parts to that.
2004.03-855,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2585.002,2585.439,Yeah.
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2585.439,2593.775,"That argument rests on the idea that there was an assumption, at the time of the Treaty of Buffalo Creek, that the prior transfers were valid."
2004.03-855,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2657.631,2662.671,Would not it be odd to have a... to give assurance that you could buy back what you've lost?
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2670.719,2674.794,--The representations from the federal treaty commissioner were not that they could buy it back.
2004.03-855,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2731.439,2743.162,"Mr. Steward, your time is beginning to come up, and there is one thing we haven't talked about that I'd really like to get your view on, and that is the 1788 Treaty... what was that, Fort Schuyler... Treaty of Fort Schuyler?"
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2743.162,2743.855,--Yes.
2004.03-855,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2743.855,2745.466,--between New York State and the Oneidas.
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2832.24,2833.072,Actually--
2004.03-855,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2833.072,2834.123,The New York State Police were in there.
2004.03-855,2,36677,michael_r_smith,,2836.395,2854.294,"--Justice Scalia, actually, it's interesting, in the Joint Appendix in the Court of Appeals, at page 413, is the actual document that governed the transfer of this land, the state statute; and in that statute, the state granted its right of preemption to an individual to acquire the land, because it understood that it had not yet exercised its right of preemption."
2004.03-855,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3018.684,3019.617,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3029.356,3031.276,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-855,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3072.311,3073.81,I don't... I don't understand that argument at all.
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3087.474,3091.02,"--Well, I think it... I think it's important to distinguish between two different types of delay."
2004.03-855,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3122.061,3129.805,"Well, do you say that a tribe can never lose its sovereign rights to land?"
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3134.173,3138.962,--This Court has held that the tribe... that a tribe may abandon aboriginal title to land.
2004.03-855,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3138.962,3139.346,Yes.
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3139.346,3139.48,It's not--
2004.03-855,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3139.48,3146.254,"Yes, and we have held that a state can abandon sovereignty, as in Massachusetts versus New York."
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3146.254,3162.494,"--But the Court has also held that once Congress creates a reservation, once it confers explicit federal protection on particular lands, the reservation can be diminished or disestablished only by act of Congress; it can't be terminated through adverse possession."
2004.03-855,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3170.03,3181.252,"Well, that might give them a right to some kind of damages for a violation, but what does that do to the sovereign claims of the tribe?"
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3181.252,3183.918,--I think the... the reservation would remain a reservation.
2004.03-855,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3201.657,3202.286,What is it?
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3220.084,3243.551,"The Court, in Atkinson Trading, and in Montana versus United States, before that, that said that the tribe may be able to regulate conduct on non Indian lands to the extent that the conduct involves voluntary transactions with the tribe or its members or to the extent that the regulation is necessary in order to protect the tribe's sovereignty over the land that it possesses is--"
2004.03-855,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3243.551,3253.706,"But now we're talking about land that... where there are no tribe members... as I understand it, this area is predominantly non tribal members."
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3253.706,3254.116,--I agree.
2004.03-855,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3286.314,3290.244,"Well, that may be true, but that's why I wondered about the damage part of it."
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3322.399,3323.791,"--That's true, but--"
2004.03-855,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3323.791,3327.135,"And that's why I want to know how, in practice, this works out."
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3338.49,3340.522,--Congress does have the power to deal with it.
2004.03-855,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3349.061,3353.061,"Yes, Congress has done nothing about this, has it?"
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3362.687,3365.167,"Well, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has recognized the tripe all along."
2004.03-855,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3412.885,3414.981,What tax... what taxes are we talking about?
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3418.448,3434.405,"--No, the Court has said... the Court has said, as a general matter, as a matter of federal law, a tribal merchant on tribal land can be required to collect sales taxes from non Indians, at least for the purchase of goods that were purchased off the reservations."
2004.03-855,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3434.405,3436.522,"Well, it isn't just taxes we're talking about."
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3445.749,3450.085,"I mean, taxes are the only thing at issue... are the only thing that's at issue in this case."
2004.03-855,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3478.667,3481.878,"Mr. Stuart, I have one question about, Buffalo Creek."
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3496.427,3514.592,"Well, the Court, in the New York Indians II, recognized, to start with, that the treaty affected an immediate session of the Oneida's Wisconsin lands to the Federal Government, and the Court specifically noted that that session, in and of itself, would be sufficient consideration to support a contract between private parties."
2004.03-855,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3523.03,3533.115,"Was there any positive indication... I just don't remember this... in the New York case, that they would... that they, in fact, had ceded anything of New... of their interest in New York?"
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3537.078,3543.628,"--I mean, there were references to the primary inducement to the Federal Government's entering into the treaty being the desire for--"
2004.03-855,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3543.628,3544.833,That's entering into the treaty.
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3556.972,3557.314,--No.
2004.03-855,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3557.692,3558.071,Okay.
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3558.071,3560.487,The compensation was strictly for the Kansas lands that were denied to them.
2004.03-855,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3561.964,3568.22,"But there was no indication that they got Kansas for anything other than Wisconsin, is that correct?"
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3568.22,3575.298,"--They got... I mean, they didn't... they weren't held to have promised... made a commitment to remove from New York."
2004.03-855,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3577.933,3583.309,"But there was no indication that they had ceded anything with respect to title in New York, was there?"
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3583.309,3583.901,--That's correct.
2004.03-855,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3583.901,3584.125,"Okay,--"
2004.03-855,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3584.125,3587.437,"Well, it rested upon the session in Wisconsin?"
2004.03-855,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3587.437,3589.48,"It rested, in part, upon the session in Wisconsin."
2004.03-855,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3642.147,3642.909,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
