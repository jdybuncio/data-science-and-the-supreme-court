1975.75-19,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.054,"We will hear arguments next in 75-19, United States against Santana."
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,51.614,55.243,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-19,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,102.691,110.942,"Do you mean when it is in progress, or when it is in progress and that fact is known or observed by the officer?"
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,110.942,114.901,And when the officers have probable cause to believe that it is in progress.
1975.75-19,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,114.901,120.013,Just to be abstract without observation or without objective fact --
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,120.013,127.816,"Unless it was known beforehand, if it just simply turned out that it was in progress, the after the fact justification would not be sufficient."
1975.75-19,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,151.447,158.069,"Let me state that second ground, you say when it is supposed evidence might be destroyed, is that not always true?"
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,158.069,165.944,"Our general argument in that regard is that during several hours after a crime, it should be reasonable to enter a house to make an arrest."
1975.75-19,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,185.25,202.856,"Is it dependent upon there being some likelihood that -- well, supposing you have a case in which the crime involves no other evidence other than just knowledge or reasonable cause to believe that a person say, committed a murder, but there is no evidence, you do not expect to find, does the evidence have any bearing and I understand –- I am quite following you?"
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,202.856,205.327,"Well, it would be difficult to understand."
1975.75-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,265.018,269.1,"At any time, day or night as per your argument."
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,269.1,272.03,"Historically, that has been so Mr. Justice Stewart."
1975.75-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,272.03,274.443,"I just wanted, what is your argument, what your position was?"
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,274.443,286.279,"Our position is that that still should be so, but it is of course not necessary to reach that question here because of the two independent grounds that I have begun to set out and also because this arrest took place during the day."
1975.75-19,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,298.178,299.407,I have just one.
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,309.827,310.411,Yes.
1975.75-19,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.411,311.068,Both are required?
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,311.068,312.785,Both are required.
1975.75-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,427.516,432.9,"Now Mr. Easterbrook, you referred throughout this recital of the facts to these people as officers."
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,434.889,435.544,That is correct.
1975.75-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,436.272,437.874,They were officers of Philadelphia.
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,437.874,440.332,Yes.
1975.75-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,440.332,446.49,"Does that make any difference or because Elkins against United States this is as though they were federal officers, is that it?"
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,446.49,466.873,"In our view, they must be judged as though they were federal officers, and because of Elkins and I would add to Elkins, the companion case, Rios, 364 U.S. 260 to 61 and most recently, Cady against Dombrowski, 413 U. S. 433 at 449."
1975.75-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,466.873,468.654,This is the same as though they were federal officers?
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,468.654,479.16,"They must be treated as though they were federal officers from a constitutional point of view, and the only question is whether their actions comported with the Federal Constitution."
1975.75-19,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,502.283,507.965,"When you say recovered the money, do you mean the identification was made by a virtue of them by the serial numbers?"
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,507.965,510.462,By the fact -- because the serial numbers have been recorded Your Honor.
1975.75-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,524.284,526.705,Is there any state prosecution?
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,526.705,532.535,"They were originally also arrested by state authorities, initially -–"
1975.75-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,532.535,534.149,That is what you just stated the facts?
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,534.149,536.466,And they were charged by state authorities.
1975.75-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,550.959,552.3,That was not a problem here?
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,552.3,553.346,There was not.
1975.75-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,553.346,556.476,Whatever other problems we may have? [Laughter]
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,556.476,567.347,"Although the oral opinion of the District Court is not entirely clear, the Judge apparently concluded that the evidence was required to be suppressed, because the arrest of Santana was made without a warrant."
1975.75-19,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,605.94,614.765,"Did District Judge say something about their being no danger of destruction of the evidence, or the concealment of it?"
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,614.765,625.494,"The District Court concluded that because they found $70 in respondent Santana’s pockets, there was no reason to believe that evidence was to be destroyed."
1975.75-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,634.636,637.209,I gather it was the marked money.
1975.75-19,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,637.209,638.0,Yes.
1975.75-19,1,20821,dennis_h_eisman,,1633.587,1637.422,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1670.276,1685.389,"What do you suggest as a hypothesis for the probabilities when the officers approached the door and she was standing in the open doorway, as it turns out with the heroin either in her hands or under her person?"
1975.75-19,1,20821,dennis_h_eisman,,1685.389,1685.578,What?
1975.75-19,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2392.365,2403.169,Counsel for respondent has indicated that a problem in this case is the failure of the officers to announce that they were officers and to state their purpose and to demand entry.
1975.75-19,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2493.987,2494.898,Thank you gentlemen.
