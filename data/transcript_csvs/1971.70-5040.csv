1971.70-5040,1,38983,richard_l_curry,,2058.033,2083.81,"It is hoped quite frankly Your Honor, that the verdict in this case will require that Mr. Field use his considerable talent as was exhibited in his post trial motion of 14 pages and reconstruct a settled statement so that the matter can be brought to the attention of the Court as I hope an expectation that the rule of Griffin will not be expanded by this bench."

1971.70-5040,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2127.082,2142.329,"That probably does the -- will the trial Judge, if you follow that method and you and Mr. Field could not agree on the settled statement and the trial Judge had to instruct it, would he have available the transcript for that purpose?"

1971.70-5040,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2145.331,2158.993,"Well my question Mr. Curry was would the trial Judge, that if it made available to the trial Judge so that he could resolve the dispute between you and Mr. Field, and (Inaudible) settled statement --"
1971.70-5040,1,38983,richard_l_curry,,2158.993,2160.302,I really do not know that Your Honor.

1971.70-5040,1,38983,richard_l_curry,,2162.429,2178.431,"I was going suggest, thank you Mr. Chief Justice, that avenue of reviewing the un-transcribed portion of the reporterâ€™s notes is also an avenue which is available to the appellant in this case."

1971.70-5040,1,38983,richard_l_curry,,2195.05,2213.828,"I submit that it would be his obligation to point out to the Court that he had tried that and that avenue was not available, that he was in fact affectively foreclosed from the reasonable avenues to go forward with his matter and try to present an alternative to the Court."
1971.70-5040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2213.828,2222.11,"Mr. Curry, I am troubled with the fact that the Circuit Court has said frankly I do not care what you do, you are not untitled for it?"
1971.70-5040,1,38983,richard_l_curry,,2235.561,2240.438,The rule of the Court spoken in terms of a felony at that time Mr. Justice Marshall.
1971.70-5040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.438,2243.187,And was it not that where it was in Circuit Court?
1971.70-5040,1,38983,richard_l_curry,,2249.336,2252.25,You are right at the lower level Your Honor.
1971.70-5040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2252.73,2255.527,Do you agree -- do you think he was right or do you think it was in error?
1971.70-5040,1,38983,richard_l_curry,,2255.527,2257.074,He then went to the Supreme Court the --
1971.70-5040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2257.074,2259.16,Do you think he was in error?
1971.70-5040,1,38983,richard_l_curry,,2259.16,2261.544,I think he was correct with his ruling.
1971.70-5040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2261.544,2263.016,Do you think he is correct now?
1971.70-5040,1,38983,richard_l_curry,,2263.016,2264.351,I do Sir.
1971.70-5040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2264.351,2267.217,"Why, because of the rule?"
1971.70-5040,1,38983,richard_l_curry,,2267.217,2294.015,"No, not because he ruled because there is in the Supreme Court of Illinois ruled three to agree, clear and unmistakable a language which finds that as a derivation of the case of Duncan versus Louisiana where alternates are specifically suggested as ways that a state can allow an indigent to proceed other than by a full verbatim transcript."
