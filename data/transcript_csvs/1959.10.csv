1959.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1891.59,1894.482,Oh I thought you said that it was longer than that.
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,1894.482,1898.035,"Well, the yard -- the classification yard, if Your Honor please --"
1959.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1898.035,1898.851,Is up in the right-hand corner.
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,1898.851,1900.325,Is up at the right-hand corner.
1959.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1900.325,1901.56,"Tracks three and five, I take it."
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,1901.56,1902.431,"That's right, sir."

1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,1902.489,1912.378,"And then, the line which goes on back to the main line is right at the right-hand edge."
1959.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1912.378,1913.18,Yes.
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,1913.18,1913.238,And --
1959.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1913.238,1915.184,And that is how -- how long?
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,1915.184,1923.012,That -- but from there to Bellwood is about 10-12 miles but the actual yard limit is only about a mile beyond the point on the map.
1959.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1923.012,1924.511,It would be about three miles long.
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,1924.511,1925.167,"That's right, sir."
1959.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1925.167,1929.258,"Well, that's how it is."
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,1929.258,1948.025,So these cars are brought in on the track here on the right-hand side into this yard where the -- I mean the train is brought in there and it's broken up and the cars are sorted and divided up for the various consignees.

1959.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2366.745,2377.066,"All the cases here, bringing the case of the United States against Railroad has this question come up in any of the FELA cases --"
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,2377.066,2377.29,I do not --
1959.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2377.29,2377.978,-- calling for construction?
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,2377.978,2390.333,"I do not recall, sir, that this specific question of the requirement with regard to air brakes or -- and their being used has come up in any FELA case."
1959.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2390.731,2392.954,And quite a number of it involves switching --
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,2392.954,2394.456,That's -- yes.
1959.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2402.219,2402.786,Yes.
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,2402.786,2405.837,And whether the (Inaudible) were secure.
1959.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2417.792,2420.035,What's been held with reference to coupling?
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,2420.035,2420.68,Sir?
1959.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2420.68,2424.406,What's been held with reference to movements of this kind in connection with coupling?
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,2424.406,2434.397,"Well if Your Honor please, the FELA requires that the couples connect automatically upon impact."
1959.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2439.087,2440.524,Without regard to whether it's a train --
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,2440.524,2442.682,Without regard to whether it's a train or not.
1959.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2471.261,2482.282,Mr. Justice Brennan asked Mr. Davis if this ruling would affect -- be effective in a personal injury case the same way and his answer was yes.
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,2482.862,2485.036,"I rather think, if Your Honor please."
1959.10,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2518.517,2520.134,(Inaudible)
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,2520.134,2520.911,Sir?
1959.10,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2520.911,2533.528,"I say is that really found open here, what was the rule against this (Inaudible) are we not -- the important to act as it should be?"
1959.10,1,22485,eppa_hunton_iv,,2533.528,2534.81,Undoubtedly.
1959.10,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2534.81,2535.296,What?
