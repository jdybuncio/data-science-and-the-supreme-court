1970.26,0,22160,elizabeth_b_dubois,,38.318,41.246,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.26,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1839.356,1840.209,Mr. Chief Justice ---
1970.26,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1840.209,1841.038,Mr. Tinglum.
1970.26,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1841.038,1868.82,"If the Court please, I would like first of all just to mention briefly a -- what is the difference of opinion about the statement of facts, the respondent did not take issue in its brief with the statement of facts presented in the appellants brief."
1970.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2152.491,2191.508,"I understood the appellant's theory to be that since the trial court denied the motion for change of venue not on the ground that there was no showing of -- no sufficient showing of community prejudice but rather on the ground that no matter how much community prejudice, you may show I cannot and will not listen to any evidence among those lines because the statute of the state absolutely forbids me to grant a change of venue so any hearing on that community prejudice would be a waste of time for both of us."
1970.26,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2191.508,2191.878,That's all --
1970.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2191.878,2210.04,"And therefore that we must assume in this case that what this case amounts to is a denial of a hearing on community prejudice and we perhaps may assume that there would have been, could have been an extraordinary showing of it, right along the lines of Rideau against Louisiana."
1970.26,2,22160,elizabeth_b_dubois,,3685.021,3686.615,"Alright, I just have a few points to make --"
1970.26,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3686.615,3690.351,You have four minutes.
1970.26,2,22160,elizabeth_b_dubois,,3690.351,3691.921,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1970.26,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3848.878,3865.478,"On that point, isn't that the conventional way if you are asking the Court to take judicial notice of the whole category at least to suggest by way of proffer, some specific instances as to alert the Court to the area?"
1970.26,2,22160,elizabeth_b_dubois,,3865.478,3866.717,Yes.
1970.26,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3921.677,3926.904,Let me interrupt one thing in the last page with your appendix.
1970.26,2,22160,elizabeth_b_dubois,,3971.015,3972.741,"At least, I'm not sure."
1970.26,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3980.783,3989.096,What is the time to appeal in -- on what -- what was your deadline here?
1970.26,2,22160,elizabeth_b_dubois,,3993.894,4000.159,"Notice of appeal to this Court was filed in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin May 6, 1969."
1970.26,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4000.159,4005.232,"Well the time, the one year had expired by that time?"
1970.26,2,22160,elizabeth_b_dubois,,4005.616,4012.237,"Yes, Your Honor because February 9, 1968 was when he was tried so it had expired at that time."
1970.26,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4012.237,4019.408,"But it could, that motion could have been made after the judgment."
1970.26,2,22160,elizabeth_b_dubois,,4022.078,4025.144,"They -- I think there was something like three days, three or four days."
1970.26,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4025.144,4026.877,"Thank you, Mrs. Dubois."
