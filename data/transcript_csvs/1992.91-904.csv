1992.91-904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.991,We'll hear argument next in Number 91-904 Concrete Pipe and Products of California v. Construction Laborers' Pension Trust.
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,51.766,54.801,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-904,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.196,151.631,"Yes, they have had a relationship."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,169.193,186.054,"Justice Scalia, our company voluntarily went into the relationship, and the relationship was defined that they went into at the time was a defined contribution... the plan held itself out to be a defined contribution plan to the extent allowed by ERISA."
1992.91-904,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,190.073,191.106,At the time.
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,194.025,194.993,"--Oh, yes."
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.862,210.087,"But the plan that you entered, your company entered into, is not acknowledged, I gather, as a defined contribution plan under ERISA."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,210.087,217.591,"In 1976, when they entered the plan, it was considered to be a defined contribution plan."
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.811,225.679,"Well, it since then decided that it is not, correct?"
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,225.679,227.548,--I do not believe that is correct.
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.724,251.164,"Well, I thought you didn't raise the issue here or argue this case or present it to us on the basis that it's a defined contribution plan."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,251.164,251.614,We did not--
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,251.614,255.616,I thought we took it on the assumption that it was not--
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,255.616,255.999,--That it's--
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.999,257.651,--That it's a defined benefit plan.
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,258.817,263.722,"--We did not raise it, but we do not necessarily concede that it is a defined benefit plan."
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,269.075,277.564,"Well, I guess as we take it, we have to consider that it is not, even though perhaps it could have been argued differently below."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,277.564,303.763,"--Perhaps it could have been argued differently below, and it is... certainly to assess liability under the statute it has to be a defined benefit plan, and certainly it has been considered, I presume, by the deciding parties that it is a defined benefit plan in assessing liability, since the statute clearly states that there is no withdrawal liability with respect to a defined contribution plan."
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,319.141,336.686,"Well, the only thing I can see that you might not have assumed the risk for back in joining the plan was that the withdrawal liability might take up to 50 percent of your net worth instead of 30 percent, as ERISA had limited."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,336.686,342.155,In... it was a very contingent risk under the original statute.
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,342.155,349.243,Under the original statute there was a contingent withdrawal liability of amounts up to 30 percent of the net worth.
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,349.243,377.311,"But not as to defined contribution plans, and it's clearly conceded that in 1976 everyone believed this to be a defined contribution plan, so if you're asking what the intent of the parties were in entering this relationship and whether they agreed to become liable for this type of debt when they entered the plan on December 1, 1976, they did not agree to assume liabilities to other employees in 1976."
1992.91-904,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.866,408.732,They were wrong about that.
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,410.318,413.936,But if you... if the issue is when they... there was no--
1992.91-904,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.936,421.69,"Well, the issue is what their reasonable expectations were, and you don't have a reasonable expectation that's contrary to the law."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,421.69,428.029,"--Well, you have a reasonable... they entered a plan and they did nothing contrary to the law."
1992.91-904,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,428.029,438.485,"No, but you're telling us you thought it was a defined benefit plan and it turned out not to be, or vice versa, and I mean, that's your problem."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,451.728,477.76,"Well, I think the Government's ability to deal with us depends... I think what we are pursuing in this action is that the Government has been recognized to be limited in its ability to deal with us, and the Government's ability to deal with us is that it can't charge one member of society for debts with which it is unrelated, and there must be some reasonable relationship in the legislation."
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,528.395,530.211,"Well, Mr. Murphy, let me put it this way."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,543.405,543.871,If the--
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,543.871,552.593,--And... and entered into on the date that was applicable here after ERISA had been enacted.
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,552.593,555.128,--I believe the case--
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,555.128,570.555,"Now, under that assumption, I assume that you would acknowledge that the company could be liable for withdrawal liability up to 30 percent of its net worth."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,570.555,585.648,"--If they understood at the 1976 that they were a defined benefit plan, they would have therefore, under force of statute, been constructively... had constructive knowledge that they would have been liable up to 30 percent."
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,585.648,586.082,You acknowledge that.
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,586.082,586.498,Correct.
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,586.498,599.407,"Well, since you didn't raise the question about this not being a defined benefit plan, isn't that precisely how we have to view it here?"
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,599.407,621.571,"Well, we can view it as a defined benefit plan here, but what we are trying to do here as I understand it is to determine whether the application of the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendment Act that was passed in 1980 is applicable... is constitutional under the substantive due process clause and the takings clause, and I think that that--"
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,621.571,626.475,"Well, the only thing that added was that they could go up to 50 percent of the net worth."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,629.011,633.312,"--Actually, it added it go up to any amount well over 50 percent--"
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,633.312,634.664,--In your circumstances--
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,634.664,635.53,--In our circumstances.
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.53,636.547,--It amounts to 50.
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,636.547,667.552,"But to assess us with the responsibilities under this act, we believe that they have to establish a nexus between our conduct and our promises and these payments, and what we're trying to demonstrate is that there was no reasonable... and as we state in our reply brief, if you were going to analogize to a joint venture or an insurance fund, there has to be some promise made, and there's no reasonable basis for asserting a promise."
1992.91-904,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,750.373,759.811,Isn't it also the case that the more you pay indicates the more likelihood of proportionacely large claims down the road?
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,761.095,771.453,"If it was related... the more we pay related in some way to the credits or the vesting of employees, but--"
1992.91-904,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,771.453,794.651,"Well, you're now... if I understand you, you're now turning to a second argument, and that is, during the period in which we paid our employees did not work long enough to have vested benefits, but it seems to me that that argument is foreclosed by the fact that the very point of the act was to aggregate the periods of employment, so I don't see how you can make that argument."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,794.651,818.682,"--The argument I'm making with that fact is that the point of the act and the point of prior decisions is that an employer must pay for the liabilities that arose as a result of its participation, and this formula does not determine or even come close to determining liabilities that arose as a result of its participation."
1992.91-904,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.692,848.369,"Well, isn't it enough if you have a reasonable plan that, in most cases, on average would indeed hit the employer with the liabilities that arose by reason of its participation?"
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,867.513,882.107,"Well, the law does not have to work out perfectly, but the law has to have some relationship between the harm... the legislation has to have some rational relationship between the harm that it is trying to address and the remedy that is provided."
1992.91-904,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.107,885.292,"In each case, or just generally."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,885.292,893.248,"Well, I would think that in general the statute has to, but in general this formula does not address that."
1992.91-904,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.632,929.421,"As Justice Souter says, ordinarily the more you pay the more you do expose the... the more your operation does expose the fund to greater liability."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,931.69,934.225,I don't think so.
1992.91-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,952.519,955.888,Are you suggesting the payments should only relate to vested benefits?
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,957.34,962.142,The... we are suggesting the payments should... and the formula should only relate to vested benefits.
1992.91-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.142,965.427,"So that if you're in business less than 10 years, you'd have no withdrawal liability."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,965.427,970.462,"Well, I would even go so far as relate to vested credits."
1992.91-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.462,976.216,Am I right about... under your theory you should have no withdrawal liability if you contribute for less than 10 years?
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,976.216,976.499,No.
1992.91-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,992.077,996.279,"Well, assume all of your employees had no prior employment within the industry."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,1002.183,1005.302,"--That is one theory, but we don't have to go that far, because our proof is--"
1992.91-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1005.302,1007.92,"It seems to me that's where your argument takes you, if I understand it."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,1007.92,1008.62,--No.
1992.91-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.36,1020.562,"Well, but if your employees have no vested benefits, they're fully funded by zero."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,1020.562,1036.439,"--Well, there is no vested... there is no... by definition, there is no vested liability at that moment in time, but there are 2-1/2 years of credits toward the 10 years, and we have fully paid for those 2-1/2 years of credits."
1992.91-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1036.439,1039.308,"Yes, but you would then therefore have no withdrawal liability."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,1039.308,1041.758,We would have no withdrawal liability.
1992.91-904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1127.164,1141.841,You say that the Constitution requires that Congress say that if the trustees are going to use their best judgment that they must prove by a preponderance of the evidence?
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,1141.841,1153.481,"I don't... I have no problem with merely switching the burden of proof and allowing us to address best estimate, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but the statute does not allow us to do that."
1992.91-904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1195.843,1204.181,"I thought you said you could prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they were in error, and then you would prevail under the statute."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,1204.181,1209.235,--We cannot prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they did not use their best estimate.
1992.91-904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1267.607,1270.476,That is simply the estimate of the interest rate.
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,1270.476,1289.203,"--That is the estimate of the interest rate, and then they apply that interest rate to the presumptive formula and come up with their unfunded liability determination, and in so doing... in so doing they have prevented Concrete Pipe and Products from addressing the issue, and they've--"
1992.91-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1289.203,1294.507,What is open to you at arbitration to prove with regard to the interest rate?
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,1294.507,1328.764,"--We have to prove that it is not... with respect to the interest rate, that it is not within this wide range of reasonableness, that in this case they used 6 percent for future funds which their actuary admitted that it was on the low end of reasonable, it was lower than their last year's 10 years experience, but he also figured in that there might be future increases in the benefits and so therefore used that, which is not in the statute at all."
1992.91-904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1339.87,1342.905,Are you talking about the trustees or the actuary?
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,1342.905,1345.524,"Well, this is... the trustees hire actuaries."
1992.91-904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1351.678,1357.247,"So it's the actuaries' judgment that you seek to challenge, the best estimate."
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,1357.247,1357.814,It is--
1992.91-904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1357.814,1362.151,Is that made by the actuary or by the trustees?
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,1362.151,1394.289,"--It is originally made by the actuary, and the actuary is hired by the trustees, and the trustees are well aware of the various philosophies of the actuaries when they hire them, so they can go hire actuaries who are very conservative and use very low rates, they can hire actuaries that are known to be more liberal and use higher rates, or they can use actuaries they know have been... used more moderate rates, and it's their determination as to which actuary they use."
1992.91-904,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1394.289,1394.706,That's okay.
1992.91-904,0,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,1398.408,1401.026,I don't challenge the fact that they go hire the actuary.
1992.91-904,1,31786,john_s_miller,,1767.832,1770.934,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-904,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1963.393,1986.091,"Well, why didn't ERISA as it was originally promulgated create a distinct investment base backed expectation in the petitioner that its withdrawal liability, if any, would not exceed 30 percent of its net worth?"
1992.91-904,1,31786,john_s_miller,,1986.091,1988.96,"The answer to that, I believe, is--"
1992.91-904,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1988.96,1992.245,That was the expectation under ERISA.
1992.91-904,1,31786,john_s_miller,,1992.245,1995.297,"--The contingent liability of 30 percent, that's correct."
1992.91-904,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2012.158,2023.633,"But on an as-applied challenge, it seems to me you may run into trouble on the excess over the 30 percent."
1992.91-904,1,31786,john_s_miller,,2023.633,2039.726,"--That argument is equally availing on a facial challenge, because every employer who contributes to the plan and chooses to leave the plan has that same exposure, and I suspect--"
1992.91-904,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2039.726,2049.514,"But unless it's applied and assessed in an amount over that, you don't really have the problem, but here it has been, apparently."
1992.91-904,1,31786,john_s_miller,,2049.514,2053.918,"--Well, that is not in the record, as I understand it."
1992.91-904,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.768,2395.909,"Mr. Miller, you're saying that the actuary who made the interest rate determination was the actuary who was employed by the plan at the time the petitioner here got into it?"
1992.91-904,1,31786,john_s_miller,,2395.909,2396.409,Yes.
1992.91-904,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2404.682,2410.085,But their expectation was not that the same interest rate would apply.
1992.91-904,1,31786,john_s_miller,,2436.403,2450.961,"Well, what I'm suggesting, Justice Scalia, is that the methods that the actuary uses to arrive at the 6 percent factor are... the methodology is on-going."
1992.91-904,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2499.643,2508.015,"The date that the employer withdrew from the plan is also something that's determined by the trustees, is it not?"
1992.91-904,1,31786,john_s_miller,,2508.015,2526.461,In terms... the date that the... our perception of withdrawal is that whether or not an employer withdrew from the plan is a matter of law.
1992.91-904,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2530.613,2538.268,"So do the... do the trustee's determination of the withdrawal date, is that entitled to any deference in the reviewing court or deference before the arbitrator?"
1992.91-904,1,31786,john_s_miller,,2538.268,2546.772,--The presumption would apply... the presumption in favor of the trustee's determination does apply to all determinations.
1992.91-904,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2547.79,2553.694,"So assuming the trustees are biased decisionmakers, you then have a presumption being given in favor of the biased decisionmakers."
1992.91-904,1,31786,john_s_miller,,2553.694,2557.063,--That begs the question as to whether or not they are decisionmakers.
1992.91-904,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2570.739,2575.041,And whose judgment is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness.
1992.91-904,1,31786,john_s_miller,,2575.041,2607.328,"--Whose... yes, who has the burden of proof accorded to it under this particular statutory scheme, which is not... we submit is not an issue of constitutional moment, and that in reality what is happening is that the law says if you quit contributing to a plan, you owe that plan your share of the unfunded vested liability unless you, the employer, can qualify for an exception."
1992.91-904,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2619.903,2627.159,"No, but it isn't just a matter of burden, they... it is not enough for them to prove that it's wrong."
1992.91-904,1,31786,john_s_miller,,2630.961,2633.33,"--They... unreasonable, or they have to prove--"
1992.91-904,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2633.33,2634.33,That doesn't mean just wrong.
1992.91-904,1,31786,john_s_miller,,2637.398,2650.172,"--If it is still a burden, it is... we submit that it doesn't rise to a constitutional deprivation to have a stronger burden for them to carry."
1992.91-904,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.274,2662.999,"--To have a biased decisionmaker make a decision against you that is wrong, and you can't overturn unless it is in addition to being wrong, unreasonable."
1992.91-904,1,31786,john_s_miller,,2662.999,2666.367,--The... we submit that the trustees are not decisionmakers.
1992.91-904,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2701.624,2704.159,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2707.028,2707.844,"Flowe, Your Honor."
1992.91-904,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2707.844,2709.73,"Ms. Flowe, we'll hear from you."
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2709.73,2730.476,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, PBGC did not participate in this case below, but when we learned that the Court had agreed to hear it, we did ask to participate because of the importance of this act to the financial stability of multiemployer plans as well as to our insurance program which protects the pensions of the millions of workers in those plans."
1992.91-904,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2761.246,2767.649,"How was that involved in the Young case, the 4 to 4 split case?"
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2767.649,2774.153,Only the trustee presumption was found unconstitutional by the third circuit in Young and McDonald.
1992.91-904,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.153,2778.54,Our 4 to 4 split affirmed that.
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2778.54,2782.926,"That's correct, Justice White... left that decision standing."
1992.91-904,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2782.926,2786.913,"And the withdrawal date's a trustee assumption, not an actuarial assumption, of course."
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2786.913,2792.634,"That's correct, to the extent that it involves disputed issues of fact."
1992.91-904,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2798.538,2806.041,Why is that presumption couched both in terms of reasonableness and clear error?
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2806.041,2825.271,"Because, Justice Souter, there are different kinds of determinations that have to be made under this act by the plan trustees, and while we certainly acknowledge that this language is inartfully drawn, we believe that Congress chose those different terms to apply to different kinds of determinations."
1992.91-904,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2865.58,2875.121,"Now, what's the relationship between those two standards and the de novo review standard that Mr. Miller was speaking of at the time his time expired?"
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2875.121,2883.976,The... this entire presumption applied only to factual determinations of the plan trustees.
1992.91-904,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2889.713,2890.046,"Well, is the ultimate--"
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2890.046,2890.446,Those that the--
1992.91-904,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2890.446,2891.246,--Excuse me.
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2898.985,2903.537,"--Again, it would depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular situation."
1992.91-904,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2916.863,2917.363,So that the appeal--
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2917.363,2917.929,--And he didn't have--
1992.91-904,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2917.929,2918.846,--I'm sorry.
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2919.898,2925.2,"--I was just going to... so he didn't use the presumption in deciding the question here, and appropriately so."
1992.91-904,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2925.2,2932.123,And therefore the arbitrator reviewed it on a de novo basis as a mixed question as to which there was no factual dispute.
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2932.123,2948.882,"He independently analyzed how the acts should be interpreted as applied to these facts and reached a decision without regard to any presumption at all in this particular instance, and in fact this trustee presumption was applied to no issue--"
1992.91-904,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2948.882,2949.5,So--
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2949.5,2950.417,--In this case.
1992.91-904,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2950.417,2956.088,"--So the trustee presumption really, as it comes to us, isn't involved in this case at all."
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2956.088,2957.454,"That's correct, Justice White."
1992.91-904,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2969.729,2975.902,Did the arbitrator specifically disclaim reliance on the presumption?
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2975.902,2978.335,The arbitration was bifurcated.
1992.91-904,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2990.392,2995.613,Is it your position that there is no presumption as to matters of law?
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,2995.613,2996.446,That's correct.
1992.91-904,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2996.446,3000.617,Is there a presumption as to mixed matters of law and fact?
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,3000.617,3003.302,"Not to mixed questions either, that those two--"
1992.91-904,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3003.302,3004.902,There's no presumption as to this.
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,3004.902,3006.921,--Correct.
1992.91-904,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3006.921,3012.991,"Well, what was the decision below on these presumptions?"
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,3012.991,3028.6,"The... in the 9th Circuit there was a precarium one paragraph decision issued referring back to a previous decision of the 9th Circuit in a case called Thompson, where they had upheld all of the act's provisions."
1992.91-904,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.6,3038.975,"Well, so they actually ruled on the merits of the presumptions, so they didn't say that the presumptions... that either... they didn't say the trustee presumption was not implicated here."
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,3038.975,3039.708,They just didn't say.
1992.91-904,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3039.708,3040.742,They actually ruled on it.
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,3040.742,3042.01,Correct.
1992.91-904,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3043.427,3044.929,How about the district court?
1992.91-904,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,3044.929,3051.55,--The district court considered itself bound by the 9th Circuit's prior decision in Thompson as well.
1992.91-904,3,21264,dennis_r_murphy,,3435.283,3493.238,"Your Honor, the SDA presumptions, the... page 54 of the appendix clearly shows that the trustees made a determination that the withdrawal occurred in 1981 and the issue was whether the plant was mothballed or permanently closed, and that was a determination that the trustees made and it was challenged throughout the entire proceedings and the presumptions... there is no disclaimer that the presumptions were not issued in their favor and clearly the arbitrator was aware of the presumptions because he cited the presumptions at page 400 and 401 of the joint appendix in issuing his second decision, so it was a decision of fact, it was raised, it is before the Court, and it needs to be determined whether the trustee's decision on the A presumption is appropriate."
1992.91-904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3519.572,3522.072,"Thank you, Mr. Murphy, the case is submitted."
