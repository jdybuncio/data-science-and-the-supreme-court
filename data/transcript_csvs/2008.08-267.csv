2008.08-267,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.702,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 08-267, United States v. Denedo."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1660.784,1673.676,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Because there are courts, appellate military courts must have coram nobis power to protect the integrity of their judgments."
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1680.163,1681.532,"What do you mean, ""they must""?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1685.0,1685.734,"No, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.673,1695.542,"That's what you mean by ""they must have""?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1695.542,1702.278,"And also, Your Honor, they must have the ability to protect the integrity of their judgments just like other Federal courts have."
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1706.997,1719.573,"That's fine, but -- but is it unconstitutional for Congress to say military courts are different, they've always been different, the need for finality is greater there, and we're conducting a different rule for there?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1719.573,1733.548,"I think Congress has the authority to legislate very broadly in the area of collateral remedies, and Congress could take away the writ of coram nobis if it left in its place an adequate and effective substitute, like it did in 2255."
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1733.548,1739.119,"Oh, oh, oh, so it would be unconstitutional if they did not leave in its place an adequate and effective substitute--"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1739.119,1740.404,Our view is that if--
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1740.404,1743.772,"--which would cover every situation no matter how fanciful, right?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1743.772,1744.422,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1752.644,1759.715,What -- which case of ours establishes the proposition that there always has to be an available avenue of relief?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1759.715,1774.708,"The best authority we have for that, Your Honor, is Webster v. Doe, which we believe stands for the proposition that courts should read statutes so as not to preclude judicial review of a constitutional claim absent an express congressional intent to do so--"
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1774.708,1778.612,"Well, that's different than saying there always has to be available relief."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1794.622,1797.305,"--I think -- well, if I could make two points, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1810.131,1813.416,You don't -- you don't think there's authority for the proposition they can do it?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1813.416,1813.983,--Correct.
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1813.983,1816.118,I'm looking for authority that says they can't do it.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1816.118,1818.403,"I'm not aware of any, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.27,1826.241,Did -- did coram nobis relief -- you say it has to be there.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1829.259,1830.425,--Yes.
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.096,1838.448,"Indeed, yes."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1838.448,1838.965,Yes.
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.154,1851.004,Worse still.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1852.538,1853.305,Absolutely.
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1853.305,1862.544,"--convicted by a court-martial and had no basis for -- for getting that revised, and that -- that lasted for a couple of hundred years, right?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1864.829,1868.048,"That was -- I think that's the impetus behind the UCMJ, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.048,1868.865,"Well, that's fine."
2008.08-267,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1887.862,1890.062,Could you clarify something for me?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1898.217,1900.002,"Not -- no, not -- we aren't, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.786,1903.038,And you were saying it is.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1908.775,1909.575,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1909.575,1913.077,I'm sorry--
2008.08-267,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1913.077,1921.75,"Well, you might -- you might say that there is a lurking constitutional question and that we ought to interpret the statute to avoid a constitutional concern."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1921.75,1925.737,"I think, Your Honor, that's the best answer that I should have given."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1927.004,1929.106,--I don't like it very much.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1940.913,1943.781,We don't have square authority from this Court to support that proposition.
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1943.781,1954.404,"So then it becomes, as Justice Kennedy suggested, a question of whether or not we should read the statutes here in a particular way to avoid confronting that question?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1954.404,1961.577,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that's where -- we're comfortably in that neck of the woods, and we really don't need to get closer to the scarier question that was alluded to."
2008.08-267,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1962.227,1966.779,"When you say it's lurking, you're -- you're invoking the doctrine of constitutional avoidance?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,1966.779,1967.731,"--Yes, Your Honor, we are."
2008.08-267,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1967.731,1968.581,Okay.
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1968.581,1976.836,"I don't think it's much of a lurk if, for 200 years, this was going on without ever -- it's not lurking to my mind."
2008.08-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1976.836,1999.452,"But you are making -- I thought that the core of your argument is that the All Writs Act applies to all courts established by Congress, the military courts are included in that definition, and there is nothing in the All Writs Act that says it doesn't apply to the military."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2016.561,2017.413,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2056.454,2062.542,"Well, if that's so, then I guess you can have courts reviewing the civilians."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2086.741,2087.924,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2087.924,2088.893,So that's what you foresee?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2088.893,2092.812,I would -- yes and no.
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2092.812,2094.414,What way is it no?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2094.414,2111.523,"No is when the individual is not in custody and the 6-year statute of limitations has expired for all the types of claims that are available for a collateral attack of a court-martial conviction, a declaratory judgment attack, a mandamus attack, Court of Federal Claims attack, all those--"
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2111.523,2116.993,"Why -- in other words, in the case I posed, he would -- he -- in your view, he wouldn't have any remedy."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2120.647,2121.464,--We agree.
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2126.968,2140.025,"Well, if, in fact, you're waiting until the -- the civil courts have lost all jurisdiction because the statute of limitations has expired, why do you need this?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2158.939,2180.869,"--This gets to the other piece of the answer I was trying to give, and that is a petitioner from the military system could not file a coram nobis petition in the Article III courts or the Court of Federal Claims because there's no authority that supports the proposition that you can take a coram nobis petition and attack a judgment from a different jurisdiction."
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2183.971,2198.981,"Then you're saying that what you're foreseeing is through coram nobis, indefinitely, a person outside the military who once was in it can bring constitutional challenges?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2198.981,2200.849,"--Yes, Your Honor, in the military justice system."
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2200.849,2204.551,"Yes, okay, and we see those every day, don't we?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2239.391,2240.291,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.291,2257.02,"And so they would have in that sense greater protection in the military system than in the ordinary criminal courts a person has in habeas, because the option of retrial is often but not always there."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2260.321,2277.016,"I think it's the very nature of the coram nobis petition, Your Honor, and that is coram nobis petitioners have already served their entire sentence, so the societal interest to seek a retrial is much lesser than in the habeas case where there's a lengthy sentence less -- left, and if someone gets out of jail--"
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2277.016,2280.635,"Well, but the collateral consequences of the conviction are pretty dramatic."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2284.17,2285.253,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2285.253,2289.657,"Well, so I think Justice Breyer's question is still on the table."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2303.298,2307.368,I think there is a classic distinction between the habeas and the coram nobis petitioner.
2008.08-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2331.584,2332.151,Where?
2008.08-267,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2332.851,2336.555,In the civilian courts or the military courts?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2336.555,2337.655,"--The military courts, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2337.655,2341.089,I think you have a good answer to what my question was.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2389.272,2391.356,"I think Morgan is helpful on that, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2394.189,2397.51,"--But was -- that question wasn't resolved, was it?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2420.024,2424.993,"--Well, the government hasn't urged that there's no ineffective assistance of counsel."
2008.08-267,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2427.529,2430.564,"Well, let's assume it raised because Justice Breyer asked a question--"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2430.564,2431.014,--Yes.
2008.08-267,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2431.014,2432.683,--and I would be interested in the answer.
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2432.683,2433.316,I knew it wasn't.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2433.316,2433.833,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2433.833,2435.801,"I thought it might be your answer: Well, that isn't raised."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2438.587,2439.337,That's -- that's why--
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2439.337,2443.872,I'm telling you my honest problem which I'm trying to think through: Where are we going with this?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2443.872,2444.491,--I think--
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2444.491,2446.824,What's going to happen one way or the other way?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2450.561,2451.111,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2473.491,2481.58,"Military courts now, since 1950, have quite a record of saying coram nobis is available in these courts."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2498.726,2505.545,"--Aside from this -- this case below, Your Honor, I don't know of a case that raised ineffective assistance of counsel."
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.486,2544.505,"Was that person retried, do you know?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2544.505,2545.621,"I do not know, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.621,2546.372,Was he still in the military?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2546.372,2547.222,I do not know.
2008.08-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2557.228,2570.822,"Do I understand correctly that since 1989 there were a total of 30 coram nobis petitions filed, and of those only 4 were granted?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2570.822,2577.892,"The statistics that we cited in our brief, Your Honor, were 10 coram nobis petitions at the court of appeals within the last 10 years--"
2008.08-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2577.892,2578.678,Yes.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2578.678,2585.832,--and 176 writ appeals from the lower courts up to the court of appeals that don't break out the category of writs.
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2604.995,2617.219,"What is the theory of the jurisdiction of the military court in the circumstance where the individual is still in the military, he's been convicted, and he is in custody?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2639.216,2640.918,"--That would be a habeas case, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2640.918,2641.551,All right.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2644.62,2645.053,Yes.
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2645.72,2650.774,And what's the theory of the jurisdiction that the military courts have over that?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2650.774,2656.094,--It's similar in that it's All Writs Act authority aiding the--
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2656.094,2657.561,Aiding what jurisdiction?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2657.561,2660.13,--A direct review authority of the military--
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2660.13,2661.915,But they've already directly reviewed it.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2661.915,2662.548,--Correct.
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2663.082,2665.384,So there is no more direct review to be had.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2665.384,2666.284,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2666.284,2670.937,"So how does this aid the direct review that is to be had, since there is none?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2670.937,2678.793,"It aids it in the same way this Court recognized it can do so in Goldsmith, where it acknowledged that a mandamus writ could issue after finality--"
2008.08-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2678.793,2679.359,I see.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2679.359,2681.576,"--to compel adherence to the court's own judgment, so that--"
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2681.576,2683.661,Within -- within the military system?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2683.661,2686.28,"--Yes, Your Honor, within the military justice system."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2703.159,2703.925,All within the system.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2721.203,2723.155,--The fact--
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2723.155,2736.313,"At any time somebody who is out of the military system, whose judgment is supposedly final under the provisions that Congress has established, he could come back and knock on the door 20 years later and say, I want to review my conviction."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2736.313,2737.998,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2737.998,2740.182,And he would be within the military system.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2740.182,2745.402,"He would be a civilian, former service member--"
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2745.402,2745.902,Right.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2745.902,2748.604,"--filing a coram nobis petition, and the coram nobis--"
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2748.604,2751.472,"And he's back in the military system, 20 years later?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2751.472,2753.174,--For purposes of the coram nobis petition.
2008.08-267,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2753.174,2766.399,"In -- in coram nobis cases in the civil system, do courts appoint special masters when they're an appellate court and they have to find out if coram nobis was--"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2766.399,2767.351,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2767.351,2769.184,--Or do they use district courts as special masters?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2769.184,2770.101,They--
2008.08-267,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2770.101,2774.005,"In this case, you had -- the court had to invent a procedural device."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2782.111,2784.194,"--It's not a court-martial, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2831.691,2835.245,But all of that is extra-statutory in your -- this instance?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2835.245,2836.228,We don't believe so.
2008.08-267,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2865.998,2869.567,Where are -- where are the procedures set out for -- for military habeas?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2869.567,2874.886,"--They're not, and actually that -- that -- this Court pointed that out in Noyd v. Bond."
2008.08-267,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2888.713,2900.521,"Are you -- are you arguing then that if it has habeas power without a -- a textual basis, there's no reason to argue that it lacks coram nobis power because there's no textual basis?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2900.521,2904.223,--I think the answer to that is yes.
2008.08-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2908.808,2913.511,But this Court has never held that the military courts have habeas jurisdiction?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2913.511,2914.578,"Yes, it has, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2914.578,2915.53,In what case?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2915.53,2922.184,"In Noyd v. Bond, this Court squarely held that military -- the court of appeals at the time has habeas authority."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2922.184,2924.469,For someone still within the military system?
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2924.469,2928.671,"That was the case where the individual was pending appeal, I believe."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2928.671,2929.221,So the answer--
2008.08-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2929.221,2929.654,But that was--
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2929.654,2938.36,"--to Justice Ginsburg is that we have never held that with respect to a situation like the facts here, where you're dealing with somebody who is outside -- long departed from the military system?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2938.36,2945.133,"Well, I would -- I would direct the Court's attention, if I could, to footnote 11 of Goldsmith, where this Court says:"
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.866,2978.104,"It's talking about somebody still within the military, if I -- if I heard the quote correctly, right?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2978.104,2985.608,An individual is out of the military if they -- if their dismissal has been executed -- or their discharge has been executed and they're in Leavenworth.
2008.08-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2989.126,2989.66,--The--
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,2989.66,2990.578,So they're not really in the military.
2008.08-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2990.578,2997.332,"--The quote you referred to from Goldsmith says: ""And a servicemember in custody""."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,3022.716,3023.949,"I read it differently, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3041.094,3043.796,"Well, what am I missing?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,3067.828,3070.114,Right.
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3121.129,3124.248,This is -- this is at a hearing.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,3129.068,3151.232,"This is the chief counsel for the Department of Defense proposing the legislation and offering the only premise there was for the particular legislative change that I'm referring to, which is stripping the -- the correction boards of this collateral review power and saying, when we do that, don't worry, Congress, because it will channel these collateral -- post-final collateral attacks into the military courts, and -- and they can have habeas."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3152.351,3152.934,Under the specific--
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,3152.934,3153.434,--coram nobis.
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3153.434,3159.255,"--Under the specific provision that was at issue, which is accompanied by very strict finality provisions."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,3177.799,3179.168,"I don't read it that way, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3285.104,3285.67,I'm sorry.
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,3295.876,3304.082,"--I think that's implicit in final judgment, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3305.951,3316.374,"Well, a final judgment is subject to review in the appellate courts within -- in the military system, just like you have -- a final court of appeals judgment is subject to review in our system."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,3316.374,3333.768,"Your Honor, the -- the key difference is that -- two things: He's referring to post-finality, which means that the discharge or the -- you know, the sentence has been executed."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3344.993,3351.063,"When you have review in the appellate system -- someone is -- the judgment is they're to be discharged, and they seek review."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,3353.915,3355.565,"--No, on direct review, you're right, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3433.848,3439.836,"You -- you don't think that if you prevail in this case, we're going to see a lot more coram nobis petitions than we did before?"
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,3439.836,3457.73,"--I -- I think there would be an uptick, and there may actually have been an uptick while this case has been up here at this level, because it's -- it has gotten a lot of visibility in the military, just like there was an uptick after Noyd v. Bond when this Court declared for the first time that military courts had All Writs Act power."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3472.407,3473.673,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-267,1,35861,matthew_s_freedus,,3473.673,3474.175,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.08-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3474.175,3478.377,"Mr. Shah, you have 3 minutes remaining."
2008.08-267,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3478.377,3495.088,"Mr. Shah, could you tell us what the government's position is on whether, when somebody has been discharged from the service and then a conviction which he -- which he suffered while he was in the service is set aside, can he be retried in military courts?"
