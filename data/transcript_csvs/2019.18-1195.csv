2019.18-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.235,8.665,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-1195, Espinoza versus the Montana Department of Revenue. Mr. Komer."
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,8.665,21.01,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case asks whether the Federal Constitution allows the wholesale exclusion of religious schools from scholarship programs."
2019.18-1195,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,130.22,167.695,"May -- may I ask you some threshold questions about Article III standing? Under the Montana judgment, these parents are treated no differently than parents of children who are going to secular private schools, so where is the harm? When a differential is challenged, the court inspecting the state law can level up or level down."
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,179.92,209.615,"Your Honor, the Montana Supreme Court lacked the necessary predicate for leveling up or for leveling down because they got the federal Supreme Court question wrong. But for getting that question wrong, we would never have moved on to the issue of remedying that problem because it isn't a constitutional problem."
2019.18-1195,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,209.615,219.14,"But there's another serious problem, and that's the parents are not taxpayers."
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,259.205,277.6,"Well, Your Honor, here what's involved is a scholarship program, and the scholarship program's intended beneficiaries are the parents, like our clients, who are enabled to exercise their constitutional right to choose --"
2019.18-1195,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,277.6,280.905,"They're challenging the tax status of someone else, not themselves."
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,280.905,293.77,"No -- no, Your Honor, it's because the Montana Supreme Court has extended their Blaine Amendment to include scholarships that are generated by the giving of tax credits --"
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,293.77,294.07,I'm sorry.
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,342.075,351.64,"I -- Your Honor, I don't think that we've had a state constitutional provision ever be applied in such a --"
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,351.64,352.63,It doesn't matter that --
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,352.63,353.52,-- extended fashion.
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,353.52,390.74,"-- we've had -- we've had a case involving schools that discriminate, and we've said that those schools -- that taxpayers -- not taxpayers -- that individuals who feel affected by that discrimination don't have standing because they're not the people -- they're not the taxpayer and they're not the recipient of the discrimination directly, so -- and I'm -- I'm having a problem understanding how you have standing either for the taxpayer or for the school who receives the money."
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,390.74,391.69,Well --
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,391.69,396.0,And why -- you have a lot of contingencies.
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,418.735,426.99,Any case that involves Article III standing where the intended beneficiaries of the program are --
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,426.99,429.36,The school's the intended beneficiary.
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,429.36,434.0,"I -- I -- respectfully, Your Honor, I disagree."
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,448.72,449.02,Counsel --
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,449.02,449.32,-- at the school.
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,449.32,453.68,-- the financial benefit is to the taxpayer who gets a tax credit.
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,453.68,454.27,Actually --
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,454.27,466.585,"That's the intent. It's an incentive for the taxpayer to give money, but there are many incentives that incentivize people to give money."
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,466.585,472.76,"Yes, Your Honor, it does incentivize donations."
2019.18-1195,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,482.64,490.505,How do you know that they wouldn't have been in the same situation? After all this is a small credit. It's $150.
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,526.77,538.71,"Well, Your Honor, the simple fact of the matter is that our clients received scholarships under this program, which was a financial benefit to them."
2019.18-1195,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,565.75,579.4,"Mr. Komer, can I go back to Justice Ginsburg's first question? And I don't know whether to call it standing or mootness or anything else, but I guess I am having trouble seeing where the harm in this case is at this point."
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,589.65,598.365,"Well, right now, their students -- two of the families' students are on scholarships and next year they won't be --"
2019.18-1195,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,598.365,598.735,Right.
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,599.38,600.83,-- generated by the program.
2019.18-1195,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,600.83,601.76,I'm sorry to interrupt.
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,630.79,632.095,"Yes, there is."
2019.18-1195,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,644.49,661.345,But it led to the invalidation of the entire program as it related both to private secular schools and private religious schools. So a -- a -- a -- a -- the parents of both are affected in the exact same way.
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,661.345,668.62,That's because the remedy -- you can't let the remedy shield the discriminatory judgment.
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,691.62,723.67,"I'm sorry, how could that be? Meaning, do you -- are you taking the position that as a matter of constitutional law, the Montana Supreme Court constitutional provision is unconstitutional? That -- that states are forced to give money, tax credits, to religious institutions and secular institutions? Are they required always to give money out, scholarships?"
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,723.67,723.965,No.
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,724.88,725.25,All right.
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,740.43,745.205,Montana's constitutional provision violates the free-exercise clause on its face.
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,745.205,746.33,On its face.
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,746.33,748.18,And as applied to this program.
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,748.18,758.11999995,So you are saying that states are forced to give money both to secular and religious schools?
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,758.11999995,764.1,It -- not to the schools. This is a case about giving the money to the families.
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,765.24,765.36,I don't --
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,765.36,766.06,-- giving money to the schools.
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,766.06,768.015,Secular and religious families?
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,768.015,772.79,"Yes, if they give to one, they must give to the other."
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,772.79,775.39,But can the state choose not to give at all?
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,775.39,776.44,Yes.
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,776.44,776.92,All right.
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,831.05,838.62,"In the circumstances we're dealing with, Your Honor, they terminated the program."
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,838.62,840.52,I'm not talking about the circumstances.
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,883.36,886.21,Are we talking about the court doing this or --
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,886.21,887.55,To the court doing this.
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,887.55,888.81,"Can the court do it, no?"
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,888.81,889.15,Why?
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,889.15,897.11,"Because when you have a constitutional conflict between the two constitutions, the Federal Constitution trumps --"
2019.18-1195,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,897.11,904.075,But you just told me the Federal Constitution doesn't stop the state from choosing not to give aid.
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,904.075,905.32,That's right.
2019.18-1195,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,914.03,919.0,"Well, it chose to give aid consistent with the constitutional amendment."
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,959.33,965.41,"Only as a result of a mistaken understanding of the free-exercise clause, Your Honor."
2019.18-1195,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,965.41,965.74,Under --
2019.18-1195,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,965.74,967.19,But we don't usually --
2019.18-1195,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,967.19,968.35,-- under -- go ahead.
2019.18-1195,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,968.35,996.295,"I mean, we don't usually sort of grade every line of an opinion. Usually we look to an opinion, and -- and -- and -- and there's a decision below, and it's had a consequence in the world. And the consequence of this decision is that there is no discrimination, that neither -- that neither set of parents is getting what it -- they want. Now, you might say, well, both should get what they want, and maybe that would be a better world."
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,1006.47,1019.965,"Your Honor, there is no discrimination because the Montana constitutional provision requires discrimination on its face and as applied to our clients."
2019.18-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1036.41,1037.715,Justice Alito?
2019.18-1195,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1037.715,1059.89999995,"Yeah, I just wanted to ask this simple question: Under our decision in Village of Arlington Heights, is it constitutional for a unit of state government to do something that it could do, but if it does it for an unconstitutional discriminatory reason, is it then unconstitutional?"
2019.18-1195,0,63223,richard_d_komer,,1059.89999995,1062.475,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
2019.18-1195,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1063.95,1081.35,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall."
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1081.35,1092.76,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The Montana Supreme Court held that the Montana constitution requires religious discrimination that the federal constitution forbids.
2019.18-1195,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1145.62,1147.65,So your -- your -- I'm sorry.
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1163.83,1168.52,"Well, but I think that's really getting at the standing issue, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.18-1195,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1220.93,1221.49,Mr. Wall --
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1221.49,1221.73,-- federal law.
2019.18-1195,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1221.73,1238.87,"-- are you claiming that -- what you're calling Blaine amendments, but that the Montana provision and all the other states that have one, that as a matter of federal constitutional law, all of those constitutional -- state constitutional provisions must be struck?"
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1238.87,1244.845,"Well, not the entire category because I actually think it's a little more nuanced than that, but I am saying what the Court said in Trinity Lutheran."
2019.18-1195,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1255.97,1258.09,That's a radical decision.
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1258.09,1258.38,I --
2019.18-1195,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1258.38,1350.495,"We have -- we have a founding father, Madison, lobbying heavily for the free-exercise clause and equally to stop states from both establishing religions or using public funds to support them. There's been over -- since the founding fathers, a long history of people who for non-discriminatory reasons, but for reasons related to their belief in the separation of church and state, that have taken the position that the state should not give money to religious institutions. You are suggesting now that Montana in 1972 went through an empty exercise, they looked at the history of this amendment or one like it, said it was odious, admitted -- some of its people who voted for this bill in '72 said it was a despicable history, but they then looked at the founding fathers' writings, they looked at the State of Montana's religious tolerance, which had changed dramatically from the Blaine Amendment era, and decided that they were going to side with James Madison, one of the fathers of our Constitution, and continue to say we don't want aid to churches."
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1350.495,1351.325,So -- so --
2019.18-1195,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1351.325,1351.68,Now --
2019.18-1195,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1351.68,1353.12,"Perhaps you could comment, counsel."
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1353.12,1357.345,"So, Justice Sotomayor, that was one of two points I was hoping to make on the merits before I sat down."
2019.18-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1383.13,1407.51,"What about -- what about -- MR. WALL -- and Justice Thomas, I think, walks through the history of the opposite in his Rosenberger concurrence, that at the time of the founding, when they gave out land in the Northwest Territory and other statutes for -- to schools, they included religiously affiliated schools. I think actually the tradition that dates to the founding is -- is sort of the opposite, that you can't disqualify them just based on their religious character, but you can have no compelled support, no preferential aid to the church."
2019.18-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1409.77,1420.11,"But what -- what did you think of this? I -- I'm having trouble, and I want you to tell me what you really think about this problem which has probably an answer that you will have thought about."
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1445.955,1455.09,"Well, no, in certain respects it doesn't change, Justice Breyer. They don't -- if they want to open up the funding, they can put limits, secular limits, on the program."
2019.18-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1457.19,1458.58,There's -- I'm not talking about scholarships.
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1458.58,1458.8,But if --
2019.18-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1458.8,1473.11,"I'm talking about the X billion dollars that the State of New York spends on the public school system, and I don't know how much, but I suspect they might spend money on charter schools."
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1473.11,1473.37,Yes.
2019.18-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1473.37,1476.48,Let's call it another 500 million.
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1479.52,1479.78,Yes.
2019.18-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1479.78,1482.025,-- spend money on the Catholic school system.
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1501.75,1505.78,I think if they structure the benefit program the way they did here or the way they did in Trinity Lutheran --
2019.18-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1505.78,1505.94,"No, no."
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1506.68,1506.86,If --
2019.18-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1506.86,1509.36,"-- they do do it, not the way that they did it here and so forth."
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1509.36,1514.85,If they are giving out generally available public benefits for people to go to private schools --
2019.18-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1514.85,1522.71,"Oh, oh, what's the private? Why is it that they have to be equal with private but they don't have to be equal with public?"
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1522.71,1525.76,"No, when you said charter schools, I took those to be private schools."
2019.18-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1525.76,1526.56,Forget the charter schools.
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1527.12,1536.83,"If -- if a city or state gives out funds for private education, which it's not required to do, it can limit its funding to public schools, but if it gives it out and it gives it out just for scholarships for private schools --"
2019.18-1195,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1536.83,1543.895,My hypothetical was they give it out in -- it's called the Public School System of the United States.
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1557.53,1570.01,"Justice Breyer, what I'm saying in the last paragraph of Trinity Lutheran, when the Court said you can't deny a generally available public benefit to an entity that's otherwise qualified based solely on its religious character or nature --"
2019.18-1195,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1570.01,1570.83,"So Mr. Wall, don't you --"
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1570.83,1573.67,-- that rule applies equally to schools as to playgrounds.
2019.18-1195,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1573.67,1580.65,"Mr. Wall, I mean, there seems -- I was one of the seven in Trinity Lutheran, but there seems to me a real difference in this case."
2019.18-1195,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1646.315,1658.485,So your question gets at the two things I was hoping to say before I sat down. The -- the first is all we're asking and the Petitioners are asking is that you do what you normally do when you review a state supreme court decision.
2019.18-1195,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1704.14,1710.85999995,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Unikowsky."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1710.85999995,1728.91,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Constitution does not bar the State of Montana from enacting and applying a state constitutional provision that keeps its own state legislature out of the business of funding of religious schools. The no-aid clause does not prohibit anyone's free exercise of religion."
2019.18-1195,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1840.15,1859.945,"I -- I'd like to get back to Justice Breyer's question and get your view you on it which I understand it to be that why doesn't -- do you think the other side's theory leads to a situation where the funding that goes to public schools, a -- a -- if -- if they prevail, wouldn't have to go to religious schools?"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1859.945,1862.81,"Well, I mean, I'm not sure of the breadth of their theory."
2019.18-1195,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1865.53,1871.94,"Well, let's take it to be just that, I mean, this is a case about money and the question whether or not it must go to religious schools."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1879.475,1883.36,I guess I don't understand Petitioners to be making that argument in this particular case.
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1883.36,1900.25,"They're not, but that's what's -- but it still can bother me. I'd like to know if in deciding it for them, if I do, that I have made a major change in the public school system. I understand one's private and the other's public."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1906.42,1907.27,Well --
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1907.27,1915.71,"That is, why -- why would it make a difference, if you have to give -- I mean, now don't jump on to my argument and say, great, it supports you."
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1918.015,1921.13,I'm asking a question to find out the answer.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1921.13,1936.91,"Well, I -- I -- I'm not sure exactly how far Petitioners' argument would lead, but I -- I do think that one important point of this -- in this case is that states generally have had power over education, and to decide that they're only going to fund the public school system, and that is the ultimate effect of the state court's judgment in this case."
2019.18-1195,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1936.91,1949.325,"But, I wonder if -- if there's a difference in the sense that -- that -- between general funding of the public schools and the decision to provide aid to private schools, except not religious schools."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1949.325,1973.24,"Well, so I think that, you know, the question in this case ultimately boils down to, whether the striking down of the program because of the no-aid clause just in and of itself is a violation of the free exercise right of Petitioners. And, you know, the first half of the argument involved a number of questions about how Petitioners are really harmed if the program as a whole is struck down. And I think I heard two sets of arguments from the other side, from Petitioners, both of which I would like to address."
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2014.93,2020.67,"Well, I thought they were quite clear, that they were not arguing -- they were not making a facial challenge."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2020.67,2020.76,Right.
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2020.76,2024.65,It was a challenge as applied to the particular situation here.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2024.65,2024.94,Right.
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2042.52,2042.87,"Well, they're not --"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2042.87,2043.04,-- we're not --
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2043.04,2046.56,-- conceding that. They're just saying you have to consider it as applied here.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2063.2,2067.45,"I would agree with that, but obviously the question is whether it discriminates in violation of the Constitution --"
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2067.45,2067.54,Okay.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2067.54,2068.34,-- the last part of that.
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2068.6,2068.78,All right.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2068.78,2070.31,-- I'm not -- I'm not objecting --
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2070.31,2094.925,"The argument is if they -- they don't have to fund private education at all, but if they choose to provide scholarships that are available to students who attend private schools, they can't discriminate against parents who want to send their children to schools that are affiliated in some way with a church."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2094.925,2095.14,So I --
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2095.14,2096.24,That's the simple argument.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2099.45,2101.33,"No, I think it is completely different from Trinity Lutheran."
2019.18-1195,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2125.11,2126.42,"Counsel, wouldn't you --"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2126.42,2126.83,Yes.
2019.18-1195,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2126.83,2130.5,"In terms of what you're agreeing with Justice Alito, I just want to press you a little bit further."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2153.515,2157.03,"I mean, in principle, if we assume there's an error of federal law in --"
2019.18-1195,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2157.03,2157.12,Yes.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2157.12,2157.58,-- the court's decision --
2019.18-1195,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2157.58,2166.09,"Assuming there's an error of federal -- in federal law and that remedying it here might provide relief to plaintiffs, we have a case."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2166.09,2174.97,"I -- I -- so, I think that, yes, as a general matter, at a high level of generality, if Petitioners identify an error of federal law in a lower court decision, I think the Court can adjudicate the error federally."
2019.18-1195,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2174.97,2175.19,Okay.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2177.98,2178.32,Right.
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2180.82,2192.94,Suppose -- suppose the state said we're going to allow the scholarship funds to be used for secular schools or Protestant schools but not for Jewish schools or Catholic schools.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2194.525,2195.32,"Yes, so I think that --"
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2195.32,2196.465,Is that a yes?
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2196.465,2196.71,Yes.
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2196.71,2196.95,Okay.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2207.915,2220.185,"So, I think the right lens to look at that hypothetical is the Establishment Clause, which prohibits the state -- regardless of whether there's an infringement on any individual liberty, I think the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from distinguishing between one religion versus a different religion."
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2221.38,2238.165,"But a lot of the free-exercise equal-treatment cases, going back to Everson, McDaniel, say you can't exclude religious people, religious institutions, religious speech because it's religious from a generally applicable program --"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2238.165,2238.44,Right.
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2238.51,2259.08,"-- the fact that it's odious to the Constitution to quote the words of Trinity Lutheran. So why isn't this excluding religious people, telling them that they're not entitled to equal treatment under the Constitution, why isn't that a violation of -- a straight violation of the Trinity Lutheran principle which goes back to Everson --"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2259.08,2259.57,Because I think --
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2259.57,2261.465,And why is it different from other hypothetical?
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2261.465,2268.03,"I think the state has a choice, right? It's not allowed to tell people we are going to penalize you for exercising your religion."
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2285.57,2286.15,But if you're a --
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2286.15,2288.035,-- to get involved in religious education.
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2288.035,2300.73,"If you're running a scholarship fund and there's a group of people lining up for the scholarships, are you secular? Okay, you can get it? Are you Catholic? No, you're out because you're Catholic."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2300.73,2302.18,"Yeah, that's exactly what the state --"
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2302.18,2302.39,How is that --
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2302.39,2303.14,-- court is not doing in this case.
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2303.14,2311.15,"How is that -- how is that consistent with the principle set forth in Trinity Lutheran or McDaniel, Justice Brennan's concurrence in McDaniel?"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2311.15,2314.95,I think that's exactly what the state court ensured wouldn't happen. It's not just a matter of like --
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2314.95,2321.885,The predicate -- the predicate was that that kind of discrimination is -- does not violate the Federal Constitution.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2321.885,2326.57,"No, I -- I -- I think that the state court can say, look, as a state, we have a no-aid clause clause."
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2347.61,2353.37,"Well, they're -- they're certainly rooted in -- in grotesque religious bigotry against Catholics."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2354.12,2360.34,"I mean, I think that in the 1880s, there was undoubtedly grotesque religious bigotry against -- against Catholics. I don't think that's --"
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2360.34,2360.62,That was the --
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2360.62,2360.97,-- comes out in the --
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2360.97,2362.34,-- clear motivation for this.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2362.34,2363.47,"No, not -- that's not true."
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2372.9,2377.99,"No, I -- I want to -- to see if there's any real difference between this and Trinity Lutheran."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2421.37,2424.27,"No, I don't think so. That's not how the state court has construed the Constitution --"
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2424.27,2428.945,Where has it said -- where has it said that that's not how it's construed? That's control in -- in part.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2428.945,2437.55,"So if you read the lower court opinion, there's all this language about how the real problem here is that the money is going to the school, which is going to spend it on religious education."
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2437.83,2439.23,"Well, they're talking about schools in general."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2441.06,2443.4,"No, they're -- they're saying -- they're not talking about schools in general."
2019.18-1195,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2481.93,2495.365,"May I ask you a question? Let's go back to the basic, okay? Let's take the proposition here that the law as written giving aid discriminated."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2500.715,2501.27,Yes.
2019.18-1195,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2501.27,2511.38,-- because -- Rule 1 does because it permits secular schools but not religious schools from receiving the scholarship.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2518.565,2519.8,"I accept I'm wrong, yes."
2019.18-1195,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2519.8,2520.38,All right.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2546.8,2547.31,Because --
2019.18-1195,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2547.31,2560.165,"Because that's exactly what we were told in a question, which is they are basing the leveling down on the basis of discriminating against religion."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2560.165,2590.84,"So I think that the answering of that question requires a kind of focused analysis of exactly what the Constitution allows and doesn't allow, all right? So if you accept the premise that Rule 1 is unconstitutional because it discriminates, it says secular schools in and religious schools out, that doesn't answer the question of whether the mere application of a no-aid clause that does not lead to a judgment with that effect is also unconstitutional. So I think the crucial point in this case is to look at what the state court did when it applied the no-aid clause."
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2590.84,2605.35,"No, isn't the crucial question why the state court did what it did? If it did what it did for an unconstitutionally discriminatory reason, then there's a problem under Village of Arlington Heights. So I'll give you an example."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2633.42,2635.06,"No, so we don't think the race analogy is apt."
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2639.94,2645.63,"What they're -- what he's saying is that, look, the Court took the case in the Prince -- Prince Edward County thing --"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2645.63,2646.14,Yes.
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2646.14,2648.735,-- or the equivalent and said they couldn't do that.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2655.71,2656.54,So I -- I assume the --
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2656.54,2657.95,"I think, Justice --"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2657.95,2658.56,I have an answer --
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2658.56,2660.21,But I have -- I'd like you to think about that --
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2660.21,2660.31,Look --
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2660.31,2663.76,-- but I have a more direct question on the merits.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2678.405,2678.75,Yeah.
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2678.75,2681.68,"All right? No problem, unconstitutional, free exercise, right?"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2681.68,2683.545,"And establishment, yes."
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2683.545,2684.12,Okay.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2697.56,2697.74,That -- that --
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.74,2698.44,-- unconstitutional.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2698.44,2699.34,That's Trinity Lutheran.
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2699.34,2699.74,Clearly.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2700.45,2700.795,Yeah.
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2700.795,2705.195,"Now, why is it different? And I'm not saying it isn't."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2723.565,2724.035,Yeah.
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2724.035,2724.665,Okay.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2737.44,2739.38,"Well, I think that --"
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2739.38,2740.83,"I mean, you see where I'm -- you see --"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2740.83,2740.95,Yes.
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2740.95,2743.34,-- how I'm doing that? You see the point?
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2743.34,2748.21,So let me -- let me answer that question and then go back to the race question I would like to address.
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2748.21,2748.3,Okay.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2751.03,2751.92,"Well, I'll -- I'll give a --"
2019.18-1195,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2751.92,2757.09,"I recommend it, though. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2757.09,2758.955,I'll give a brief answer.
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2758.955,2759.59,Yeah.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2759.59,2768.49,So I think that there's a constitutional difference between distinguishing among religions and saying the Court is -- the government is just going to stay out of religion altogether.
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2768.49,2769.12,That's correct.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2769.12,2778.84,"There's many Establishment Clause cases saying that regardless of whether there's a civil liberties violation, it's just contrary to -- to disestablishment principles to say that we're going to treat one religion --"
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2778.84,2779.39,"Okay, I got that."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2779.39,2780.18,-- totally different from another one.
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2780.18,2795.57,"So what about the other part, where we said, look, you can't discriminate against all religions by not giving them playgrounds or you can't discriminate against all religions by refusing to give them police protection or fire protection? What about that part?"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2795.57,2795.93,All right.
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2816.6,2817.1,Does --
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2817.1,2818.37,And I think that --
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2818.37,2818.53,Does --
2019.18-1195,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2818.53,2822.08,"Can I take you back, Mr. Unikowsky, to the striking down the whole program?"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2822.08,2822.17,Yes.
2019.18-1195,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2822.17,2828.185,Because a number of people have suggested that that must be motivated by animus towards religion.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2828.185,2828.535,Right.
2019.18-1195,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2828.535,2836.75,And I can think of many reasons why you would strike down the whole program that have nothing to do with animus toward religion.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2878.85,2882.815,"So I think that's right, and I think that's why we don't think the race analogy is apt."
2019.18-1195,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2892.07,2925.04,"Why -- why does that explain why the race analogy is inapt? I mean, the legislature may say they built parks and pools, and they say funding those, but if a higher percentage of African Americans come and use the pools, then we're going to shut down the whole program. And you wouldn't defend that on saying they could have a judgment that it decreases tensions among the different races to keep them -- no, you would just look at the facial discrimination, right, and conclude the fact that -- that wouldn't be good under your view, would it?"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2925.04,2925.92,Of course not --
2019.18-1195,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2925.92,2927.0,Because they're shutting down the whole --
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2927.0,2927.1,No.
2019.18-1195,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2927.1,2927.45,-- program?
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2927.45,2927.59,No.
2019.18-1195,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2928.57,2934.39,"How is that different than religion, which is also protected under -- under the First Amendment?"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2934.39,2947.27,"Because I don't think that race and religion are identical for all constitutional purposes, right? Look -- look, if a state constitution had a provision saying that like historically black colleges aren't entitled to any aid at all, that would obviously be facially unconstitutional."
2019.18-1195,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2976.0,2979.19,Was that -- was that your answer to Justice Kagan's question?
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2979.19,2980.81,"No, so -- well --"
2019.18-1195,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2980.81,2981.64,"Well, I -- go ahead."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2983.435,3005.105,"The answer is, I think if you accept that no-aid clauses are not facially unconstitutional, and I think it's a hard argument to make for all the historical reasons, they've existed for such a long time, then you have to accept that it's at least permissible for a state to say, for principled reasons deeply rooted in national tradition dating back to Madison, we have a preference to not fund religious activities, not prohibit it but not fund it."
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3005.105,3012.955,But there's a difference between saying we're not going to fund religious activities and saying we're going to discriminate based on religion.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3041.885,3045.62,I think what -- so that sounds more like the Trinity Lutheran hypothetical.
2019.18-1195,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3083.61,3085.275,"To do what the state court did, meaning?"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3085.275,3087.105,"Yes, invalidate the program."
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3128.2,3134.06,"Basically what you're saying is, the difference between this and race is, it's permissible to discriminate on the basis of religion."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3138.38,3152.88,"I mean, look, it -- it seems to me that when you talk about discrimination, we can mean two different things, all right? One way of looking at discrimination is to say that just -- you can't have a rule that treats religion differently from other subjects, which is I think is the core of Petitioners' argument. And they say, look at the no-aid clause."
2019.18-1195,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3176.17,3179.53,"Well, I -- I mean, I don't know about every -- every no-aid clause in the country."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3203.84,3206.14,"I'm not saying that they -- no, I'm not saying that at all."
2019.18-1195,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3219.99,3229.74,"But aren't you saying -- are you -- I don't know, can we -- can you or could I say this: Yes, race is different from religion."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3283.21,3283.965,Okay.
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3314.22,3321.11,"But this is a -- this is a school, in education, there satisfies the compulsory education laws of the state, correct?"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3321.11,3321.8,That's true.
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3321.8,3367.025,"And so that's different from Locke, as Professor Laycock's amicus brief points out in a very narrow decision about training of the clergy. And it seems to me there are two different things going on here, it seems to me. One is to Justice Breyer's question, just funding religion, funding religious schools generally or training of clergy is -- is an establishment clause concern, but this -- it's a separate issue when you set up a neutral benefit program -- police, fire, or scholarships -- and allow people to use those things, allow religious institutions to obtain the benefits of those things on a non-discriminatory basis. And the question in this case, it seems to me, is which side of that line this comes on."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3371.86,3387.755,"I -- I guess I'm not really sure that's the right way to look at it. I think that it's important to just look at the interest the no-aid clause protects, understand whether those are just unconstitutional and whether they apply to this case. So as I said, the no-aid clause was concerned about using government leverage to influence religious education."
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3393.31,3397.61,"You think that was the design of the no-aid clause, to -- to help religious institutions?"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3397.61,3397.74,Yeah.
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3423.46,3428.745,"Well, no one's compelling the religious schools to participate in a program in order to accept funds from the program, correct?"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3428.745,3429.78,That is certainly true.
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3429.98,3433.54,So a religious school that doesn't want to be part of a neutral program doesn't have to be.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3433.54,3454.55,"Yeah, that's true. But I mean, there's still a concern that ultimately the inevitable effect of these programs is that the government would exercise its leverage over schools. And, look, this is what people were saying at the hearing, and I think that may be a little paternalistic, but I think the state is allowed to have a structural provision being arguably paternalistic in its own state constitution. There's no bigotry whatsoever in evidence from the actual convention at which this is enacted."
2019.18-1195,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3462.35,3483.55,"I think the other side's argument is the way you can do better is to say: If we're going to give benefits to private schools, which you don't have to do -- to Justice Breyer's question, you do not have to give benefits to private schools or funds or tax credits, but if you do, don't tell someone they can't participate because they're Jewish or Protestant or Catholic."
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3483.55,3490.78,"I guess the -- the concern of the delegates was that if you have money going to religious schools, that's going to lead to entanglement problems."
2019.18-1195,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3519.24,3530.77,"Mr. Unikowsky, if we can just go back to the standing question. You are not at liberty to waive Article III, so why do you think this case doesn't fit under Eastern Kentucky?"
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3530.77,3532.92,"So I'll -- I'll just answer briefly, Your Honor."
2019.18-1195,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3532.92,3533.255,Sure.
2019.18-1195,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3533.255,3539.07,"So Petitioners are claiming they personally are the victims of status discrimination, which is the argument that wasn't made in that case."
2019.18-1195,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3546.785,3550.56,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Komer, two minutes remaining."
2019.18-1195,3,63223,richard_d_komer,,3550.56,3563.96,"Thank you. What we're saying here is that -- what Trinity Lutheran says, the state can't discriminate on the basis of religion."
2019.18-1195,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3698.25,3698.66,It's almost --
2019.18-1195,3,63223,richard_d_komer,,3698.66,3699.9,That is why --
2019.18-1195,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3699.9,3711.025,"It's almost sort of a illusory state, isn't it? The legislatures can choose to give money or not."
2019.18-1195,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3724.48,3724.91,You may --
2019.18-1195,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3724.91,3726.74,"That's basically what you're saying, isn't it?"
2019.18-1195,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3726.74,3728.07,You may answer briefly.
2019.18-1195,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3728.07,3733.08,And not fund.
2019.18-1195,3,63223,richard_d_komer,,3733.08,3744.36,We're saying the legislature ab initio might be able to do more than what the court should have done here.
2019.18-1195,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3756.605,3757.8,"Thank you, counsel."
