2018.17-71,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.36,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-71, Weyerhaeuser Company versus the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Mr. Bishop."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,9.36,31.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress amended the Endangered Species Act in 1978 to narrow the concept of critical habitat, and it did that in response to this Court's decision in Hill and an early regulation that allowed critical habitat designation for population expansion beyond a species' present habitat."
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,68.76,96.8,"Mr. Bishop, may -- may I offer you a hypothetical just to understand the scope of your argument, which is a bit unclear to me? So, in my hypothetical, there is a species which, like this one, is in only a single habitat, and for whatever reason, that habitat is no longer going to support the species. Disease has come, a predator has come, it's gotten too hot, it's gotten too cold, whatever it is."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,149.44,165.52,"No, it has to be habitat. Now, just to be plain, part of the problem with that is that the government -- when the government talks about reasonable changes, which is what -- is what it does here, what would be involved in -- on this piece of land for it to be inhabited --"
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,165.52,167.08,I understand that you think --
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,167.08,167.2,There may --
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,167.2,170.24,-- that it's much more than reasonable changes that would be involved here.
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,174.04,174.4,I understand.
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,174.4,175.44,-- I'm stipulating --
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,175.44,175.96,I understand.
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,175.96,178.08,-- that it's -- it's pretty minimal stuff.
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,183.04,183.28,Right.
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,206.24,206.96,But I want to --
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,206.96,208.4,What happens when you have a reasonable --
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,208.4,213.48,"-- I want to stick to my hypothetical, which is, you know, maybe something more than de minimis but -- but --"
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,213.48,213.8,"No, I --"
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,213.8,223.6,"-- but what -- what the government views as reasonable changes, such to allow the land to support the species over the long term."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,223.6,225.48,"No, we don't think so, Justice Kagan."
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,225.48,225.96,And why is that?
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,225.96,226.28,And the reason is --
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,226.28,227.76,Where in the statute do you find that?
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,227.76,230.2,The statute says it in three places.
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,235.6,236.56,But we know that habitat --
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,236.56,238.76,It says it in Section 3(5)(C) --
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,238.76,244.96,"-- doesn't mean -- excuse me, I'm sorry. We know that habitat doesn't mean just where a species lives."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,266.08,266.8,But those are --
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,266.8,272.08,So we know that the statute is not using the kind of garden-variety definition of habitat.
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,272.08,275.04,"No, I -- I disagree with that, Justice Kagan."
2018.17-71,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,311.76,329.8,"But if you use the migratory bird example, then we have here the ephemeral ponds, which are supposed -- supposed to be ideal for breeding, so it's -- it's a habitat that is suitable for breeding."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,329.8,331.68,"I disagree with that, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.17-71,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,348.76,354.88,But is it -- is it -- is it true with -- in -- in the case of birds that they may stay at a place less than a month?
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,354.88,358.84,"That's an entirely different example, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,377.8,414.44,"If I could go back to the -- the statutory basis for your position, because, to my mind, it is a counterintuitive result that the statute would prefer extinction of the species to the designation of an area which requires only certain reasonable improvements in order to support the species. That seems a counterintuitive result, and, as I say, it does not seem a result that's demanded at all by the statutory language, which contemplates that habitats will exist even beyond the areas where a species currently resides."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,414.44,422.04,"Justice Kagan, there is a difference between an area -- an unoccupied area that is habitat and an unoccupied area that is not habitat."
2018.17-71,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,422.04,422.68,Mr. Bishop --
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,422.68,423.92,The statute reaches --
2018.17-71,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,423.92,424.92,-- do you agree -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,426.84,435.76,The statute reaches only in 3(5)(C) critical habitat shall not include the entire area which can be occupied.
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,438.28,478.12,"But I think that that was dealing with a very different problem. That was dealing with a problem where a species can reside in many areas outside of the area where it resided, and the statute was making clear that just because that's true, you can't go designate all of those areas habitat. But this is a different problem from the problem that we're talking about where there's only a single area that might conceivably prevent extinction of the species. And you're saying that, notwithstanding that it was -- it's only reasonable efforts that would allow it to conserve the species, that's not permitted."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,478.12,478.6,It is not.
2018.17-71,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,480.64,494.48,"Well, do you -- Mr. Bishop, do you agree with the proposition that the choice in Justice Kagan's hypothetical is between designation of the land as critical habitat and extinction of the species? Are there not --"
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,494.48,494.56,No.
2018.17-71,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,494.56,496.72,-- other options available to the federal government?
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,496.72,499.96,There are other options and there are other clues in the statutory language.
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,548.4,599.4,"But -- but I guess what strikes me about the statute, Mr. Bishop, is that really all over the place you get these references to the fact that habitat isn't just sort of there and perfect always, that habitat requires things to be done to it. You know, even in the definition of ""occupied critical habitat,"" it talks about special management that needs to be taken in order to protect the habitat. And, similarly, in the definition of ""conservation,"" it talks about, you know, the need for habitat improvement. So -- so all through the statute there's this idea of it's not just an on/off switch, that there is habitat that needs to be maintained, improved, and so forth in order to fulfill the function of preserving a species."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,599.4,601.56,"With all due respect, Justice Kagan, I don't think that's right."
2018.17-71,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,608.64,617.48,May I ask you a preliminary question? And it concerns whether the landowner's claim is currently ripe.
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,647.24,658.28,"No, Justice Ginsburg. The -- the immediate effect of this overlay of a critical habitat on this 1500 acres is a diminution in value of tens of millions of dollars."
2018.17-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,731.2,733.68,This is a royal we.
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,755.96,760.72,"No, we incurred all of these expenses as the -- as the economic analysis explains."
2018.17-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,760.72,762.48,But who are you representing? I thought the --
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,762.48,772.48,The agreement between Weyerhaeuser -- the agreement between Weyerhaeuser and the owners of the rest of the property is that we would expend the money and they will provide the land. We also own 150 acres.
2018.17-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,780.16,823.88,"Can I go back to a question? As I was reading the evidence in this case, it appeared that there was a dispute as to whether this frog could, in fact, survive, maybe not as healthily as it does now, and maybe not for the very long term, but there was evidence that the frog was there for, I think, 10 or 15 years while timber cutting was occurring. There was some scientific evidence that there were stumps that the frog might be able to survive in, as opposed to the canopied forest."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,863.44,866.28,This property is not just not optimal.
2018.17-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,899.92,903.12,But that -- but that definition was never provided?
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,903.12,923.24,"The definition that we provided was the definition that we have provided to this Court, which is the dictionary definition from Webster's 3rd, ""the physical features that naturally or normally are preferred by the species,"" the 1979 convention, ""land which contains suitable living conditions."" And, you know, a picture is worth a thousand words."
2018.17-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,955.0,998.68,"I think it's begging -- it's begging the question, which is I don't know that the circuit below actually accepted your definition or whether your definition, for the reasons I indicated just a few minutes ago, covered all of the conditions that could make for survival for the species. As I read the record, there were suggestions by some of the scientists that what -- what you admitted to Justice Kagan a little while ago, minimal work, this species could survive, albeit not robustly, but it could survive."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,998.68,998.84,No.
2018.17-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,998.84,999.96,Wouldn't that be enough?
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,999.96,1002.48,"No, that's just not what the administrative record shows."
2018.17-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1002.96,1005.04,"Well, I don't want to argue the record now."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1024.76,1039.56,"If you thought that habitat meant something other than what the convention says and what the dictionaries in 1978 said, and if you think that on the basis of this record that this is habitat for these species, then I think that would be --"
2018.17-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1039.56,1041.24,"Well, that's your -- well, that's your adversary --"
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1041.24,1043.68,But none of those things are supported -- none of those things are supported by --
2018.17-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1043.68,1045.6,Assuming what I said --
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1045.6,1046.36,Yes.
2018.17-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1046.36,1047.92,-- would a remand be appropriate?
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1047.92,1048.8,Yes.
2018.17-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1048.8,1049.44,Okay.
2018.17-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1049.44,1058.48,"I'd like to ask you, I've not -- one way of looking at the case, as I started looking at it, is this isn't about words, really, or definitions."
2018.17-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1146.96,1154.04,"And -- and so you don't -- isn't what we have to do, we look at the record, it's -- the discretion is given to the Secretary."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1178.48,1179.32,"No, not at all."
2018.17-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1200.36,1201.08,"No, we're looking at it the same way."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1203.24,1216.36,"I would like to spend a couple minutes, if I may, on judicial review. The court below held that the exclusion decision here is not subject to judicial review."
2018.17-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1255.76,1277.36,"Well, it is a ""may/if."" But if the other conditions are met, it indicates, because of the use of the ""may,"" rather than the use of a ""shall,"" doesn't it, that the Secretary still has discretion? In other words, if the conditions aren't met, then the Secretary can't exclude. But if the conditions are met, the Secretary may exclude if he wants."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1277.36,1279.76,"Yes, ultimately, there's -- it's a discretionary decision."
2018.17-71,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1306.12,1306.6,Mr. Bishop --
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1306.6,1308.6,And the government itself has conceded this.
2018.17-71,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1308.6,1309.44,-- if I --
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1309.44,1309.52,Sorry.
2018.17-71,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1309.52,1313.0,"No, not at all. Maybe you can help me out with this."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1347.52,1348.24,Right.
2018.17-71,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1368.68,1381.8,"And what -- what -- on that, my question is, what more would you ask the Secretary to do? The Secretary did quantify the economic benefits exclusion and then said, compared to the benefits of inclusion, they're indeterminate."
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1403.04,1403.2,"Well, we do --"
2018.17-71,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1403.2,1403.4,-- reasoning?
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1403.4,1404.56,-- we do have that complaint.
2018.17-71,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1409.16,1410.88,"Well, could you explain that to me?"
2018.17-71,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1410.88,1440.2,"Yes, the inputs into the decision have to be fair and reasonable and the connection between those inputs and the ultimate decision have to be. Let -- let me give an example of a very basic error that -- an example of an internal inconsistency. So the -- the Service refused to factor in the loss of Unit 1 to housing and to St. Tammany's tax base, and it did that because it found that Unit 1 is only 0.5 percent of developable land in the parish. There's a big problem with that."
2018.17-71,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1544.12,1549.84,"Thank you, Mr. Bishop. Mr. Kneedler."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1549.84,1558.8,"Mr. Chief Justice -- excuse me -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The dusky gopher frog is a critically endangered species."
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1581.52,1594.12,It has to be -- your argument is that critical habitat doesn't have to include all of the elements for habitability because you could undertake some restoration that would provide whatever's missing?
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1594.12,1594.6,That -- that --
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1594.6,1597.64,So the -- the draining of the -- of -- of the swamp.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1613.4,1613.68,Yes.
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1625.12,1630.0,"Well, reasonable -- reasonable efforts that the landowners would have to undertake voluntarily, right?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1630.0,1634.2,"The landowners, or if they entered into an agreement with a -- with a conservation group."
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1639.0,1642.2,But they've -- they've told you they're not going to do it.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1642.2,1651.32,"That -- that's true. But the -- the operation of the Act, it can't be dispositive what the intention -- subjective intentions at this moment in time by this particular owner of the property are."
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1667.04,1667.6,I don't understand.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1678.04,1679.12,Right.
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1679.4,1683.8,"So you just say, well, we're going to designate it anyway, even though the restoration won't occur?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1683.8,1692.6,"Well, the -- the -- the question of whether it -- it's -- whether it is capable of supporting a population is basically a scientific one."
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1700.08,1704.64,"With the -- with -- with the change, right? Can this support the population if they make this change?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1704.64,1705.2,Yes.
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1705.72,1722.32,"Well, but what's the limit? I mean, you could require, say, well, this -- this piece of property in -- in Canada could accommodate the species so long as you invested $100 million to put in ephemeral ponds, change the loblolly pines to longleaf and do all this."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1722.32,1727.44,"Well, it has -- it has to be, according to the Service here, reasonable efforts."
2018.17-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1727.52,1730.08,What's the definition of reasonable?
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1730.08,1749.96,"I -- something that -- I mean, for one thing, I think there's a big distinction between whether the -- whether, in this case, the upland habitat has been transformed to such an extent that it's destroyed, like if there was a shopping center there or a housing development there. As compared to the upland habitat here --"
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1749.96,1750.4,But why -- why --
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1750.4,1751.24,-- has trees that different --
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1751.24,1760.52,"-- why is that so, Mr. Kneedler, though? I mean, it might be a few more dollars to pull up the asphalt and then put down the ephemeral ponds."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1765.44,1766.88,It's conceivable if there was a small --
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1766.88,1771.36,And where does all this come from in the statute? Where do you get reasonable efforts in the statute?
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1771.36,1775.72,"Well, I -- I think it runs throughout the statute, frankly."
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1775.72,1776.92,"Well, runs throughout."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1777.8,1781.96,"Well, a number -- a number of places I would -- I would -- I would refer to."
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1785.64,1787.36,I don't see reasonable efforts there.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1787.36,1788.52,"No, not reasonable efforts, but --"
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1788.52,1788.96,It's not there.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1788.96,1793.96,"No, but it -- it talks about conservation, what's essential for conservation of the species."
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1803.12,1812.16,"Oh, I don't doubt under Section 7 the government has enormous powers to help species, whether in critical habitat or elsewhere."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1822.32,1831.68,"But this Court said in Sweet Home, for example, that the fact that the government can purchase land or make grants does not undermine the -- the operation."
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1833.36,1835.32,"It's a supplementary power, though, you'd agree?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1835.32,1836.6,It -- it is.
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1881.04,1881.16,Do you --
2018.17-71,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1881.16,1881.4,Mister --
2018.17-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1881.4,1888.24,I think your argument requires you to provide some definition of reasonable restoration.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1941.08,1944.32,I -- I don't think there would be a hard-and-fast rule.
2018.17-71,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1957.12,1957.6,"Well, that's --"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1957.6,1959.36,It's being used to raise trees.
2018.17-71,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1963.84,1966.76,"Well, yeah, but that's -- that's -- now you're right at the point."
2018.17-71,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2025.08,2028.88,-- but they want a lot of trees planted there.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2054.92,2059.72,"Well, I -- the Act, as you pointed out, it says the Secretary shall --"
2018.17-71,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2059.72,2062.04,But it's not the Act that I'm thinking of.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2096.96,2107.52,"First of all, you pointed to page 57 of the Joint Appendix, which shows the uplands at Glen Pond."
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2147.24,2157.76,"Well, but the problem with that is, once you have the designation, you need probably federal permits to do things like logging companies typically do."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2171.28,2180.16,"Well, as far as logging is concerned, the -- the ongoing log -- logging operations here have not required a -- any -- any federal permit."
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2186.32,2187.84,"Which is exactly what they want to do, right?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2187.84,2200.2,"Yes, but -- but if that's true, then a Section 7 -- excuse me, a 404 permit would be required if they were going to fill wetlands or -- or fill the ponds."
2018.17-71,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2217.96,2228.48,"Mr. Kneedler, in your brief, you give a meaning to ""habitat"" which, frankly, is very different than its dictionary meaning."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2257.88,2260.92,"Well, if you disagree about the Santa Ana sucker, that's --"
2018.17-71,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2260.92,2262.24,I'm not -- we're not looking at that.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2262.24,2262.44,Okay.
2018.17-71,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2262.44,2297.88,"Let's assume I take the dictionary definition of ""habitat,"" which is the kind of place that is natural for the life and growth of an animal or plant. That's a fairly simple, natural place. Could this -- is this a natural place for this frog to live? And, if not, do -- is the difference between you and your colleague whether some reasonable restoration can be made or not?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2297.88,2327.52,"That -- that may in the end be the difference, but -- but I think it's important when -- when you're talking about the definition that you quoted, and we -- we quote a number of them on page 33 of our brief, a number of dictionary definitions, is it the kind of place, is it the kind of site on which the -- on which the species could thrive? And -- and here, the kind of site, I think, is really most commonly understood or defined as the central element, what makes it rare, and that's the pond."
2018.17-71,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2335.28,2336.6,And was I all that --
2018.17-71,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2336.6,2337.4,Mr. Kneedler --
2018.17-71,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2337.4,2342.72,We were just told that they were in a pond for less than a month.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2342.72,2349.72,"Well, the -- the adult frogs are, but -- but the -- the larvae and tadpoles remain in the -- in the pond for much longer."
2018.17-71,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2360.88,2362.24,How -- how do you answer --
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2362.24,2370.28,"-- the tadpoles mature and -- and metamorphize, but -- but not water all the time so it has fish that will eat the larvae."
2018.17-71,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2373.72,2389.56,But you need -- you need a place for them to live outside the pond. And Justice Sotomayor brought up the question about whether the frogs could live in the area outside.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2402.64,2411.08,"Well, there -- there is some evidence in the record that we point to where the scientists evaluated the -- the land and found some stumps."
2018.17-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2439.28,2442.64,"The frogs need the -- the frogs need the ephemeral ponds, and those are there."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2469.0,2473.64,"For a long-term sustaining population, there would have to be changes."
2018.17-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2478.32,2492.52,"So they -- they couldn't survive where they are now? I mean, the test can't be could you -- if you dumped a couple of frogs there and then you came back two weeks later or a month later, would any of the frogs still be alive? That can't be the test, right?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2492.52,2493.36,"No, but -- but --"
2018.17-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2493.36,2495.2,They would have to sustain themselves.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2495.2,2497.52,"Well, they -- they might live for several generations."
2018.17-71,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2517.8,2518.32,Mister --
2018.17-71,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2518.32,2519.16,So if we were --
2018.17-71,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2519.16,2544.52,"-- Mr. Kneedler, suppose -- if we could just go back to Justice Alito's question, Justice Alito suggested that there were other things that the government is capable of doing to conserve these frogs. So what, consistent with Mr. Bishop's view of the statute, could the government do, is the government enabled to do, that would effectively conserve these frogs? Is there anything?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2544.52,2551.16,It does have the authority -- there's a grant program under Section 6 of the Act of grants to states.
2018.17-71,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2587.84,2596.88,"And -- and this -- this statute presumes that the designation of critical habitat is often, almost always, going to be on private land, isn't that correct?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2596.88,2597.68,"Well, not -- not --"
2018.17-71,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2597.68,2599.76,"Maybe I'll take down ""almost always."""
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2599.76,2600.84,-- almost always.
2018.17-71,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2600.84,2601.16,Often.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2601.16,2601.84,"No, I -- JUSTICE KAGAN."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2603.28,2605.16,It often will be on private land.
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2625.16,2627.64,Can't you do what you want on federal land?
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2627.64,2639.92,"Well, but triggering section -- yes, but -- to an extent, but Section 7 is a framework to bring in the Fish and Wildlife Service and its expertise."
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2640.84,2649.04,"Well, so the only benefit to the federal government is that the Fish and Wildlife Service will sit down at the table with whoever else, whatever other government agency owns the land?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2649.04,2650.88,"Well, I -- that is an important benefit."
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2659.44,2666.32,"At some point, somebody in the federal government can say to the federal wildlife service: I want you to sit down with whoever it is, the Army Corps of Engineers."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2667.0,2667.16,That --
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2667.16,2669.32,You don't need a statute to bring that about.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2669.32,2686.04,"Well, it's true they could, but Section 7 of the ESA organizes that by setting up a consultation process such that the action agency can't go -- can't go forward in an area that might harm the species or its habitat without consulting with the agency. That is a very important concept at that time."
2018.17-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2686.04,2686.68,Let's go back to my --
2018.17-71,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2686.68,2698.76,"I guess what I was suggesting was -- was -- you know, Congress could have passed a statute which just said every time that there's a problem of this kind, the federal government has to purchase the land that will support an endangered species."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2719.84,2722.04,"You mean immediate restoration, do you mean?"
2018.17-71,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2722.04,2730.08,"You know, that it has to be -- that it has to be available to support the species exactly now without any further effort?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2730.08,2731.48,It is not in the Act at all.
2018.17-71,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2737.92,2740.6,"So that's -- all right, that's -- that's so."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2791.6,2794.64,"Well, the greenhouse example is not -- is not restoring habitat."
2018.17-71,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2796.32,2797.32,"Well, you see what I'm trying to get at --"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2797.32,2798.36,"No, no, no --"
2018.17-71,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2798.36,2799.6,-- is very unlikely.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2799.6,2799.96,Yes.
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2814.76,2815.44,So would you --
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2815.44,2817.52,-- but the restoration doesn't have to happen immediately.
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2817.52,2825.76,"That's your -- that's your requirement, the restoration has to -- has to be entirely in, what did you say, in sync or in --"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2825.76,2829.56,In -- in sync with -- I'm not saying that that is a hard-and-fast rule.
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2832.0,2832.16,Okay.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2856.56,2865.48,I -- I think it's whether -- whether it is a further modification of the habitat in it -- in its existing -- in its existing state.
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2879.96,2895.52,"So if you get to Justice Gorsuch's or whoever it was -- the asphalt thing, if what you have to do is just dig up the asphalt, that's -- the use of the area for a parking lot is not in tune with its normal whatever, so you couldn't do that under this statute?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2895.52,2900.36,"Well, I -- I think -- I think there may be several factors, the size -- the -- the effort involved."
2018.17-71,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2987.96,3001.0,"So can we talk about -- I -- I see your point with talking about a kind of place, and it does seem logical that the frogs were there and they were there for a very long time."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3027.68,3031.16,What -- what the frog needs is -- is some --
2018.17-71,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3031.16,3032.76,"The PCEs, I know."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3032.76,3040.8,"Well, yes, but it -- but it -- that -- that transformation or that change, that restoration would not have to happen overnight."
2018.17-71,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3047.76,3049.0,That's my point.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3049.0,3076.4,"And -- and there -- there is an example in the -- in the recovery plan that is cited in the record when it's describing what has happened at Glen Pond, which is the place in Mississippi, the only place where there is a -- a stable population at all. It describes that there has been some habitat management which has included thinning trees and planting longleaf pines, which suggests this could be a gradual process."
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3097.04,3102.96,"But it's still the case that that would require consent of the owners, and they say they're not going to do it."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3102.96,3103.68,But -- but again --
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3103.68,3105.16,"You can't require them to do it, right?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3105.16,3109.24,"But, again, what constitutes habitat, looks at the nature of the land."
2018.17-71,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3138.52,3138.88,But can you --
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3138.88,3139.88,Suppose the missing --
2018.17-71,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3139.88,3157.76,"-- can you explain, suppose the proposed regulation is in effect. What would the Fish and Wildlife Service have to do differently if the proposed regulation were in effect?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3157.76,3159.48,If the what? The proposed regulation?
2018.17-71,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3159.48,3159.96,Yes.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3159.96,3164.24,I think this would qualify under the proposed regulation as I -- as I read it.
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3194.6,3195.76,Could -- could this --
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3195.76,3202.36,"It is the kind of place, because of the ponds, where the species can thrive."
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3202.36,3250.92,"Let's -- let's assume for the moment that this isn't habitat and, therefore, couldn't be designated as critical habitat. Could the Secretary take other actions to identify this land as critical to the survival of the species, even if it isn't currently habitat? Is there anything in Section 7 or elsewhere in the statute that would prohibit that? The way I read the statute, it says that, you know, the Secretary has to take actions to avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of any endangered species, or result in the destruction of habitat, critical habitat. So there's -- there's an ""or"" there. And it seems to me, I -- I wonder, isn't the Secretary fully endowed with authority to take other actions, even if this isn't critical habitat, to identify this land as important to the future survival of the species?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3250.92,3256.2,"Well, Section -- Section 7(a)(2) is talking about what the action agency does to avoid --"
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3256.2,3257.12,Right.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3257.12,3261.04,-- to avoid critical habitat.
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3261.32,3262.44,That's the operative --
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3262.44,3262.8,-- but -- but --
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3262.8,3264.36,-- action part of the statute.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3264.36,3273.44,-- but -- but Congress enacted it -- the concept of habitat has never been a technical term or a technical feature in the way that it's applied.
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3273.44,3274.72,I -- if you can just answer my question --
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3274.72,3274.92,Yes.
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3274.92,3276.96,-- I'd be grateful. Is there anything that prohibits the Secretary --
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3276.96,3278.4,Maybe on an ad hoc basis --
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3278.4,3278.72,Right.
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3278.72,3280.84,-- but not -- it's not under the statute.
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3283.0,3304.76,"My question is: Why isn't it under the statute, given that language that says specifically that the agency -- the agency can take cognizance of the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species, quite apart from preserving its threatened habitat? It seems to me there are two duties that the Secretary has there, and this would fit neatly under at least one of them, if not the second."
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3304.76,3312.68,"But the -- the Secretary could, but the -- but the designation of critical habitat, as I said, it's mandatory under the Act."

2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3349.6,3350.24,-- are part of that process.
2018.17-71,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3350.24,3358.84,"The agency does lots of things to protect species, endangered species, beyond protecting their habitat, doesn't it?"
2018.17-71,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3358.84,3359.4,Yes.
2018.17-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3368.8,3372.28,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bishop, you have four minutes remaining."
2018.17-71,2,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,3372.28,3387.44,"Justice Gorsuch, to your point, 7(a)(1) imposes an obligation on all other federal agencies which shall, in consultation with the Secretary, utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter. Critical habitat is just one part."
2018.17-71,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3387.44,3390.24,But that's only if it's designated critical habitat.
2018.17-71,2,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,3390.24,3392.08,"No, no, no, that is a general obligation."
2018.17-71,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3605.44,3605.76,I'm sorry.
2018.17-71,2,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,3629.48,3632.36,"Well, first of all, there are other ways to acquire these ponds."
2018.17-71,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3645.52,3646.8,But they don't have to.
2018.17-71,2,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,3646.8,3647.16,"No, they don't --"
2018.17-71,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3647.16,3647.76,If it's critical --
2018.17-71,2,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,3647.76,3648.16,"Well, they -- well --"
2018.17-71,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3648.16,3656.4,"-- they can designate it and then a deliberate process goes on where they talk to the owners, and you come to an accommodation."
2018.17-71,2,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,3657.96,3659.48,"Could I answer that question, Chief Justice?"
2018.17-71,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3659.48,3660.12,Briefly.
2018.17-71,2,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,3660.12,3688.4,"I mean, you know, the government has made absolutely clear what it thinks that means, right? It -- it -- it admits that it's the most likely outcome here, if we need to apply for permits, is that we get to use 40 percent of the land for development and we have to turn 60 percent of it over for frog habitat. We don't think that that is an appropriate use of our land, given that this is not habitat to begin with. Thank you."
2018.17-71,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3688.4,3689.2,"Thank you, counsel."
