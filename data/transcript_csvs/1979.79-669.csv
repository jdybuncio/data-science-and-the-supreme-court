1979.79-669,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,134.179,"Mr. Conley, I think now you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,134.179,138.559,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,315.154,339.317,"Mr. Conley, if you will notice the last page of Judge Gee's opinion in the Fifth Circuit at page A-48 of the petition for certiorari he quotes Judge Richards, saying that -- I think he says himself these are the kinds of cases that are argued by professionals to amateurs."
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,371.229,391.207,"I believe I can say a qualified ""Yes"" to that, because certainly the doctrine of misuse is a doctrine that grew out of attempts by patent owners to expand the patent grant beyond something or to use the patent in such a way as to obtain a control which the patent grant in and of itself does not grant them."
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,408.685,411.865,"That would be particularly true in combination patents, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,411.865,427.061,"Yes, that is primarily true in the case of combination patents but I believe it is also applicable in the case of the type of patent we have here, which is a patent on a method of using a chemical."
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.291,496.938,Was that a staple or a non-staple?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,496.938,501.705,It was a non-staple it was conceded to be in that case.
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,558.591,560.973,Were they conjunctive or disjunctive?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,560.973,568.895,In the statute it says if you do anyone of these or any combination of the three.
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,651.953,666.303,"But the question is whether the doctrine of contributory infringement has been reintroduced and Mercoid, in effect, either sharply cut back on or overruled by the congressional Act, is it not?"
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,666.303,669.141,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is correct."
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,733.042,745.827,Suppose the invention requires the use of a non-staple material and you say the patentee has a right to his invention.
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,752.36,754.228,"Yes, sir, he does."
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,754.228,755.996,And does he have a right to refuse it?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,755.996,757.893,To refuse the license?
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,761.666,766.06,"Well, how can you work it both ways?"
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,768.752,778.498,It is contended by some that the patent owner has a right to refuse licenses and that what we are trying to accomplish here is to compel him to grant a license.
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,778.498,779.892,"Yes, that is what it sounds to me like."
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,782.337,787.628,Let us put it this way A patent owner has only two ways that he can profit from his invention.
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.606,814.026,Has your client asked them for a license?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,814.026,814.364,Sir?
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,814.364,815.485,Has your client ever asked them for a license?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,815.485,817.468,The day we were served we asked for a license.
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,817.468,819.19,"And they said, no, we won't give you a license?"
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,819.19,820.005,That is right.
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,820.005,824.479,"Would you take one if they said, yes, we will give you a license; but, for a small fee?"
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,824.479,825.661,Sure.
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.661,827.554,You would pay a reasonable royalty?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,827.554,829.963,"We told them so, and we still would."
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,829.963,838.575,So you do think that they must grant you a license?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,838.575,840.665,"No, I don't think they must grant us a license."
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,840.665,844.487,Do you think you have the right to sell it without a license?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,844.487,845.527,"I do, because of their --"
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,845.527,849.932,"If they refused to license you, you claim you can sell without license?"
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,849.932,855.01,I say that we can sell it to farmers whom they must grant an alternative.
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.33,860.862,"Well, suppose in suing you they said we offered them a license and they refused?"
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,860.862,862.305,They said they offered the farmers a license?
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,862.305,862.69,"No, no."
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,863.227,864.375,"Oh, they offered me a license."
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,864.375,865.355,Your client a license.
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,879.713,881.046,They would have a right to sue us.
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,883.406,885.01,And --
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,885.01,891.686,"Because if we sold it then we would be guilty of contributory infringement and there would be no coercion of these farmers, because they --"
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.686,901.046,It sounds to me like you are saying that the patentee must give you a license.
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,901.046,904.026,No only that he has to give the farmer an alternative.
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,910.995,913.38,How does he give the farmer an alternative?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,913.38,925.309,"By merely telling him that if he wants to practice the invention by use of propanil, purchase from someone else, then a license is available."
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.309,936.67,"This case could end up, I suppose, theoretically at least, that you lose but the other side loses, too, in a sense that they have to give you a license?"
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,936.67,944.219,"No, I don't think there is any loss there, because they would receive -- by either party, because they would receive exactly what they are entitled to, and that is the royalty that they would --"
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,944.219,945.63,You mean you would both win?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,945.63,946.376,"We both win, right."
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,946.376,949.209,But they have no bargaining power under your theory?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,949.209,952.073,"Oh, no, they can set the royalty as high as is necessary --"
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,952.073,961.994,"All they have to do is offer you a license at a reasonable royalty and if you refuse it, you are in trouble?"
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,961.994,973.151,"If we refused it and they continued to make available to the farmers a license alternatively to the one tied to the purchase of the material, yes, we would be in trouble."
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,973.151,976.406,They have no bargaining power with the farmers?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,976.406,981.263,"No more does any other patentee of a patent which uses staple, materials."
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,993.074,998.466,But does propanil have any use except in this combination patent?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,998.466,1004.934,For the purpose of this case it is conceded it has none.
1979.79-669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1004.934,1011.855,"Do I correctly understand that you, in effect, agree that you are a contributory infringer, the issue is whether there is misuse?"
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1011.855,1012.502,"Yes, sir, that is right."
1979.79-669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1012.502,1013.356,That is the only issue?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1013.356,1017.098,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1076.109,1079.355,"There were some other statements, too, made by Senator McCarren --"
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1079.355,1080.898,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1080.898,1083.037,-- saying that there were some changes.
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1083.037,1096.247,"Senator McCarren said when asked generally on the floor of the Senate, this statute -- Title 35 as a whole, he was talking about -- did not make any changes, it merely codified the law."
1979.79-669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.1,1141.359,Why is your client willing to take a license from the patentee and pay him some royalty?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1141.359,1146.57,"We have some advantages, I think, over a large corporation like Rohm and Haas."
1979.79-669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1151.906,1159.858,And the misuse that you talk about is at least in part the fact that they refused to give you a license when you offered it?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1159.858,1173.005,"Specifically, Mr. Justice White, the misuse is in the coercion of the farmers, the conditioning of the granting of a license on the sale and the purchase by the farmer of this unpatented material."
1979.79-669,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1176.491,1178.079,How do they enforce that?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1178.079,1178.524,Sir?
1979.79-669,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1178.524,1181.138,How do they enforce that?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1182.578,1184.442,"Oh, I see no problem there, really."
1979.79-669,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1185.81,1186.768,How do they do it?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1186.768,1205.44,"Well, one of the things that we suggest because it is commonly used, even by Rohm and Haas itself, is a label licensing program where they apply to the label of their can a statement that the price includes a royalty and if they want to purchase elsewhere, well, such licenses are available."
1979.79-669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1226.095,1232.461,"So to avoid the misuse, quit coercing the farmer and also give you a license?"
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1232.461,1237.329,"Or give the farmer a license, whichever way."
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1251.3,1254.15,What is involved in practicing their invention?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1254.15,1257.161,"Oh, buying some spraying equipment and going around and spraying farms."
1979.79-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.161,1261.761,Exactly.
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1261.761,1274.193,"Now, there was a great deal of discussion by -- in the briefs about some testimony at committee hearings on this bill."
1979.79-669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1305.261,1311.182,Were his earlier statements directed to the same statutory language?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1311.182,1317.192,"The language was slightly different but the meaning was in essence the same, I think."
1979.79-669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1357.211,1359.856,"Well, they did involve contributory infringement?"
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1359.856,1362.045,"Yes, there were contributory infringements."
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1364.968,1366.038,You say Aro --
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1366.038,1382.429,"Aro -- the second Aro case, there was a specific situation where Ford had a license, which they passed on to their customers, which allowed customers to use the patented combination but only if they bought the unpatented fabric from Ford."
1979.79-669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1382.429,1384.496,That was a convertible top.
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1384.496,1387.63,"Convertible top, that is right; that was the case."
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1396.966,1406.181,Do you disagree with Judge Gee's analysis of those two cases and references to Mercoid?
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1406.181,1415.052,"Well, I agree with what Judge Gee finally concluded, and that is that on the whole those cases cut against his opinion."
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1415.052,1416.421,Right.
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1420.768,1423.229,I don't know specifically what you are referring to.
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1423.229,1426.976,"Well, I take it, you know, you have read his opinion?"
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1426.976,1428.905,"Yes, I certainly have."
1979.79-669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1428.905,1436.443,He devoted three or four pages of his opinion to the analysis of Aro 1 and Aro 2 as he called them.
1979.79-669,0,37057,ned_l_conley,,1436.443,1437.5,Yes.
1979.79-669,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1455.039,1456.971,Mr. Hutz.
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1456.971,1460.347,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1592.218,1597.397,"The distinction between staple and non-staple goes to the question of whether it is contributory infringement, does it not?"
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1597.397,1603.966,"Yes, Your Honor, if it is a non-staple as we are using the term now it is considered to be contributory infringement?"
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1603.966,1606.985,"And if it is staple, you won't have contributory infringement."
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1606.985,1610.141,"You will not have contributory infringement, you may have active inducement."
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1610.141,1615.029,But is it not true that you may have misuse whether you have a staple or non-staple.
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1615.029,1616.997,"Yes, Your Honor, that is perfectly possible."
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1616.997,1632.665,"And in this particular case where we have a non-staple, supposing instead of just making periodic sales of implied license to the user you entered into a long-term, say a ten-year license with a farmer, giving him the right to use your patent for ten years."
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1639.926,1647.498,It could well be a misuse in the sense that the extent of the license may continue beyond the point at which propanil is a non-staple.
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1647.498,1652.426,"Well, assuming that it is known in advance that propanil will continue to be a non-staple for ten years?"
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1652.426,1661.307,I am not sure how you know that in advance but the question -- if your question basically is could we do it by an expressed license the --
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1661.307,1661.62,Yes.
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1661.62,1664.285,-- effectively the equivalent of what is done now --
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1664.285,1664.598,Yes.
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1664.598,1666.858,-- I would say that was not a misuse.
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1666.858,1667.504,So you are --
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1667.504,1672.696,"What we are doing now is we are granting no licenses, as I think is clear."
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1672.696,1673.875,An implied license?
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1673.875,1684.641,"Well, it is called an implied license, it is actually -- it goes back to an exhaustion of the monopoly We sell the product propanil, that is all we do."
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1698.007,1698.834,"Well, I understand."
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1716.442,1722.171,If the express license was the equivalent of what we are doing here I would say there is no misuse.
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1722.171,1722.264,Right.
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1722.264,1726.347,Once you begin to talk about a long-term and other factors there may be something in addition --
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1726.347,1732.194,"Well, isn't that the whole issue in the case, because 271 they concede there is contributory infringement."
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1732.194,1732.851,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1732.851,1740.87,"And nothing in 271 expressly covers the kind of case we are talking about, so the question really is whether this is a misuse when it is a non-staple item."
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1742.842,1754.775,"Your Honor, I would take issue with your statement, because I believe that Section 271 does expressly approve of what we are doing, because it expressly states there shall -- I am talking about 271(d) now."
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1754.775,1755.732,Right.
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1755.732,1766.32,It expressly states that there shall be no extension -- illegal extension of the monopoly and no misuse if the patentee engages in three specified acts.
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1768.685,1771.103,It says none of those three shall create a misuse.
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1776.192,1776.958,That is correct.
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1776.958,1782.988,"The question is whether the something else, namely granting a license on condition that you buy only the product, is a misuse."
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1784.922,1796.853,In this particular case that we have before the Court the only acts that Rohm and Haas is doing -- are doing is exactly what is spelled out in Section 271(d).
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1807.36,1807.505,Right.
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1807.505,1814.61,My worthy opponent has conceded that if we were to do it and not be the patent owner we would contributorily infringe.
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1856.107,1856.363,Right.
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1856.363,1858.599,"It can be (1), (2) or (3)."
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1884.083,1888.253,There are things besides those three things in (d)?
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1888.253,1889.735,I would suggest that we are not.
1979.79-669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1889.735,1899.366,"Well, aren't you still telling farmers don't use our patent except in connection with our propanil?"
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1899.366,1902.872,"Effectively we are saying nothing to the farmers, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-669,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1927.787,1935.6,What is the basis for the claim that you are letting people practice your patent but only on condition that they buy an unpatented material from you?
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,1935.6,1940.314,"Well, that of course is the position which my worthy opponent makes."
1979.79-669,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.314,2035.533,Do you contend that your sales of propanil are to the ultimate consumer of the product?
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,2035.533,2039.152,"No, no, they are not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, they are to distributors."
1979.79-669,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2051.621,2055.52,Was there any dispute over that in the District Court?
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,2055.52,2056.688,Not as far as I know.
1979.79-669,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2097.268,2100.317,How widely available is propanil?
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,2100.317,2101.231,Today?
1979.79-669,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2104.454,2107.506,The ordinary farmer?
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,2107.506,2114.662,I don't believe there is any inability of the farmer to obtain access to propanil if he wishes to use it on his fields.
1979.79-669,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2119.352,2125.641,What I am trying to get at is what I addressed in the form of a question to your friend and I am not sure I understood the answer.
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,2140.753,2146.682,"Well, we can only that, Your Honor, by looking at others who produce propanil."
1979.79-669,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2375.563,2391.744,"Mr. Hutz, don't opponents of legislation have a history of a parade of horribles saying how bad this is going to be when perhaps the actual enacted language does not involve all the things they think it does?"
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,2391.744,2403.239,I think you are right but I think you have to keep in mind that I don't believe there was any dispute between the proponents and the opponents or even those that were considering the Act that that would be permitted.
1979.79-669,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.192,2427.467,"Were they not then talking about tributary infringement; and is it not true even if it were feasible -- and I understand it is probably not -- to license farmers, about 3,000 licenses to farmers, so there would be no claim whatsoever that you are misusing the patent, then you could still sue these people for contributory infringement under this bill."
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,2430.217,2437.835,I would submit that the Justice Department was accurately stating that exactly the conduct we are doing today would be permitted.
1979.79-669,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.452,2448.364,"Well, am I not correct in what I said?"
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,2448.364,2450.166,I may have misunderstood the question.
1979.79-669,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.744,2459.964,"Even if there were no basis for a claim of misuse here and, as I say, I don't know whether that is a valid basis, say you had a licensing program and you just licensed the farmers."
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,2475.155,2477.649,I am sure they didn't want us to do that under those circumstances
1979.79-669,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2477.649,2484.351,What I am suggesting is that their opposition to the bill didn't necessarily address itself specifically to the misuse question.
1979.79-669,1,39511,rudolf_e_hutz,,2486.521,2489.378,I would submit it was directed to the misuse.
1979.79-669,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2692.22,2694.902,Mr. Bernard.
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,2694.902,2698.802,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-669,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2794.529,2797.364,"May I just ask, you agree with respondents generally."
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,2810.3,2813.172,"It is not a misuse, Your Honor."
1979.79-669,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2909.607,2915.19,Does this mean that the patent becomes substantially worthless if the product ceases to be a non-staple?
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,2919.691,2921.577,"Well, the patent is of value."
1979.79-669,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2924.555,2931.244,"I thought you just explained that you really as a practical matter could not enforce it, except by controlling the sales?"
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,2931.244,2935.633,"No, as a practical matter when there are contributory infringers in that group --"
1979.79-669,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.633,2939.399,They are infringers as soon as the product ceases being a non-staple.
1979.79-669,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2939.399,2946.225,"Once other uses for propanil are found, then anybody could freely sell propanil without being a contributor or infringer."
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,2947.17,2948.549,That is a contention.
1979.79-669,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2963.153,2965.133,"Well, what if this were salt or sugar?"
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,2965.133,2967.278,"Well, let us draw an analogy with salt."
1979.79-669,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.142,3000.695,Right.
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,3000.695,3004.523,But nevertheless that stoker switch was unpatented.
1979.79-669,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3011.746,3012.209,Right.
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,3012.209,3015.328,But its use is patentable.
1979.79-669,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3016.866,3018.859,"Well, in this method patented."
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,3018.859,3019.411,Yes.
1979.79-669,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3031.13,3038.624,"Well, as a component of the combination it was patentable."
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,3038.624,3039.736,Only in the combination.
1979.79-669,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3039.736,3041.033,Not an exact analogy.
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,3041.033,3041.37,No.
1979.79-669,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3046.501,3061.506,You are suggesting it is possible that even if propanil was a staple that you could prevent people from selling it if the purpose of the sale was to use your invention?
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,3061.506,3062.626,Yes.
1979.79-669,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3063.56,3068.265,Rather than trying to monopolize the sale of a staple generally.
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,3068.265,3071.096,"Yes, I think that is an area that is yet to be developed."
1979.79-669,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3078.607,3086.676,I thought the teaching of the briefs was that we learned from 271 that Congress wanted to draw a very clear bright line between staples and non-staples.
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,3087.256,3091.663,Congress did draw a very clear line between staples and non-staples.
1979.79-669,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3106.344,3107.976,None of those should constitute misuse?
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,3107.976,3108.832,Yes.
1979.79-669,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3108.832,3113.359,"It did not say, though, that a long-term license on condition is not a misuse?"
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,3113.359,3114.302,Well --
1979.79-669,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3114.302,3120.347,"What you said, I think, is if you do anyone of those three things you are not guilty of misuse."
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,3126.258,3129.265,"None of those three things constitute misuse, per se."
1979.79-669,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3129.265,3129.693,Yes.
1979.79-669,2,22000,eugene_l_bernard,,3130.752,3132.735,Yes.
1979.79-669,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3310.452,3321.112,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Conley?"
1979.79-669,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3321.112,3335.219,"Tell me again, where would the condition -- how did the patentee here attempt to impose any condition that the use of his patent must be -- it is conditioned on buying propanil from him?"
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3335.219,3337.135,It is inherent in the patentee.
1979.79-669,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3337.135,3338.417,"I know, but he didn't say it anywhere."
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3338.417,3340.558,He doesn't say -- he can only have a license --
1979.79-669,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.558,3341.797,If he sells propanil.
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3341.797,3342.302,Right.
1979.79-669,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3342.302,3344.15,Which is what 271 says he can do.
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3344.15,3344.569,Right.
1979.79-669,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3347.611,3348.961,"Yes, but he doesn't tell them anything else."
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3348.961,3350.557,And thereby grants him a license.
1979.79-669,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3350.557,3352.254,"I know, but he doesn't tell them anything else."
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3352.254,3353.801,And then he doesn't?
1979.79-669,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3355.231,3358.247,"He doesn't say to the farmer, you can't buy that from anybody else."
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3358.247,3360.239,He can commit sins of omission as well as a commission.
1979.79-669,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.239,3362.835,What he really does is he won't furnish you a license.
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3362.835,3364.978,"He won't furnish the farmer a license, unless he buys --"
1979.79-669,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3364.978,3366.015,"He won't furnish you one, either."
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3366.015,3369.65,"Nor anybody else, unless they buy the material from Rohm and Haas."
1979.79-669,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3396.007,3402.811,"All the patentee is doing here, he is offering for sale propanil, which 271 says he can certainly do."
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3402.811,3403.476,He can.
1979.79-669,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3403.476,3407.666,"And he doesn't need to go out and practice his invention himself, he is selling propanil."
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3414.265,3415.047,Correct.
1979.79-669,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3415.796,3416.471,That is all he is doing.
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3416.471,3418.728,-- he had the right to sell propanil before.
1979.79-669,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3418.728,3419.953,Yes.
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3419.953,3422.555,That was not given to him by 271.
1979.79-669,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3430.75,3433.125,You haven't told me yet where he is conditioning it.
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3433.125,3437.878,Because he sells it with a license and refuses to grant a license without it.
1979.79-669,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3439.327,3441.847,He refuses to grant a license without what?
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3441.847,3446.566,He refuses to grant a license without the purchase of the propanil.
1979.79-669,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3448.237,3449.458,Whom has he refused?
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3449.458,3453.309,He refused it to my client and to one single farmer who wrote to us.
1979.79-669,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3453.309,3457.404,So you really are saying that his real sin is refusing you a license?
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3457.404,3459.799,And he has stipulated that he refuses.
1979.79-669,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3465.356,3466.15,Where is that?
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3466.15,3471.222,It is in the stipulation that was filed before the motion for summary judgment was granted.
1979.79-669,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3471.222,3477.858,"Well, that is not inconsistent with the language of the '52 Act of Congress, is it?"
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3477.858,3479.267,What is that?
1979.79-669,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3479.267,3482.528,You say his refusal to grant a license.
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3482.528,3485.892,It is inconsistent when you look at all of the cases that came before.
1979.79-669,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3485.892,3487.931,I am not talking about all the cases that came before.
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3490.52,3493.506,That the refusal to grant a license is not inconsistent?
1979.79-669,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3498.334,3502.663,"Well, but patent misuse stems from Mercoid and the question --"
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3502.663,3504.149,"No, sir, that is not correct."
1979.79-669,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3504.149,3510.159,"Well, from Catlin v. Leeds and so forth, but it reached its apogee in Mercoid."
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3510.159,3511.856,It did not.
1979.79-669,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3601.107,3607.479,And the '52 congressional enactment was intended to either overrule or limit Mercoid?
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3607.479,3610.055,It was intended to clarify --
1979.79-669,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3610.055,3617.459,"Well, you can call it clarify but certainly there wouldn't have been that legislation had it not been for Mercoid and its predecessors."
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3617.459,3627.672,If it had not been for the statements in Mercoid to the effect that what there may be left of the doctrine of contributory infringement we do not stop to consider.
1979.79-669,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3653.49,3661.423,Mercoid left very much in doubt whether there was anything left of the doctrine of contributory infringement?
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3661.423,3663.723,"Yes, sir indeed, it did."
1979.79-669,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3697.038,3700.192,But all those were scope of patent cases.
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3700.192,3700.981,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-669,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3700.981,3707.78,Contributory infringement and patent misuse are both how you remedy-type cases.
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3707.78,3707.995,No.
1979.79-669,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3727.953,3742.567,"But there is no question that Congress -- accepting the Commerce Clause definition of Wickard v. Filburn, Congress needn't rely on the Patent Clause to grant everybody that comes up with an invention a patent on it."
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3742.567,3744.584,I don't know of a single case when they haven't done so.
1979.79-669,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3762.613,3770.23,"It is a question of which authority Congress might have been acting under, just like in the Civil Rights Act of 1964."
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3781.156,3782.594,It probably doesn't.
1979.79-669,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3806.48,3809.44,You say that there is a just not fourth paragraph in (d).
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3809.44,3810.816,There is not a fourth paragraph in (d).
1979.79-669,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3810.816,3816.28,That says you may condition the use of your invention on the purchase of a non-staple material.
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3816.28,3816.612,Precisely.
1979.79-669,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3816.612,3821.928,Which you say is what is happening here and which is outside the protection of (d).
1979.79-669,3,37057,ned_l_conley,,3821.928,3826.111,"And since that is precisely what Mercoid held, was a misuse."
1979.79-669,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3838.234,3838.893,"Thank you, gentlemen."
