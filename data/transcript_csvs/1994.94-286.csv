1994.94-286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-286, Freightliner Corporation v. Ben Myrick."
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,10.222,13.074,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.385,194.558,"Mr. Fried, even if we accept your position on that, we have here an express preemption clause, as I understand it, and it preempts State standards applicable to a particular aspect of performance addressed by a Federal standard that is in effect, and as I understand it, there is no Federal standard in effect now on antilock brakes, and how can there be express preemption?"
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,196.91,198.195,"Well, there--"
1994.94-286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.195,200.328,There just isn't a Federal standard.
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,200.328,207.651,"--That is the contention principally urged by the Solicitor General, and we believe that is incorrect."
1994.94-286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,260.603,261.636,Mr. Fried--
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,278.147,278.864,There would not.
1994.94-286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.947,283.199,"And you rely on the history of what happened, I gather."
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,283.199,283.468,--No.
1994.94-286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,312.268,320.224,"Mr. Fried, why shouldn't we accept the administrator's determination of what the status of regulation is?"
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,335.584,343.44,--the administrator is owed deference because of the administrator's expertise.
1994.94-286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,381.048,389.837,"Mr. Fried, I just don't think that's true, that we only accord deference to agency officials in their areas of expertise."
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,411.734,412.217,--Well--
1994.94-286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.217,413.786,We accord deference.
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,413.786,447.674,"--On that, let's turn to the meaning of the regulation, because there is... if there is deference to be paid, I think that deference cannot carry all the way to the conclusion which respondents and the Solicitor General seek, because in this case there was a federally mandated process, and the outcome of that process was the removal, and that removal is textual."
1994.94-286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,461.6,462.7,Where do we find that?
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,462.7,464.552,"--In the lodging, Your Honor."
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,507.379,517.253,"I still don't quite understand, Mr. Fried, just following up with... you were interrupted on... you were going to quote something that was in writing that was in place now, that preempts the State--"
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,517.253,518.47,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,518.47,519.82,--Is that what you just referred to?
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,519.82,520.285,No.
1994.94-286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,547.303,551.607,That is footnote 8 on page 9 of the respondent's brief?
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,551.607,552.657,--That is correct.
1994.94-286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,582.21,593.701,"I find this quite unsatisfactory, Mr. Fried, that things that seem to be at the core of the case were either lodged or are in the footnote in someone else's brief."
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,593.701,600.255,"I wish it had been otherwise, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,600.255,624.387,"Is it your position, Mr. Fried, that if a truck had airbrakes on it, and there was an accident, that the Federal standard could be used or argued to a jury as evidence that it was unsafe?"
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,624.387,631.976,It could be used if it violated 5.5.1 as set out by the respondents.
1994.94-286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,634.011,635.528,"Well, suppose it didn't?"
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,635.528,639.915,"--Oh, if it did not, then that, too, would be preempted."
1994.94-286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,686.411,690.365,But it seems to me that indicates there's an absence of a safety standard.
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,699.038,711.928,"--There is... Standard 121, altogether, is a comprehensive design and performance standard."
1994.94-286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,724.586,733.359,"Well, it is with respect to airbrake systems, but it's not comprehensive with respect to the vehicles upon which an airbrake system may be installed."
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,742.381,748.986,An antilock device becomes part of an airbrake system.
1994.94-286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,753.272,764.163,"Well, it may do so, but the only word from the National Government with respect to them, by the National Government's own text, does not apply to trucks and trailers."
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,786.326,804.288,"--Oh, the difficulties that are being raised apply as well to implied preemption, that is correct, but what one has to do is consider what the Federal Government has done and why it has done it."
1994.94-286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,804.288,822.417,"No, but no matter how comprehensive the regulation may be with respect to those vehicles that it covers, it is neither comprehensive nor even, if you will, in existence with respect to those vehicles that it does not cover, so I'm missing your point here."
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,834.057,860.625,"Well, it does apply to all trucks and trailers, including those that incorporate antilock devices, because those antilock devices cannot, if they're functioning properly, bring... the malfunctions in them, rather than maintenance and driver mistakes, cannot bring the performance of the rest of the system below the prescribed minimum."
1994.94-286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,861.81,864.445,But I'm focusing on the text of the amendment.
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,866.461,882.823,"Well, the provision I've been citing to you is in the standard as it is now in operation, and the amendment withdrew the requirement of having that device in all airbrakes."
1994.94-286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,913.176,927.602,"Mr. Fried, suppose one were to read this as the agency's responding not to its own better judgment, but to the compulsion of the Ninth Circuit?"
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,967.746,983.523,"Justice Ginsburg, you're quite right, the agency did not in its heart of hearts, expressed in its own news releases, accept the Ninth Circuit's determination."
1994.94-286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,997.265,1001.3,"Well, let me get to Justice Ginsburg's point in just a slightly different way."
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1025.598,1035.121,It would be because the premise was not... and this is what I have to keep coming back to.
1994.94-286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1054.083,1061.688,"But it seems to me is what we're interested in is what the agency has done, not what the Ninth Circuit has said, and if the agency, in my hypothetical, has said,"
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1082.618,1117.006,"--Again, that formulation assumes that the decision forced on a reluctant agency was a decision that what you've done here is simply not sufficiently justified, rather than a decision which was at the heart of the safety concerns... that is to say, what you have done here is dangerous, and the agency, of course, has had the matter under continual review ever since."
1994.94-286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1148.21,1149.644,But that's not a standard.
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1149.644,1175.112,"What is a standard is 121 as a whole, and 121 as a whole tells you what are minimally safe airbrake systems, and those minimally safe airbrake systems do not, cannot be compelled to include antilock devices because it is dangerous."
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1179.663,1185.919,"You're saying it's just as clear as if it in so many words said, you may not use antilock brakes."
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1185.919,1187.835,"Oh, no, they do say you may use them."
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1187.835,1188.319,Oh.
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1188.319,1194.691,"You may use them if, when properly functioning, they don't degrade the rest of the system."
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.935,1243.256,"You're saying it's as though the statute said, or the regulation, you may not use them if they have this degrading consequence."
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1243.256,1245.541,--If they have this degrading consequence--
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1245.541,1246.474,--you may not use them.
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1246.474,1248.493,--You... I believe that--
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1248.493,1250.043,That's what they in effect said.
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1250.043,1251.028,"--Oh, well they... it's not as if."
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1253.328,1255.397,But does it say they all have this consequence?
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1255.397,1256.297,"No, they don't."
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.932,1260.3,"Well, what about the systems at issue in this case?"
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1262.217,1267.637,"Well, there are no... these trucks, which were manufactured--"
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.637,1268.323,"Oh, they don't have--"
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1268.323,1271.525,--They don't have... they do not have the devices.
1994.94-286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1273.391,1282.481,"--If you could show that they would automatically have the consequence, you wouldn't have to reply upon this regulation anyway, because you would show that it's not negligence to have them."
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1286.618,1291.939,"--Oh, we don't... we could not say that they do all have that consequence."
1994.94-286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1291.939,1299.193,"--Well, if you can't say that, then you cannot say that this regulation in effect prohibits the use of antilock brakes."
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1299.193,1306.262,"I mentioned the three kinds of difficulties, because 5.5.1 addresses only the first."
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1321.874,1325.66,"Yes, but if you have the driver response problem, wouldn't that apply to any system?"
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1325.66,1326.626,--No.
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1332.914,1340.27,"Well, what if the plaintiffs alleged in this case that such a system is now available, and you were negligent not to use it?"
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1342.621,1357.564,"That is preempted because the judgment that those systems are now available is a judgment which we believe is reserved to NHTSA, the correct place to make--"
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1357.564,1359.614,What reserves that judgment to NHTSA?
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1359.614,1363.885,--121 as a whole reserves that judgment to NHTSA.
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.885,1367.837,And in fact prohibits any use of antilock devices until we say they're okay--
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1367.837,1368.27,No.
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.27,1368.939,--is that what you're saying?
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1368.939,1382.762,"Leaves the option open, and forbids either Georgia or Florida to impose design-defect liability for having them or not having them."
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.404,1397.089,How about devices that do not function well?
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1397.089,1397.989,Those are--
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1397.989,1399.041,Do they retain the option to use those?
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1399.041,1399.741,"--No, they are not."
1994.94-286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.045,1409.23,And it's clear that that excludes only those identified in that--
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1409.23,1410.016,Electrical failure.
1994.94-286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1425.441,1450.241,"--But Mr. Fried, you concede that if all we ever had here was a notice of proposed rulemaking of the part of 121 that the Ninth Circuit rejected, if all we ever had was that, and the agency never made it a rule, then there would be no argument about preemption, that the States could have their tort law?"
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1450.241,1467.618,"They would not, because there would not have been any occasion for the Ninth Circuit to reach a conclusion on the record as part of the mandated process under the act that such a requirement is a dangerous requirement with which--"
1994.94-286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1467.618,1474.172,So everything really hinges... your argument hinges on the respect that we owe to that Ninth Circuit judgment?
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1474.172,1482.545,--I believe it hinges more on the respect that the agency owed to that Ninth Circuit judgment.
1994.94-286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1509.779,1537.949,"Well, but the agency just... when you say respected it, just did the act that it required, but not for the reason that it stated, and it seems to me that it's important to your case to establish not just that the Ninth Circuit's judgment required the elimination of that regulation, but also that it established the reason for the elimination of the regulation, and that just doesn't track."
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1542.484,1546.637,And that reason is that this requirement--
1994.94-286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1546.637,1547.304,And that is the reason--
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1547.304,1547.62,--is dangerous.
1994.94-286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1547.62,1549.689,--And that is the reason the agency eliminated it?
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1552.891,1563.33,"But the agency is a law-abiding agency, and therefore it must act pursuant to a judgment of a court of law."
1994.94-286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.33,1568.318,It doesn't have to say something is true which it believes is false.
1994.94-286,0,18942,charles_fried,,1578.526,1594.385,"Well, it is quite interesting on this score that the agency consistently has been unable, and in its technical reports, has been unable to show that the Ninth Circuit was wrong."
1994.94-286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1599.122,1600.155,"Very well, Mr. Fried."
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1602.324,1606.943,"Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.94-286,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1755.223,1761.026,"Mr. Gottesman, strictly speaking, that isn't the question that we granted certiorari on."
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1775.719,1777.488,"We do, Your Honor, for two reasons."
1994.94-286,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2249.861,2262.335,"Well, so if there were a Federal performance standard applicable here, is it your position that the savings clause would still preserve this cause of action?"
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2262.335,2264.051,"--Well, we have three... yes."
1994.94-286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2330.646,2341.554,"So if the Federal Government said, there may be no antilock braking system on a truck, everyone would agree that the State cannot have a regulation to the contrary, then?"
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2341.554,2342.254,Absolutely.
1994.94-286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2342.254,2346.941,Could a jury find there would be negligence for not having the antibrake system?
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2346.941,2351.159,"Well, after first saying that's not this case, our strongest position would be yes."
1994.94-286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2353.011,2354.261,Most extreme--
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2354.261,2360.165,"--advanced position, yes, and it would be yes because that is what the plain language of the statute says."
1994.94-286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2360.165,2361.784,"--Well, that's what I wanted to focus on."
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2374.092,2390.184,"Well, I think when you read the language, the language says, compliance will not exempt them from any common law liability, any common law liability, and you read the legislative history of the people who both wrote it and who were the conferees adopting it."
1994.94-286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2395.422,2403.028,But common law liability doesn't necessarily include the formulation of the standard of care.
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2403.028,2407.246,"Well, Your Honor, I think it does--"
1994.94-286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2407.246,2409.182,This is the extreme that we're talking about.
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2409.182,2413.9,"--Well, it is the... I don't... that was the Chief Justice's characterization."
1994.94-286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.9,2417.269,You're... I think you're saying it doesn't necessarily.
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2426.141,2428.059,"Is to have which provision, the savings clause, or--"
1994.94-286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.059,2430.261,--The common law liability provision.
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2430.261,2430.711,--Yes.
1994.94-286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2430.711,2432.178,"Of course, common law liability includes a lot of things."
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2433.897,2434.447,Yes.
1994.94-286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2434.447,2435.915,"--procedures, and all sorts of things."
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2435.915,2437.415,The standards of care are apart--
1994.94-286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2437.415,2447.64,"But since we're dealing with a statute that issues standards, this thing must be addressing common law liability insofar as liability is based on standards, otherwise it's meaningless."
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2447.64,2448.657,"--Well, that's right."
1994.94-286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2448.657,2455.311,"It would be like saying, compliance with the motor vehicle safety standard will not permit a 10-person jury."
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2459.865,2460.615,"Well, it isn't--"
1994.94-286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2460.615,2461.965,So why is that an extreme position?
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2461.965,2465.333,"--Well, as I say, that was not my characterization."
1994.94-286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2539.215,2540.317,"Yes, but let me... can I just interrupt?"
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2557.093,2557.529,--Well--
1994.94-286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2557.529,2558.629,--do you think a State could--
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2558.629,2562.063,"--No, of course they can't have an express prohibition, but a tort action is not."
1994.94-286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2562.063,2563.182,--That's exactly what I thought Justice Kennedy gave you.
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2563.182,2564.132,"Yes... oh, well, I'm sorry."
1994.94-286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2566.467,2567.184,"No, no, no."
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2577.423,2582.41,"I think that is what the plain meaning of the statute says, and there is not an inconsistency."
1994.94-286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2585.262,2586.412,Sure there's an inconsistency.
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2592.266,2593.385,"No, they're not."
1994.94-286,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2606.375,2606.892,But then--
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2606.892,2609.644,"But then they have to compensate the people they hurt, that's all."
1994.94-286,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2609.644,2615.865,"--Well, but it's just... in that case, it would be the jury setting up a standard that is totally in conflict with the Federal law."
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2624.821,2634.279,"Well, there would be a disagreement about standards, but there would not be a conflict in... there would be no threat to the Federal interest, which is what preemption is all about."
1994.94-286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2657.644,2660.596,"But you're inserting, that's not this case."
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2661.046,2665.731,"Yes, repeatedly, every third sentence."
1994.94-286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2672.92,2673.804,Wouldn't it be--
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2673.804,2674.47,There's no express preemption.
1994.94-286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2676.439,2691.131,"--But Mr. Gottesman, on the case that's not this case, wouldn't it be a powerful, strong defense on the part of the manufacturer to say, we had to have this device under Federal compulsion?"
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2691.131,2696.019,"Well, of course, no judge in any State in this Union would let that case get to a jury."
1994.94-286,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2716.147,2717.933,I think I could find some.
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2717.933,2722.837,Yes?
1994.94-286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2726.704,2731.525,That's not this case.
1994.94-286,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2732.008,2735.91,"That's not this case, Your Honor."
1994.94-286,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2737.11,2740.029,"Thank you, Mr. Gottesman."
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2742.398,2755.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2953.937,2974.433,"Mr. Wolfson, I gather from what you've said that you do take the... or, the Government does take the extreme position that there could be a standard in effect, and nonetheless an individual could held liable at common law for not violating that standard for complying with the standard, is that right?"
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2974.433,2981.337,"No, I don't think... I think we would take the position that that should be analyzed as a matter of implied preemption."
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2986.741,2987.124,Right.
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2987.124,2988.158,--size headrest--
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2988.158,2988.576,Right.
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2988.576,3000.068,"--and the State standard of care... if the State sought to essentially premise liability on compliance with a Federal mandate, that would preemptive as a matter of implied conflict preemption."
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3000.068,3000.551,I see.
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3006.638,3009.256,The exception for the common law reaches cases like this.
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3011.24,3013.208,They don't need that for cases like this.
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3020.179,3031.103,"--I think that the Congress put ""the saving act"" because it thought that with... the preemption clause standing by itself might be ambiguous on the point, and so the... and so--"
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3031.103,3034.139,Might be ambiguous on the point of whether what?
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3034.139,3041.209,"--Tort... whether common law liability would be considered a standard and thus preempted under 1392, so the saving clause--"
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3041.209,3042.995,But you say it is preempted.
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3045.18,3057.587,"--It... a standard... a State standard... a State standard when there is a Federal standard in effect, a State prescriptive standard issued by, say, the George Department of Motor Vehicles--"
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3057.587,3058.487,Is preempted.
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3058.487,3058.987,--Would be preempted.
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3064.658,3074.382,"So your answer is, you can, indeed, be held liable in tort for refusing to violate a Federal standard."
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3074.382,3088.357,"As a matter of implied preemption, you cannot be held liable in tort if that liability is premised on compliance with a Federal mandate."
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.357,3092.243,So then you don't think this provision has any effect.
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3092.243,3112.055,"It... well, the provision says, compliance with Federal standard, but if there's a... will not provide a defense to State tort liability, but I think if there's a Federal standard that requires obedience to a specific mandate, like a headrest of a specific size, it isn't really--"
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3112.055,3113.405,There cannot be common law liability.
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3113.405,3113.921,--Right.
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3115.007,3116.757,Then I really don't know what that provision means.
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3117.959,3118.875,"--Well, it--"
1994.94-286,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.875,3121.161,"Well, doesn't it apply in a case of minimum standards?"
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3121.161,3121.627,"--Yes, exactly."
1994.94-286,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3121.627,3124.779,"A State standard, common law standard could be a little tougher."
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3132.367,3135.753,NHTSA perceives no difficulty with that situation.
1994.94-286,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3135.753,3139.972,And I suppose it would apply in the case of an expressly provided option.
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3148.411,3166.556,"Only... there would only be a Federal conflict, a conflict with a Federal... an implied preemption situation if the reason why the option were provided was, as in the airbag case, to preserve a diversity of approaches because NHTSA believed the Safety Act required that."
1994.94-286,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3194.74,3203.396,"This is slightly different from the example you just gave, because here, your position, I take it, is what the agency has done is the equivalent of agency silence."
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3203.396,3204.346,--Yes.
1994.94-286,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3206.848,3208.966,"You're expressly saying nothing, if you will."
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3208.966,3221.357,"That's correct, and I might add, I don't think that that silence takes on a different character just because the standard was vacated in response to the Ninth Circuit's decision in--"
1994.94-286,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3221.357,3223.225,Suppose... sorry.
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3264.119,3268.754,"--I don't think it is this case, but I think even there the tort suit could go forward."
1994.94-286,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3268.754,3269.44,--It could go forward.
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3281.498,3299.625,"In that situation, if the evidence on the rulemaking record was so compelling that NHTSA could have only concluded that the device, the antilock brake device, should be prohibited, then perhaps NHTSA should have issued a standard that prohibited antilock brakes, but--"
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3299.625,3303.744,Maybe Congress doesn't trust State regulators.
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3326.977,3328.912,--I think there are a number of--
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3328.912,3329.612,"--attitude, isn't it?"
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3329.612,3338.517,--I think there are a number of reasonable explanations why Congress drew the distinction between State prescriptive standards and common law liability.
1994.94-286,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3349.392,3361.116,"Or that the manufacturers who lost the battle at the Federal regulatory agency will simply go out and fight it State-by-State before the State regulators and get it reversed, and they didn't want that to happen, but they're not worried about the common law reversing it."
1994.94-286,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3361.116,3365.235,"That's... it's a plausible reason for why Congress might have done it, but--"
1994.94-286,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3365.235,3367.27,"Thank you, Mr. Wolfson."
1994.94-286,3,18942,charles_fried,,3370.056,3393.587,"Mr. Chief Justice, it is entirely correct that we sort certiorari in this Court on the Eleventh Circuit's rule about implied preemption and that was the only matter as to which there was a conflict between the circuits."
1994.94-286,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3568.751,3569.685,"I have just one question, Mr. Fried."
1994.94-286,3,18942,charles_fried,,3576.089,3577.123,Ilsa Petroleum.
1994.94-286,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3594.082,3595.516,"Thank you, Mr. Fried."
