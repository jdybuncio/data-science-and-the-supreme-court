1985.84-836,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,85.373,"Mr. Prahl, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,85.373,88.387,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-836,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,129.418,133.04,Did I understand you to say this crime occurred in 1962?
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,133.04,133.775,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,191.595,202.309,"Mr. Prahl, did the state plead as a defense to the federal habeas action that it was prejudiced in presenting its defense of the action by the passage of time?"
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,202.309,203.575,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.757,219.537,"And, the District Court ruled on that defense?"
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,219.537,220.334,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,223.723,225.674,"And, you have not presented that issue here?"
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,225.674,226.534,No.
1985.84-836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,268.703,273.17,How many years does it take to become harmless?
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,273.17,279.153,"--Your Honor, I don't think the passage of time alone is the sole criterion."
1985.84-836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,279.153,285.853,You were asked why did you drop the time point and you said you dropped it because of the harmless error.
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,297.8,307.547,"Your Honor, in this particular case, the passage of time has indicated that there is no continuing history of discrimination in the county."
1985.84-836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,314.389,316.856,Would that have helped him?
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,316.856,326.29,"Well, Your Honor, we don't think that it is necessarily the case in this type of situation; that the remedy provides specific relief to the Defendant."
1985.84-836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,395.809,399.385,"You say that in the 60's... What was it,--"
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,399.385,400.712,"--1962, that is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,400.712,405.024,"--They were looking for ""black"" jurors?"
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,405.024,410.694,"The trial judge indicate, Your Honor, that he was looking for--"
1985.84-836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,410.694,411.366,"Did he use the word ""black""?"
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,411.366,412.599,"--Pardon me, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,412.599,414.052,"Did he use the word ""black""?"
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,414.052,415.083,"I don't believe he did, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,415.083,418.501,Because nobody else did back in the 60's.
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,418.501,419.017,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,485.21,498.328,"Mr. Attorney General, before you move away from the question of delay, is there any evidence in the record as to whether or not California can retry the Respondent at this time 23 years afterwards?"
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,498.328,503.779,"--Your Honor, we tried to argue harmless error to the District Court."
1985.84-836,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,504.467,505.483,I am not talking about harmless error at this point.
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,535.658,539.829,"--We did not introduce any of that evidence, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,571.628,574.908,"Mr. Prahl, let me put Justice Powell's question another way."
1985.84-836,0,45887,william_george_prahl,,580.327,587.044,"--Well, if the District Court opinion is affirmed, you mean, and the Ninth Circuit opinion is affirmed, Your Honor?"
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,1750.744,1753.243,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1803.676,1812.001,"Would you be here if there had been, maybe not in this grand jury, but in a previous one?"
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,1822.168,1832.617,"I think if there had been some evidence that in the history of the county there had been a black or blacks on the grand jury, I think Hillery would not have a position here today."
1985.84-836,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1913.069,1916.505,In what year was the Supreme Court of California decision?
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,1916.505,1921.206,"The first decision in the California Supreme Court was handed down in 1963, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2154.752,2168.872,Do we know why the evidence from the additional witnesses and a probability analysis was not presented to the state courts by Mr. Hillery?
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,2168.872,2177.119,"Your Honor, in the record of the hearing at the motion to quash... It is a difficult record."
1985.84-836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2217.805,2226.848,"Well, I suppose the burden there was on the Defendant to produce his evidence, is that right or not?"
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,2226.848,2227.598,"--Well, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2237.032,2249.121,"That is your understanding of state law in California in a case of alleged discrimination in grand juror selection, that the burden is on the state to disprove it?"
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,2249.121,2255.869,I think what happens is the court directs the state to present the evidence and in that particular case the state did present evidence.
1985.84-836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2265.161,2272.378,"In California, is there no burden on the part of the Defendant like Mr. Hillery to support the allegation of--"
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,2272.378,2274.985,--I don't know of any law that imposes a burden on him.
1985.84-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2276.126,2284.653,"--Well, he has to allege at least there has never been a black on the grand jury or that the proportion of blacks is completely out of line."
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,2284.653,2285.809,"Yes, he would have to make that allegation."
1985.84-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.809,2291.401,"And, if there is an objection... If there is a denial of those facts, he has got the burden of proving that."
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,2291.401,2291.728,Yes.
1985.84-836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2293.51,2297.352,"So, presumably he did have the burden of proof in California?"
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,2297.352,2300.273,"I believe he would have the burden of moving forward, yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2300.273,2320.499,"And, if a defendant then does not present evidence at the state court level that is crucial and substantial, can the defendant then simply wait until going to federal court later and present that evidence in your view?"
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,2334.571,2338.648,"I don't know of any rule of inexcusable neglect, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2338.648,2341.506,"But, there is a rule of exhaustion certainly."
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,2341.506,2342.208,"Yes, that is correct."
1985.84-836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2342.208,2354.782,"And, I think the rule does extend... Courts have said on occasion that even though the claim is the same, if the evidence adduced in support of it is totally different, then the claim may be unexhausted."
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,2354.782,2357.171,"Yes, that is the way the courts rule."
1985.84-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2400.902,2416.303,"So, if he had been a computer expert himself and in the course of deciding the case had gone back to his office and run his own analysis of the facts that were before him in the record, that would really be no different than what happened here?"
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,2416.303,2416.537,Yes.
1985.84-836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2448.492,2459.02,"Well, Mr. Tedmon, I thought there was also some rather significant additional witness testimony over and above the probability analysis."
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,2459.942,2460.411,Yes.
1985.84-836,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2903.86,2909.983,When did Hillery first make his objection to the composition of the grand jury?
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,2909.983,2913.076,He made it before he was ever brought to trial.
1985.84-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3018.377,3023.437,When are you going to tell us about why this shouldn't be held harmless error?
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3023.437,3023.797,"Oh, I am sorry."
1985.84-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3025.219,3025.797,That is the issue.
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3025.797,3026.405,--That is the issue.
1985.84-836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3051.77,3061.095,What case or cases in this Court squarely hold that this kind of discrimination can never be harmless error?
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3063.25,3066.374,--I don't think it says that.
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3099.032,3101.156,Mr. Tedmon?
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3101.156,3101.703,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3101.703,3109.56,"Along the line of questions Justice White has been asking you, what is the reasonable rationale for the per se rule you argue for?"
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3117.462,3117.947,Yes.
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3123.382,3130.895,"Yes, but you are not suggesting that constitutional rights can never be found to be harmless error, are you?"
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3145.154,3147.044,--That is correct.
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3147.044,3153.011,Do you think this is the only constitutional question with respect to the integrity of the judicial process?
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3153.011,3155.978,"I am not sure I understand the question, Justice--"
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3155.978,3167.802,"Well, your position is there can never be harmless error rule because otherwise the integrity of the judicial process would be put at issue."
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3167.802,3173.144,"--Yes, in this type of a case, in a grand jury discrimination case."
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3173.144,3181.842,My question was is the grand jury discrimination the only situation where you would make that same argument?
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3184.295,3184.982,I don't think so.
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3185.685,3188.433,--You would make it any constitutional error?
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3188.433,3193.151,"--When the Constitution gets violated, it is very... To me--"
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3193.151,3197.477,"So, the integrity of the judicial process is at stake?"
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3197.477,3199.383,--The integrity of the whole Constitution is at stake.
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3199.383,3200.289,Have you read Chapman?
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3200.289,3202.319,Chapman versus?
1985.84-836,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3202.319,3206.551,Chapman against California.
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3209.582,3210.441,"Oh, yes, I have, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3210.441,3211.551,Long after Cassel.
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3212.549,3216.907,"Well, it held that in certain situations there could be harmless error."
1985.84-836,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3216.907,3218.188,Even constitutional error.
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3218.188,3219.562,Even a constitutional error.
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3219.562,3225.935,Even constitutional error and the error in that case was a comment by a trial judge on the failure of the defendant to take the stand.
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3237.32,3240.1,"Exactly, Your Honor, and I understand."
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3240.1,3241.272,Do you disagree with Chapman?
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3241.272,3248.3,I tend to disagree on a constitutional right has been violated.
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3248.3,3251.612,"When any constitutional right has been violated, it ought to be a per se rule."
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3251.612,3254.954,"Yes, I think so, but the courts don't hold that way necessarily."
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3254.954,3255.72,The courts don't agree with you.
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3255.72,3258.625,"The problem comes out this way, as I view it, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3297.062,3301.748,"But, the fairness of the trial in this case was not affected in any way by--"
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3301.748,3302.076,--No.
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3308.417,3315.367,--Are you familiar with our fairly recent decision in Strickland that involved whether or not counsel had been ineffective?
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3315.367,3315.959,Yes.
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3317.756,3317.991,Yes.
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3317.991,3318.522,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3318.522,3334.157,"And, there, as I recall, the Court expressly said that even if counsel had been extremely ineffective in substance of denial with the right to counsel, that still the defendant would have to show prejudice."
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3337.796,3338.343,That is correct.
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3338.343,3341.139,Can you think of any more important constitutional right than the right to counsel?
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3341.139,3347.871,I would think not.
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3347.871,3348.403,You would think not.
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3348.403,3350.807,"I would think that is a very fundamental right, Your Honor, yes."
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3350.807,3359.523,"So, the rationale that you rely on is the integrity of the judicial process has never been uniformly applied by this Court."
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3359.523,3362.474,I missed that again.
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3362.474,3371.596,"Your rationale, integrity of the judicial process, has never been uniformly adopted as a reason for not applying the harmless rule by this Court."
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3382.139,3384.7,I think--
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3384.7,3389.105,I will ask you one other question while you are thinking.
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3400.725,3401.694,--I think so.
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3401.694,3419.483,"What do you think the public will think of the courts in this case after 23 years, in view of the fact this man has been unquestionably found guilty of a brutal murder, and you are here arguing today that because of integrity of the judicial process we should let him off?"
1985.84-836,1,20211,clifford_earl_tedmon,,3419.483,3422.841,I don't know that he would be let off.
1985.84-836,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3422.841,3423.216,That is your argument.
