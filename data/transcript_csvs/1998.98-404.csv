1998.98-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.249,"We'll hear argument now in No. 98-404, the Department of Commerce v. the United States House of Representatives, and William Jefferson Clinton v. Matthew Glavin."
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,12.07,14.912,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,76.231,81.466,"General Waxman, I understand there are... there are two kinds of statistical sampling involved here."
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,100.418,102.789,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,148.29,155.867,"Well, that initial enumeration is first based on responses and then based on follow up interviews?"
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,155.867,156.955,--That's correct.
1998.98-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,213.615,219.029,"But when you say up to 90 percent, there... there is going to be an intentional effort not to do 100 percent?"
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,219.029,233.268,"No, there... Justice Scalia, there is an intentional effort in this census to obtain census information from every household that is known to exist by mailings, by a Be Counted program, by telephone, by the Internet."
1998.98-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,277.227,281.82,Let... let's... let's stay on the question of describing this... this procedure.
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,281.82,282.188,"--Yes, sir."
1998.98-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,376.462,380.223,So... so you will get the initial returns from the census.
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,391.333,391.64,--Yes.
1998.98-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,406.47,409.131,How can you know in advance that there are inaccuracies?
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,409.131,424.823,"Justice... Chief Justice Rehnquist, there... every effort to enumerate the population, from the 1790 Census until now, has produced only an estimate of the true population totals in each State."
1998.98-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,444.146,454.562,"But how can you know... but if... if you have this census, which is a very... and it's inaccurate, it doesn't reflect the, quote, true number, how... how do you know what the, quote, true number, close quote, is?"
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,454.562,466.89,"--Well, the... I recall that was the... that was the question that was asked of my predecessor in City of New York v. Wisconsin, as the subject of an explanation in the Court's opinion in that case."
1998.98-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,490.014,491.755,"Well, why do we need... why do we need a census then?"
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,491.755,503.855,"Well, because there... there is a requirement in the Constitution that every 10 years the respective number of persons in each State be determined."
1998.98-404,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,518.894,523.948,"Well, most people would think that actual enumeration meant a count."
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,529.221,540.118,"--Well, I think it depends how you define... actual enumer... most people would think actual enumeration means a count in the sense of determining the number of persons."
1998.98-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.962,567.216,"And you would call that an actual enumeration; you sort of scan Camden Yards and say, it's the best I can do, it's 25,000, you would call that an actual enumeration?"
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,567.216,575.56,"--Well, the words ""the actual enumeration"" I don't think would come up very likely in the context of Camden Yards."
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,625.846,626.314,What... what--
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,626.314,627.876,--they very... I'm sorry.
1998.98-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.876,632.161,"--What, in your judgment, is excluded by the adjective ""actual""?"
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,637.063,638.233,"Well, the... the--"
1998.98-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.233,646.968,"If... if... if estimation by statistics or anything else is not excluded, what is excluded, rolling the dice or... or what?"
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,646.968,648.35,"--Well, we know for--"
1998.98-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,648.35,649.652,"It says ""actual enumeration""."
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,654.394,658.785,"--""Actual"" was defined then as it is now as that which comprises action."
1998.98-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.234,675.208,"You say it means not a phony enumeration, not a false enumeration; is that... is that all it means?"
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,675.208,676.069,Well--
1998.98-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,676.069,677.459,It has to be a real enumeration?
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,677.459,681.622,"--You see, that is our understanding of what it means."
1998.98-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,685.754,689.347,"But for that we would have thought a phony enumeration would do, had they not put in ""actual""?"
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,689.347,689.507,I don't think so.
1998.98-404,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,710.49,710.661,All right.
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,728.452,729.193,--That's--
1998.98-404,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,729.193,733.796,"Isn't that a plausible explanation for why the word ""actual"" is not redundant here?"
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,733.796,734.065,--Yes.
1998.98-404,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,751.398,776.613,"General Waxman, do you mean actual enumeration is to be contrasted with what the article says, that is, actual enumeration in comparison to three from Mass... three from New Hampshire... was it... eight from Massachusetts, 10 from Virginia... that's the comparison for the actual enumeration in place of what was going... the enumeration going in?"
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,776.613,777.344,--That's right.
1998.98-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,847.814,856.777,"Well, was there much... much in the way of an option or alternatives in 1787 to conducting a door to door census?"
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,856.777,861.981,"There certainly were not the options that are available now in many, many respects."
1998.98-404,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,869.166,871.279,Do we know how the early censuses were taken?
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,871.279,874.962,--We... we have a very good record of how the early censuses were taken.
1998.98-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.06,937.15,They had... they had estimation techniques then--
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,937.15,937.571,--They--
1998.98-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,937.571,938.713,--as we have it now.
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,947.708,953.222,"--That... well, it prob... apparently, according to the records of the Convention, was somewhat cruder than that."
1998.98-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,966.342,969.314,"But you began... you began with some estimation, right?"
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,969.314,969.801,--Justice Scalia--
1998.98-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.801,975.745,"And the difference now is that we're better at estimating than we were then, and that makes estimation okay?"
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,975.745,983.802,"--The... the point here... I think that there is... it's easy to say, you know, they talked about an actual enumeration, not an actual estimate."
1998.98-404,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1015.925,1017.254,"I would think just the opposite, frankly."
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1041.701,1047.644,"Well, I... with all respect, I don't know how likely it would have been to have been used then, Justice Scalia."
1998.98-404,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1078.875,1080.958,Is that... is that what we're interested in for purposes of apportionment?
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1089.582,1094.085,--The... the... under Section 141(a) of the--
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1094.085,1094.445,--Yeah--
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1094.445,1096.077,--the Constitution doesn't speak to--
1998.98-404,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1096.077,1096.296,--No.
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1108.715,1109.546,--Correct.
1998.98-404,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1109.546,1109.866,All right.
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1130.74,1131.11,Your... your--
1998.98-404,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1131.11,1137.494,It's... it's only if... it's only if you... you get differences in the errors that it begins to make a difference.
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1137.494,1138.354,--If I understand your point--
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1138.354,1138.704,Yeah.
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1138.704,1153.404,"--it's precisely the same basis for Secretary Mosbacher's determination in not... in 1991, not to adjust the physical enumeration with the results of a post enumeration survey."
1998.98-404,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1179.723,1179.883,All right.
1998.98-404,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1195.972,1197.474,That... that is precisely the point.
1998.98-404,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2425.215,2429.056,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-404,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2524.429,2556.018,"Ms. Mahoney, what is your response to the... I guess to the objection that if this is a sufficient basis for standing here, the Congress, as a practical matter, can place any obligation on some agency of the executive branch to provide it with information on a concrete subject; and if it ends up not liking the... the information that it gets, in effect, can sue the executive branch on matters that certainly impinge on the respective policy responsibilities of the two branches?"
1998.98-404,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2559.571,2561.403,"I don't think so, Your Honor, for several reasons."
1998.98-404,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3767.427,3778.395,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-404,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3803.541,3806.594,You say 90 percent of the households.
1998.98-404,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3812.568,3813.357,"--Both, Your Honor."
1998.98-404,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3822.343,3826.718,"Well, I guess they'll give the forms to every household."
1998.98-404,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3826.718,3828.237,"--Yes, that's correct, Your Honor, and they--"
1998.98-404,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3828.237,3830.808,So they're not trying to get 90 percent.
1998.98-404,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3839.683,3841.656,"--Precisely, Justice O'Connor."
1998.98-404,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3861.369,3863.249,Let me just clarify one thing.
1998.98-404,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3871.046,3872.048,I... no--
1998.98-404,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3872.048,3877.42,"I mean, say they... in other words they... on the first go around they tried to get the 100 percent instead of the 90."
1998.98-404,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3877.42,3877.619,--Yes.
1998.98-404,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3877.619,3880.042,"But they failed to get it, and they only got half of what they try."
1998.98-404,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3880.042,3880.71,Right.
1998.98-404,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3880.71,3882.943,And then... could they then use sampling?
1998.98-404,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3883.484,3886.056,"As to the ICM, that is true."
1998.98-404,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5055.913,5057.135,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-404,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5085.662,5087.044,"That is not a challenge here, is it?"
1998.98-404,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5087.044,5087.783,Excuse me?
1998.98-404,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5087.783,5090.347,"I mean, that may well be, but it's not under challenge here, is it?"
1998.98-404,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5090.347,5098.362,"It's not under challenge here, but it's highly relevant, Justice Scalia, to the question of whether what has been going on and what the Constitution requires is a ""head count""."
1998.98-404,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5098.362,5099.423,Since 1940.
1998.98-404,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5099.423,5100.603,Since 1940.
1998.98-404,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5101.184,5101.965,"Not much of a tradition, either."
1998.98-404,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5101.965,5129.032,"--Similarly, it's also highly relevant to the meaning of the 1976 amendment that gave the Secretary the authority under 141(a) to use whatever means he thought desirable, including sampling, that in 1970 there was not just imputation but statistical sampling in two different instances that added 1.5 million people to the initial enumeration total."
1998.98-404,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5197.675,5201.198,"Now, but you're not using it to increase the accuracy."
1998.98-404,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5216.019,5252.772,"--Justice Scalia, the Census Bureau and the National Academy of Science panels and the GAO all agree that the Bureau's method for conducting the nonresponse follow up, which uses some statistical sampling, will be at least as accurate as if they had done physical nonresponse follow up, and it will increase the overall accuracy of the census because it will be conducted in 5 weeks rather than 14 weeks and permit the ICM part of the process to be conducted with more... better trained people, and at a time that is closer to Census Day."
1998.98-404,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5255.676,5256.357,"Thank you, General Waxman--"
