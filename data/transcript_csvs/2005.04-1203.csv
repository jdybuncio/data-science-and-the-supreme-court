2005.04-1203,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.358,"We'll hear argument first in United States versus Georgia, and Goodman versus Georgia."
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,7.545,11.075,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.611,132.275,"Can it... with respect to the reasonableness aspect, in Turner versus Safley, we said prison administrators have a good deal of latitude, in the prison context, in order to maintain order."
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,145.378,147.019,"Absolutely, Justice O'Connor."
2005.04-1203,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,175.43,175.524,Are you--
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,175.524,175.868,--I think it--
2005.04-1203,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,175.868,175.946,--suggesting--
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,175.946,176.805,"--applies, a fortiori."
2005.04-1203,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,177.43,177.727,--Are you--
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,177.727,178.305,--Chief Justice.
2005.04-1203,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,178.305,185.818,"--suggesting that the ADA does not add to the burdens of the State officials, it just simply tracks what's already required under Turner?"
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,185.818,227.269,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't... I don't... I'm not up here today saying there's no prophylaxis at all with respect to Title II, but I think it is proportional and congruent, and I think the prophylactic gap between what the Constitution protects and what Title II protects is relatively narrow in the prison context, both because if you think about one set of claims, the Turner claims, much of that deference can be brought in under the reasonable modification standard; and then, if you think of the other class of cases, those involving deliberate indifference, I think in those class of cases, this is... the prison context is one of the rare contexts in which the State is under an affirmative obligation to provide accommodations to the medical needs of inmates, including disabled inmates."
2005.04-1203,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,235.391,241.92,"Under Turner, one of the considerations that can be taken into account are the budgetary limitations of State officials."
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,244.09,245.762,I think it certainly could.
2005.04-1203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,262.349,266.535,"Of course, all of the concerns you've mentioned could be taken care of by injunctive relief."
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,268.269,273.423,"Well, I think damages are an important aspect of the remedial scheme, Justice Kennedy."
2005.04-1203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,290.494,307.378,"Well, but if we held the Act was applicable for injunctive relief, it would... it would be, because I'm... the pert part of your argument is that you could have a attorneys fees and triple damages where trial attorneys levy against the State treasury, which is... which is what the Eleventh Amendment is largely concerned with."
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,309.814,314.095,"--Well, I'm not sure about the treble damages, but certainly compensatory damages would be available."
2005.04-1203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,322.045,327.339,"I know they're not available under Title II, but, I mean, as a constitutional matter, there's certainly nothing barring them, based on what you've told us so far."
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,327.339,332.947,"--Well, I think punitive damages would be a harder case, in terms of proportional incongruence."
2005.04-1203,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,381.941,416.756,"General Clement, in two respects, it... I think you have addressed the cost concern by comparing, in your brief, the Federal experience, which is subject to these controls, and you said it wasn't an inordinate expense, but you also pointed out that every State prison system is subject to the Rehabilitation Act, because they get Federal funds."
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,427.392,429.515,"No, Justice Ginsburg, we don't think so."
2005.04-1203,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,470.421,470.842,And the--
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,470.842,471.342,--two provisions.
2005.04-1203,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.342,474.717,--damage remedies available under the Rehabilitation Act is--
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,474.717,475.31,I'm--
2005.04-1203,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,475.31,476.434,--Damages are available?
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,476.434,477.965,"--Yes, they are, as to the States."
2005.04-1203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.965,478.668,General--
2005.04-1203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,478.668,479.292,But this--
2005.04-1203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,479.292,491.538,"--Clement, I'm interested in another statute that has applicability in the circumstances, and that's Section 1983 and the Prison Litigation Reform Act."
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,507.187,509.546,"No, I don't think that is right, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,575.676,576.878,May I ask you to comment on this?
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,594.308,596.902,Because of the lack of the Commerce Clause nexus?
2005.04-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,597.479,597.807,"Well, it--"
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,597.807,598.713,"--concern, Justice Stevens?"
2005.04-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.713,603.585,"--the whole basis for the constitutionality of the statute, I think, is the Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,603.585,609.865,"Well, it was... when it was originally enacted, Justice Stevens, it was supported by both the Commerce Clause and, of course the--"
2005.04-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,609.865,611.77,"That's true of Title II, as well as Title I?"
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,611.77,615.581,"--That is... that's true, the statute generally... and it's true of Title II."
2005.04-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,628.779,629.185,Right.
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,629.185,639.93,"--telling that, if you go back to the Government's brief in Yeskey, when we were dealing with constitutional challenges to the application of Title II to prisons, the Government focused all its energy on defending it as valid Section 5 legislation--"
2005.04-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,639.93,640.337,Right.
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,640.337,642.883,--and dealt with the Commerce Clause in a footnote.
2005.04-1203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,650.879,657.892,"So, what I'm suggesting is that it is not merely a matter of damages that's at issue here, but the entire validity of Title II."
2005.04-1203,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,657.892,660.017,"We agree with that, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-1203,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,670.215,670.668,"Thank you, General."
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,674.229,681.93,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.301,736.781,Do those violations that you allude to... is there an extensive record of violations by the State of Georgia?
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,736.781,738.672,There is not.
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,743.592,744.311,"Well, you're--"
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,744.311,744.811,--of constitutional violations--
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.811,745.186,--But the money--
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,745.186,745.78,--by Georgia.
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,745.78,748.748,"--is not coming from the Nation, it's coming from the State of Georgia."
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,754.98,760.182,"Well, I mean, of course, in this case, the lower court said that there might have been a constitutional violation that allowed that claim to proceed in the--"
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.182,761.056,"No, no, my--"
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,761.056,761.509,--companion--
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,761.509,768.569,"--I mean a record... a record that would have justified applying, against the State of Georgia, prophylactic measures."
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,768.569,773.505,"--Well, we think the prophylactic measures are justified by the nationwide record, just as in this Court's case--"
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,773.505,777.143,Even against people who played no part in that nationwide record.
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,777.143,781.718,"--Well, that's this Court's cases on prophylactic nationwide legislation, absolutely."
2005.04-1203,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,795.777,812.942,"This is... it's relevant to the... I just saw these as... I... just by chance, it... one of the cases in the SG's brief involved Georgia juvenile facilities, where mentally ill patients were restrained, hit, shackled, put in restraint chairs for hours, sprayed with pepper spray."
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,812.942,813.332,"--Well, I think--"
2005.04-1203,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,813.332,816.628,And that seemed to be one instance coming out of Georgia.
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,816.628,817.097,--I think that's right.
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,817.33,820.172,But was that before or after the enactment of this statute?
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,820.172,821.703,"--I believe that was pre-ADA, Your Honor."
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.703,822.015,Yes.
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,822.015,827.076,But I think that the point... the point is that the record of constitutional violations here is a nationwide record.
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,838.931,839.337,Well--
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,839.337,840.134,--in final adjudications--
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.134,841.149,--I'm looking at the--
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,841.149,841.633,--constitutional violations.
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,841.633,856.971,"--at the chart in one of the amicus briefs, which shows that there are, for Georgia... and it lists all the States... for Georgia, zero arguable State violations prior to the Act."
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,856.971,859.687,"Well, I think that's... I mean, I think that's because they exclude--"

2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,860.906,861.187,--Well--
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,861.187,861.687,--consideration.
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,861.687,862.749,--State and local violations.
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,862.749,863.234,Right.
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,863.234,867.372,But State and local units don't enjoy the sovereign immunity of the State.
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,867.372,868.278,The... I mean--
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,868.278,868.512,You--
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,868.512,868.997,--you know--
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,868.997,870.231,--don't need this Act to sue them.
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,870.231,875.604,"--Well, I would say, in Georgia, of course, State and... of course, local facilities are arms of the State in Georgia."
2005.04-1203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,899.219,900.282,May I ask you this?
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,915.494,931.3,"In determining whether the evidence before Congress was sufficient, I think, you know, this Court has said... I think the standard comes from City of Boerne... it's the congruence and proportionality test, but it recognizes that Congress has to have a great deal of leeway in determining where the line between enforcement and substantive change in the law lies."
2005.04-1203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,944.42,946.779,"Yes, I understand your view is that, whatever the standard is, you win."
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,952.246,967.223,"--Well, as I said, I think the... I do think that the proper standard should be the City of Boerne standard of congruence and proportionality, exercised with the kind of deference that this Court said in Boerne, which I think this Court adopted in Lane, to the factfinding capabilities of the... of the... of the Congress."
2005.04-1203,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,967.223,975.892,"I understand your submission... and that's what I heard from the Solicitor General, as well... on the difference between enforcement and the substantive right."
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,984.639,987.402,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think there is clearly a difference."
2005.04-1203,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1006.364,1007.176,But I'm just wondering if that's--
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1007.176,1007.692,--constitutional violation.
2005.04-1203,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1007.692,1017.078,"--a reasonable reading of the ADA, which I had always understood to be a significant change in... in terms of what rights are available to the disabled."

2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1049.065,1049.424,--these concerns.
2005.04-1203,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1049.424,1058.828,"--One concern is that, in the prison situation, the prison is exerting control over all aspects of the prisoner's daily life."
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1078.725,1080.443,"Well, I think there are two sides to that coin."
2005.04-1203,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1121.489,1134.421,"Mr. Bagenstos, on this point, do we have any figures on what... I guess it's the Rehabilitation Act that applies to the Federal Prisons... do we have any figures on... you know, on what that has cost in required accommodations?"
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1134.421,1135.327,"--You know, I don't know the figures for that."
2005.04-1203,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1145.262,1145.527,Yes.

2005.04-1203,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1149.712,1150.181,"Well, yes, that's right."
2005.04-1203,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1150.181,1151.197,--Clause legislation.
2005.04-1203,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1151.197,1151.447,Yes.
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1151.931,1152.431,--That's true.
2005.04-1203,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1202.536,1208.596,Why is it so clear that damages are necessary and that equitable relief shouldn't suffice?
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1209.267,1209.595,Well--
2005.04-1203,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1209.595,1219.982,"--it's puzzling... it's puzzling to me, the notion that trial attorneys and their clients can levy upon the funds in State treasuries under the Eleventh Amendment."
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1222.402,1223.637,"--Well, a couple of points about that."
2005.04-1203,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1239.411,1243.753,"Well, where you say Section 1983 failed, the ADA could allow equitable remedies."

2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.026,1265.37,Why don't--
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1265.37,1265.916,--think that--
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.916,1268.025,--Why don't you need it for 1983 violations?
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1268.025,1268.883,--But--
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1268.883,1270.852,Constitutional violations.
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1272.241,1273.116,"--Well, there--"
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1273.116,1277.255,--but actual constitutional violations by the prisons under 1983--
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1277.255,1277.552,--I think it--
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1277.552,1283.862,"--that don't happen to relate to the handicapped and, thus, are not covered by this legislation."
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1285.612,1293.345,"--Well, you know, I think that the... with respect to constitutional violations that might not relate to people with disabilities, you know, that's something Congress could certainly consider in other legislation."
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.195,1359.707,"Well, wait, but... you know, in 1983, when you exhaust your prison remedies, the prison fixes what was wrong, and that's the end of it."
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1368.563,1369.172,"--Well, I think--"
2005.04-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1369.172,1377.825,"--mean, the prison-remedy thing is... the only thing it does is make it take a longer time to get to court, but it does the prison no good."
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1380.075,1397.661,"--Well, I think that, of course, the prison can reduce its damages liability, and, of course, where we have a continuing violation after exhaustion, which is what... when people file these lawsuits, when they have continuing problems, like Mr. Goodman alleges were continuing problems in his case... we will have cases where we have very much... very likely to have deliberate indifference."
2005.04-1203,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1502.15,1503.978,"Thank you, Counsel."
2005.04-1203,1,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,1503.978,1504.414,--Okay.
2005.04-1203,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1506.851,1511.942,Mr. Castanias.
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1511.942,1514.347,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-1203,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1535.402,1541.869,"But was there... there was a reporter who was one of the disabled people, I think, wasn't there, in Tennessee versus Lane?"
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1541.869,1542.962,--I believe that's correct--
2005.04-1203,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1542.962,1543.227,And so--
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1543.227,1543.696,--Your Honor.
2005.04-1203,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1543.696,1546.96,--what is the right that that reporter has that's specific to courthouses?
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1546.96,1553.347,"As I understand it, Your Honor, from reading the opinion, that right was the specific right to access the courts."
2005.04-1203,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1557.128,1559.345,"Well, was there any problem of that in Tennessee versus Lane?"
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1573.715,1583.102,"--It's the right of access to courts, specifically, that was the context that was... that was created for purpose of the as-applied analysis in Lane."
2005.04-1203,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1614.198,1614.62,"Well, your--"
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1614.62,1615.088,--have a--
2005.04-1203,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1615.088,1625.881,"--your friends on the other side say that's not a big deal, because the ADA looks only to reasonable accommodations; you can take all those factors into account; and presumably the lower courts would."
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1633.206,1641.734,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we respectfully, but strenuously, disagree with that submission, and I'll give you a very good example of what they're not talking about here."
2005.04-1203,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1657.742,1663.616,Have Courts of Appeals approved those determinations?
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1663.616,1676.782,"I'm not aware, Justice Ginsburg, of any Court of Appeals that has ruled on that yet, but I am aware of two District Court cases... I could give you the names of them... where summary judgment was denied, and a trial was given to the inmate."
2005.04-1203,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1679.703,1690.182,"And how many has it... in the District Courts, how many have been rejected when it's something like television or recreation?"
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1690.182,1699.741,"--Justice Ginsburg, without making any representations that I am going to canvas the universe on this, I have not seen a case where the District Court has rejected a trial in that respect."
2005.04-1203,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1704.412,1705.161,"Well, before you do that--"
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1705.161,1705.442,--Sure.
2005.04-1203,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1705.442,1717.718,"--as I understand it, and as the Solicitor General confirmed, you are subject to the Rehabilitation Act, where the substantive scope is the same."
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1735.492,1740.521,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't have any data on that, and we haven't... we don't have any in our brief."
2005.04-1203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1747.222,1747.629,But do you--
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1747.629,1748.082,--an opportunity--
2005.04-1203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1748.082,1748.691,--agree that--
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1748.691,1748.941,--to pull that together.
2005.04-1203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1748.941,1755.736,--the Rehab Act contains the same essential requirements as ADA?
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1755.736,1762.437,"Well, the Rehabilitation Act is a little different than the ADA, but it certainly is protective of many of the same rights."
2005.04-1203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1766.06,1771.996,And you agree that it applies at least where the States are accepting Federal money for the prison?
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1771.996,1784.084,"--Well, as I understand it, Justice O'Connor, the Spending Clause power can be hived down on a program-by-program basis, not just as whether the State itself is receiving it."
2005.04-1203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1787.63,1793.597,Does it apply in the prison in this case... the Rehab Act?
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1793.597,1797.203,"--I don't know the answer to that, as I stand here, Justice O'Connor."
2005.04-1203,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1797.203,1805.576,"Mr. Schaerr, who's going to be representing some States as amici, will presumably have better information on that subject."
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1805.576,1807.56,I--
2005.04-1203,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1807.56,1813.87,"In your point of view, would it help if the Court said... I guess it would, but I... in order to get rid of this problem, if the Court said,"
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1843.717,1850.199,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I think you're right to say that, except that that's not what the Act says."
2005.04-1203,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1851.121,1852.963,"I thought it said ""reasonableness""."
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1852.963,1869.739,"--That's exactly right, and that... and the reasonable... the reasonable-accommodation or reasonable-modification standard of the ADA, both generally and specifically in Title II, imposes an affirmative burden on the States, which is very much unlike the rational-basis test of Cleburne."
2005.04-1203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1932.073,1933.416,Is that case cited somewhere?
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1933.416,1933.713,--It is.
2005.04-1203,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1974.477,2003.653,"But maybe in the prison setting, the lower courts would pay some attention to the Court's recent decision in Cutter against Wilkinson, where the Court made it very clear that a high level of deference... even dealing with a strict-scrutiny standard for religious freedom... that a high level of deference would be paid to prison administrators' judgment of what safety and discipline requires inside a prison."
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2008.276,2011.151,--You--
2005.04-1203,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.151,2012.399,We could say that--
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2012.399,2012.915,--But you--
2005.04-1203,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.915,2013.602,--in this opinion.
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2015.632,2017.695,"--You could... I mean, you could absolutely say it."
2005.04-1203,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2025.473,2026.27,Do you think that the--
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2026.27,2027.035,--and with the ADEA--
2005.04-1203,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2027.035,2036.592,"--that if the prison explained what their practices were, in terms of the needs of security, that a lower court will then say,"
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2045.464,2054.382,"--Well, I'm... I... Justice Ginsburg, were... if this Court were to uphold the damages remedy in this case, this would be what the States would be left to argue."
2005.04-1203,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2087.806,2088.103,It's interesting--
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2088.103,2088.868,--type claims.
2005.04-1203,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2088.868,2092.476,"--that you cite that case, in terms of Justice Scalia's remark,"
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2107.861,2111.72,"That's exactly right, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-1203,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2124.307,2124.557,But if you think--
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2124.557,2125.057,--basis test.
2005.04-1203,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2125.057,2133.912,"--if you think of the... any conceivable basis... doesn't even have to be offered if the... if it's, indeed, the rational-basis test."
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2151.655,2155.936,"I think that the Tennessee Solicitor General Moore, at the end of the Lane argument, said,"
2005.04-1203,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2163.135,2180.909,"Mr. Castanias, suppose the Court agrees with you that the response here is not proportionate, and, hence, that the prophylactic aspects of this statute are invalid."
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2209.102,2212.647,"Well, I think, Your Honor, there are two answers to that."
2005.04-1203,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.895,2218.723,It doesn't lie damages here.
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2220.69,2221.565,--Absolutely.

2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2223.096,2225.313,You can get it against State officers acting--

2005.04-1203,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2422.703,2422.922,--Yes.
2005.04-1203,2,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2422.922,2437.136,"--say to you that I think, first of all, the First Amendment right that was at issue there was the general right that's possessed by the public to attend court proceedings, not just a right that was inherent in the newspaper or the... a right that was prophylactically being exercised there."
2005.04-1203,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2493.456,2498.985,"Well, presumably, that's because the prisoners don't have a lot of choice as to which accommodations they're going to select from."

2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2743.089,2749.15,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-1203,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2841.44,2842.049,May I just--
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2842.049,2842.564,--the State's sovereignty.
2005.04-1203,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2842.564,2843.721,--be sure I understand this point?
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2843.721,2843.986,Yes.
2005.04-1203,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.986,2856.636,"Are you, in fact, arguing that the statute might be... I know you don't agree with it... might be proportionate and congruent with respect to all of its prohibitions, but, to the extent it provides for a damage remedy, then it crosses the line?"
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2856.636,2867.195,"I do believe that the statute could be invalidated on that ground alone, but I don't think the Court needs to do that, because I think it's clearly not congruent with constitutional requirements."
2005.04-1203,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2868.086,2868.647,But--
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2868.647,2869.429,--four reasons for that.
2005.04-1203,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2869.429,2875.364,"--But is that... it... because it has a damage remedy, or would it be equally noncongruent without the damage remedy?"
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2876.02,2876.27,I--
2005.04-1203,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.27,2879.815,--I'm following up on Justice Kennedy's question to your colleague.
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2879.815,2889.28,"--Well, the way... the way I would view it is that the damage remedy is disproportionate to Congress's legitimate goals in this case, for a couple of reasons."
2005.04-1203,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2935.449,2936.137,Mr.--
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2936.137,2936.947,"--I said, I think there are four reasons for that."
2005.04-1203,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2936.947,2947.569,"--Mr. Schaerr, before you go on, may I just ask you one question on the point that you made... and you made it in the brief... about the failure to establish a... some kind of a history of unconstitutional action in this particular State?"
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2961.782,2976.042,"Well, City of Boerne and other courts... other decisions of this Court say that, to be a valid exercise of Congress's Section 5 authority, it has to be a response to a record of constitutional violations."
2005.04-1203,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2976.042,2976.682,"Right, but Congress--"
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2976.682,2977.557,And it's hard for me to--
2005.04-1203,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2977.557,2981.899,--but Congress normally operates on a... on a national scale--
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2981.899,2982.211,--True.
2005.04-1203,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2982.211,2984.553,"--so that, I mean, we... I guess, we would normally say,"
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2999.532,3007.95,"No, I'm not claiming that Congress necessarily has to make the record, but I believe the record has to have been created before Congress acts; otherwise, the--"
2005.04-1203,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3007.95,3008.294,"So, it could be done--"
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3008.294,3008.513,--legislation isn't--
2005.04-1203,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3008.513,3008.732,--it could be done--
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3008.732,3008.966,--a response--
2005.04-1203,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3008.966,3010.732,"--in the litigation of this case, then."
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3014.792,3020.056,"--No, I... I don't think the record in this case would satisfy it, because this... because--"
2005.04-1203,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3020.056,3022.617,"No, but my question is, Where does the record have to be made?"
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3035.767,3044.842,"--Well, this Court's decisions suggest that the record has to at least have been within Congress's awareness at the time the statute was passed."
2005.04-1203,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3044.842,3048.732,"So that Congress could have known this, whether they specifically adverted to it, or not."
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3050.481,3052.059,I think that's correct.
2005.04-1203,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3132.386,3133.525,And I'm saying this to help you.
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3135.884,3137.305,Okay.
2005.04-1203,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3137.305,3140.554,"Even if they're bad, why aren't the other ones good?"
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3140.554,3158.734,"Well, in order to abrogate the State's sovereign immunity, there has to have been a valid exercise of Congress's power, and there has to be a statute that represents a valid exercise of that power; otherwise, there's no basis for subjecting the States to liability."
2005.04-1203,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3252.461,3253.539,"Well, why isn't all that true of Lane?"
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3299.693,3304.268,"--Well, I think it... one of the ways is the one... is the one I just mentioned a... mentioned a minute ago."
2005.04-1203,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3308.111,3308.282,You mean--
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3308.282,3308.486,--the Court--
2005.04-1203,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3308.486,3309.017,--beyond a--
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3309.017,3309.298,--to be--
2005.04-1203,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3309.298,3311.079,"--the average public, you had a constitutional right?"
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3314.454,3315.14,"--Well, I--"
2005.04-1203,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3315.14,3318.639,"The average person could have brought a lawsuit, a person in a wheelchair, and said,"
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3329.9,3339.662,"--Well, I'm not sure the claim... I'm not sure, Justice Breyer, that the claim of the person who wanted access to the courthouse to serve as a reporter was necessary to the result in Lane in all of that."
2005.04-1203,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3339.662,3339.958,Ah.
2005.04-1203,3,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3349.158,3353.655,"I think that would be one way of understanding it, though not the only way."
2005.04-1203,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3354.233,3355.218,"Thank you, Mr. Schaerr."
2005.04-1203,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3359.654,3361.482,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1203,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3438.513,3451.758,"General, when you... earlier, you told us that this doesn't add much to the Constitution, in Turner versus Safley, and then we hear about access to the TV lounge, which doesn't sound like a constitutional deliberate-indifference Eighth Amendment claim."
2005.04-1203,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3457.973,3465.345,"--Well, let me address the specter of all these claims for TV access, because I do think that that's something that can be taken care of in any number of respects."
2005.04-1203,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3605.227,3609.227,"Thank you, General. The case is submitted."
