1997.96-1375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.837,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 96-1375, Regions Hospital v. Donna Shalala."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,9.026,14.612,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,85.298,93.293,"Well, determine I think could quite reasonably be read to mean, use some discretion, or judgment."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,96.895,119.249,"Well, I think when you're referring to an average, determine and calculate are essentially equivalent, and there are, Mr. Chief Justice, within 1395ww(h) other provisions where it's clear that Congress did intend to confer significant authority on the Secretary."
1997.96-1375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.545,174.476,Mr. Sutter--
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,221.347,221.688,--Right.
1997.96-1375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,221.688,223.408,It has already been recognized.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,223.408,223.708,Right.
1997.96-1375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,223.708,224.449,Under this subchapter.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,238.618,258.641,"Well, there are a number of reasons, but one is that there is one, and only one statutory provision in the medicare subchapter that does provide for recognizing an amount as reasonable, and that is 42 U.S.C. 1395oo (a), which we have quoted at pages 11 and 12 of petitioner's appendix."
1997.96-1375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.992,332.659,"Well, that... I mean, that's all very persuasive if you read the phrase as recognized under this subchapter."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,357.766,372.924,"Well, I do... I think the timing here would preclude that, because COBRA 9202(e), which we have cited at page 6 of our reply brief, clearly reflects that Congress intended these amounts to be established by 1987."
1997.96-1375,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,382.582,412.25,"Well, there's no reason it would want two amounts, but there is a reason that it might want a corrected amount, and suddenly a figure which in the past has been used solely to calculate a reimbursement for 1 year is going to be the basis for reimbursement in effect in perpetuity until the law gets changed, so I mean, there's a... there would be a good reason on Congress' part to want to make sure that the ultimate figure was the right one."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,412.25,412.962,"Oh, I agree with you."
1997.96-1375,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,414.281,420.936,"So we're not talking... I mean, it's not as though... but I guess my only point is, I don't see that you get anywhere by saying Congress wouldn't have wanted two figures."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,424.499,428.91,And I think there's every reason to believe that we do have the right figure here.
1997.96-1375,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,429.331,430.352,Let me ask you this.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,448.835,458.8,--I think that avoids a potential question as to whether the lower cost or charges principle applies.
1997.96-1375,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,461.802,463.455,But... may I interrupt you here?
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,463.455,463.965,--Sure.
1997.96-1375,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,463.965,477.703,"In any given... in the case of any given hospital for the base year there has been, at least in the past with respect to that year, that annual reimbursement, only one figure recognized, isn't that so?"
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,486.07,508.134,"Well, there has been only one figure recognized as reasonable, but in certain cases that may not have been what was actually paid and the reason why is that, under 42 U.S.C. 1395f(b), a hospital got paid the lower of its reasonable cost or its customary charges."
1997.96-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,523.534,537.163,"Is that your interpretation of it, or is there any basis for saying that what Congress had in mind was that sometimes the hospital might charge even less than what was reasonable?"
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,537.163,540.285,"--Well, that's in the statute."
1997.96-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,542.358,544.649,But you're giving that as a reason--
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,544.649,545.119,Right.
1997.96-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,545.119,547.311,--for why the word reasonable is in there.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,547.311,547.671,Right.
1997.96-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,547.671,552.182,"And my question to you was, is that just your interpretation?"
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,552.182,553.353,That's my interpretation.
1997.96-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,556.136,567.753,Do I understand you right that you wouldn't be having any claim here if the Secretary had made the reopening period 5 or 6 years instead of 3 years?
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,568.284,588.79,"Well, I think in this case, in light of COBRA 9202(e), it is clear that Congress intended the per-resident amount to be established by 1987, which was well within the existing reopening period, and I think prompt implementation was very important, just as in the case of--"
1997.96-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,588.79,591.301,But if you would... suppose there hadn't been the 3-year.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,596.984,599.586,--You mean that was a general period for all years?
1997.96-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,599.586,604.438,"Just the same regulation as the Secretary now has, except instead of saying 3, it says 6."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,607.65,623.783,"Well, as we pointed out in footnote 8 of our reply brief, the current reopening regulation is a pretty broad construction of the statute, but you would certainly have a very different case here."
1997.96-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,632.417,636.698,"Yes, I understand that argument, but I just wanted to be clear on two things."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,647.297,649.018,We would... yes.
1997.96-1375,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,658.865,671.601,"Just following up on Justice Ginsburg's question, you would agree the agency could have repealed the 3-year window for examining the costs if it had chosen to do so by regulation?"
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,671.601,675.814,"Well, I don't think so in this case because of COBRA 9202(e)."
1997.96-1375,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,683.879,691.176,"So the statute froze into place the congressional... pardon me, the administrative regulations on re-audit?"
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,691.176,698.239,"--If it expected to be done by 1987, which Congress made clear that it did, I think it would... it did that, yes."
1997.96-1375,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,710.987,717.302,May I ask you a question about one of the phrases that troubles me?
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,725.527,726.689,"Yes, that's correct."
1997.96-1375,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.689,733.083,And therefore the duty to make a determination existed before the 1986 amendment.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,739.606,740.077,Right.
1997.96-1375,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,740.077,745.971,In 1986 it imposed a new duty to make a determination that did not previously exist.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,745.971,746.792,Determine the average.
1997.96-1375,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,746.792,753.276,Which sounds to me as though they may have said you're not necessarily bound by what you would have done under the preexisting statute.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,753.276,758.989,"Well, it said you shall determine the average, and the amount recognized."
1997.96-1375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,779.364,782.847,"Well, the old determination didn't do it resident by resident, did it?"
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,782.847,784.119,"No, no."
1997.96-1375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.89,788.63,The '84 determination just gave you the total figure.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,788.63,789.231,--That's correct.
1997.96-1375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,789.231,794.314,"And what this says is, you figure how much of that is attributable to each full-time equivalent resident."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,794.314,795.596,"No, it's the average--"
1997.96-1375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.596,796.597,Yes.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,796.597,807.303,"--for each resident, but what you would have, when you have the NPR you would have with it an audited cost report that would give you an aggregate figure for GME."
1997.96-1375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.303,807.713,Right.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,807.713,812.048,"So you would take that figure, whatever it is, and divide it by your number of residents--"
1997.96-1375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.048,812.336,Right.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,812.336,813.447,--and that's what you'd get as your number.
1997.96-1375,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,813.447,825.606,But it's interesting that the term which we're considering is not the amount recognized as reasonable for each full-time... each FTE.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,836.362,841.027,"Yes, that's correct, so the Secretary shall determine the average, that's right."
1997.96-1375,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,841.027,847.32,"Well, shall determine the average amount, and that so-called average amount has never been determined in the past."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,847.32,862.779,"No, but the amount recognized as reasonable under this subchapter is always determined as... in the normal course, and the language here is very similar to the same language that we had in the prospective payment system for operating costs in... for TEFRA."
1997.96-1375,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,862.779,865.601,"Well, except that it didn't have the modifier average on there."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,870.506,874.888,But the Secretary was directed to compute the average.
1997.96-1375,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,874.888,875.208,Yes.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,875.208,886.154,"Because you see that there's an average if you look at 42 U.S.C. 1395ww(a)(4), which defines all of that in terms of average."
1997.96-1375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.503,907.959,"Mr. Sutter, I hope at some point you will tell us... because this has to affect the way you look at this case."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,916.485,916.835,Right.
1997.96-1375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,916.835,935.608,"And it gives me, at least, the impression that it's a pretty terrible system that would carry forward such an enormous error, and if there's a way to avoid that, I would like to."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,935.608,936.43,Okay.
1997.96-1375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,993.975,1011.169,And your claim is that had that been... had that method of calculation been imposed in 1984 you would have had the facts and figures that would have allocated more of that administrative time to GME.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1011.169,1012.018,I believe that to be the case.
1997.96-1375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1018.912,1031.361,"Well, what factual development in the record is there to show that you were hurt by this socalled default rule, that you didn't have material that you had at one time but had disposed of?"
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1031.361,1038.724,"--Well, we... in the record we have... there is the audit adjustment report which shows that these are recharacterizations--"
1997.96-1375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1038.724,1039.115,Yes.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1039.115,1039.586,--of costs.
1997.96-1375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1046.192,1055.636,"Yes, but my question was, what is there in the record that shows you were injured, that you could have produced something had it come up in 1988, but you couldn't when it came up in 198--"
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1055.636,1063.602,"--We haven't really focused on that because we're really focusing on the threshold question here, which is, did the Secretary have the authority to re-audit."
1997.96-1375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1063.602,1074.208,"--Well, then you don't really rely on the fact that you were hurt by the Secretary's decision to re-audit if it were justified on other grounds."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1084.927,1089.189,"Well, we haven't focused on the individual facts because we are--"
1997.96-1375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1089.189,1091.54,"Well, I... you can answer that question yes or no, Mr. Sutter."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1091.54,1098.446,"--Yes, I think that's correct, but we are looking at whether the Secretary had the authority to do the re-audit."
1997.96-1375,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1098.446,1110.643,"Because a large part of your brief, and I thought it was a convincing argument when I first examined it, was that hospitals have thrown away their records for 1984 and they're prejudiced, but that seems to be falling--"
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1110.643,1113.414,"Well, no they... that did, in fact, happen in this case."
1997.96-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1133.288,1160.124,"--Is the reason you're not focusing on it because... is the reason, is one reason you're not focusing on it... one reason because you conceded it out of the case, and I take it the other reason is because they've actually promulgated a rule that states, as an equitable solution to the problem of the nonexistence of records, we are allowing providers to furnish documentation from cost reporting periods subsequent to the base period."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1165.067,1165.318,Right.
1997.96-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1165.318,1171.473,"I wanted to know what HHS had done about people who'd thrown their records away, and my law clerk found this rule."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1171.473,1171.803,Yes.
1997.96-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1171.803,1175.335,"Which says, they're aware of the problem and they're going to be fair about it."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1175.335,1176.026,We--
1997.96-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1176.026,1178.998,Now... so is there any answer to this?
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1178.998,1179.329,--Yes.
1997.96-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1179.329,1179.819,What?
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1180.009,1180.249,There's two answers.
1997.96-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1228.111,1242.43,"But I also have a later sentence in this same thing which, it says, we understand that all this stuff is at best persuasive, so if the intermediary believes any of the changes or modifications distort the reliability of the data, it says we'll look at the whole thing."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1256.742,1257.18,"Well, they... yes."
1997.96-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1257.18,1259.732,--of the fairness of the give-back of the [dollars] 4 million.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1259.732,1261.224,"Well, they had a choice."
1997.96-1375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1320.643,1340.915,"Isn't there some difference between a regulation which perhaps deals with private actors in the... in a private field, say like an FTC regulation of competition, and a regulation issued by the Secretary which basically just determines how Government money is going to be spent?"
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1344.218,1361.873,"Well, perhaps, but I think we have clear language here, and I think we also have the fact that there was already a final and binding determination, and there is a presumption in favor of issue preclusion, and there's nothing to overcome that presumption here."
1997.96-1375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1361.873,1366.363,"Well, where does the presumption in favor of issue preclusion come from?"
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1366.363,1377.711,"The... well, the Court has established that in cases such as Astoria Federal, and here we have a final and binding determination for 1984."
1997.96-1375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1381.244,1385.625,"Well, but this is not a redetermination for the same purpose."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1385.625,1387.968,"Well, it still said final and binding."
1997.96-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1392.112,1407.03,"But up until the change that was made to take this as a base year, final and binding meant, we do it on a year-by-year basis, so that's... final and binding for purposes of that year, once a 3-year reopening passes is one thing."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1421.14,1424.613,"--Well, it was the same thing that was done for PPS in TEFRA."
1997.96-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1441.133,1446.166,"Yes, but that's not answering my question, that I... there was a change, was there not, that up until then--"
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1446.166,1454.601,"--But 1986, Justice Ginsburg, was within the reopening period for this year."
1997.96-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1464.158,1468.442,"--So you don't quarrel with any... if all this had been done within the 3 years, you would have no quarrel with it."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1468.442,1469.691,--I am... yes.
1997.96-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1477.876,1479.568,"So what you're saying is, the Secretary got it wrong."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1488.355,1505.465,"--I'm saying once that period has passed you are not going to get an accurate result, and I'm also saying that these results were accurate because they were audited determinations, done by experienced intermediaries, and they were done at a time when there was reason to be careful because this was the year to be used for the--"
1997.96-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1505.465,1506.206,But all that's another case.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1517.142,1518.364,"--No, we've not accepted that."
1997.96-1375,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1522.676,1523.667,"Counsel, I--"
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1523.667,1524.468,"Which is, did the--"
1997.96-1375,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1524.468,1528.74,"--I also have a question, and your time is running out, and I did want to ask it."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1535.656,1536.287,--Right.
1997.96-1375,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1536.287,1538.648,--from education to operating.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1538.648,1539.208,That's correct.
1997.96-1375,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1539.208,1555.798,And I think there is a regulation... tell me if that's right... that hospitals can request an upward adjustment in the hospital-specific rate if a reaudit results in the reclassification of costs as operating costs.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1555.798,1556.339,Right.
1997.96-1375,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1556.339,1563.594,"So in theory, even though this disastrous thing happened, the hospital can ask for an upward adjustment in the rate."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1563.594,1566.006,"They can ask, but that doesn't really help."
1997.96-1375,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1583.618,1598.236,"Well, they may not have it, but weren't they put on notice by the Secretary that there would indeed be this recalculation, so can any hospital at this point claim that they were surprised to find that they would like to look at old records which they tossed out?"
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1598.236,1599.917,"No, they weren't put on notice."
1997.96-1375,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1616.119,1617.43,But it didn't suggest otherwise.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1617.601,1617.901,"Yes, it did."
1997.96-1375,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1617.901,1619.362,--How did it suggest otherwise?
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1619.362,1649.021,"At page 36,592 it reiterated the normal 3-year reopening period and said that there would be a special exception to make conforming amendments for purposes of the hospital-specific rate, but there... but... and it also said to the extent there's a re-audit those will be begun quickly, before any final rule is issued, so there was absolutely nothing in there that suggested that there would be some sort of audit done after expiration of the 3-year period."
1997.96-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1649.021,1651.715,"I'm sorry, I'm mixed up now."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1664.922,1670.055,"But that wouldn't apply to this hospital, because it did have the '84 time records."
1997.96-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1670.055,1670.946,So you had all the old records.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1670.946,1671.347,"No, no, no."
1997.96-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1673.518,1674.219,Right.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1674.219,1675.389,And the time--
1997.96-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1675.389,1675.649,I... all right.
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1678.243,1678.439,--Right.
1997.96-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1678.439,1689.098,"I thought if there is one piece of paper missing from 1984, the reg says, you don't have that, you've thrown it away, whatever it is, give us your most recent one."
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1689.098,1690.267,That's not how it was applied.
1997.96-1375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1690.267,1690.808,That's not--
1997.96-1375,0,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1690.808,1694.1,"If you had the time records, then that's what they used."
1997.96-1375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1721.098,1726.483,"--Thank you, Mr. Sutter."
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1728.764,1739.211,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1761.265,1767.79,"Well, he could have done that by re-auditing any ones he was doubtful about within the period."
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1772.783,1789.994,"That's correct, and to the extent that the 3-year period expired, the Secretary can no longer recoup that money, but what's at issue here is the implementation of the statute in which, if there are errors that the Secretary cannot recoup, the Secretary does not want to prevent them from being forever enshrined into all payments."
1997.96-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.994,1792.485,"No, but my point is, they didn't have to be forever enshrined."
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1795.237,1796.479,Well--
1997.96-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.479,1796.82,Didn't he?
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1802.892,1806.423,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia, and if the Secretary had--"
1997.96-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1806.423,1807.775,Moved quickly.
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1807.775,1821.426,"--Had promulgated the rule earlier, then you would have had the re-audit within the 3-year window, and you would have been able to recoup the money, but this regulation by and large for most hospitals missed that 3-year window."
1997.96-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1821.426,1821.806,Okay.
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1834.482,1839.527,"No, Justice Scalia, but the issue is whether the language is consistent with what the Secretary did."
1997.96-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.527,1840.078,I understand.
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1840.078,1847.432,And in this case the statute directs the Secretary to determine an average amount recognized as reasonable under the act for GME costs per resident.
1997.96-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.432,1849.583,Why is the word recognized in there?
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1867.424,1883.036,"Well, the word recognized under the act, to us the most natural reading of that language is, it's the costs that are regarded by the statute, acknowledged or regarded or deemed by the statute as allowable, and we think the actual... actually, two points."
1997.96-1375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1899.647,1900.507,Can I just--
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1900.507,1901.428,It says recognized as reasonable.
1997.96-1375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.428,1903.569,--May I just interrupt on that first point?
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1914.438,1916.017,That's correct.
1997.96-1375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1920.691,1921.079,Correct.
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1921.079,1922.031,--by April of 1986.
1997.96-1375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1922.031,1922.381,That's a good point.
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1922.381,1932.947,"But the point, Justice Stevens, is that recognized as reasonable in our reading of the statute refers to the substantive standard of allowability under the act during the base year."
1997.96-1375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1941.423,1954.312,But do you think it's fair to assume that Congress thought there might be one amount that would be determined in the 3-year period for the 1984 reimbursement and still a different amount based on 1984 for this permanent program?
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1960.025,1960.506,--No.
1997.96-1375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1996.231,1998.761,"Well, I'm not questioning the reasonableness of her judgment and all that."
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2010.368,2012.85,"--I don't think the statute speaks to this at all, Justice Stevens."
1997.96-1375,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2044.132,2046.783,"Ms. Blatt, would you help me out on one thing?"
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2089.259,2093.273,"No, I think the former description was accurate."
1997.96-1375,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2093.273,2093.623,Okay.
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2093.623,2094.983,You get a... excuse me.
1997.96-1375,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2106.072,2106.453,Okay.
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2106.453,2111.616,Then sometimes 2 and sometimes even 3 years later there's a notice of program reimbursement.
1997.96-1375,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2111.616,2111.926,All right.
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2144.487,2153.972,"You're correct in that the amount of money had been reimbursed, but you use the word recognized as having the same meaning--"
1997.96-1375,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2153.972,2154.252,I was saying--
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2154.252,2156.005,"--as a determination, and we don't read it--"
1997.96-1375,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2156.005,2157.104,--the reimbursement implies a recognition.
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2159.047,2170.033,"--It could be... that could be one reading of the word recognized, but equally in fact we think a more persuasive reading of the word recognized is recognized by the statute, not determined by a fiscal intermediary."
1997.96-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.938,2198.934,"But it uses that phrase many other times, or at least several other times in the statute for the very purpose that Justice Souter is describing."
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2212.874,2221.219,"That's correct, Justice Scalia, but the D.C. Circuit in Tulane cited two cases, two instances in which the statute does use the term, recognized as reasonable."
1997.96-1375,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2245.277,2252.633,"--I was going to say, I suppose for the purposes of your case it doesn't matter whether my reading is the better one or your reading is the better one."
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2265.78,2267.152,"Thank you, Justice Souter."
1997.96-1375,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2274.606,2288.146,"Well, what about the argument, Ms. Blatt, that's made that if the Secretary can wait this long, till '90, '91, to go around doing what she should have done in the first place, she could do the same thing in '93?"
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2304.369,2306.539,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, several responses."
1997.96-1375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.69,2340.502,"Yes, but you're suggesting there's something magical about a one-time adjustment."
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2348.977,2359.164,"Again, that first... when it was paid originally in 1984, Justice Stevens, the only risk associated with errors was the amount of reimbursement that provider was due in 1984."
1997.96-1375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.929,2373.616,"Well, the amendment was in '86, and there was still... the final determination of reasonableness just on how much you're going to pay this hospital was still subject to change."
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2373.616,2379.71,"--That's true, and the price that the Secretary paid for not acting quickly is, she cannot go back and recoup the money."
1997.96-1375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2384.601,2393.928,"Well then, I'm just not sure why that argument wouldn't allow her in 1999 to say, well, I can't recover anything earlier than 1995, say, but I can still change the basic rules for the future."
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2393.928,2396.45,"--And if she doesn't have a good reason, it would be arbitrary."
1997.96-1375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.45,2397.191,"Well, there's a good reason why."
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2400.971,2402.534,But Justice Stevens--
1997.96-1375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2402.534,2403.443,Imperfect knowledge.
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2403.443,2424.697,"--But Justice Stevens, the Secretary went into this round to make this per-resident determination knowing the point of it, and it would... I just can't imagine a situation where the Secretary would say, okay, I need to do this every 2 years, but if she did articulate a reason it would be judged based on the information the Secretary had in front of her, and whether that was reasonable."
1997.96-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2452.636,2454.417,Do you have a page citation for this--
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2454.417,2454.708,--Yes.
1997.96-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2455.579,2455.989,--in the petitioner's brief?
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2455.989,2461.053,"--Well, he just said it a minute ago in his argument, that--"
1997.96-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2461.053,2461.302,I see.
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2461.302,2463.252,--So it's not cited in the brief.
1997.96-1375,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2503.169,2504.879,What was the date of this Federal Register?
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2504.879,2508.253,"I think September 21, 1988."
1997.96-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.78,2528.185,"Did it say these were going to be general re-audits, or just in... claimed it was just in a few circumstances?"
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2528.185,2530.258,"--It said, where costs seemed questionable."
1997.96-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2530.258,2532.369,Where costs seemed questionable?
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2532.369,2532.67,Yes.
1997.96-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2593.52,2609.272,"In this case, or in the run-of-the-mind case, does the misallocation indicate that the Government actually paid too much even under the old program, or would the Government come out just the same either way, and it just affects the GME program because of misallocation?"
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2609.272,2613.123,I'm not sure how to answer that question.
1997.96-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2615.607,2617.376,"But I'm glad you understood it, because it's hard to put--"
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2617.997,2618.458,--Yes.
1997.96-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2619.197,2629.083,"It's hard... in other words, was the Government prejudiced for reasons other than the GME program, or was it just under the GME program that it is paying too much or paying too little, depending on who wins here?"
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2629.083,2634.397,--The 1984... the problem in 1984 was that the Government paid too much.
1997.96-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2637.138,2639.109,Even without reference to the GME program?
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2639.109,2641.413,--No.
1997.96-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2655.381,2657.412,So the Government paid too much even under the 1984 scheme?
1997.96-1375,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2657.412,2658.213,"Oh, yes."
1997.96-1375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2658.213,2659.044,All right.
