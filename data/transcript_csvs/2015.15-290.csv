2015.15-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.335,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 15-290, the United States Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Company. Mr. Stewart."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,8.335,24.41,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A jurisdictional determination issued by the Army Corps of Engineers is not final agency action because it does not order any person to do or refrain from doing anything and does not alter anyone's legal rights and obligations."
2015.15-290,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,112.74,128.3,"If there were a provision of law saying that a jurisdictional determination by the Corps or by the EPA is binding on the federal government in future litigation, would that be reviewable?"
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,128.3,150.79,"I think if the -- if the statute said that, we would have a very different case, because in that case we would have something much closer to Bennett v. Spear. In Bennett v. Spear, the Corps -- the Court was dealing with a biological opinion issued by one Federal agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service to another Federal agency, the Bureau of Reclamation, and it included an incidental take statement."
2015.15-290,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,158.13,163.1,"Well, it would be a different case, but are you able to say whether that would be reviewable under the EPA?"
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,163.1,163.45,Yes.
2015.15-290,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,189.42,192.34,"Well, let me just ask about how far removed it is."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,238.0,257.92,"That would be one argument, but the other argument, and I think we've made this point in the reply brief, that particular Memorandum of Understanding was dealing with what are referred to as ""special case determinations."" There are -- situations occasionally arise where the agencies perceive at the outset that there could be dicey questions."
2015.15-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,263.97,266.745,"Well, I don't -- I'm sorry to stop you right there, but I don't think that's right."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,305.085,314.075,But -- but we understand the language about the ultimate determination being binding on the government in subsequent litigation as referring to special case determinations.
2015.15-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,314.075,315.69,"Well, but I don't see how you can do that."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,349.315,355.24,"I -- I take it we're looking at the 1989 memorandum, Memorandum of Agreement?"
2015.15-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,355.24,366.895,"It's the one -- yeah, the one you cite in footnote 3 of the reply brief, where you say that it does not address mine-run core jurisdictional determinations."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,366.895,375.59,"I -- I think we would still think of the -- the general -- the final determinations as referring to special case determinations, but even if the Memorandum of --"
2015.15-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,375.59,394.78,"Well, just to pause there, how can you do that when it says all final determinations signed either by the D -- the district engineer, who does not have authority over special cases, or the regional administration -- administrator? How can you read that as applying only to the special case determinations?"
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,394.78,406.865,"Well, we are -- it is saying final determinations of the DEA or RA made pursuant to this MOA, which is referring to -- which is a MOA -- MOA that is referring specifically to special case determinations."
2015.15-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,406.865,414.425,"Yes, this MOA decides what's a special case and what's not, and it tells you what happens when it's not."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,419.165,427.46,"I think even if the memorandum is read -- read that way -- if the memorandum is read that way, I don't think it reflects current government policy."
2015.15-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,431.08,431.865,"Well, that's fine."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,450.665,451.6,I don't think --
2015.15-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,451.6,458.975,"-- where -- where you've actually taken the Army Corps' determination and said, we're going to go after this person anyway."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,458.975,462.36,"I don't know that it's ever happened, and I certainly don't want to suggest --"
2015.15-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,462.36,474.485,"The fact that you're reserving your power is enough, even though by this memo and practice you've never done it? You think that that's not within Bennett's second prong."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,474.485,489.37,It's not within Bennett's second prong in the same way that in Franklin v. Massachusetts that -- the practice of the President had always been to transmit the figures and do the apportionment in accordance with the figures that were prepared by the Secretary of Commerce.
2015.15-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,518.86,539.575,"Well, the question is, I think, whether it's final with respect to the Corps' determination, not with respect to whether somebody else might be able to bring a suit, and -- and I think what Justice Sotomayor is suggesting is that in practice and, what I was suggesting, in law is it's final with respect to the Corps."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,539.575,541.74,And that would be the first prong of Bennett.
2015.15-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,562.33,567.99,"Well, it seems to me what you are arguing, then, is that there are exceptions to what is otherwise a safe harbor."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,567.99,578.295,"It's -- it's not intended to be -- first of all, the jurisdictional determination that we're talking about here, the one that's actually being challenged, was one that concluded that jurisdictional waters were present."
2015.15-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,587.71,591.45,"Well, a great -- a great practical risk."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,603.875,617.08,"And -- and the other -- I agree that it -- it is a legally available alternative, but I agree a practically difficult one. The other alternative that the -- the Property owner has is to seek a permit to discharge fill lawfully."
2015.15-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.17,631.34,"Well -- well, it's very arduous and very expensive."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,646.11,653.62,And -- and I think the legal -- our legal system confronts that type of problem and that type of tradeoff in a lot of different contexts.
2015.15-290,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,689.93,691.275,Sometimes it doesn't.
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,855.625,877.5,"Well, with respect to Abbott Labs specifically -- excuse me -- Abbott Labs dealt with a regulation that essentially required that on each instance where the -- the trade name of the drug appeared, including it on the labeling, the generic name of the drug had to appear as well. And the regulation, as rules typically do, was phrased as a -- as a directive."
2015.15-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,968.35,972.97,"Mr. Stewart, may I ask you, please don't panic by asking this question."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,986.61,1022.16,"I guess if the -- if the Court ruled against us on the ground that it understood the EPA and the Corps to have entered into a binding agreement, such that the EPA would be foreclosed from taking action based on its disagreement with the Corps' jurisdictional determination, I -- I think if that were the gravamen of the opinion, it would be one that if the agencies wanted to fix it, they easily could, simply by issuing a new MOA clarifying their view of the -- the JD's effect."
2015.15-290,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1022.16,1038.715,"Well, on the same lines, could I ask more generally? I mean, one of the reasons I find this case very difficult is because all over the Federal government there are compliance offices of various kinds whose function is to give advice to people."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1091.64,1133.31,"Well, I mean, it -- I guess part of the -- the difficulty I have with your question is -- or I should say I think if you were drawing lines, the jurisdictional determination at issue here would be fairly far removed from anything that ought to be judicially reviewable, because in many of the instances, the informal advice that agencies are giving, it is specifically advice about the legality -- the perceived legality or illegality of specific contemplated private conduct. Somebody may come to the Agency and say I'm thinking about doing X, would that be legal or illegal? And the Agency might say we think that that would be one or the other."
2015.15-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1140.23,1168.49,"Well, I think -- I think underlying Justice Kagan's question is that the Clean Water Act is unique in both being quite vague in its reach, arguably unconstitutionally vague, and certainly harsh in the civil and criminal sanctions it puts into practice. What's the closest analogous statute that gives the affected party so little guidance at the front end?"
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1168.49,1191.29,"Well, I think with respect to the vast majority of sites in this country, it's readily apparent whether the Clean Water Act applies; that is -- and this point is somewhat removed from the actual facts of this case, but it happens all the time that at construction sites around the country, industrial parties will dig up a lot of dirt and deposit it somewhere else."
2015.15-290,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1246.27,1254.615,"Well, let's -- let's say in a case where there hasn't been a stand-alone jurisdictional determination and the landowner applies for a permit."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1259.81,1260.44,That's correct.
2015.15-290,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1260.44,1260.84,Okay.
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1280.78,1283.61,I think it would still have to go through the rest of the permitting process.
2015.15-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1298.62,1306.31,Why isn't the permitting process a legal consequence under the -- the second -- the second prong of Bennett?
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1306.31,1315.2,It's not a legal consequence because the -- the landowner always has the legal option of discharging without a permit if it feels that --
2015.15-290,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1315.2,1316.32,Then he goes to jail.
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1408.09,1420.54,I would agree that the process that culminates in the approved jurisdictional determination is much more formal and -- and elaborate than the process that would usually culminate in the kind of advice letters that Justice Kagan is talking about.
2015.15-290,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1420.54,1420.77,All right.
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1422.97,1445.74,"But I -- I don't think the formality of the process really has much to do with the basis on -- the practical basis on which Respondent wants to get into court; that is, if this had been a much less formal document, but it had still manifested the Corps' view that jurisdictional waters were present, I think Respondents would say they would be under exactly the same practical pressure either to go --"
2015.15-290,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1445.74,1447.48,It isn't just the pressure.
2015.15-290,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1447.48,1447.93,"Indeed, that --"
2015.15-290,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1447.93,1448.13,It's both.
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1488.64,1505.9,"I agree that it's a public policy question, but as I was saying about Standard Oil and the -- and the same principle applies to our -- our legal system's general resistance to interlocutory appeals within the judicial system; that is, it happens all the time that a motion to dismiss is denied."
2015.15-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1518.24,1527.08,"At least there's an opportunity to certify the question to say it's interlocutory, but there's a good reason why it should go up immediately."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1530.725,1533.77,"There is nothing like 12 -- I mean, there is the permitting process."
2015.15-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1537.9,1555.65,"The jurisdictional determination, you -- you -- well, first, can you explain to me why the -- under the Clean Water Act, it's done this way -- it's not, you can request advice, and we'll give you advice."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1573.03,1582.74,"I think it is formal, and the Corps doesn't revisit it because it -- sua sponte because it would usually seem like a waste of time, unless somebody had presented the Corps a reason --"
2015.15-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1582.74,1588.84,"Why was it done this way, to make it this formal adjudication, rather than we'll give you advice?"
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1588.84,1594.04,I don't know why the -- the formality including the administrative appeal was provided.
2015.15-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1600.81,1610.535,"Was there -- was there anything in it for the EPA or the Corps? I mean, I understand we -- we want to inform the public of the Agency's position."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1620.73,1642.27,"It certainly has benefits to the enforcement agency in the sense that if landowners receive what the Corps believes to be accurate information about their property, the likelihood of their complying will be greater. As Justice Kennedy, I believe, was pointing out, the preparation of a jurisdictional determination would be the first step in the -- the permitting process if -- if one was --"
2015.15-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1642.27,1681.76,"Mr. Stewart, in regular litigation, there is an inducement, potentially, for one or other party to appeal to delay the resolution of the case. In this situation, I don't see that inducement as existing, meaning I doubt very much that landowners are -- who wanted to use their property for a particular purpose are going to appeal just for the -- just to delay the government's adjudication of an issue that's going to either permit them or not permit them to go forward."
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1681.76,1684.67,I would agree there is less danger of manipulative appeals.
2015.15-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1699.63,1700.19,"Well, I --"
2015.15-290,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1700.19,1702.42,"If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."
2015.15-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1702.42,1702.71,Yes.
2015.15-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1703.39,1714.09,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hopper."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,1714.09,1726.6,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We read the MOA to be binding in every way. We have found not a single word --"
2015.15-290,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1726.6,1732.905,"That doesn't help you for very long, because he just said they'll change it. So is that the argument that you want to rely on?"
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,1732.905,1733.945,I'm sorry?
2015.15-290,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1733.945,1738.86,"He just said before that if we rule that way, they could change it."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,1741.02,1743.51,"Well, it's -- it's existing today."
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1786.16,1793.84,"Mr. Hopper, can I ask, you know, I was just looking through some other agency's rules and practices."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,1876.925,1906.57,"What you're describing, Your Honor, is what is -- what we -- would be referred to in this case as a preliminary jurisdictional determination. The regulatory process has built into it the option of an advisory, informational, preliminary jurisdictional determination to be issued to the applicant that is nothing more than advisory."
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1908.96,1912.57,"Well, these are -- this is very strong language that are in these letters."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,1928.75,1955.61,"That is strong language, Your Honor, but not as strong as an adjudicative determination, where rights and obligations are actually decided. In -- in this particular case, the process is so formalized, and -- and purports to be final, and purports to be binding, that it -- that's -- that it's quite distinguishable from the situation that you are describing."
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1955.61,1979.945,"Let me ask you about that, because that's certainly -- this -- this process does last a long time, and it's -- even Mr. Stewart, I think, would say this is a more formal process than many that are -- that exist around the Federal government. But I guess I'm wondering about the incentives of the kind of distinction that you would make."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2008.86,2022.735,"Well, I think that the Agency has more to lose than the landowner has to gain by refraining from issuing these kind of formal adjudications."
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2067.45,2084.53,"Well, I guess I don't quite understand that, because it seems as though they could make it less formal, and they could provide less assurance, and -- and still, there would be very few people who would want to run the gauntlet. And so you wouldn't gain anything."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2097.24,2145.99,"Well -- well, that's the problem, because until there has been -- because the -- the Clean Water Act is so difficult to -- because under the Clean Water Act, it is so difficult to determine, the reach of the Act, and it can only be done through expert analysis, you would never get the kind of detailed, reliable information that would define the scope of jurisdiction if you didn't have such a formal process, which would never occur in the type of generalized ruling that you've suggested, like through the preliminary JD. The preliminary JD says we think you may have waters of the United States on your property."
2015.15-290,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2163.045,2183.975,"Tell us -- just -- it's in the briefs, but what -- what's the cost to get a -- a JD determination in a case such as yours? Second, can the Agency, if we adopt the sort of rule that you want, simply decline to give jurisdictional determinations?"
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2183.975,2192.995,All that's required in order to receive a jurisdictional determination under the regulatory guideline is to ask.
2015.15-290,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2213.675,2214.5,The --
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2214.5,2214.88,Did Mr. --
2015.15-290,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2214.88,2232.53,"The point was made earlier that in -- that in court proceedings you have a jurisdictional question; you may think that the court was very wrong, but apart from 1292(b), you -- you are stuck there."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2258.245,2261.325,"I'm not sure that I follow your question, Your Honor."
2015.15-290,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2262.82,2273.01,"Well, you -- you are urging that you should have -- you should be able to challenge in court this jurisdictional determination, right?"
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2273.01,2274.5,Immediate judicial review.
2015.15-290,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2274.5,2290.925,"And -- and if you were in a district court, you would have no immediate right to challenge a jurisdictional determination. So why should this -- this situation be different in an agency setting and in a court setting?"
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2290.925,2299.48,"That's -- that's the whole question at issue, Your Honor, is whether we can get district court or -- or judicial review."
2015.15-290,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2299.48,2324.645,"But if you were in the district court and the district court made a jurisdictional determination, you are in our power, and you disagree, and you think the case should be -- you should be allowed to be free to do what you will, and -- but you've lost on the jurisdictional issue, you have to stay there."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2328.76,2332.17,"We don't know why we would not be able to appeal that, Your Honor."
2015.15-290,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2336.845,2340.435,"A summary judgment, you'd have to take a judgment on the whole case."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2347.635,2352.71,We don't believe that -- we don't believe that we need to go through the -- the permit process --
2015.15-290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2352.71,2353.62,The question is why.
2015.15-290,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2353.62,2354.56,The difference between --
2015.15-290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2354.56,2355.065,Why.
2015.15-290,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2385.94,2386.49,Please.
2015.15-290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2386.49,2394.18,"-- is -- is why doesn't that apply here, too? Because this is just like one part of the whole thing."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2394.18,2394.81,It --
2015.15-290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2394.81,2395.6,Nothing --
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2395.6,2396.42,In what --
2015.15-290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2396.42,2397.75,-- is like the jurisdictional question.
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2397.75,2399.83,In what sense is it one part of the whole thing?
2015.15-290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2399.83,2408.585,"Well, this says that nothing's going to happen to you until they decide that they're not going to give you a permit, which is part of it."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2408.585,2410.43,Under -- under Abbott Labs --
2015.15-290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2410.43,2410.95,Yeah.
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2414.23,2414.57,Yes.
2015.15-290,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2446.82,2490.735,"Do you see any distinction between a jurisdictional determination by an Article III district judge and a jurisdictional determination by an enforcement Agency? Do you think there might be an argument that it is tolerable to wait until the end of the case when a neutral Article III judge makes an adverse judicial -- an adverse jurisdictional determination, but perhaps less appealing to wait till the end of the adjudication when the jurisdictional determination is made by an enforcement Agency?"
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2490.735,2506.95,"Well, there -- when an adjudication has already been made, there's no further adjudication to be made unless you're talking about requiring a permit prior to judicial review, and that's what we find objectionable, Your Honor."
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2506.95,2507.37,Mr. Hopper --
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2507.37,2509.345,It's not an adequate remedy in court.
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2509.345,2513.0,A more general way to ask this question.
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2557.49,2558.47,Exactly.
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2558.47,2569.075,"Well, that seems to be a good reason for Mr. Stewart to prevail in this case. But the predicament is the predicament, and it's a predicament that comes from the Clean Water Act."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2578.895,2580.58,It does more than that.
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2617.68,2627.27,"Well, that's the question, is whether there's any obligation or whether there's -- it's simply information about what will happen given different courses of action."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2627.27,2645.82,The Clean Water Act itself doesn't say anything about this particular property. And the -- the Clean Water Act doesn't cover all waters. And the only way to find out if there are jurisdictional waters which will trigger the requirement for a permit is to go through this laborious site-specific analysis --
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2645.82,2646.53,That seems right.
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2660.525,2660.81,Not --
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2660.81,2662.52,-- at least a hundred different examples.
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2662.52,2680.87,"I'm not aware of them, all -- those examples having an appeals process that results in a final Agency action, that by treatment and regulation and practice constitute a binding conclusion."
2015.15-290,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2680.87,2730.75,"Well, the premise of the question is that the Army Corps of Engineers is doing this just out of the goodness of its heart; that this is a lot of work for them but they just want to be nice to landowners and that's why they've set up this -- this process. And maybe that's correct, although I understood what you were saying earlier to suggest that that's not quite how you see the process; that they do this for their own purposes because they -- it expands their enforcement power, because landowners who have a question about the status of their land have strong incentive to ask for a jurisdictional determination. And if -- so that alerts the Corps to the fact that this is a property that might be subject to their jurisdiction."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2742.78,2743.17,"Well, if --"
2015.15-290,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2743.17,2744.21,Is that your argument?
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2744.21,2744.66,Yes.
2015.15-290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2763.56,2777.415,"It isn't just -- that isn't -- the issue, I think, is this -- what I thought your answer would be is that informal advice is not final Agency action normally. There is a statute."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2832.85,2836.85,"Well, to help you make up your mind, we would refer you to Frozen Food, which you've already --"
2015.15-290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2836.85,2837.1,"Yeah, yeah."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2848.46,2848.835,Right.
2015.15-290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2848.835,2852.21,A few other things will be on the other side of the line.
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2852.21,2859.62,"And in fact, if Frozen Food is virtually indistinguishable from this case, Frozen Food was essentially a jurisdictional determination case."
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2859.62,2865.645,"Well, Mr. Hopper, can I ask, do you think that this would count as a formal adjudication under the APA?"
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2865.645,2866.74,Yes.
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2866.74,2869.835,A formal adjudication under the APA.
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2869.835,2870.67,Yes.
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2879.43,2880.46,Would it be --
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2880.46,2881.21,-- issued a final --
2015.15-290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2881.21,2882.05,It's not --
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2882.05,2884.465,Would it then receive Chevron deference?
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2884.465,2885.54,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2887.375,2887.77,Yeah.
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2924.8,2933.85,"Well, the -- we -- we have met in every way the -- the finality standards of the Bennett second prong."
2015.15-290,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2949.39,2960.74,What -- what's the best example of a legal effect that follows from a jurisdictional determination as opposed to a practical effect? It seems to me that the practical effects are quite -- what's the legal impact?
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2960.74,2974.605,"Increased risk of enforcement, because the very existence of the JD constitutes prima facie evidence of a violation if one were to discharge without a permit."
2015.15-290,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2974.605,2976.965,"That sounds to me practical, not legal."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2976.965,2981.915,"I -- I think that is legal, Your Honor."
2015.15-290,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2982.83,2982.89,You --
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2982.89,2994.715,"Also, I would suggest, as this Court recognized in -- in Sackett that this jurisdictional determination increases the risk of civil and criminal liability."
2015.15-290,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2994.715,2998.74,Does it affect the determination of willfulness on the part of the landowner?
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,2998.74,3001.33,"It does, in two -- in two respects, Your Honor."
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3032.78,3034.85,Mr. Hopper -- I'm sorry. Please.
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,3034.85,3036.669,Yes.
2015.15-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3036.669,3050.785,"Isn't that true in every case of an opinion letter, whether it's from the government or for -- actually, from a -- a private party, that, you know, there's always cases in which people say you had an opinion letter; it said X; you did Y."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,3064.465,3088.175,"Yes, with the -- with the one exception that -- that the weight that the -- that the court is going to give to those types of opinions and suggestions is much different than what the court will give to a final determination as to jurisdiction after having gone through a formal appeals process."
2015.15-290,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3299.39,3319.25,"Suppose the response to your -- to your argument on the part of the Agency is, well, we didn't have to get into this in the first place; there's no statute that required us to hold these jurisdictional -- to make these jurisdictional determinations, so forget it."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,3348.14,3378.915,"You might recall, Your Honor, that this is a 12(b) motion where we take the facts as asserted in the -- in the complaint as -- as correct. And the complaint suggests that this jurisdictional determination should never have been issued; that -- that the waters on this particular property are not waters of the United States, and a negative jurisdictional determination should have been issued."
2015.15-290,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3378.915,3379.51,I thought your --
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,3379.51,3393.69,"So that -- that's a unique result of the -- of the jurisdictional determination, and does not follow from the -- from the statute. Under the statute, we should be exempt. Under the jurisdictional determination, we have to get a permit."
2015.15-290,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3393.69,3407.1,"I thought your answer might focus on the fact that this is of great benefit to the Agency, because by issuing the determinations, they are able to exercise extraordinary leverage without going through the formal enforcement process."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,3427.59,3429.43,I think there's no question they're not going to give it up.
2015.15-290,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3488.205,3495.87,"How do I determine how much is too much? I mean, for some people, given their financial situation, $3,000 is too much."
2015.15-290,1,36044,m_reed_hopper,,3511.78,3535.54,"Well, I -- I don't think it's a -- a question that needs to be answered generally, because it can be answered specifically in this case. In this particular case, the landowner has been asked to provide over a hundred thousand dollars in -- in additional studies."
2015.15-290,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3554.965,3559.69,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart, two minutes."
2015.15-290,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3559.69,3571.22,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First, with respect to the costs of the permitting process, there -- there's no basis for assuming that the permit process is systemically unavailable."
2015.15-290,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3671.055,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
