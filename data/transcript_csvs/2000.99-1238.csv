2000.99-1238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.926,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-1238, Christopher Artuz v. Tony Bruce Bennett."
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,56.931,60.198,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-1238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,78.858,87.655,"I take it it all comes up because we're construing the language, properly filed, in the applicable statutory provision."
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,87.655,89.863,"Absolutely, Your Honor, yes."
2000.99-1238,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,131.969,144.767,"Well, the courts are all over the lot on what the words, properly filed, mean. It seems to me there are several different approaches."
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,162.938,164.123,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1238,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.123,175.662,So not every lower court has thought that it also encompasses a review of substance to see whether it's procedurally barred.
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,175.662,176.789,"Yes, that's right, Your Honor."
2000.99-1238,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.68,183.461,And I guess the court has to later decide whether it's procedurally barred.
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,189.137,189.881,--Yes.
2000.99-1238,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.881,196.02,"The Federal habeas court would, I suppose, at the end of the day have to address that issue."
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,196.02,197.581,"Yes, absolutely, Your Honor."
2000.99-1238,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.581,198.207,Yes.
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,198.207,201.689,Here there are several different definitions.
2000.99-1238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,214.07,216.28,And what is your definition of properly filed?
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,216.28,217.577,"--It's this, Your Honor."
2000.99-1238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.699,266.117,That gets you to the situation where the petition is filed in a court that didn't even have the authority to grant any sort of relief.
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,266.117,267.574,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2000.99-1238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.574,269.062,But you want to go further than that.
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,269.062,271.019,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.707,283.9,"And is that the third part of your test, or the second part of your--"
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,283.9,286.186,That's the second part of the test.
2000.99-1238,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,302.971,331.814,"--Well, but does it follow that the court can't entertain the merits? I mean, a procedural bar is something that can be waived and, as counterintuitive as it may be, I mean, we occasionally do get cases before this Court in which there seems to have been a procedural bar that the State didn't invoke, so it seems to me that we're not in the position of even being able to analyze this on a merely... or I shouldn't say merely, on a jurisdictional basis, because it really doesn't go to the State court's jurisdiction."
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,348.967,351.876,"--No, Your Honor, the third prong is not a jurisdictional prong."
2000.99-1238,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,366.92,370.308,"You mean, if it can't adjudicate the merits it's not properly filed."
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,370.308,374.999,It's not properly filed if it can't adjudicate the merits.
2000.99-1238,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,374.999,376.911,"No, but it can adjudicate the merits."
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,380.218,381.999,Not in this case.
2000.99-1238,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,391.516,432.67,"But doesn't this... doesn't your answer, and I realize I'm shifting my position here, but doesn't your answer point out another difficulty of your position, and that is, a Federal court is, it seems to me, hard pressed in these cases if it's got to decide whether a particular bar is jurisdictional or whether it's not jurisdictional under State law, and this is just adding one more complication, as against the position of the other side, which takes a kind of a plain language, almost physical act interpretation."
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,442.962,446.837,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe we are imposing an additional bar."
2000.99-1238,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,472.13,475.52,"Well, there's no question that the Federal courts in a sense can do this."
2000.99-1238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,489.107,501.988,"And that essentially usurps the function, or at least duplicates the function of the State court and is, it seems to me, contrary to the Federal interests that underlie this statute."
2000.99-1238,0,29713,john_m_castellano,,501.988,505.385,--I don't believe it duplicates the function of the State courts at all.
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1190.74,1217.644,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-1238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1312.607,1314.548,What about the case where it just isn't clear?
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1322.265,1328.015,"--Where it's not clear, and so the prisoner isn't certain--"
2000.99-1238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1328.015,1330.63,It's a difficult... you know--
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1330.63,1328.015,--Right.
2000.99-1238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1328.015,1333.614,--frivolous cases aren't really that tough.
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1343.928,1350.555,"Though I should make clear, a large percentage of these cases will be the frivolous ones, the second, third, fifth applications, but--"
2000.99-1238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1350.555,1356.865,"It's no problem, if the Federal court sees somebody abusing the State system this is an equitable statute, tolling, and they can deal with it."
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1362.101,1360.89,--Right.
2000.99-1238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1380.194,1389.977,"It goes back, and now the State court says, oh, well, I guess, in fact, there's a independent State ground, or the statute of limitations wasn't tolled under State law, et cetera."
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1390.754,1391.063,Right.
2000.99-1238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1401.673,1403.446,"How could you, under your interpretation?"
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1403.446,1411.154,"--Right, but the time back in State court would equitably toll the Federal 1-year limitations provision."
2000.99-1238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1411.154,1411.154,"Even though it turns out that, in fact, it's not... even though it was in the wrong court, it should have gone to the surrogate court, or something?"
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1411.154,1429.851,"Well, if the Federal court, upon looking at the habeas petition says, this might, in fact, be a proper case to be back in the State courts, there may be those State remedies available."
2000.99-1238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1436.225,1437.336,It was wrong.
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1438.571,1438.748,"--Well, the Federal--"
2000.99-1238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1438.748,1440.19,--The Federal court was wrong.
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1441.238,1449.369,"--But in essence, since the State prisoner shouldn't be penalized for the Federal court being wrong, we think that would be an appropriate time for the limitations period to be tolled."
2000.99-1238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.907,1466.351,"Mr. Schweitzer, the problem I have with your position is, I don't know how you can get out of the word properly the kind of line that you want to draw."
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1514.656,1548.028,"Well, the first answer to that question is that we think it makes sense to believe that Congress took the word... inserted the word properly here and created the phrase, properly filed application, borrowing from its past use of the word properly with respect to the terms, proper exhaustion, and proper presentation, both of which deal with the presentation of claims to State courts which, if it's properly done, provides the State courts with the opportunity to rule on the merits, regardless of how the court ultimately rules on that merits decision."
2000.99-1238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.42,1593.187,So also if it makes a frivolous merits claim.
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1597.871,1597.871,"Well, in the habeas corpus context, where there's such a focus on compliance with the various procedural bars, and where the procedural default context expressly exists to accommodate the situations where State procedural rules aren't complied with, but prisoners aren't considered to have done anything wrong if they have exhausted their State remedies but lost on the merits, we think that same... Congress had that same mind set here, where the prisoner isn't treated as having done anything wrong, having done anything improper or incorrect by bringing losing claims, but the prisoner has done something wrong by bringing claims that are barred by mandatory State court rules, and then attempting to delay the limitations period, possibly indefinitely, by filing repetitive, improper claims in the State court."
2000.99-1238,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1597.871,1656.958,"Mr. Schweitzer, does Florida have either a statute of limitations or any rules taking care of the repetitive and successive filing problem as a matter of State law?"
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1656.958,1673.926,"Well, Florida has a 2-year limitations on noncapital cases and a 1-year limitation on capital cases, both of which have exceptions for new facts or new law, and mere existence of that exception means that under respondent's theory you can violate the time bar, and that's... and it would still be a properly filed application."
2000.99-1238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1673.926,1688.656,"Mr. Schweitzer, you have conceded, I think, in agreement with Mr. Castellano, that Congress could have been, as he put it in his brief, more specific in defining the scope of the tolling provision."
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1688.656,1691.077,Yes.
2000.99-1238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1691.077,1720.263,"And you say that... well, Mr. Castellano says the reason probably that Congress was not more specific, that 1) it's Members couldn't agree on a definition, or because the types of State procedures that could be invoked were so varied, Congress thought it best to leave the application of the provision for the courts, but that seems... why shouldn't the court say, well, Congress, we'll just go as far as you did."
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1728.791,1743.672,"I wouldn't want to speculate as to why Congress didn't do a better job of defining the exact contours of the tolling provision, but I don't think that an ambiguity in the statute requires an answer one way or the other."
2000.99-1238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1743.672,1771.927,"Well, it's not one or the other, because everyone would agree that at least it's got to be an application for habeas corpus, and has got to be filed in the court, so it's not... it's... that's... no question about it."
2000.99-1238,1,21482,dan_schweitzer,,1782.271,1796.719,"Because the problem, without reading more into it, is that it would essentially allow subsection 2 of 2244(d), the tolling provision, undermine subsection 1, the limitations period, and it's an unusual provision of law which defeats itself."
2000.99-1238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1811.057,1819.957,"Not if the States, as Justice O'Connor suggested, enacts one of these... you have to get permission before you can file such an application."
2000.99-1238,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1819.957,1826.596,"Thank you, Mr. Schweitzer. Mr. Futerfas."
2000.99-1238,2,15990,alan_s_futerfas,,1828.62,1830.473,"Yes, you are, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.99-1238,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1887.531,1891.988,"What do you think the term properly filed means, Mr. Futerfas?"
2000.99-1238,2,15990,alan_s_futerfas,,1891.988,1902.332,"As we state in the brief in the Second Circuit, and in fact the majority of the circuits, I tend to disagree with petitioner."
2000.99-1238,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.691,1906.952,I mean your position.
2000.99-1238,2,15990,alan_s_futerfas,,1906.952,1917.33,"--Our position is, a properly filed application is an application which is delivered to the custodian designated to receive it in accordance with the rules governing its acceptance for filing."
2000.99-1238,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1917.33,1929.839,"Well, supposing, to use Mr. Castellano's example, there's a habeas corpus petition that is delivered to the clerk of a surrogate's court which has only probate jurisdiction?"
2000.99-1238,2,15990,alan_s_futerfas,,1929.839,1931.39,It's not properly filed.
2000.99-1238,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1952.904,1956.099,"And also, a timely filing?"
2000.99-1238,2,15990,alan_s_futerfas,,1956.099,1957.011,--That's correct.
2000.99-1238,3,29713,john_m_castellano,,3387.549,3394.529,"Your Honor, I would just like to address the question, I believe it was Justice Ginsburg's question actually about why adopt our rule."
2000.99-1238,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3458.722,3460.439,"Thank you, Mr. Castellano."
