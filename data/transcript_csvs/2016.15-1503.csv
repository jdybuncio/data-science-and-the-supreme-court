2016.15-1503,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.545,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15-1503, Turner v. United States, and the consolidated case, 15-504, Overton v. United States. Mr. Williams."
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,12.545,25.12,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Brady v. Maryland, this Court established the now familiar principle that the prosecution must disclose to the defense all favorable and material information."
2016.15-1503,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,71.0,71.84,Counselor?
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,71.84,72.605,Yes.
2016.15-1503,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,72.605,83.02,"At the trial, the witness, Mr. Freeman, indicated that there were two people acting suspiciously."
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,129.06,129.51,Sure.
2016.15-1503,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,202.065,206.74,But was the -- was the name disclosed during the trial?
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,206.74,210.96,"It -- I don't think it was ever disclosed during the trial, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.15-1503,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,271.15,276.42,"But would all of the defendants -- this -- this had what, something like 10 defense counsel?"
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,276.42,277.615,Yes.
2016.15-1503,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,277.615,298.025,"Would they all have to agree to go this route if they had the information, if it was turn -- turned over as Brady material? Some might still say I'd rather go with, not me, maybe them, instead of the alternate perpetrator."
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,298.025,304.13,"Yes -- yes, Justice Ginsburg. First, let me say I don't think they would have all had to do it."
2016.15-1503,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,362.43,381.005,"I'm sorry, but I -- I -- my greatest difficulty with Mr. McMillan is that clearly his '92 crime, which was decades after this crime, suggests a similarity that would have been very potent at a trial."
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,460.505,460.9,"Well, sure."
2016.15-1503,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,564.61,571.64,The alternative perpetrator theory does seem completely inconsistent with the defenses that were put on at trial.
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,619.225,638.85,"We think that there is definitely a reasonable probability that the jury would have had reasonable doubt, and that's the -- that's the standard, whether or not this jury would have had reasonable doubt and whether or not there was a reasonable probability that it would have had it, even in light of these purported eyewitnesses. Now, we started with Alston and Bennett, and I'd like to talk about Thomas."
2016.15-1503,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,697.41,701.58,"In a different -- different case, not in this case."
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,701.58,702.04,No.
2016.15-1503,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,769.3,778.34,"But even so, wouldn't it still be difficult to explain how Thomas came up with a theory that would be a complete fabrication."
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,790.195,800.605,"Well, first, defendants at trial did try to point to a motive, that Mr. Thomas was a relatively unpopular kid who got him picked on quite a bit."
2016.15-1503,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,836.94,838.945,Did Mr. Thomas ever recant?
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,838.945,839.75,No.
2016.15-1503,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,897.92,916.135,"Well, why wouldn't that have happened anyway? I mean, even if you had this alternative-perpetrator theory, there's still a lot of defendants with a lot of lawyers with -- seems still a strong incentive to point at the other folks and say it was them, it wasn't me."
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,916.135,922.45,"Justice Kagan, it would not have been a motive to go so far as to bolster the other witnesses."
2016.15-1503,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,953.86,976.49,"Well, lawyers are used to arguing in the alternative, but other people are not. And I -- it's really hard to see how the -- the defense argument could be: This was -- this crime was committed by McMillan and another, and a confederate of his; but if you don't believe that, it was committed by the group, but I wasn't part of the group. That's really hard to -- to do that; isn't it?"
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,976.49,976.72,Right.
2016.15-1503,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1072.07,1088.325,"You have so much to cover, I don't want to interrupt, but why, if McMillan was the perpetrator, would he have been hanging around the scene? That -- that -- that's really -- concerns me. Why -- why -- if you commit a murder, you don't hang around for an hour."
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,1088.325,1090.465,"Well, we think that there would be two reasons."
2016.15-1503,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1097.2,1100.59,But it was -- it was -- it was 30 to 60 minutes later.
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,1100.59,1103.74,We would say it was most likely 30 minutes later that he came back in.
2016.15-1503,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1214.405,1214.62,Okay.
2016.15-1503,0,33605,john_s_williams,,1229.585,1234.305,"So, if it's okay with the court after I answer this question, I would like to reserve the balance of my time."
2016.15-1503,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1272.845,1285.97,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Rice."
2016.15-1503,1,62827,deanna_m_rice,,1285.97,1316.305,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court: The jury repeatedly deadlocked as to Russell Overton telling the court it would be impossible to reach a verdict and returning a conviction only after multiple assertions of impasse, and 40 to 50 additional votes. In this incredibly close case the government not only wrongfully suppressed evidence of two alternative perpetrators, but also withheld critical impeachment evidence concerning a key witness against Overton Carrie Eleby."
2016.15-1503,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1367.97,1369.23,Which one was that?
2016.15-1503,1,62827,deanna_m_rice,,1369.23,1371.32,That was Maurice Thomas.
2016.15-1503,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1450.055,1450.49,Ms. Rice --
2016.15-1503,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1450.49,1459.375,Did the government give nothing at all to the defense about Eleby or did they just give a truncated file or was there a separate file they didn't give.
2016.15-1503,1,62827,deanna_m_rice,,1459.375,1470.57,And so the government did turn over Eleby's grand jury testimony and the defense cross-examined her on some inconsistencies between that testimony and her testimony at trial.
2016.15-1503,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1478.02,1480.68,"That wasn't redacted, but it was on a separate notepad or something."
2016.15-1503,1,62827,deanna_m_rice,,1480.68,1496.07,"It -- it was in the prosecutors notes, yes, and the -- and the prosecutor at the post-conviction hearing acknowledged that he had this information, that it's the kind of thing he normally would have brought out probably in the grand jury testimony, and that it just slipped off his radar."
2016.15-1503,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1503.825,1504.715,Ms. Rice --
2016.15-1503,1,62827,deanna_m_rice,,1504.715,1505.795,-- at trial.
2016.15-1503,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1505.795,1514.34,"The matter of Eleby that you were talking about, this is what the government says about that, and I just wondered whether, what your reaction was to it."
2016.15-1503,1,62827,deanna_m_rice,,1525.26,1541.09,Two points on that: First there's a substantial question at least as -- as it was before the jury about whether this conversation she claimed to have had with Alston which the other witness falsely corroborated to investigators actually happened.
2016.15-1503,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1586.155,1592.09,"You're kind Ms. Rice, I would have said creating false corroboration is fabricating evidence."
2016.15-1503,1,62827,deanna_m_rice,,1592.09,1596.365,And -- and I would emphatically be -- not agree -- agree with that.
2016.15-1503,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1596.365,1601.69,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben."
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1601.69,1608.385,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court can have confidence in the integrity of these verdicts."
2016.15-1503,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1699.3,1706.79,"Can we go back to your first, to the -- the two who confessed and testified for the prosecution."
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1714.935,1715.59,That is correct.
2016.15-1503,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1715.59,1723.24,"So the -- the jury, at least to that extent, did not believe what these witnesses said."
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1723.24,1733.645,"Well -- there -- there are two separate questions, Justice Ginsburg: Whether the jury believed everything that Alston and Bennett said, and the question of whether they believed it that a group attack occurred."
2016.15-1503,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1768.39,1780.62,"Justice Alito suggested earlier that a defense counsel might take the position, there's evidence that indicates McMillan was the one who did it."
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1807.65,1823.69,"Sure Justice Ginsburg, the defense counsel can run alternative arguments, but to the extent that they depend on saying no event happened and any event if you believe the government's witnesses my guy wasn't one of them is weaker, but I don't even think that's the issue for the Court to decide."
2016.15-1503,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1843.62,1854.495,"Mr. Dreeben, it's a hard case about whether it was one or more perpetrators. More than likely more than one."
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1900.34,1944.05,"Justice Sotomayor, let me start first with what actually happened in the deliberations because you can't understand what's going on with Turner, Chris Turner and Overton, unless you understand that the jury deliberated carefully, convicted six defendants and acquitted two defendants after going through an elaborate process of considering the evidence in a six-week trial, sending out a variety of notes that all required consideration of evidence and culminating in a request to see Yarborough's videotaped statement, which he gave early on in the investigation in which he describes the group attack as a pincer movement with two groups of people moving out of the park, surrounding the alley, 8th Street and 9th Street, and commencing the attack."
2016.15-1503,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1981.5,1985.79,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, of course that's right because that was the only theory in the case."
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2036.365,2056.005,"So, Justice Kagan, it's not actually accurate that they had no alternative theory. Rouse, who was the -- the defendant who committed the culminating act and has four separate people testifying that he did it, ran the most obvious alternative perpetrator defense, the one that was readily available to all of the Petitioners."
2016.15-1503,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2354.71,2357.185,"So, Mr. Dreeben, why did it take the jury longer?"
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2357.185,2363.66,"Well, I think that this is a -- this is a six-week trial with ten defendants as Your Honor pointed out."
2016.15-1503,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2384.37,2394.835,But we don't know how the trial would have shaped up and how the jury would have reacted if the defendants had put on this alternative theory.
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2405.415,2418.715,"So the test, Justice Ginsburg, is whether there is a reasonable probability of a different outcome defined as an outcome in which this Court's confidence is undermined that the jury would have convicted."
2016.15-1503,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2498.55,2505.925,"Mr. Dreeben, can I ask about the facts of this? And it's a -- it's a similar question on the other side to the one Justice Alito asked about the garage."
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2555.17,2560.51,"So first of all, Justice Kagan, the government looked as hard as it could for witnesses."
2016.15-1503,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2730.72,2738.78,"Is -- was the judge -- the superior court judge who decided the post-trial motions, the Brady motion, the same judge as the judge who presided over --"
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2738.78,2739.28,It was not.
2016.15-1503,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2879.18,2885.98,What about the attack that Mr. Williams described? The McMillan's attack on the council woman.
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2885.98,2886.315,Yes.
2016.15-1503,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2906.29,2912.17,"Of course, the prosecutors did not know this, but in the end McMillan commits a crime very much like this."
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2912.17,2914.41,"Well, I think the crime actually quite different."
2016.15-1503,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3015.48,3025.04,"Why does Michelle Roberts, who has a client who the evidence is quite weak against, say that she certainly would have run with this evidence."
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3046.275,3048.315,"Well, her client was acquitted."
2016.15-1503,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3137.99,3140.735,Why was his name not given to the defense?
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3140.735,3149.29,At the time Justice Ginsburg the policy of the Department of Justice was that we comply with our obligations under Brady.
2016.15-1503,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3205.78,3217.2,"But -- but if you had -- you had been asked you would have told the prosecutor at the time that this is not Brady material, so far as, McMillan is concerned? That's -- that's the advice you would have given the prosecutor, don't turn it over."
2016.15-1503,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3217.2,3252.64,"Well -- I -- Justice Kennedy, I don't know that is the advice that I would have given him because, unless the government has a good countervailing reason, which it often does, such as witness safety or concerns about obstruction of justice, providing that information to a defendant about the crime scene, about the general timeframe, in which it occurred, would be good practice and it's the practice today. The question for this Court is whether there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different verdict if it had had turned over the McMillan evidence and the defendants had presented that McMillan evidence to the court."
2016.15-1503,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3357.03,3362.26,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Williams, four minutes. IN NO. 15-1503."
2016.15-1503,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3362.26,3367.12,Mr. Williams could you list for me the legal errors the court made below?
2016.15-1503,3,33605,john_s_williams,,3367.12,3368.195,Absolutely.
2016.15-1503,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3394.15,3395.84,I'm sorry go through that one again.
2016.15-1503,3,33605,john_s_williams,,3395.84,3396.575,Sure.
2016.15-1503,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3433.94,3436.645,Was that -- is that a legal error? Sounds like a factual error.
2016.15-1503,3,33605,john_s_williams,,3436.645,3442.49,"Well, no I think it is a legal error, Your Honor, if you look at Parker v. Gladden, which is a case from this Court in 1966."
2016.15-1503,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3607.48,3608.73,"You can finish your answer, sure."
2016.15-1503,3,33605,john_s_williams,,3608.73,3617.225,Yes. The government has never sought to explain how it has -- it can correctly explain where the sodomy occurred. Thank you.
2016.15-1503,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3617.225,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
