2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.855,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 15-680, Bethune-Hill v. The Virginia State Board of Elections. Mr. Elias."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,8.855,26.215,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court created out of whole cloth a new legal standard that permitted Virginia to apply a one-size-fits-all, 55 percent racial floor to all 12 of its predominantly black districts."
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,72.48,94.215,"I'm -- I'm not quite sure I understand how you assess predominance, which I think is the challenge here. And to take a hypothetical, let's say you're trying to select people for a particular board or something; and you say they have to come from a city with more than 500,000 people, absolutely."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,108.565,112.99,"Well, in this case, under the jurisprudence of -- of --"
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,112.99,115.02,I don't really care -- I'm not talking about this case.
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,116.265,128.89,"I think that you -- you can set aside the -- the population center, and you would look at the State of California as the predominant factor because it is the criteria to which all others must yield, and in this --"
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,128.89,135.6,"Well, how do you know that? I mean, it seems to me that the 500,000 is the criteria which -- to which all others might yield."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,135.6,142.39,"In -- in -- in that hypothetical, each of them might be an unyielding criteria."
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,142.39,142.79,Right.
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,142.79,144.59,"In this case, there is only one."
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,144.59,156.89,"Well, no, I know. That's why I'm looking -- that's why this is called a hypothetical, because it's not about the particular case. But I -- I -- obviously, what I'm trying to highlight is, ""predominant"" means one that dominates over all the others."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,156.89,157.095,Right.
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,157.095,161.94,And it's easy to imagine situations where you cannot say that one dominates over all the others.
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,161.94,162.2,I think --
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,162.2,164.095,So what do you do in a situation like that?
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,164.095,171.865,"I think I now understand your -- your question. In that case, neither criteria would predominate, because, in fact, neither one controls the other."
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,185.53,189.24,"Well, if you're still -- you're trying to figure out which -- which predominates."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,205.855,206.43,That -- that --
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,206.43,206.725,Right?
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,206.725,212.89,"Your Honor, that is one way that evidence is adduced to determine predominance."
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,212.89,213.03,Uh-huh.
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,213.03,214.77,But it is not the only way.
2016.15-680,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,246.47,248.52,What if the -- I'm sorry. Finish.
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,248.52,251.58,I -- and that's what this -- that's what happened in this instance.
2016.15-680,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,251.58,262.22,"What if the legislature says, look, we want to follow all the traditional districting, applying all the traditional districting factors."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,280.15,310.17,"It is predominance if race was the -- was the controlling factor in -- that could not yield in the drawing of the districts. Now, it may very well be that when the Court then completes its inquiry, there will be a strong basis in evidence that -- that drawing the districts that way was to comply with a good faith understanding of the Voting Rights Act, and then the -- the State wins. In this case, though, what the State did is it started with an --"
2016.15-680,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,310.17,322.915,"I didn't really understand the answer to the question. If the court says -- if the State says, the one thing we absolutely do not want is to be found to violate the -- the Voting Rights Act, that is not -- that -- that is not necessarily predominance, in your view?"
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,322.915,324.85,That is not necessarily predominance.
2016.15-680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,362.62,400.405,"What -- what is your evidence of that? I mean, look, which I'm sure you've read, in -- in the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus, which I had hopped would end these cases in this Court, which it certainly doesn't seem to have done -- all right? But if you make the comparison, it isn't enough, I don't think, for you to say that they just saw some traditional factors; and they didn't take into account other evidence that they were using race predominantly. Well, if you look at the other evidence on page 1271, you know, the west thing, it was pretty strong evidence."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,407.53,407.79,Right.
2016.15-680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,407.79,413.64,"Now, is there -- and when you looked at their use of the factors, of the traditional factors, they were pretty irrelevant."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,413.64,413.99,Right.
2016.15-680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,413.99,419.245,"It makes a point of that in the opinion, and that -- that that's meant to guide the district judges."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,431.719,436.825,His mistake is setting an arbitrary threshold at 55 percent.
2016.15-680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,436.825,437.41,No.
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,449.25,449.715,I think --
2016.15-680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,449.715,453.52,"You saw the 17 -- 15,785. That's pretty strong."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,453.52,456.81,I think if you look at District 71 --
2016.15-680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,456.81,457.16,Okay.
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,457.16,457.85,Okay.
2016.15-680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,515.7,527.97,"What was the number, roughly, of the new people in the district? How many are black? How many white? Of the people who were moved out of the district, how many were black, how many were white, approximately?"
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,527.97,542.93,"They -- they -- the -- I don't have the precise number that were moved in and out, but there were a significant number, in the -- in the many thousands of voters who were moved in and many thousands who were moved out."
2016.15-680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,542.93,549.375,"But giving a number matters, because, after all, the -- the -- that was the key factor in Swann."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,549.375,550.21,"Right, and I think that --"
2016.15-680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,550.21,551.095,How do I find that?
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,551.095,554.515,I think it's on -- it's in the Joint Appendix on 669.
2016.15-680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,568.635,570.81,I found what I wanted to know.
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,570.81,570.9,Okay.
2016.15-680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,570.9,572.41,I just wanted to know where to look.
2016.15-680,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,572.41,594.07,"Mr. Elias, could I make sure I understand: What's your view of -- let's -- let's -- the policy here says 55 percent, and it says that across the board as to each of these 12 districts, and it says, effectively, this is the most important criteria, in the sense that it will trump other things."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,603.55,604.14,That is correct.
2016.15-680,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,604.14,612.3,And why is that? When would such -- when would such a policy not have the requisite impact on a voting district?
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,612.3,612.64,Right.
2016.15-680,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,638.95,647.595,"So we really are looking to what Justice Breyer suggested, which is, we're -- we're looking to the movement of voters in and out of a particular district?"
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,647.595,651.43,"Yes, and I don't think that that is at -- at -- in dispute."
2016.15-680,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,672.11,681.44,"Even -- even if we concede that there were -- you know, essentially, all the African-Americans were moved in and all the -- the -- the whites were moved out."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,681.53,684.955,And even if it was done by an -- for an avowedly racial reason.
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,718.18,719.215,So you're saying -- yeah.
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,724.19,724.57,Correct.
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,724.57,739.19,"But do you agree with the Solicitor General that say -- who says, nonetheless, that -- that -- quoting on page 8 of their brief -- in the vast majority of cases, a conflict may be necessary evidence to establish racial predominance?"
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,739.19,741.22,I think that that overstates it slightly.
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,748.0,761.8,"Well, even if you're saying not in the vast majority, but in the majority, or -- why is that? Based on -- on your answer to Justice Kagan, why is it that you're almost -- almost always or vast majority for the SG, or something less than that in your --"
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,761.8,772.98,"I -- I -- I think the reason is because in the real world, the way in which population distributes, you're going to need to create bizarre districts in many instances, in many parts of the country."
2016.15-680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,819.69,821.3,We haven't said that for a reason.
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,827.88,828.115,Correct.
2016.15-680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,828.115,846.885,"And -- and my problem with your argument here, if you want to go on the -- what the district court said there, which you may be right, but this is such a complicated area that it's the easiest thing in the world to go through a district court lengthy opinion and to find a sentence that's not exactly right."
2016.15-680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,846.885,862.06,"And that's why it seems to me, if we're going to have a -- ever have districting done back in the legislatures, rather than in the courts, you've got to prove your case that, not only did what he say was wrong, but it mattered, with pretty strong evidence."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,862.06,878.97,"I -- I agree, Justice Breyer. I -- but -- but I'd make two points in response. Number one, this was not a stray sentence. This is the -- the -- in every one of those hundred-plus pages, this is the test he applies, over and over and over again."
2016.15-680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,926.835,942.72,"So are you proposing that we remand, we tell the district court, you applied the wrong standard, and that the right standard is race can predominate, even if there's no distortion of the shape of the district? Is that -- is that the relief you're --"
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,942.72,946.4,"I think that -- I think that that is -- that is an appropriate relief, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,959.35,959.63,It's kind of --
2016.15-680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,959.63,959.95,I'm sorry.
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,959.95,969.875,"I was going to say: It's kind of hard to do it just with respect to one, isn't it? Because that means, okay, you can't pull these voters in, so you've got to push them back, and now all of a sudden that other district has an issue."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,969.875,973.49,"I -- I -- I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that's a -- that's a fair point."
2016.15-680,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1039.025,1061.505,"Just if I -- so I can understand your sense of the relative strengths of your arguments, if we did remand, say, this is the wrong standard, go apply the right standard, and -- and that was done fairly, where do you think he would have to change his view, where do you think that there would be a question, and where do you think the same result would probably obtain?"
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,1061.505,1064.905,So I'd like to say there would be new results everywhere.
2016.15-680,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1139.23,1149.66,"But -- but as to 75, did he not say that strict scrutiny was met, because other legitimate and -- and conventional factors were considered and were present?"
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,1149.66,1150.49,He did find --
2016.15-680,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1150.49,1155.64,It seems to me that 75 is the -- is the strongest case for the district court.
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,1155.64,1173.005,"I think 75 is the strongest case in the sense that the application of the wrong legal test, he still found that we met -- that we met our burden of -- of -- of predominance. I think it is a weak finding on the part of the district court in this regard, Your Honor."
2016.15-680,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1248.595,1258.795,Wasn't there a primary in 2005 in that district where Representative Tyler won over a white candidate by less than 300 votes?
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,1258.795,1259.44,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-680,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1322.78,1327.14,"I thought she won by only, like, 1 1/2 percentage points in the general."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,1327.14,1340.08,"In the general. So what happened next is that the incumbent, who had retired, whose son had run against her in the primary, who she had beaten, he then endorses the Republican opponent."
2016.15-680,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1347.09,1350.94,"But these -- these districts are going to last for a decade, are they not?"
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,1350.94,1351.4,Correct.
2016.15-680,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1351.4,1356.26,And -- and there's no guarantee that these same candidates are going to be running throughout that decade.
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,1356.26,1356.7,I agree.
2016.15-680,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1356.7,1365.2,"So you think they have to take into account this very complicated analysis: Well, it was the -- the person is an incumbent, and therefore is going to have the incumbent's advantage, and --"
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,1365.2,1376.24,"No, Your Honor, I'm saying the complete opposite. I'm saying that in 2001, 2003, 2007, 2009, this was -- this performed without a close election."
2016.15-680,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1387.935,1390.21,"Which you're saying, essentially, is idiosyncratic."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,1390.21,1392.5,It's -- it's an idiosyncratic one election.
2016.15-680,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1403.91,1405.645,"Well, I mean, that gets to an interesting point."
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,1414.855,1415.57,"I think it -- yeah, I --"
2016.15-680,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1415.57,1416.81,I don't want to take up your response.
2016.15-680,0,62677,mark_e_elias,,1416.81,1421.16,"I think it is likely. If there are no other questions, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time."
2016.15-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1421.16,1428.35,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gornstein."
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1428.35,1465.455,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court was right to hold that the use of a racial target is not sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny, but it was wrong to hold that a conflict with traditional redistricting principles is an essential element of a racial gerrymandering claim. On the use of a racial target, the Court's cases have drawn a distinction between the use of race as a factor and the predominant use of race in drawing district lines, and the use of a racial target shows that race was used."
2016.15-680,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1531.18,1538.14,"Maybe I missed your -- you're saying, if it was 75, and it's down to 50, that does not necessarily mean --"
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1538.14,1539.91,"No, I -- I -- I did not say that."
2016.15-680,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1546.13,1546.49,Okay.
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1550.7,1550.84,Right.
2016.15-680,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1550.84,1551.495,And then they --
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1551.495,1554.76,And so they could end up anywhere between 70 and 50.
2016.15-680,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1589.41,1589.95,So are those --
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1589.95,1591.895,-- you're going to end up above 50 percent.
2016.15-680,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1591.895,1610.115,"Are these the only kind of districts where you would say that a target would not have an impact on district lines? In other words, where the district has a population that's so far above the target that nothing that they're doing on the margins is affected by the target, are those the only kind?"
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1610.115,1625.95,"No, I would not say that, because I -- I would say districts, for example, like in this case where you start at 60, there's no -- no reason, necessarily, to think that race is going to predominate in order to bring the districts into compliance with the Voting Rights Act."
2016.15-680,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1636.53,1640.39,What if you started at 53 and you brought it up to 55?
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1640.39,1642.35,"Again, I -- I'm -- I'm with you on there."
2016.15-680,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1647.38,1649.9,More evidence of what? That --
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1649.9,1657.41,"Well, so -- so the most important evidence, Justice Alito, would be a conflict with traditional redistricting principles."
2016.15-680,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1667.63,1672.335,"What if they said, well, we're at 53; we have a 55 percent floor."
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1679.36,1689.075,"So, ordinarily speaking, it's going to be very difficult to show that race predominated without showing a conflict with traditional redistricting principles."
2016.15-680,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1693.77,1701.165,"When, then, can you? What would be a case in which that might be possible? Not theoretically possible, but you can imagine it happening?"
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1701.165,1721.14,"So I -- I we have two examples in our brief, and -- and most of the cases I can think of are -- are -- are but variations of those. So the first relies on direct evidence from the mapmaker himself, and the second is where the State's nonracial explanation is discredited by the evidence to be more concrete."
2016.15-680,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1761.6,1761.84,There's no way --
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1761.84,1762.34,-- lines.
2016.15-680,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1762.34,1768.15,"And -- and maybe there's no way around this; but this is all, as you -- as you lay it out, very, very complicated."
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1801.36,1801.42,So --
2016.15-680,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1801.42,1802.72,-- in every one of these instances?
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1802.72,1811.97,So we're very sympathetic to the interest of the State in being able to comply with the Voting Rights Act while simultaneously pursuing its traditional redistricting policies.
2016.15-680,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1837.005,1847.22,"Is it still the office's position that it would preferable to have the test that was adopted by the district court here, requiring a conflict before you find that race predominated?"
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1847.22,1851.7,So putting aside the question of whether it would -- you would -- overruling the Court's --
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1851.7,1858.96,"-- decisions, yes, except that we wouldn't want that to bleed over into racial vote dilution claims."
2016.15-680,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1858.96,1865.185,So -- so your objection to the court below is that it required a conflict?
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1865.185,1865.75,Correct.
2016.15-680,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1865.75,1872.12,"And in your brief, you say, in the vast majority, your words, of cases, you will need to show a conflict?"
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1872.12,1872.895,Correct.
2016.15-680,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1872.895,1878.56,"And you think showing a conflict should be the correct legal standard, putting aside the decisions?"
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1878.56,1881.75,"Well, I wouldn't want to urge the Court to overrule its decisions in --"
2016.15-680,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1881.75,1882.07,"No, I know."
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1882.8,1888.935,"-- those cases -- for that -- but putting aside, that is the position that we advocated in -- in -- or a version of it in Miller."
2016.15-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1888.935,1908.555,"But in -- in -- in the Alabama case, certainly what I tried to do, changing what my position had been previously, in order to get a court that would have a clear set of standards, on page 1271 there are two paragraphs that address the issue you're talking about, and they virtually say what you say."
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1936.62,1936.95,No.
2016.15-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1952.81,1955.03,"Right, correct, exactly. It's predominant."
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1967.29,1968.17,Yes.
2016.15-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1969.465,1970.13,Pretty much.
2016.15-680,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1970.13,1972.435,What is it -- what is it -- what is it that you said?
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1972.435,1975.615,I think that what we said -- (Laughter.)
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1975.615,1995.97,"I think what we said are two things. One, that there -- that simply because you use a racial target, you're not in strict scrutiny, and that's from Alabama; and, two, a conflict is not essential to prove a claim; but, three, there has to be pretty strong evidence besides just the use of the racial target to put you in strict scrutiny."
2016.15-680,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1997.04,2002.065,"May I ask, Mr. -- Mr. Gornstein, the -- the same question I asked Mr. Elias."
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2020.665,2025.915,"So we've only done a close analysis of three districts, as you can see from our brief."
2016.15-680,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2034.975,2036.78,But a strong case that it would change?
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2036.78,2037.47,It would change.
2016.15-680,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2037.47,2038.675,And those districts are?
2016.15-680,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2038.675,2040.0,Those are 71 and 95.
2016.15-680,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.0,2049.39,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement."
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2049.39,2058.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The 2011 redistricting of the Virginia House of Delegates was a bipartisan success story."
2016.15-680,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2083.96,2087.52,How was the 55 percent arrived at?
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2087.52,2094.55,"55 percent, the testimony in the record, Justice Ginsburg, shows that was arrived at by the members of the bipartisan Privileges and Election Committee."
2016.15-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2135.2,2146.22,"I thought, Mr. Clement, that the -- the 55 percent was based on a single district, 75; and that they said, okay, we've looked at 75."
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2157.115,2161.48,"I don't think the record would support that characterization of the evidence, Justice Kagan."
2016.15-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2194.81,2209.475,Isn't there something a bit strange about this kind of rule? And it's not to say that this kind of rule is the end all and be all. You -- it might be that you can have this rule and still be absolutely fine in the way that Mr. Gornstein suggested.
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2234.92,2244.89,"Well, Justice Kagan, I think that maybe if you were picking one number for every district in the state, from Big Stone Gap to Arlington, maybe that would be the case."
2016.15-680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2294.1,2295.35,Let's talk about 71.
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2295.35,2295.78,Sure.
2016.15-680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2295.78,2298.11,"Now, I have a particular question on 71."
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2299.87,2300.21,Sure.
2016.15-680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2300.21,2308.05,"At least in Alabama. The -- the Court's cases, at that moment, pre-Alabama, I -- I'm one of the problems."
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2346.785,2347.16,Right.
2016.15-680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2347.16,2350.275,"Now, let's look at 71. Same kind of thing they are arguing."
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2412.76,2420.83,"And I'm -- I'm glad to be focused on District 71, because what the district court did is not apply any sort of cartoonish analysis."
2016.15-680,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2475.76,2479.31,Suppose you have two district -- or two possible districts.
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2503.57,2510.06,I would say that the right answer to that in -- when -- for predominance within the meaning of your Court's cases is no.
2016.15-680,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2511.7,2539.36,"That -- and that's what the district court says, and I have -- I have problems with that, because predominance is designed to measure intent when there are multiple causes, and in my -- in my hypothetical, the hypothetical is, the -- the -- the tipping point, the principal motivating factor was race. And you say that because -- and the district court I think said because the districts are conventional in all other respects, strict scrutiny doesn't apply."
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2540.71,2541.21,Okay.
2016.15-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2649.44,2649.9,"But, Mr. Clement --"
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2649.9,2651.785,-- by bringing junior varsity -- I'm sorry.
2016.15-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2651.785,2652.53,"No, please."
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2652.53,2677.685,"People are bringing junior varsity dilution claims under the guise of calling them Shaw claims, and I think it's really distorted the law. The third point, just to put it on the table, is that at some point then you have to ask the question -- if -- if you disagree with me on those first two points and you actually think you have a different conception of what a Shaw claim is, there still has to be the question of is the game worth the candle given the stated need to defer to State legislatures."
2016.15-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2688.0,2707.96,"Just -- yeah, no, just going back to Justice Kennedy's question, it seems pretty clear to me that in the cases after Shaw -- because Shaw, you could have looked at it as, this is all about the way the district looks, and then in the cases after Shaw, in Shaw II, and in Miller, the Court makes very clear that it's not all about the way the district looks, and indeed --"
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2707.96,2715.6,"But can I -- can I stop you there, though, and say: In Miller, what this Court confronted was an argument that bizarreness is an element of the claim."
2016.15-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2720.055,2738.055,"If you look at Shaw and Shaw II and you look at Miller, and then you think about the -- the hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave you, which is essentially -- maybe I'll change it a little bit -- it's essentially a mapmaker who says, look, we really want to do race-based districting here."
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2761.045,2765.59,I don't think that you have to read those decisions in that way.
2016.15-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2793.95,2807.635,"Well, then I'm with Justice Breyer, who suggested that a few years ago we took those concerns into account and we tried to figure out a test that was responsive to those concerns, and that is not the test that the district court used here."
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2807.635,2808.81,I -- I beg to differ.
2016.15-680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2837.47,2842.885,"That's -- that's what I have to do after this argument, isn't it? I mean, you gave me exactly what I needed."
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2876.145,2876.78,Absolutely.
2016.15-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3071.58,3073.335,"You absolutely don't, Mr. Clement."
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3134.055,3137.56,"Well, I'm with a lot of what you had to say, Justice Kagan."
2016.15-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3361.49,3387.62,"I think the -- the real difference between your standard and the SG's standard is that in your standard, the shape of a district functions as a threshold inquiry such that if the shape is okay, we don't look at anything else, and particularly we don't look even if the districting was completely race-based in motive."
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3406.985,3419.44,"Well, Justice Kagan, first of all, I think the real difference between our position and the SG's position is a difference in the real world, which is, they admit it's not going to make a difference in 99 percent of the cases."
2016.15-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3508.47,3510.35,"Well, it's more than a theoretical possibility."
2016.15-680,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3530.315,3538.15,"Well, I would put, representing the State Legislature of Virginia, my bona fides in looking out for the State's even ahead of Mr. Gornstein's."
2016.15-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3558.96,3563.975,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Elias, you have two minutes left."
2016.15-680,3,62677,mark_e_elias,,3563.975,3578.435,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to clarify a few factual points and obviously answer any questions you have. The first is, the timing of this case followed the Page decision."
2016.15-680,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3633.68,3636.23,You make a point of that.
2016.15-680,3,62677,mark_e_elias,,3636.23,3636.525,Yes.
2016.15-680,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3637.425,3644.35,"I mean, I think I heard the -- Mr. Clement say that, well, no, this has all been brought up after the case was over, and --"
2016.15-680,3,62677,mark_e_elias,,3644.35,3646.7,"Your Honor, it's in our expert's report from trial."
2016.15-680,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3650.46,3651.47,You called it to the attention --
2016.15-680,3,62677,mark_e_elias,,3651.47,3654.945,-- we called it -- it was in our expert's report at -- at trial.
2016.15-680,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3697.415,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
