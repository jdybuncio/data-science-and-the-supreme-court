1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,202.977,207.893,"I certainly wish we could, the answer to Your Honor's question is, yes, (Inaudible) which has mean nothing."
1958.429,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,577.131,579.901,"I didn't (Inaudible), I mean, the results, did it?"
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,579.901,595.195,"Well, you -- you have -- you have more than pleased that man interested in seamen's right since then by telling us point blank, we're entitled to the practical proposition that confront us, not theoretical."
1958.429,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,692.386,695.275,Every -- I mean these problems in this can either all of them if --
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,695.275,695.973,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.429,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,697.087,698.988,You've all considered the seamen beyond that?
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,698.988,700.301,"Yes, no question about it."

1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,715.164,716.02,Yes.
1958.429,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,716.02,718.709,Then that's not a problem because that's -- I supposed that will --
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,718.709,721.525,"Well, I can -- I certainly can ask you to revise yourself --"
1958.429,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,721.525,721.595,Yes.
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,721.624,723.378,-- whether you'll do it or not is another story.
1958.429,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,723.378,725.473,I just want to know what -- what it is we are taking in this --
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,725.473,728.209,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I've never hedged."
1958.429,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,728.209,730.695,We had no -- with no problem being with a seamen?
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,730.695,730.755,That's right.
1958.429,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,730.755,734.394,"They're free, the merchant men which we have to decide again on public --"
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,734.394,736.777,"Well, frankly I can't see the difference."
1958.429,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,736.777,737.106,Pardon me.
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,737.106,738.328,"I -- frankly, I can't see the --"
1958.429,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,738.328,739.514,Neither was Judge Hand.
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,739.514,740.395,That's right.
1958.429,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,746.456,749.299,(Voice Overlap) -- to reconsider your answer?
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,749.299,749.907,Precisely.
1958.429,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,749.907,751.707,All right.
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,751.707,757.302,I -- and I'm not going to try and get a victory on the technicality in which I personally have no confidence.
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,773.404,781.974,"I don't quite understand that Mr. Rassner, maybe I have -- perhaps, I haven't quite completely followed your argument but what -- what's this business of what's in the number five hold --"
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,781.974,793.426,"Whether the vessel is privately the operator, operators of merchant vessel by the U.S. Government or operated as a public vessel, let's say, carrying war supplies or soldiers."
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,810.793,810.918,"Well, it depends on --"
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,810.918,811.76,The debate --
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,811.76,813.087,"-- who's operating the ship, doesn't it?"
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,813.087,813.441,No.
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,816.683,817.962,"Well, that's what I didn't follow."
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,817.962,830.859,"Oh, it depends on what type of cargo the vessel is carrying whether it is a public vessel so that it may not be subject to suit if the Johansen and Mendel cases are affirmed."
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,830.859,832.361,Whether it's a public vessel or a merchant vessel --
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,832.361,833.97,Or a private seems to be the question.
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,833.97,835.871,--or a merchant vessel operated by the government in both cases.
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,835.871,839.456,It seems to be that that seems to be the station left open in the -- in those last two --
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,839.456,842.058,But that's a distinction that you at least don't --
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,842.058,842.727,I can't because --
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,842.727,844.077,-- think it has any validity at all.
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,844.077,845.938,I can't see it.
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,848.326,849.128,"Yes, I understand."
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,849.128,851.424,"But, I can't go ahead and urge that."
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,851.424,853.689,That's the distinction that the Eight Circuit saw.
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,853.689,853.985,Yes.
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,853.985,855.207,That the Second Circuit could not see.
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,855.207,855.775,That's right.
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,858.125,858.812,I understand that.
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,858.812,866.777,But I do think it's about time that we went along but didn't what the concept of this Court that we are dealing with the realistic problem.
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1126.921,1128.784,"Mr. Rassner, just before you sit down."
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,1128.784,1130.118,Yes sir.
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1130.118,1133.746,We're reflecting your very admirable candor.
1958.429,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,1138.214,1138.995,Yes sir.
1958.429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1138.995,1145.917,Yes.
1958.429,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1145.917,1148.441,Mr. Colby.
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1148.441,1153.713,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1958.429,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1244.059,1259.211,"May I -- may I interrupt Mr. Colby, what was -- was there any explicit explanation for -- for that provision that you just stated, or the case they had fail in other remedies?"
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1259.211,1261.323,Yes.
1958.429,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1475.94,1477.304,What does that mean Mr. Colby?
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1477.304,1479.111,The regular government seamen?
1958.429,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1521.635,1522.182,Ellis Island.
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1522.182,1523.065,Ellis Island.
1958.429,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1523.065,1527.181,Are these largely covered under the Civil Service Law?
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1527.181,1532.812,"Well, if Your Honor please, they are excepted positions in the Civil Service."
1958.429,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1545.489,1551.973,"Well, what I'm trying to get at is, do they have certain Civil Service Law benefit by reason of their government service?"
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1551.973,1563.443,"Well, if Your Honor please, if you mean by Civil Service Law benefits, matters of status and things like that, no, but neither do I."
1958.429,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1590.763,1597.196,"Well, how about the protections against discharge in discipline, and all that sort of things, are those from the Civil Service Law defined?"
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1597.196,1599.789,I think you can say in general that they don't.
1958.429,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1599.789,1600.059,Do not?
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1600.059,1608.688,"They are in excepted positions just like attorneys are in excepted positions and most of this kind of thing doesn't apply, some of it does."
1958.429,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1827.288,1830.949,He gets compensation for claiming which?
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1830.949,1833.601,"Well, I mean of course, if he is entitled to claim it."
1958.429,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1833.601,1834.249,Entitled?
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1834.249,1834.901,Is he -- if he is covered by --
1958.429,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1834.901,1837.472,(Voice Overlap) -- if he -- if he's covered.
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1839.364,1840.04,"Now, --"
1958.429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1840.04,1849.004,"Well, I -- I understand then that you and Mr. Rassner do not differ in your reading of the Johansen case, is that your understanding?"
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1849.004,1850.779,"Oh, I would hesitate to say --"
1958.429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1850.779,1851.198,"Well, I'd say --"
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1851.198,1851.835,"-- say that, I mean --"
1958.429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1851.835,1853.901,"-- I mean, to speak for him of course but --"
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1853.901,1856.389,He says yes.
1958.429,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2230.564,2233.977,Is that -- if that's what -- I'm sorry to interrupt you.
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,2243.363,2243.657,"Yes, sir."
1958.429,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2243.657,2246.619,"-- to employees of the ship -- War Shipping Board, that's what he's referring to, is it?"
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,2246.619,2247.001,"Yes, sir."
1958.429,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2349.714,2358.636,"Well, what is the man in an ambiguous situation so that legally speaking, he definitely know (Inaudible) could find out of what agencies and employee?"
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,2358.636,2362.731,I don't think there's the slightest bit of difficulty Mr. Justice.
1958.429,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2515.025,2524.048,"Well, in any event Mr. Colby, did you tell us earlier that if one mistake is granted and sue rather than seeking compensation."
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,2528.235,2534.191,"Well now, I wouldn't want you to think that Mr. Justice because that's true with this -- respect to this man in this law suit."
1958.429,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2601.606,2607.209,"As to these -- as to the case and actually before the Court, your answer is unequivocal that they are covered."
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,2607.209,2608.06,That's right.
1958.429,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2608.859,2614.568,"And as to the future, except if they're outside of the five years span, any decision this Court may make will take care of that."
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,2614.568,2616.148,Will take care of them.

1958.429,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2650.309,2652.691,-- that's right under the Compensation Act?
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,2652.691,2667.183,"Ordinarily, his superior who of course has to make a report on this on the form CA2 gives him a form CA1 and says, “Will you fill this out or shall I send it in?”"
1958.429,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2677.759,2684.281,"Mr. Colby, so long since I've been in the Government service, what is CA1 or CA -- what are these cabalistic --"
1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,2684.281,2687.232,These are those -- those lovely governmental things.
1958.429,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2693.878,2695.429,(Inaudible)

1958.429,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,2699.614,2711.777,"That is correct Mr. Justice, if you -- if you wanted to -- if someone wanted to make a claim for your burial expenses, I believe you are entitled to -- your estate is entitled -- excuse me to --"

1958.429,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2819.288,2821.313,Mr. Rassner.
1958.429,2,32702,jacob_rassner,,2821.313,2835.632,"I was wondering if solely in the interest of the savings some work for the Court, if I could point out some of the matters that Mr. Colby and I are in accord and then show where it stems from."
1958.429,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2847.319,2847.602,Yes.
1958.429,2,32702,jacob_rassner,,2848.282,2850.543,It might be helpful.
1958.429,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2878.277,2878.543,Go right ahead.
1958.429,2,32702,jacob_rassner,,2878.543,2879.602,Thank you.

1958.429,2,32702,jacob_rassner,,2891.523,2892.231,I suppose I think I could do --
1958.429,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2892.231,2894.532,You may respond if you wish Mr. Colby.
1958.429,2,32702,jacob_rassner,,2894.532,2898.228,I -- I could probably do in five or 10 pages where it would take me two hours.
