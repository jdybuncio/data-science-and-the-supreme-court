1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,64.068,"We will hear argument next in No. 78-6885, Hicks v. Oklahoma."
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,66.097,69.168,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-6885,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.68,240.307,Do you think Thigpen rested on state constitutional grounds or federal constitutional grounds?
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,240.307,256.701,"Your Honor, I think it rested on federal constitutional grounds, although it doesn't say so in the opinion, and my opinion that it rests on federal grounds rests on the fact that the appendix attached to the opinion is premised upon federal grounds, and it appears to have been cited with approval by the majority opinion."
1979.78-6885,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.701,258.161,The District Court of Oklahoma?
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,258.161,259.834,That's correct.
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,259.834,265.5,"So when you said a little while ago that Oklahoma has two statutes, you really mean now it has only one?"
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,265.5,267.571,"That's correct, Your Honor, now it has one."
1979.78-6885,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.571,275.382,"Well, what if we were to conclude that Thigpen was incorrectly, decided as a matter of federal constitutional law?"
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,275.382,284.357,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that that issue isn't directly before this Court because Thigpen was not appealed here."
1979.78-6885,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,301.012,306.704,"Well, there is a certain abstraction about the whole thing perhaps on both sides."
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,335.218,345.757,"No, I don't think the statute is in existence any more because it has been declared unconstitutional by a final decision by the state's highest court before this case ever came up here."
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,345.757,356.665,"Your view is that unless the state took an appeal to this Court on the assumption that there was a federal question involved, they have acquiesced in that matter?"
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,356.665,357.741,That's correct.
1979.78-6885,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,361.51,391.464,"Let me ask you this Supposing that after Thigpen had been decided and after this case had been decided one way or the other, this Court were to come down with a square ruling that indicated that made clear that Thigpen was wrongly decided if it rested on federal constitutional grounds, would you then say that Oklahoma legislature had to enact a new statute rather than simply having the old one revived?"
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,391.464,392.702,"Oh, absolutely, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,407.983,409.97,What is your authority for that?
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,409.97,421.2,"I don't have any to cite to you at this time, Your Honor, but I believe that to be the law."
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,476.273,487.795,"When Thigpen was decided during the pendency of this appeal, could the state have gone back to the process of new sentencing?"
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,492.22,495.163,"I don't think you need to reconstitute the original jury, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,501.114,512.534,"If we hypothetically agreed with you now, would Oklahoma assemble a jury and go through the sentencing process under the surviving statute?"
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,512.534,515.746,"Yes, I believe so, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,515.746,519.033,And he might get 40 years or he might not get 40 years.
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,519.033,521.914,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,521.914,528.431,"It is mandatory under 51(B) but permissive under 51(A), is that correct?"
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,528.431,534.211,"That's correct, and 51(B) is what has been thrown out and which we think is now a final decision in the State of Oklahoma."
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,539.498,548.929,"You probably can't tell us, but was there any indication that you are aware of that the state considered that possibility?"
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,548.929,550.132,Of reenacting 51(B)?
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,550.132,554.542,"No, of a new sentencing, remanding."
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,554.542,559.522,"Your Honor, there appears to be no indication that the Court of Criminal Appeals considered that."
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,568.108,572.605,"And you say that when the Supreme Court did that, they were usurping the jury's function."
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,572.605,576.418,Absolutely.
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,576.418,578.402,Perhaps the state will tell us about that a little later.
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,578.402,580.533,All right.
1979.78-6885,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,611.205,615.35,I want to be sure I understand your position.
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,642.492,652.343,"Your Honor, they didn't impose a new length of sentence, they incorporated the old length but they based the sentence upon a different statute."
1979.78-6885,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,675.681,676.858,"Well, they don't say that."
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,676.858,677.223,"Well, the Oklahoma --"
1979.78-6885,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,677.223,681.223,"You may be right as a matter of Oklahoma law, but that is not what their opinion says."
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,681.223,688.575,"Well, I think, Your Honor, it in essence does say that because it says that we are going to sentence under 51(A), it is a different statutory --"
1979.78-6885,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,688.575,689.557,It does not say that.
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,709.317,710.29,Your Honor --
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,713.082,721.318,"I understand your point to be that the jury was instructed that it had to return a 40year sentence, is that it?"
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,721.318,727.101,If the jury was instructed it had to return a 40-year sentence if it found that Hicks had two prior felony convictions.
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,727.101,729.275,And there is no dispute that he had two prior felonies?
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,729.275,731.244,No dispute.
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,731.244,747.084,So I take it your argument is now that the court was exercising a discretion which under 51(A) could only be exercised by a jury which might have given only a ten-year bonus instead of a twenty-year bonus.
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,747.084,749.469,That's correct.
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,749.469,755.842,"But Justice Stevens is quite right, the court didn't say this flatly."
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,755.842,762.697,"Well, the court may not have used the word ""resentenced,"" but the court has said everything but that."
1979.78-6885,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,789.066,792.915,I'm not sure you are making your strongest argument.
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,792.915,798.272,"Well, if that is true, then several things have happened that have violated Hicks' due process rights."
1979.78-6885,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,807.55,813.346,"Well, that doesn't involve a federal question, does it?"
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,813.346,815.212,"Oh, I think it does, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,827.535,838.13,You mean if a -- do you think it is unconstitutional for an appellate court to sentence?
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,838.13,839.72,"No, Your Honor, I --"
1979.78-6885,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,839.72,841.476,I mean a state appellate court to sentence.
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,841.476,848.989,"I think if the laws permit it and if the appellate court gives the defendant notice and a hearing, then an appellate court may impose sentence."
1979.78-6885,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,848.989,875.712,"Well, if an Oklahoma appellate court from time to time says it is not inconsistent with Oklahoma law in any way, every now and then we will just sentence ourselves when we think the defendant deserves it, the state statute may say something but we will just sentence him ourselves."
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,877.231,877.959,I think so.
1979.78-6885,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,893.146,898.946,But isn't the state court's reading of its own law the final version of it so far as we are concerned?
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,898.946,906.437,"Well, the state court here never interpreted 926 as having been abrogated by any abilities that it had."
1979.78-6885,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,927.597,945.671,But isn't there a presumption of validity to a conviction coming from a state court that the state has at least insofar as its own laws are concerned read those laws as they had to be read because it is the final interpreter of them?
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,945.671,948.921,"I don't know of any presumption of validity, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.273,976.146,That just assumes that it isn't following its own law.
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,1000.293,1006.739,"Well, the Oklahoma court didn't say that what it was doing was not inconsistent with Oklahoma law."
1979.78-6885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1021.592,1025.268,There is nothing implicit in that.
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,1033.478,1040.643,"Well, if there is such an implicit holding, then I think state courts are courts are virtually immune from any challenge that they are not following their own laws."
1979.78-6885,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1040.643,1041.814,It has to be implicit.
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,1047.749,1047.919,I don't --
1979.78-6885,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1047.919,1051.344,They must have implicitly thought that it didn't.
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,1051.344,1062.136,"I think what they said was this may not comply with all the procedural safeguards we have, but we don't think it is prejudicing Hicks and so why does he care, because we are going to give him the same length of sentence."
1979.78-6885,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1062.136,1065.64,The question here is whether there is some federal constitutional right.
1979.78-6885,0,20802,david_m_ebel,,1073.496,1073.767,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,1,29381,janet_l_cox,,1073.767,1074.735,You have given us one.
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1075.478,1076.135,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1084.454,1087.521,Before the Supreme Court of the state could impose the sentence?
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1087.521,1089.373,Before anyone can impose a sentence.
1979.78-6885,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1089.373,1090.04,But the only one that --
1979.78-6885,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1090.04,1091.177,The court didn't say that.
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1101.088,1102.096,"Well, Your Honor --"
1979.78-6885,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1102.096,1106.816,Where did the Court of Appeals say we sentence you to blank years?
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1106.816,1107.725,Your Honor --
1979.78-6885,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1107.725,1110.332,"They didn't say that, did they?"
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1110.332,1114.474,"Well, the strongest syllogism I can argue on that is that --"
1979.78-6885,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1114.474,1116.469,"I am not asking for syllogism, I am asking for facts."
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1116.469,1126.972,"Well, they said that we are sentencing you -- they said you were sentenced under 51(B), that is an unconstitutional statute, but we don't think you are prejudiced if we affirm a 40-year sentence under 51(A)."
1979.78-6885,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1126.972,1129.59,"Well, isn't affirming different from sentencing?"
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1129.59,1132.384,"Well, I think it is a different word but I think it means the same thing."
1979.78-6885,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1132.384,1133.46,I see.
1979.78-6885,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1133.46,1143.738,"Well, they said we agree with you, Mr. Hicks, that the statute under which you were sentenced is unconstitutional."
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1147.474,1148.004,That's correct.
1979.78-6885,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1148.004,1149.492,It was a void or invalid sentence.
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1149.492,1150.277,That is what Oklahoma law says.
1979.78-6885,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1150.277,1155.886,"Therefore, if he is under any sentence at all, it has to be as a result of his sentence imposed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma."
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1155.886,1158.56,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1158.56,1169.752,And you say the Supreme Court has no authority to fix it at this 20 extra years.
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1169.752,1193.277,"What I would argue on the second point, Your Honor, is that we think the U.S. Constitution requires the defendant to have an opportunity for notice and a hearing before a sentence can be imposed, and we think that Hicks here did not have such an opportunity to present any evidence on his behalf under 51(A), and that that violates the United States Constitution quite apart from any of your readings of the Oklahoma law."
1979.78-6885,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1193.277,1205.247,And you think the only remedy available by the time the appeal was argued in the state Supreme Court was to send it back to the trial court for a new sentencing procedure under 51(A)?
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1205.247,1208.417,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1208.417,1219.196,"Because, as Mr. Justice Stewart suggested, at the time of the oral argument in that court, the Supreme Court, there was no valid sentence outstanding."
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1219.196,1227.272,"Right, and the Oklahoma court cases are absolutely explicit on that point, the Brown case and the other one that I cite in my brief."
1979.78-6885,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1235.821,1256.764,"I understood you to say before that you would be quite satisfied if the -- even if your client were not, as matter of law you would be quite satisfied if this Court were to have the case go back down through the Supreme Court to the trial court for resentencing under the procedure of 51(A)."
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1256.764,1258.591,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1258.591,1259.432,And you might --
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1259.432,1276.634,"Your Honor, not necessarily under 51(A), because our third argument is that we think 51(A) itself is unconstitutional on its face, but at least we would be satisfied if he were resentenced and we think the sentence ought to be conducted under the basic heroin statute rather than 51(A), but at least to be sentenced."
1979.78-6885,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1276.634,1279.369,That would avoid the enhancement of the sentence?
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1279.369,1286.011,"That's correct, and it would entitle him to be punished somewhere between five years and twenty which is the spread permitted under the --"
1979.78-6885,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1286.011,1292.75,"Then my first assumption has fallen apart, hasn't it, that you would be satisfied if it went back for resentencing."
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1300.514,1304.328,"Your Honor, what I meant to say was that we would be satisfied with resentencing."
1979.78-6885,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1334.987,1341.661,"That never having been decided in the Oklahoma court, it would be no question for us to reach here, would it?"
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1341.661,1345.118,"Well, it was not presented before the Oklahoma court, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1358.414,1363.531,"Are you talking about the state court, when the issue hasn't been raised and passed on by the state court?"
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1363.531,1365.021,"Well, I think that that would be --"
1979.78-6885,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1365.021,1367.429,Isn't that a jurisdictional question here?
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1367.429,1375.67,"Well, I think if this Court remands for sentencing under 51(A) and Hicks gets his sentence under 51(A) --"
1979.78-6885,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1375.67,1380.999,"Well, we wouldn't necessarily remand for sentence under 51(A), we would just remand."
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1380.999,1382.35,"Well, if Hicks then is resentenced under --"
1979.78-6885,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.35,1385.584,For resentencing.
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1385.584,1391.508,"I would say if Hicks is sentenced under 51(A), then we would have to come back before this Court to challenge --"
1979.78-6885,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1391.508,1402.906,"That is old hat, if this particular federal constitutional issue were not raised in the state court, if the validity of that statute wasn't raised and passed on, I don't think we can reach it here."
1979.78-6885,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1402.906,1411.071,"Isn't it true generally, Mr. Ebel, that in Oklahoma juries are given wide latitude in imposing sentences?"
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1412.149,1413.011,Yes.
1979.78-6885,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1413.011,1416.205,-- that a defendant has a right to be sentenced by the jury in most cases --
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1416.205,1418.144,Right.
1979.78-6885,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1418.144,1429.153,"-- without any standards, and that 51(A) which provides for repeat offenders, gives the jury discretion to impose any sentence between ten years and life, if I am not mistaken."
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1429.153,1429.416,That's correct.
1979.78-6885,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1429.416,1433.509,That is quite typical of Oklahoma sentencing procedures?
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1433.509,1433.856,I would --
1979.78-6885,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1433.856,1440.267,"It is longer than most, but typical in giving the jury no standards, and allowing the jury wide discretion."
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1440.267,1451.879,"I think that the typical statute in Oklahoma does not set any standards for the jury, but most of the statutes are like the heroin statute with a narrow range of five years to twenty, which we think is permissible."
1979.78-6885,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1454.09,1461.62,"Well, that range may seem narrow to you or me, but I don't know if it would be for the person sentenced."
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1463.247,1463.799,Right.
1979.78-6885,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1463.799,1469.477,When it is out of your own life.
1979.78-6885,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1469.477,1471.663,"You raise Eighth Amendment questions, too, I take it?"
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1471.663,1472.163,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1472.163,1473.059,And equal protection?
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1473.059,1475.535,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1475.535,1477.253,Are you just submitting them in your brief or --
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1477.253,1482.55,"Your Honor, I think probably I don't have the time to go into those in care."
1979.78-6885,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1500.745,1511.202,How many of these issues that you are relying on here did you assert as constitutional federal issues in the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals?
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1511.202,1526.65,"The only two that clearly were not raised below were our third and fourth due process arguments, that is the lack of standards in the sentence and the failure of the court to give any reasons for its sentence."
1979.78-6885,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1542.581,1545.096,You didn't argue the case then in the Court of Appeals?
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1545.096,1545.324,No.
1979.78-6885,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1571.556,1585.217,"Mr. Ebel, one of your due process arguments, as I understand it, is that whoever fixes the sentence, there should have been notice and an opportunity on behalf of the defendant to argue what the sentence should be."
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1585.217,1585.592,That's correct.
1979.78-6885,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.592,1597.457,"But he did not receive that in the trial court because the jury was instructed that there was a mandatory requirement of forty years, and he didn't receive it in the Court of Appeals because the Court of Appeals imposed the sentence."
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1621.651,1633.392,"Well, unless it is accepted by this Court that there is a right to be sentenced by a jury in Oklahoma and the failure to observe that right is itself a due process violation."
1979.78-6885,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1633.392,1641.148,"Well, we could send it back to the Court of Appeals and they could decide whether there is such a right in Oklahoma which they would be much better able to decide than we would."
1979.78-6885,2,20802,david_m_ebel,,1645.549,1655.406,"Well, we think, Your Honor, that the Oklahoma law is already clear on that, and this Court can decide that on the basis presented by the Court of Criminal Appeals which was that Hicks wasn't prejudiced."
1979.78-6885,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1674.904,1677.127,Mr. Cox.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1677.127,1680.63,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-6885,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1804.927,1807.631,"Ms. Cox, may I just be sure I understand you."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1817.724,1820.933,I am saying that they held it to be vague and illusory and because it --
1979.78-6885,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1820.933,1821.371,I understand.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1823.327,1828.989,"Yes, they did hold it unconstitutional but not on the basis of the federal constitutional issue, that it denied due process."
1979.78-6885,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1828.989,1833.816,"So we must accept that as a matter of state law that statute is unconstitutional, is that true?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1833.816,1841.412,"That is correct, and we are not trying to litigate the constitutionality of 51(B) but only as to what the court tried to do when it invalidated the statute."
1979.78-6885,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1841.412,1848.646,Then you disagree with your opposing counsel that Thigpen was based on federal constitutional grounds?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1848.646,1849.468,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1979.78-6885,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1854.485,1857.721,"For purposes of this case, it probably doesn't make any difference, does it?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1857.721,1869.909,"No, it really doesn't except that he has predicated the invalidation of section 51(B) on the fact that it voided the petitioner's sentence and therefore the Court of Criminal Appeals in effect resentenced the petitioner."
1979.78-6885,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1871.375,1876.383,That would be true regardless of the basis for declaring 51(B) unconstitutional.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1876.383,1877.8,That's true.
1979.78-6885,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1877.8,1885.582,"Hypothetically, if this case went back, have you suggested that the new jury could give a life sentence in the exercise of its discretion?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1885.582,1888.877,"Yes, I have, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1902.751,1914.191,"Now, Ms. Cox, you are emphasizing that and you have argued that and it is very clear from the statute that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals does have that revisory authority."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1923.63,1924.095,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1928.474,1931.146,"If they have acted at all, they have only decreased one?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1931.146,1939.824,"Yes, that's correct, either the same sentence or decrease it, which they have done under the decisions following Thigpen where the defendants were sentenced under section 51(B)."
1979.78-6885,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1942.899,1946.366,"But when you modify, it is only to decrease?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1946.366,1948.083,"Decrease, yes."
1979.78-6885,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1948.083,1952.71,You know of no case and in fact you doubt the power of the court to increase a sentence imposed by a jury.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1952.71,1956.342,I think it would be highly improper and an exercise of --
1979.78-6885,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1956.342,1958.331,"In any event, you know of no case where that was done?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1958.331,1959.182,"No, Your Honor, there has been none."
1979.78-6885,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1959.182,1962.028,"In fact, isn't that what was done here?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1970.915,1973.919,If you buy the premise that the sentence was void.
1979.78-6885,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.589,1986.319,"Well, is it your view -- let me just be sure I understand your theory."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,1992.116,1993.588,That is correct.
1979.78-6885,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1993.588,2000.439,Then where did the defendant get his opportunity to have somebody decide how long he should be in jail?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2000.439,2010.642,Because at the trial court level he was given an opportunity during the second stage of the proceedings to be represented by counsel to attack the underlying convictions.
1979.78-6885,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2014.049,2017.25,You said a moment ago that due process applies to the sentencing procedure.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2017.25,2021.15,"It does in the sense that the trial court level, and that is what we are talking about in this case."
1979.78-6885,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2021.15,2030.495,"Well, what due process was there if he had a right to have the jury decide between ten and forty and the judge said to the jury, you must give him forty?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2030.495,2035.441,"Because the sentencing statute, 51(B), required a mandatory imposition of 40 years."
1979.78-6885,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2041.753,2044.498,Except it was simply invalid in this case.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2044.498,2046.76,"That is what petitioner argues, it was simply invalid."
1979.78-6885,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2046.76,2052.088,"Maybe not improper if there had been a valid statute authorizing it, but there wasn't."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2052.088,2052.11,I would --
1979.78-6885,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.11,2056.458,"Do you think if they went back and did it all over again, the judge could give the same instruction?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2056.458,2065.4,"Well, section 51(B) has been reenacted, and that portion which would provide for the maximum under the underlying felony has been deleted from the statute."
1979.78-6885,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2067.811,2072.384,So your answer is that the same instruction could not be given.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2072.384,2074.984,"That's correct, because the statute has been amended."
1979.78-6885,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.984,2079.036,Then how can you defend the procedure in the trial court that was followed?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2080.918,2089.308,Because due process only affords the right for him to be represented by counsel to attack the underlying convictions.
1979.78-6885,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.38,2139.218,"Suppose he was resentenced before another jury under different instructions, could he say anything to the jury?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2143.13,2149.892,Oklahoma does not prohibit a defendant from coming before the jury to present mitigating circumstances during the second stage.
1979.78-6885,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.926,2162.543,But what good would it have done to present mitigating circumstances when the jury is told by the judge you've got to give him forty years?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2162.543,2163.87,"That is correct, but this Court has upheld --"
1979.78-6885,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.87,2165.614,"He still waives his right to do it, you say."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2165.614,2165.81,That's correct.
1979.78-6885,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.81,2168.693,When does the judge instruct the jury in Oklahoma?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2168.693,2174.703,"Following the presentation of the evidence and closing arguments by counsel, then he instructs the jury."
1979.78-6885,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.703,2179.46,So he is the last -- does counsel know what the instructions are going to be before they argue?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2179.46,2179.721,Yes.
1979.78-6885,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2182.63,2187.274,So they had been absolutely told what his instruction was going to be?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2187.274,2187.422,That's correct.
1979.78-6885,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2187.422,2190.15,The jury was going to be instructed that --
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2190.15,2190.351,In other words --
1979.78-6885,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2190.351,2192.996,"Well, that isn't much of a hearing then on sentencing, is it?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2192.996,2198.092,"Well, the information put him on notice, put the petitioner on notice when the charges were originally filed."
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2203.942,2206.525,Could he have been sentenced under 51(A)?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2206.525,2208.864,"No, he did not qualify under that class."
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2209.274,2223.346,"How can anyone be sentenced under -- as I understand it, the Court of Criminal Appeals said that the jury could have sentenced him under 51(A)."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2238.27,2244.72,What the court did when it invalidated 51(B) was take away that class of individuals and lumped them all to 51(A).
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2247.927,2252.437,Isn't that shifting the rules?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2252.437,2254.339,I don't know what type of rules you are talking about.
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2254.339,2263.557,"Well, you said when he was originally tried, he couldn't have been sentenced under 51(A), but the Court of Criminal Appeals said he could have."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2263.557,2266.341,"No, they merely affirmed the punishment as being within the limits of --"
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2266.341,2269.755,They affirmed 51(B)?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2273.774,2280.387,"No, they merely said that the sentence was in the range of punishment that the legislature provided for the enhancement of habitual offenders."
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.387,2298.335,"So if you have a death penalty for first degree murder and five years for manslaughter, if they sentence you to the death penalty to life imprisonment for manslaughter, that is all right because they could have sent you to death."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2298.335,2298.875,Not if that --
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2298.875,2300.069,There is something wrong with that.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2300.069,2308.696,"No, that creates -- let's talk about the death penalty cases in Furman where a number of states had numerous individuals on death row."
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2319.922,2322.705,"Well, they didn't commute this sentence, they affirmed it."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2322.705,2328.205,"No, but it is the same type of theory because they have the authority to affirm the sentence of the jury if they find that there is no --"
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2328.205,2332.308,They could affirm an unconstitutional sentence?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2332.308,2333.035,As they --
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2333.035,2339.487,They could affirm an unconstitutional sentence?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2339.487,2344.417,This Court has to look to Thigpen as to why the court declared it unconstitutional.
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2346.163,2352.163,"Well, do you think that this case reversed Thigpen?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2352.163,2355.368,"No, no, it definitely does not reverse Thigpen at all."
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2355.368,2358.454,Then how can you affirm?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2367.785,2369.393,"If anything, the court could have remanded the cause."
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.393,2370.708,"It is interesting, yes."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2370.708,2372.227,"It is an interesting question, but the court --"
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2372.227,2376.043,It sure is.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2376.043,2376.296,The only remedy the court had --
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2376.296,2377.857,But this man got forty years.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2380.755,2394.505,"What they were saying is that in terms of due process he was afforded his hearing, his notice and simply because he was sentenced under a statute which was subsequently found to be unconstitutional, and I think we have to look at the intent of the legislature -- the intent of the Court of Criminal Appeals."
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2397.583,2402.879,The Court of Appeals reaffirmed that this statute was unconstitutional.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2402.879,2403.877,They merely acknowledged --
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2403.877,2406.364,The merely said it was unconstitutional.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2406.364,2408.978,They concede in their opinion and we agree.
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2408.978,2414.407,"From the way I read it, it was unconstitutional before Thigpen, according to what the court said."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2419.437,2424.41,Thigpen was decided after the petitioner in this case was sentenced.
1979.78-6885,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2424.41,2428.945,I am talking about what the Court of Criminal Appeals said.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2430.974,2433.829,"Your Honor, I would say that is what they said."
1979.78-6885,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2433.829,2468.453,"Ms. Cox, I suppose in any case where the legislature has validly provided for a mandatory sentence upon conviction or habitual offenders or that sort of thing, the right of allocution, the right of the defendant to get up and speak before the jury if there is jury sentencing or before the judge if there is judicial sentencing, really is a fantasm almost if the sentence has to be mandatory."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2468.453,2485.813,"I would have to agree with that statement, that what good would it do for the defendant to get on the stand unless he were taking the underlying conviction upon which the enhancement was laid, that for him to be presenting the mitigating circumstances, it would not affect the range of punishment because the jury had been instructed to return a mandatory sentence."
1979.78-6885,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2485.813,2497.79,"If that is constitutional, to give a lot of arguments why you shouldn't be given a mandatory sentence that is required, it isn't going to do him any good."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2497.79,2500.219,"I'm sorry, I missed your question."
1979.78-6885,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2500.219,2518.432,For the defendant to give the jury or the judge a lot of reasons why a less than mandatory sentence shouldn't be imposed on him isn't going to do the defendant any good if the legislature has said constitutionally that this mandatory sentence shall be imposed.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2518.432,2520.553,That's correct.
1979.78-6885,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2556.919,2559.958,Did you argue this case in the Court of Criminal Appeals?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2559.958,2561.381,"No, I did not."
1979.78-6885,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2561.381,2570.915,"So you don't know any more than Mr. Ebel, I take it, except from briefs what were raised as federal constitutional issues?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2570.915,2574.583,"That's correct, I did not argue it at the trial court level."
1979.78-6885,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2574.583,2591.409,Do I understand correctly that you have agreed with your friend that the Court of Appeals of Oklahoma could have remanded that case for resentencing by a new jury?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2591.409,2591.63,No.
1979.78-6885,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2599.848,2608.46,"If the Court of Appeals could not do it, then can this Court, could this Court remand it for resentencing?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2608.46,2613.764,I know of no procedure whereby the State of Oklahoma could reempanel the jury.
1979.78-6885,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2626.751,2650.011,"You say every time a judge misinstructs the jury as to the range of sentencing, where there is jury sentencing and he just makes a mistake, a Court of Appeals decides that he was erroneously sentenced, properly found guilty but erroneously sentenced, there must be a new trial?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2650.011,2652.082,That's correct.
1979.78-6885,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2662.803,2669.109,It almost follows from the fact you have jury sentencing in your state.
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2672.132,2682.174,"Oklahoma is unique in that, yes, and I didn't realize it until this particular case, but we do afford the defendant an opportunity to have his sentence determined by a jury."
1979.78-6885,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2722.062,2748.652,"If we remanded and the Court of Criminal Appeals decided as a matter of state law that contrary to your view of the matter a new jury could be drawn for the sentencing only, even though that you say has not been done before, would that action of the Court of Appeals be reviewable here?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2748.652,2750.787,"I would think so, yes."
1979.78-6885,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2750.787,2755.008,What would be the federal question?
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2755.008,2768.544,"Well, there wouldn't be unless the defendant raised one if he was -- if in fact he went back and was resentenced and got a greater punishment, life, surely he would contest that it was a denial of due process possibly to send him back for resentencing."
1979.78-6885,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2768.544,2774.5,"Well, you said before he could get a life sentence."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2774.5,2775.338,Possibly if he were resentenced.
1979.78-6885,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2775.338,2782.698,"He didn't get a life sentence if he got the same sentence he has now, then would there be any federal question?"
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2782.698,2784.792,I know of none off the top of my head.
1979.78-6885,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2784.792,2800.429,"Assuming that the Court rejected your brother's attacks on 51(A), he presents federal questions in asserting that 51(A) itself is constitutionally invalid."
1979.78-6885,3,29381,janet_l_cox,,2800.429,2803.857,"Yes, and that that legislation should contain minimum sentencing standards."
1979.78-6885,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2883.18,2884.763,You have about three minutes remaining.
1979.78-6885,4,20802,david_m_ebel,,2884.763,2886.878,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1979.78-6885,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2904.002,2914.905,"Well, if we agree with you, counsel, presumably what we would do is be to vacate the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals and remand the case to that court and let it decide what it wants to do about it."
1979.78-6885,4,20802,david_m_ebel,,2914.905,2916.749,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-6885,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2968.993,2971.146,What did the Court of Criminal Appeals do?
1979.78-6885,4,20802,david_m_ebel,,2971.146,2972.897,They denied the petition for rehearing.
1979.78-6885,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2972.897,2976.736,So there is no way of knowing whether they considered it or not.
1979.78-6885,4,20802,david_m_ebel,,2976.736,2990.098,"No, but it couldn't have been raised until the petitioner for rehearing because that is the frustration that Hicks faces here, until the Court of Criminal Appeals decided that he was to be sentenced under this new statute, the error hadn't occurred."
1979.78-6885,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3002.117,3003.667,You say that was the first opportunity.
1979.78-6885,4,20802,david_m_ebel,,3003.667,3009.144,"That was the first opportunity, because we are not claiming error at the trial, we are claiming it at the appellate level."
1979.78-6885,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3014.596,3015.289,"Thank you, counsel."
