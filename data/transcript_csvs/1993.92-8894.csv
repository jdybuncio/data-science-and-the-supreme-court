1993.92-8894,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,16.172,"We'll hear argument now in Number 92-8894, Clarence Victor v. Nebraska, Number 92-9049, Alfred Arthur Sandoval v. California, Consolidated."
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,17.684,21.304,"Thank you, Mr. Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-8894,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,73.909,79.334,Mr.... why... ordinarily we say instructions should be considered as a whole.
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,82.045,102.238,"--Well, I do believe the prior decisions of this Court do warrant looking at the instruction as a whole, but I think the plain meaning of the instruction, also consistent with the prior decisions of this Court, would be to see two basic parts, one being the burden for conviction, the other being the burden for acquittal, and in this particular instruction I see those two parts coming out in the plain meaning given to it."
1993.92-8894,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,157.023,160.366,You say you do agree that this instruction should be read as a whole.
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,160.366,161.277,"Yes, I do."
1993.92-8894,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,161.277,171.033,And do you think that our decision in Holland v. United States lays down the same standard as was laid down in Cage?
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,171.033,176.517,"Well, as recognized, the standard has changed somewhat and specifically with respect to Boyde--"
1993.92-8894,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,176.517,181.851,"Well, but I mean the standard as to the context of the instruction."
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,189.805,190.175,--Yes.
1993.92-8894,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,190.175,194.928,"And other than that, do you think that Holland and Cage lay down the same test?"
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,194.928,211.88,"I believe so, in the sense that as recognized I believe in Estelle, if not also in... recognized previously in Franklin, there might be a new test when it comes to interpretation of jury instructions and particularly in this case with respect to reasonable doubt."
1993.92-8894,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,211.88,218.426,Why would there be a new test in interpreting an instruction on reasonable doubt?
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,218.426,239.116,"Well, as you found in... taking Winship in conjunction with Sullivan, just decided by the Court last year, the concept of reasonable doubt and the burden of the Government to prove reasonable doubt, to prove conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, is so fundamental that I believe it would be a recognized exception to basic rules of interpretation."
1993.92-8894,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,239.116,242.268,What authority do you have for that proposition?
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,242.268,251.344,"Well, again I refer only to Sullivan in the sense that it's such a fundamental guarantee with respect to due process, the fundamental right of trial by jury, and relieving the State of its burden."
1993.92-8894,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,261.051,271.908,"Yes, but why does it follow from that that a different standard should be applied to judging a jury instruction on that subject than a jury instruction on some other subject."
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,273.53,277.043,"No, I don't believe so, and I spoke in error with respect to interpretation of other instructions."
1993.92-8894,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,285.027,289.319,"Mr. Weber, is this instruction routinely used in the courts in Nebraska?"
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,289.319,290.17,"--It is not, Your Honor."
1993.92-8894,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.802,359.296,Was the instruction in this case routinely given before our decision in Cage?
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,359.296,360.686,"Yes, I think it would be safe to say it was."
1993.92-8894,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,510.164,540.473,"Well, counsel, that would, if it stood alone, certainly come pretty close to Cage, but the balance of the sentence explains that the reasonable doubt has to be as distinguished from a doubt arising from a mere possibility, bare imagination, or fanciful conjecture, and viewed with that, perhaps it isn't a misstatement."
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,540.473,555.312,"I understand what you're saying, Justice O'Connor, with respect to reading the entire sentence, but I think what we're looking at here is a continuum, with mere possibility or fanciful conjecture at one end, and we can't ignore the language that I believe you omitted in your question, and that is the substantial doubt."
1993.92-8894,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,562.849,564.609,"Well, I'm not sure it is."
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,572.406,573.055,--I tend to agree with you.
1993.92-8894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.256,736.121,"In this case we just didn't have the use of the phrase, moral certainty, by itself."
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,750.791,751.603,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1993.92-8894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,755.675,761.309,"And moral certainty, that certainty which is the only certainty that can be had pertaining to human conduct... moral certainty."
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,761.309,762.118,--The problem... excuse me.
1993.92-8894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,767.942,768.212,Maybe--
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,768.212,771.424,--counsel will point out to you the instruction means something totally different today.
1993.92-8894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.424,771.775,--It does to me.
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,798.632,801.724,"That's the problem, Justice Scalia, it has several different meanings."
1993.92-8894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,816.356,820.848,"It's your burden to show that it has to be reasonably likely that it would be misunderstood, isn't it?"
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,820.848,821.178,Yes.
1993.92-8894,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,821.869,828.823,"Well then, what line of reasoning would say that moral certainty means roughly like the civil preponderance standard?"
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,830.546,854.12,"The only thing I'm saying is that, as the prior decisions of this Court have noted, we are not necessarily to parse language and view the particular terms under a microscope, and I'm saying it is certainly possible, indeed, reasonably likely, that a jury looking at the moral certainty language and noting that they can convict on the strong probabilities of the case that those are tantamount to similar or same meanings, and it's reasonably likely that they will be given that meaning by a jury."
1993.92-8894,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,854.12,863.647,--So you say that because of the juxtaposition of moral certainty and strong probabilities that that gives meaning to moral certainty?
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,863.647,869.809,"To me I believe it does, and I believe it does to the common juror, and I believe that's what we need to focus upon here."
1993.92-8894,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,876.484,877.315,Inordinately.
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,877.315,901.181,"Yes, and the problem is that we maybe have removed ourselves too far from what the common juror on the street is going to think when they look at this instruction, and if we're to do the best we can and look at the instruction as a whole, I don't think there's any question when you look at what I submit is the conviction language, and that takes the graver more important transactions of life language, the moral certainty language, and the strong probability language taken together."
1993.92-8894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,919.971,924.396,"Well, wait, I certainly don't agree with that as to the first sentence, as to the"
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,948.963,950.453,"No, that's not what I'm saying."
1993.92-8894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.453,950.733,I don't think so.
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,956.567,965.822,"Certainly, but another reading of that instruction would be that possibly the decision to acquit in this case could be grave and thus, again, raising the burden of the defendant unconstitutionally."
1993.92-8894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.822,967.763,I don't understand what you're saying.
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,967.763,968.063,If--
1993.92-8894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,968.063,974.308,I take that first sentence to define reasonable doubt in such a way to say the kind of doubt that would cause you to pause.
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,980.202,990.948,"--But I also think the more clear definition of reasonable doubt provided in the instruction is the one at the conclusion of the instruction, that being a reasonable doubt is an actual and substantial doubt."
1993.92-8894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,990.948,995.202,"Okay, I'll give you that one, but you were trying to use the first sentence as supporting your case--"
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,995.202,995.613,I'm only--
1993.92-8894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.613,998.624,--and I think it's something you have to overcome rather than something you can use.
1993.92-8894,0,36901,mark_a_weber,,998.624,999.914,--I understand.
1993.92-8894,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1096.879,1098.239,"Very well, Mr. Weber."
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1104.143,1104.824,Multhaup.
1993.92-8894,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1104.824,1105.385,Multhaup.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1105.903,1106.303,Thank you.
1993.92-8894,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1142.948,1146.791,"Of course, you would say at the time of Shaw it was not corrective at all, that--"
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1146.791,1148.862,Exactly.
1993.92-8894,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1148.862,1153.845,--The average juror at the time of Shaw understood what moral certainty meant.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1153.845,1154.906,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1993.92-8894,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1154.906,1156.627,"You don't really think that, do you?"
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1163.121,1185.117,"Your Honor, you're raising an interesting point more as to the scope of American education than as to whether it was a technical versus nontechnical term, and my belief is that anybody who knew what the phrase meant at all knew what it meant in the terms that Justice Shaw penned it."
1993.92-8894,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1192.704,1194.213,Are the dictionary definitions different?
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1202.611,1230.307,"--Yes, Your Honor, and as we traced from our petitioner's opening brief through the reply brief, the common meaning of moral certainty as reflected in lexicographical sources meant moral certainty in terms of the highest degree of certainty that you could obtain, based on empirical evidence from Daniel Webster's... Noel Webster's first dictionary in 1827 through approximately the turn of the century."
1993.92-8894,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1256.945,1264.24,And yet in so many model instructions the term appears well past the turn of the century.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1264.24,1286.537,"That's certainly true, Your Honor, and I think that brings up... that brings up the fundamental problem in this case, where lawyers and judges as law-trained people hear this phrase as reiterating what they have learned since the beginning of law school and throughout their practice, while the lay public uses it, understands it in a very different manner, and they're--"
1993.92-8894,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1286.537,1296.864,"But might that manner be favorable to the defendants, and might it not be that the defendants' desire to have it explains how it continues to persist, despite what you see the shift in definitions after 1900?"
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1296.864,1301.966,--I think that is a very unlikely possibility.
1993.92-8894,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1319.007,1323.401,"I'm not sure that that's what the defense attorneys are doing, but they're still asking for moral certainty language."
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1323.401,1326.313,"--Nobody asks for it, Your Honor, I don't believe."
1993.92-8894,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1329.863,1337.81,Why didn't... didn't California just make a decision to preserve that language after a rather extensive review of the instruction?
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1337.81,1356.0,"No, I... if Your Honor's referring to the CALJIC review in the mid-1980's, that review went so far as to consist of asking the lawyers and judges whether they saw any reason for changing the instruction."
1993.92-8894,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1374.993,1382.347,"How many people... what percent of the general public do you think frequently use the phrase, moral certainty, in their conversation?"
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1382.347,1384.881,"Your Honor, I don't believe that that's the test."
1993.92-8894,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1384.881,1386.651,"Well, I didn't ask you whether that was the test."
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1386.651,1386.991,Yes.
1993.92-8894,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1386.991,1390.445,I asked you what percent you thought used the expression.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1393.697,1408.116,"I don't know what percent use it in their ordinary conversation, but I do know that there's a high likelihood that most people hear it used in contemporary parlance in the newspapers, as indicated by our contemporary references."
1993.92-8894,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1423.085,1431.16,"It's familiar to the readers of the Washington Post and the New York Times and the Sacramento Beat, but you're not required to read those newspapers to get on the jury."
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1431.16,1432.312,No.
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.928,1452.855,"You'd have to do that from its context, wouldn't you, and although I happen to agree with you that the word has acquired a different meaning, I'm not sure it has eliminated the original meaning."
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1461.089,1463.281,"I disagree with that as a factual matter, Your Honor."
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.799,1479.403,Maybe that means it's a better dictionary.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1509.751,1524.581,"--I was more... Petitioner Sandoval focused more on those dictionary definitions which specifically took the phrase, moral certainty, as a phrase, rather than simply the word, moral certainty."
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1524.581,1528.935,"Oh, well, but you couldn't expect every dictionary to single out the phrase, moral certainty."
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1540.321,1542.932,"Well, that question is--"
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1542.932,1545.665,If you wanted to explain to a juror... I don't want mathematical certainty.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1560.705,1568.94,"--I would put it exactly as... first of all, there are any number of possible definitions for, consistent with the concept of reasonable doubt."
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1606.435,1608.438,I agree with you that that would be a better idea.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1608.438,1608.798,Yes.
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.798,1616.452,But the question before us here is whether it was likely that not doing that... likely that not doing that misled the jury.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1634.124,1634.815,Yes.
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1634.815,1639.297,"How could you possibly make it clearer that the word, moral, means pertaining to human action?"
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1642.209,1650.236,"Your Honor, it pertains to human action when a civil jury returns a verdict of liability."
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.167,1686.901,"I agree with you, but you're making the argument that the only meaning this jury could have taken, or it is more likely than not that the jury took moral certainty not to mean that degree of certainty that... which is the highest degree we can have in matters of human affairs--"
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1686.901,1687.39,Yes.
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1687.39,1704.97,"--and I say that it is very likely that they took it to mean that, since earlier the judge refers to moral evidence, and in that context the only thing it could have meant to the jury is evidence relating to human action, and moral certainty means that certainty which is certainty relating to human action."
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1712.737,1713.476,"Well, Your Honor--"
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.476,1721.834,"Relating to human affairs, everything relating to human affairs and depending on moral evidence is open to some possible doubt, and then he goes on to say,"
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1729.678,1746.598,"--Well, I question whether a juror hearing that would be able to distinguish whether a juror's level of certainty had to rise merely to say clear and convincing evidence, or had to rise above that to the utmost certainty."
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1759.578,1771.175,"Moral is susceptible to both meanings, yes, but certainty is not susceptible of both meanings, when you combine the word moral with the word certainty, it means--"
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1771.175,1772.246,--It means--
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1772.246,1777.179,--That highest degree of assurance you can have in matters of human conduct.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1777.179,1791.167,"--Well, see, there's where we have a fundamental disagreement, because if you take any American dictionary that does have the phrase, moral certainty, defined in it... moral certainty, and a definition... it's clearly inconsistent with proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.077,1805.867,The OED gives that meaning.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1807.279,1809.01,I certainly did.
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1809.01,1809.871,Okay.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1811.941,1817.924,I count that as the most... as the most widely recognized dictionary--
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1817.924,1818.555,It's too good.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1818.555,1822.717,--to preserve historical meanings at the expense of current American usage.
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1822.717,1825.411,At the expense of current American... I thought they gave American usage.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1825.411,1825.759,Yes.
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.38,1827.442,They purport to give American usage.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1827.442,1827.993,--Pardon me?
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.993,1828.992,They purport to give American usage.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1828.992,1855.07,"I think Your Honor is exactly correct in using the word, purport, because we have... we have twelve American-published dictionaries giving definitions of moral certainty inconsistent with the standard that we all know in our minds is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and we have one venerable English dictionary... everybody enjoys reading the OED... consistent with the historical meaning."
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.99,1872.97,I suppose it depends on the context.
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1887.402,1888.962,No.
1993.92-8894,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.962,1908.025,"It's the context that determines its meaning, and when the context is following a sentence that says, everything relating to human affairs and depending on moral evidence is open to some possible doubt, and therefore you must have a moral certainty, I think that's a quite different context from just coming up to somebody and saying, moral certainty."
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,1910.406,1932.452,"Well, if I may, Your Honor, I believe that by referring to... if you refer to usage and definitions of the word, moral, separate from the phrase, moral certainty, there are 22 different definitions, nuances, subtleties of the word, moral, including sexually virtuous, which have nothing to do with the context of the reasonable doubt instruction here."

1993.92-8894,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2035.71,2037.693,What is the definition that's satisfactory?
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,2037.693,2046.937,"Well, Your Honor, I'd say 43 out of the definitions contained in petitioner's Exhibit B from around the country are satisfactory."
1993.92-8894,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.036,2059.135,May I ask you about that?
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,2070.143,2074.857,"Well, Your Honor, my understanding is that's what this Court has said."

1993.92-8894,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.814,2124.8,But you don't really mean to suggest you can never convict if you can conceive of a case that would be even more convincing than the one you've seen?
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,2124.8,2127.962,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, I didn't understand the question."

1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,2136.587,2137.399,"Certainly not, Your Honor."
1993.92-8894,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2137.399,2143.201,"Well, that's what this instruction says at footnote 26."

1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,2171.019,2172.892,"Of course not, and it's foolish to assign numbers."

1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,2215.368,2228.046,"Well, Sandoval's position is that whether or not there's a constitutional obligation to define it, you can't give an instruction which drags the jury away from the core concept."
1993.92-8894,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.448,2258.738,"Notwithstanding the observations in Holland that violate the Constitution if a judge refuse to give an elaboration on the meaning of the term, reasonable doubt?"

1993.92-8894,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2263.539,2265.049,"Well, I... to say you would argue--"
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,2265.049,2265.37,--Yes.
1993.92-8894,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2265.37,2270.815,"--on behalf of a client, I'm sure you would, but do you think that's what the law is?"
1993.92-8894,1,22828,eric__s_multhaup,,2270.815,2279.631,"There's no law whatsoever that says it's flatly unconstitutional not to define proof beyond a reasonable doubt, no question about that."

1993.92-8894,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2485.695,2488.637,And the newer one leaves out moral certainty?
1993.92-8894,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,2489.288,2493.89,"The new one leaves out all of the three phrases that are questioned here, Your Honor."
1993.92-8894,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2562.585,2565.327,"Why do you say, half, General Stenberg?"
1993.92-8894,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,2570.75,2581.537,"Well, I would say... I guess I would use the term, at least, Your Honor, because as I pointed out, even our new instructions which contains none of the phrases that were commented upon in Cage, has been challenged."
1993.92-8894,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2597.147,2597.798,You said 10 years.
1993.92-8894,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,2601.94,2607.593,"Well, Your Honor, let's start at least by looking at the Victor case to answer that question."
1993.92-8894,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2616.679,2618.542,"Yes, but we're not on direct review."
1993.92-8894,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,2623.365,2652.763,"Well, I think on the record here it's a little unclear as to whether we're on direct review or not, Your Honor, but I would note that the petitioner in his reply brief... Petitioner Victor in his reply brief argues that even under the Teague standard, because this is so fundamental, because the reasonable doubt jury instruction is so fundamental, it is part of the concept of ordered liberty, that if the instruction is invalid, that we would have to go back under a Teague test as well, and that, of course, is not the position of the State of Nebraska."
1993.92-8894,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2652.763,2657.816,"Well, if you did, it's because that was the law before... I mean, you don't... it seems to me you don't have to reach that issue."
1993.92-8894,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,2667.694,2687.125,"Well, I guess my response, Your Honor, would be that there's no question that we're looking at several... that obviously retroactivity affects exactly how many cases are affected, but I don't think there's any question that we're looking at several years' worth of retrials if these jury instructions are broadly rejected by this Court."
1993.92-8894,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2687.125,2690.537,Has the defense bar been regularly objecting to all these instructions?
1993.92-8894,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,2690.537,2698.124,"I think since Cage there has been a pretty general... it's been a fairly standard objection to object to reasonable doubt jury instructions, Your Honor."
1993.92-8894,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2698.124,2715.585,"Of course, prior to Cage, at least with respect to cases prior to Cage in which there were not objections, for example, as I understand it we don't know and we couldn't possibly tell on this record whether the supreme court of Nebraska will find a complete procedural bar."
1993.92-8894,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,2729.022,2733.748,"Well, that, of course, is exactly the argument we make on retroactivity in our brief, Your Honor."
1993.92-8894,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2966.229,2976.875,"Do you acknowledge that the meaning of the phrase, moral certainty, has changed over time?"
1993.92-8894,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,2976.875,2978.807,"I do not believe so, Your Honor."
1993.92-8894,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3006.163,3009.105,Have the dictionary definitions of it changed?
1993.92-8894,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,3009.105,3013.309,"Your Honor, I do not profess to be an expert on dictionaries."
1993.92-8894,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3054.135,3056.978,"General Stenberg, you refer to our decision in the Miles case."
1993.92-8894,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,3068.555,3079.804,"--The quote I have from the Miles case, Your Honor, is found at page 309 in 103 U.S., and the quote as I have it written here, is ""proof beyond a reasonable""... this is from the instruction, Your Honor."
1993.92-8894,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3098.535,3099.326,--You're quite right.
1993.92-8894,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,3099.326,3103.748,"If the Court wishes, I would address the retroactivity issue."
1993.92-8894,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3106.232,3108.031,"Thank you, General Stenberg."
1993.92-8894,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,3108.031,3108.432,Thank you.
1993.92-8894,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3108.432,3109.762,"General Lungren, we'll hear from you."

1993.92-8894,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3507.166,3518.972,"How about, proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced of the defendant's guilt, period?"
1993.92-8894,3,21174,daniel_e_lungren,,3518.972,3540.646,"Some have suggested that it is better not to have any instruction whatsoever, and to just say, reasonable doubt, and to say unreasonable doubt is that doubt which is not reasonable, and leave it at that, yet we have found that in California, at least, we have those who inquire as to that."
1993.92-8894,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3540.646,3554.466,"I ask about this particular instruction, proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced of defendant's guilt, because it is the one that the Federal Judicial Center recommends and I was surprised to see in all of the definitions in all of these briefs that it wasn't mentioned."
1993.92-8894,3,21174,daniel_e_lungren,,3554.466,3559.0,That is not meant as a criticism on our part.
1993.92-8894,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3814.519,3815.868,"Mr. Lungren, can I ask you a question?"
1993.92-8894,3,21174,daniel_e_lungren,,3834.601,3839.284,It could if viewed in the context of the instruction.
1993.92-8894,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3840.015,3840.385,Right.
1993.92-8894,3,21174,daniel_e_lungren,,3840.385,3843.156,"That the word, hold, means many different things."
1993.92-8894,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3881.251,3882.282,I understand your argument.

1993.92-8894,3,21174,daniel_e_lungren,,3931.905,3960.312,"I don't think there's any doubt about it, and if you look at the way it has been used by this Court in many references where it was not reviewing a question of instruction but the Court attempting to express how it saw something being seriously... a dissent by the chief justice in Schnebel... talking about moral certainty didn't go to the question of moral certainty, but it advanced the cause that the decision made was a decision that was made seriously, and with the quantum of proof necessary beyond a reasonable doubt."

1993.92-8894,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4073.406,4088.897,"Well, I... instead of dropping it, you might also consider the possibility of having a campaign to use the term properly instead of using it as a slovenly description of something that is not at all a certainty, far from certain."
