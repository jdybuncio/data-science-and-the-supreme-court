2018.17-9560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.075,6.665,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-9560, Rehaif versus United States. Ms. Cakmis."
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,6.665,18.675,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To knowingly violate 922(g), one must know the crucial fact that transforms his otherwise innocent firearm possession into a 10-year felony."
2018.17-9560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,39.94,94.45,"What do you do with this -- in this very same statute, there are crimes where the legislature has said explicitly -- well, let's take 922(g), says selling firearms to one that the defendant knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a felon, so that makes -- there's a case where the status, felon, has to be known to the defendant, but in the, what is it, 922(g), we don't have that knowing requirement. So why should we insert it when it's not there?"
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,94.45,136.87,"Because 924(a)(2) states that the person must knowingly violate 922(g). ""Knowingly"" modifies the verb ""violate"" and the direct object, ""922(g)."" Several of the provisions that are listed in 924(a)(2) do have other types of knowledge requirements, but the ""knowingly"" still forms the default or the baseline knowledge if there is not an otherwise inserted knowledge. Additionally, this Court's precedent -- and that makes sense in light of this Court's precedent, which attaches a mens rea to every element that criminalizes otherwise innocent conduct."
2018.17-9560,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,149.24,156.35,"Ms. Cakmis, do -- do you agree that there is no mens rea element attached to the jurisdictional element?"
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,156.35,157.635,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-9560,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,157.635,160.25,And so what is the difference between the two?
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,160.25,179.665,"This Court has carved out a very narrow exception for jurisdiction, because that relates only to the power of the Congress to legislate, whereas, in our instance, we're talking about a substantive fact, something that criminalizes otherwise innocent conduct, something that goes to the defendant's culpability."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,179.665,203.44,"But isn't the -- the theory behind the conclusion that there's no mens rea element for a jurisdict- -- no mens requirement for a jurisdictional element, the -- the inference that this is not the kind of element for which Congress wanted to have a -- a -- a mental element? It's an inference about congressional intent."
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,205.02999995,210.85,"No, Your Honor, I would respectfully submit it is an exception carved out by the Court."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,210.85,211.32,"Yeah, and --"
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,211.32,211.53,Because --
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,211.53,214.995,-- and what's the basis for the exception? Why have we carved out that exception?
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,214.995,228.59,"In the Commerce Clause, for example, the defendant's conduct is not related to that interstate transportation. There's no requirement that the defendant himself must transport the firearms in interstate commerce."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,228.59,232.96,"Well, Congress could attach a mental element to that, could it not?"
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,232.96,233.66,"Yes, it could."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,233.96,234.59,All right.
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,237.05,244.08,"Because that goes to Congress's power to legislate and not to the defendant's conduct, whereas the status --"
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,244.08,244.365,"No, no."
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,249.66,249.96,Right.
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,249.96,250.805,"It could, right?"
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,250.805,251.355,"Yes, sir."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,251.355,254.17,We infer -- we -- we say but it didn't.
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,254.66,255.16,"Yes, sir."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,255.16,257.045,And why do we say that?
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,257.045,261.17,"Again, because of the difference that's being targeted."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,267.03,270.04,But why? Why do we say that it's -- I'll try one final time.
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,270.04,270.3,I'm sorry.
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,270.3,283.165,What -- what is the theory behind the conclusion that Congress did not want the mental element to apply to the jurisdiction -- the mental requirement to apply to the jurisdictional element?
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,283.165,289.455,"And, again, from what I've gleaned from this Court's cases, it's that the defendant's culpability is not at issue."
2018.17-9560,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,289.455,291.26,"Well, this --"
2018.17-9560,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,291.26,293.7,The blameworthiness of the defendant is not --
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,293.7,294.31,"Yes, sir."
2018.17-9560,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,294.31,294.71,-- right --
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,294.71,295.27,"Yes, sir."
2018.17-9560,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,295.27,308.445,"-- in those elements, because whether you knew about the jurisdictional hook doesn't really go, we've assumed, to your blameworthiness, whereas whether you knew the elements of the offense, the other elements of the offense do, right?"
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,308.445,309.775,"Yes, Your Honor, thank you."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,309.775,312.485,But it's an inference about what Congress intended.
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,322.225,323.14,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,323.14,334.845,"And the reason we -- we infer that because we think this is just not the kind of element that Congress wants to have a mental requirement attach to, unless it says so expressly."
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,334.845,336.405,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,349.23,349.87,Okay.
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,363.44,390.9,"First of all, there is the language and structure of the statute. They put ""knowingly"" directly into 922 -- 924(a)(2) in front of ""violate 922(g)."" If they had only wanted it to skip and to apply to the jurisdictional element -- excuse me -- to the possession element, they logically would have put it immediately in front of the possession element, after the nine categories of people."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,390.9,396.81,What if there were no mental -- what if the statute itself made no mention of any mens rea?
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,396.81,410.86,"Even when the statute is silent, this Court has inferred a mens rea for each substantive element, each element that relates to blameworthiness and to the -- it criminalizes otherwise innocent conduct."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,410.86,414.515,So then your argument really doesn't depend on the text of the statute?
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,414.515,416.33500005,"Correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-9560,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,438.985,451.66,"I thought your argument did depend on the text of the statute, but you were saying in the alternative, even if there were no mens rea element, our cases require us to still require mens rea."
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,451.66,453.23,Our argument is --
2018.17-9560,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,453.23,453.32,Right?
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,453.32,471.025,"-- supported by the statute's text and structure, and we would respectfully submit the text and structure are plain, and so we don't need to go to the presumptions or legislative history. But, in the event that the Court feels it's not plain, the next step is to look at the presumptions."
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,477.43,478.1,Would this be --
2018.17-9560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,478.1,478.77,I have a --
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,478.77,479.41,-- different --
2018.17-9560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,479.41,500.445,"-- question about the consequences of -- of your position, and the constitutional -- answer the -- to the constitutional question shouldn't turn on it, but, as a practical matter, I think I'm right that most of these possession cases are felon-in-possession cases."
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,500.445,502.37,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-9560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,502.37,533.565,"And if that's right and you prevail, then how many people who have been convicted under felon-in-possession charges could now say, well, the Supreme Court has said what has happened to me, I can't be convicted of a crime I was convicted of, so I want -- I want to get out."
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,554.75,558.33,"There would be a habeas avenue to pursue, Your Honor."
2018.17-9560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,590.61,590.81,Well --
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,590.81,592.76,-- about their knowledge of their status.
2018.17-9560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,592.76,612.58,"Well, I suppose it would get to whether or not a jury was instructed on the element of the offense that had to be -- that it had to be knowing. So it may be broader than -- than that. And, in my experience, felon-in-possession is almost always what people are charged with in -- at this level because it's the easiest thing to prove."
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,622.80999995,627.03,But then there's the practical and the legal answer.
2018.17-9560,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,650.95,658.075,What percentage of those guilty verdicts are by way of plea versus trial?
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,658.075,664.505,"There -- for a Section 922(g), approximately 95 percent are guilty pleas."
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,669.84,681.57,Could -- could you tell me exactly what do you think the -- what are the facts he would need to know to be guilty? Because you can't have a mistake of law.
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,681.57,682.23,Correct.
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,682.23,685.08,And you can't -- and you can't be ignorant of the law.
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,692.295,693.13,Yes.
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,693.13,695.43,-- on -- on his being a student?
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,695.43,709.54,"Yes, Your Honor, that he knew he was admitted into this country lawfully on a student non-immigrant visa, that the visa had specific requirements, and that he failed to comply with or violated those requirements."
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,709.54,709.835,All right.
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,727.65,728.19,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,744.525,751.35,So your -- the condition is that he knew he came in on a -- on a student visa that said he had to remain a student?
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,751.35,752.34,"Yes, ma'am, Your Honor."
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,752.34,759.33,"And if they show that he was told that at the time of admission and he stopped being a student, that's enough?"
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,759.33,760.645,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,760.645,764.67,"So how do we not go to harmless error here? I mean, at some point --"
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,764.67,764.87,I'm sorry?
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,764.87,767.265,-- he knows he stopped going to school.
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,767.265,768.8,I -- I apologize.
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,769.14,774.26,"How -- how don't we have harmless error here? At some point, he knows he stopped going to school."
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,774.26,775.15,We only have --
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,775.15,786.81,"He knows that he came in on a student visa because that's the only kind of visa he had. So what's his -- why isn't this harmless error, even if we reach this issue in your favor?"
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,786.81,806.58,"In our situation, we only have one side of the story because, before trial, the government moved in limine to keep out the defense, and the court agreed with the government on the jury instruction that the jury was specifically instructed the government does not have to prove Mr. Rehaif knew his status."
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,806.58,807.88,That doesn't answer my question.
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,810.85,816.42,That he was unaware that he had been academically dismissed and was now out of school.
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,816.42,822.6,"That he didn't know he had been -- I mean -- I mean, every student knows whether he goes to school or not."
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,822.6,829.33,"There is an opportunity for reasonable mistake here, Your Honor, just like with the other categories."
2018.17-9560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,829.33,838.505,"Even though he was -- he was out on a -- a firing range, and he should have been at school if he hadn't been dismissed? (Laughter.)"
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,838.505,845.585,"He also had a hunting license, for example, that the defense wanted to introduce into evidence."
2018.17-9560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,846.05,848.87,He was taking a course on firearms.
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,848.87,850.89,He could have been.
2018.17-9560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,850.89,858.26,"But, I mean, does the evidence suggest that there was a lot of confusion about his status as a student?"
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,858.26,864.925,The government's evidence is all that we have because the defense didn't introduce it.
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,920.12,953.17500005,"Suppose someone who is admitted on a student visa doesn't go to school, has every reason to know, understands that he has to continue in school if -- for his visa to be valid, and he has every reason to know that he's not any longer considered to be a student by the school, hasn't been there for months and months and months, hasn't done one single thing, but doesn't actually know for sure that they have expelled him. Your position is that that person would not fall within the statute?"
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,953.17500005,956.12,Our position is that that would be a jury question.
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,956.12,956.545,No.
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,967.56,976.79,"Again, with respect, if someone has every reason to know, it can be inferred that the person does know. Intent and knowledge are --"
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,976.79,977.25,All right.
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,988.67,994.52,"If the fact-finder finds that he truly did not know, then he would not be guilty, Your Honor."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,994.52,997.16,And do you -- do you think that's really what Congress meant here?
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,997.16,1001.23,"Yes, Your Honor, but I don't think that will happen in that type of a situation."
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1049.42,1067.87,"It does seem fairly easy for the government to prove status like you're a felon-in-possession because there's a whole series of ways you should know you're a felon, a transcript of you pleading guilty could be one of them, or a judgment of conviction, you have to be there to get that."
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,1067.87,1068.42,Exactly.
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1068.42,1099.07,"But how about 922(g)(3), who says, where the status element is being addicted to a controlled substance, why would Congress want to punish someone who is aware of being addicted because they sought help but not when someone -- but not someone who is in denial, meaning my parents, yeah, put me in a program, but they put me in against my will."
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,1099.07,1115.05,"And if the person knew the facts underlying the legal definition of ""addicted,"" they knew that they were dependent on those drugs, they knew that when they weren't taking them, they started having withdrawals or whatever the legal definition, the facts --"
2018.17-9560,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1115.05,1119.475,But how would the government be able to prove that? Meaning --
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,1119.475,1143.265,"In the bulk of the cases, practically speaking, it's going to be proved by the same evidence that the government uses to show the person was addicted. And in -- as in all the other statutes that require knowledge, the jury will have to infer knowledge through reasonable inferences or find that those reasonable inferences don't support the knowledge."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1143.265,1181.755,"What about subparagraph 8, which applies to a very -- to -- to a set of individuals who are defined in a very complicated way? So there has to be a restraining order that includes a finding that the person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of an intimate partner or a child, and then the order by its terms must explicitly prohibit the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury. So it has to be proven that the defendant knew all of those things?"

2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1192.25,1196.07,And he -- but he has to know all the -- all those characteristics of the restraining order?
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,1196.07,1204.87,"Yes, Your Honor, which would be demonstrated by the restraining order that he received a copy of in the bulk of the cases."
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1225.87,1258.43,"If someone is charged with being a felon-in-possession, and it -- the prosecution has to prove that the person knew that this offense was a felony, can the prosecution be prohibited from -- can the defendant, by offering to stipulate, prohibit the prosecution from proving the nature of the felony? Because, if all the jury knows is that there was a conviction for a felony, then, you know, the jury doesn't know how serious this crime was."
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,1270.62999995,1282.94,Which would make Old Chief an even stronger tool in the prosecutor's hands because the prosecutor would not have to stipulate if the defendant is challenging his knowledge of status.
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1293.56,1300.625,"Well, if that's true, then you -- you are perhaps not going to win a great victory for people charged with being a felon-in-possession."
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,1313.96999995,1314.865,If --
2018.17-9560,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1314.865,1315.79,That's true?
2018.17-9560,0,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,1315.79,1352.89,"If the defendant is challenging his knowledge that it was a felony -- if he's just challenging his knowledge that he ever was convicted, that might be different. But, if he's challenging his knowledge that he knew this was a felony or that he knew it was a serious offense punishable by more than one year, and he claims, I didn't know that, then he's made that probative, the type of offense, the nature of it, and the name. And we believe -- if the Court has no further questions, I would like to reserve the rest of the time."

2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1360.685,1393.315,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Firearm Owners' Protection Act does not take the unusual step of requiring proof that the defendant had subjective awareness of his own legal status, nor does it create a safe harbor for aliens or felons who remain ignorant, even recklessly ignorant, of their own circumstances. Instead, FOPA reflects the long-standing nationwide consensus that a defendant knowingly violates the statute if he, despite his prohibited status, knowingly possesses a gun. I think it's --"
2018.17-9560,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1393.315,1396.22,What do you do with that dreamer?
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1396.22,1397.105,Pardon?
2018.17-9560,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1397.105,1426.65,"What do you do with that dreamer -- with that dreamer example or a student who got a visa from a certified institution and all of a sudden, unbeknownst to him or her, the school is decertified? And so they're no longer in status. What -- I -- I agree with you, in the vast majority of cases, the status is pretty self-evident, but -- or lack thereof is self-evident."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1433.405,1434.27,So I --
2018.17-9560,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1434.27,1436.56,Innocent of knowing their illegality.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1436.56,1436.95,Sure.
2018.17-9560,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1454.22,1458.785,"Well, I guess my question becomes, what do we do with the Staples presumption?"
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1458.785,1459.34,Sure.
2018.17-9560,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1459.34,1479.315,That you -- we're not going -- we're going to not read in a or read out a mental element for the conduct or the part of an element that makes you guilty of something that's otherwise not guilty. Possessing a gun is not in and of itself a blameworthy conduct.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1479.315,1480.18,That's correct.
2018.17-9560,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1480.18,1483.725,And the only blameworthy conduct is if you're an illegal alien.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1483.725,1509.97,"That's correct, but our argument here is not that possessing a gun is blameworthy or inherently dangerous and, therefore, you're charged with knowing the law. Our argument is that there are certain people who, by virtue of their circumstances and status, are charged with knowing or at least being on notice of whether they have a certain status. So someone who is an alien has a -- has an obligation, if they're here in the United States, to know whether they're here lawfully or unlawfully."
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1509.97,1530.165,"But what if they're mistaken? So it's a mistake of fact. Mistake of fact has always been recognized as a defense, or, put conversely, knowledge has always been required -- going back to Justice Jackson in Morissette and all through the cases, as required for all the elements of the offense."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1530.165,1532.72,The court of appeals acknowledged that --
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1532.72,1535.11,So what if there's a -- what if there's a mistake of fact?
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1535.11,1535.615,Sure.
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1541.94,1542.24,Well --
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1542.24,1543.22,But that would not be --
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1543.22,1551.36,"Well, once -- but then the camel's nose is under the tent, isn't it, counsel? Intent matters except for when it doesn't? Knowledge matters except for when it doesn't?"
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1551.36,1554.19,"No, Your Honor, mistake of fact is an affirmative defense that has to be raised --"
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1554.19,1554.45,"No, I'm -- I'm --"
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1554.45,1556.58,-- and proven beyond a preponderance of the evidence.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1556.58,1558.82,"Oh, okay, so you're just saying there's an affirmative defense."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1558.82,1559.19,There -- there -- there might --
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1559.19,1566.565,So we're just going to recreate this as an affirmative defense throughout? So -- so what's the -- what's the delta between the defendant's position and the government's position then?
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1566.565,1569.76,"It's whether it has to be proven in every single trial, just as --"
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1569.76,1584.6,"Well, let -- let me -- let me ask you, just to -- just to follow up on Rob -- since Robert Jackson's name's been invoked here, Morissette, ""the contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient notion."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1603.7,1604.12,And it is.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1604.12,1612.48,-- and here we're talking about the only thing that separates not just innocent conduct but constitutionally protected conduct potentially is --
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1612.48,1613.16,So that is --
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1613.16,1616.415,"-- is knowledge of the status, knowledge that I am a felon."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1634.25,1638.525,"His admonition was about creating strict liability offenses, which this is not."
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1641.84,1643.59,"No, it wasn't just about that."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1644.905,1645.23,So --
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1645.23,1647.76,And -- and we've got X-Citement Video as well.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1648.54,1660.91,"So all of those cases are ones in which there was a list of elements, usually followed by some state -- some word like ""knowingly,"" and the presumption is that it applies to all of the other elements. We don't have that here."
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1662.15,1664.565,"Well, with respect, we've got maybe even worse here."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1666.95,1667.64,It precedes --
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1667.64,1672.97,"And this is the very first element that follows after the word ""knowingly violates."" This is the very first element."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1672.97,1673.36,"So, Your Honor --"
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1673.36,1674.29,Substantive element.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1674.29,1674.87,-- it -- it is not.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1675.15,1687.075,"And the other element -- if I can just finish my question. You can tell me I'm wrong for -- for as long as you want. But the -- the next -- the element -- the elements that follow, you -- you would admit that ""knowingly"" applies to, but just not this one."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1689.005,1689.12,Sure.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1689.12,1691.48,-- it's a bit of a grammatical gravity I'm not familiar with.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1691.48,1701.275,"So the phrase ""knowingly violates"" in 924(a)(2) we interpret to mean knowledge of conduct, the same way that this Court did in the International Minerals and Chemical Corporation case."
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1722.25,1737.27,How -- how is the defendant blameworthy if he or she truly thought -- truly thought that the status was lawful and then possesses the gun? Just focus on that question.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1739.49,1741.68,"So I'm not sure that they are, but I think the more --"
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1741.68,1743.25,"Well, then okay. Let me stop you there."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1746.375,1759.77,"Because the more relevant question is whether the Congress that enacted FOPA in 1986 had any reason, given its 50-year history with the federal firearm laws, to think that cases of that type would be a problem. Congress normally legislates --"
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1759.77,1785.585,"But suppose -- suppose -- and I think you're right in the sense that 99 percent of the time or 90 percent of the time this is going to be so easy to prove, but there are going to be those cases, the delta of cases where the defendant truly was mistaken about his or her status, and you just said is not blameworthy in that circumstance, I think I have that right, and yet you would put that person in prison for up to 10 years."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1785.585,1790.05,"In the vast majority of those cases -- first of all, almost all of these cases --"
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1790.05,1792.52,"Well, what was wrong about my summary of your position?"
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1792.52,1792.655,Sure.
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1799.53,1802.205,Possibly -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- possibly true.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1812.775,1818.15,So it is notoriously difficult to figure out what is a mistake of law versus fact.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1847.16,1847.41,Really?
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1847.41,1848.27,So what?
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1848.27,1851.28,"Ninety-five percent are -- I -- I'm sorry, please go ahead."
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1851.28,1860.49,"Why is everybody assuming there has to be a mistake of fact? I mean, law sometimes can be a fact. I mean, a person overstays his visa."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1860.49,1860.885,Right.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1861.24,1862.78,He doesn't know he's overstayed it.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1881.85,1905.74,"But -- but -- but, look, there could be many situations where you just don't expect that person to -- to -- to know not necessarily the law that forbids the thing, but where the thing itself is composed, in part, of a law, many cases where they don't know what it is."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1905.74,1905.9,Sure.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1905.9,1913.845,"So where in the Supreme Court has this ever said, even in such a case, always, under all circumstances, right to jail?"
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1913.845,1917.74,So I agree with you morally speaking that someone who makes a mistake of law --
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1917.74,1919.2,If you agree with me morally speaking --
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1919.2,1919.4,But -- but --
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1919.4,1924.615,-- I have a naive view that criminal law by and large should charge -- should follow morals.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1928.19,1928.93,Or require --
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1928.93,1931.8,I think that's what Justice Black -- Justice Jackson.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1931.8,1932.2,Jackson.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.2,1933.775,So if you agree with that too.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1938.465,1943.09,Knowledge that you have to be violating the law is a willfulness requirement.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1956.41,1957.74,That isn't -- you've missed the question then.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1979.87,1979.96,Sure.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1979.96,1992.12,"-- look at that which it makes unlawful, sometimes the that which it makes unlawful could, in part, be composed of rules or laws."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1992.12,1992.58,Sure.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1992.58,1998.32,And it's that part that I am uncertain -- though you may know --
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1998.32,1998.9,Right.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1998.9,2005.84,"-- you know, that -- that this Court has always said you have to know the legal status there."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2005.84,2006.145,Sure.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2007.21,2009.84,Is it -- does it -- has it said that? Have we said that?
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2009.84,2022.48,"So I think that this Court has consistently said that, unless a willfulness requirement is imposed, you do not, in fact, have to show that the defendant had any awareness that they were violating any law, much less the specific law."
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.67,2032.315,Even including the -- the instance where you have a criminal statute that has within it a -- a -- a thing?
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2032.315,2032.73,Sure.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2032.73,2035.085,And the thing is in part composed of laws.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2040.94,2076.66,"So -- so maybe I could step back and answer your question this way: Even assuming that Congress thought there was some mens rea necessary with respect to status, would Congress have chosen knowingly? And I think we know the answer is no, because we have subsection (d), the firearm dealer provision, which applies where the defendant knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the person who's purchasing the gun has a prohibited status. So why would Congress presume that the firearm dealer has more information about the person purchasing the gun than the person who purchases the gun has about themselves?"
2018.17-9560,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2076.66,2078.12,"Well, that's a -- that's a very good point."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2105.625,2106.06,No.
2018.17-9560,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2118.64,2118.97,Wait a minute.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2118.97,2119.66,-- to reasonably believe something.
2018.17-9560,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2119.66,2135.06,"Congress -- Congress can legislate exceptions to every general rule. If the baseline is knowing for every element and, all of a sudden, Congress has another definition that changes it, which it does in -- in the dealer definition --"
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2135.06,2135.82,So it --
2018.17-9560,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2135.82,2137.73,-- the specific governs the general.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2137.73,2151.355,"So it's -- it's not clear how you get there textually, but it also doesn't explain why, for instance, in subsection (h) or (a)(6) Congress has specified a knowledge requirement there. In (h), for instance, you have to know that your employer has a prohibited status."
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2158.73,2163.14,I don't -- I don't think I agree with you on the fact it has to be read the same way in all.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2182.31,2182.54,So let me --
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.54,2187.85,-- and we wouldn't apply knowingly to the hook and we would apply it to other things and so forth.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2187.85,2212.02,"So let me speak then directly to the idea of knowledge of status, because, to a certain extent, mens rea is really about what facts a defendant is presumed to know or at least be on notice of versus the type that should be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. And there's a reason that we don't require in a case of statutory rape the government to prove that the defendant knew the victim was under the age of consent, because, even if he didn't know, he was on notice."
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2221.57,2225.81,"Well, you'd agree, first of all, I think, that the immigration laws are kind of complex."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2225.81,2226.455,They are.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2226.455,2226.97,All right.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2228.74,2229.405,Absolutely.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2229.405,2229.83,No doubt.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2231.23,2231.34,Yeah.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2231.34,2242.72,"-- for example, DACA recipients, whatever. You'd also, I think, agree in (d) that there's language before you get to the new mens rea, before the reasonable cause, that -- that the ""knowingly"" from 924 could attach to."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2242.72,2243.325,There is.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2243.325,2243.93,Okay.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2254.235,2261.78,"Because it's contained in a separate provision, which means that you don't have the same distributive language presumption that you would have if it were ""knowingly"" followed --"
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2261.78,2265.075,"Not distribute, but the very first substantive element."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2265.075,2277.39,"So I don't think anything about Petitioner's argument would change if it said anyone possessing a gun that traveled in interstate commerce who is an alien unlawfully in the United States, I don't think the order matters for that argument."
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2277.39,2281.58,But it matters to you because you admit it attaches to the second substantive element.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2281.58,2284.02,"Because it's conduct, not because it's the second one."
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2284.02,2288.82,"Well, the status is a product of conduct, isn't it?"
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2288.82,2289.72,I don't --
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2289.72,2292.3,One is an illegal alien because of one's conduct.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2295.98,2296.5,That is true.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2309.35,2313.305,"You'd agree that, you know, most of these cases you're going to be able to resolve by plea agreement?"
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2313.305,2314.425,I think that's right.
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2314.425,2319.83,You made a point about Congress and statutes use different kinds of mens rea in different sections.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2319.83,2320.13,Sure.
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2320.13,2324.08,"That's the whole point, right? Congress is all over the place in terms of mens rea."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2324.08,2324.33,That's right.
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2324.33,2326.095,"Old statutes, new statutes."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2348.355,2348.89,That is.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2400.76,2402.65,Then a person who overstays his visa --
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2402.65,2403.14,So you have to know.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.14,2409.705,"-- a person who overstays his visa, just inadvertently, is -- always knows that."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2425.09,2426.88,"I understand, but by the same --"
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2426.88,2430.18,I can fairly easily think of many other examples --
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2430.18,2430.27,Sure.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.27,2431.57,-- besides that indictment.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2431.57,2436.52,"And absolutely we can, but, you know, Congress normally legislates with the haystack in mind, not the needle."
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2436.52,2437.31,"But that's why, perhaps --"
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2437.31,2438.24,Especially not --
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2438.24,2472.285,"That's perhaps why courts tend to read into silent language mens rea requirements, such as: our statute -- I'm making up, but I -- I think it does illustrate the example. Anyone who robs a veteran of a medal that is in categories X, Y, Z, and C, the greatest honors and the lesser honors and so forth, goes to jail for 15 years."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2487.25999995,2488.0,Right.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2488.0,2491.39,"So it's not hard, I think, if you have more time --"
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2491.39,2491.86,Right.
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2491.86,2496.09,-- to think of tremendous unfairness that can exist.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2496.09,2510.72,"We can come up with hypotheticals, but, again, the question is whether Congress had any reason to redesign the way that firearm prosecutions had always worked in every court of appeals around the country out of concern for a category of cases that, if it exists at all --"
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2510.72,2511.295,Counsel --
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2511.295,2511.78,-- is vanishingly small.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2511.78,2543.105,"-- counsel, you talk about this -- this prior history as if it were handed to us on tablets, but the -- the only prior history I'm aware of really is that Fourth Circuit opinion, Capps, and it -- it seems to rely on a very convoluted parsing of the legislative history of a predecessor statute. That's what the holdings of the courts of appeals on your side all rest on at the end of the day, and that's a mode of interpretation that's not exactly preeminent today."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2543.105,2544.09,That's correct.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2544.09,2562.01,"And even for those of us who do attend carefully to legislative history, it's the legislative history of a prior statute that's been superseded. And I don't know many of us who think that is enough to overcome clear language of a present statute."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2564.125,2570.39,We have made a textual argument that does not rely on the arguments that appear in those Fourth Circuit references.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2570.39,2583.115,"Fair enough, but you just told us that we should be careful about undoing the careful work of the courts of appeals for the last 50 years, but if it all hinges on a terrible mistake, that argument seems to me -- you may have other arguments, but that one doesn't seem to be a very good one."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2583.115,2583.855,I'm sorry.
2018.17-9560,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2617.51,2624.99,"Mr. Kedem, before you do that, sorry, do you think that there's a difference between a jurisdictional element and a status element like this one?"
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2624.99,2627.09,I think it's not a difference in kind.
2018.17-9560,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2681.935,2692.715,The inference -- the -- the rule about so-called jurisdictional elements seems to me must rest on an inference about congressional intent.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2745.05,2748.03,So I'm -- I'm not sure it can be distinguished on those grounds.
2018.17-9560,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2814.54,2825.62,"Well, in practice -- practically, that won't be so because the last thing in the world that the defendant will want is for the jury to know that he committed some heinous crime."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2825.62,2827.755,So that will often be the case.
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2841.47,2842.1,But juries don't --
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2842.1,2842.44,Despite --
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2842.44,2843.83,-- believe that.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2843.83,2846.33,Sometimes they do; sometimes they don't.
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2846.33,2851.47,"Well, I mean, if you've got a ridiculous defense, it's not going to work."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2851.47,2866.98,"It's not ridiculous for a defendant who, let's say, five years after his prior offense, for which he received a 10-month sentence, to say, at the time of my later gun possession, it's just not something that I remembered because I only got 10 months, so I wasn't thinking about the potential penalty."
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2866.98,2870.22,All -- all right. So -- so we're dealing with two classes of cases then if I understand your argument.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2883.88,2884.56,Our point --
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2884.56,2886.25,"It seems to me a double-edged sword, isn't it?"
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2886.25,2892.925,"So -- so our argument is not that it's a burden on the government. Sometimes it will be, but usually it won't. And, in any event, we're not asking for your sympathy."
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2903.72,2907.43,"That does seem like you're asking for our sympathy, with all respect."
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2907.43,2909.58,You are referring to burden too.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2909.58,2909.665,Yeah.
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2909.665,2910.8,"I mean, that's your argument."
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2910.8,2913.88,"You say you want to turn to the practical consequences, the burden on the government."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2913.88,2914.12,It's not --
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2914.12,2916.47,And then we dismissed most of them as not burdensome at all.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2917.77,2920.8,"So, again, the problem is not the burden on the government."
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2922.42,2922.8,What is the --
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2922.8,2923.07,-- trial.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2923.07,2926.275,-- practical consequence argument then if it isn't the burden on the government?
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2926.275,2928.69,It's that it will be deeply confusing to the jury.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2930.14,2931.19,So you are worried about --
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2931.19,2937.53,You are considering a person who didn't know he was brought here at the age of two.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2961.065,2961.67,So --
2018.17-9560,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2961.67,2967.835,-- what purpose is it served to send that person to prison for ten years?
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2967.835,2979.05,"Respectfully, Justice Breyer, if you reinterpret the mens rea for every 922(g) offense out of concern for that hypothetical category of people, that is worse than letting the tail wag the dog."
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2984.16,2988.405,And the dog is that we're concerned about juries not being able to understand?
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2988.405,2991.565,And -- and the fact that you were shifting the focus.
2018.17-9560,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3005.785,3018.25,"Deeply confusing for a jury, and we just shouldn't trust juries, even though it's enshrined in the Constitution that -- that every person is entitled to have their guilt or innocence -- then we need to worry -- we need paternalistically to worry about juries?"
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3018.25,3018.84,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-9560,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3026.8,3032.135,How many people are now serving time in federal prison under the felon-in-possession statute?
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3032.135,3040.24,"Well, given that it's about 8, 9, 10,000 a year, it's going to be a very high number. If I could, because my time is limited --"
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3040.24,3045.435,"So Morissette itself, the charge was converting government property."
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3051.885,3052.145,Right.
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3052.4,3057.185,The government there argued who cares? It doesn't matter if you thought it was abandoned.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3057.185,3057.7,Right.
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3057.7,3060.28,And Justice Jackson saw the problem.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3060.28,3061.18,"Right, because that --"
2018.17-9560,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3061.18,3068.285,And why is that different from this case? They're the abandoned property here. You're -- didn't know your status.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3068.285,3094.87,"Because here we're talking not just about a legal status, but the defendant's own legal status, something of which he presumably is aware or at least is charged with being aware. What a defendant can't do is say: I don't remember when my visa was going to expire and, you know what, I'm not going to bother to figure out, because as long as I remain ignorant, even recklessly ignorant about my own status, that means that I can't face liability. If I could just tie together the various strands of our textual argument."
2018.17-9560,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3163.3,3176.7,I would like to know your -- your view of -- let's just say we -- we would reverse the -- the collateral review issue that I asked about.
2018.17-9560,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3176.7,3177.095,Sure.
2018.17-9560,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3193.69,3196.19,"Thank you, counsel. Six minutes, Ms. Cakmis."
2018.17-9560,2,63133,rosemary_t_cakmis,,3196.19,3225.0,"Thank you, Your Honor. First, I'd just like to point out I think that 10,000 a year prosecutions under this statute is somewhat overstated in that the sentencing commission has indicated in the past 15 years there's only been 65,000. But, regardless, the bulk of them are under the felon-in-possession."
2018.17-9560,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3315.075,3316.13,"Thank you, counsel."
