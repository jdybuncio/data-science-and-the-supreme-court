1973.73-263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.332,"We’ll hear arguments next in 73-263, Commissioner against Idaho Power."
1973.73-263,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,122.418,125.948,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-263,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,167.356,174.715,"Put you back along way Mr. Jones, I suppose the same issue is at present time, succeeding tax full years of the taxpayer?"
1973.73-263,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,174.715,179.903,That is my understanding Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1973.73-263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,527.321,532.936,"What do you rely on, saying this is not normal if it would not be normal accounting practice?"
1973.73-263,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,532.936,540.498,By normal accounting practice we mean the general accepting accounting rule that this kind of capital cost must be capitalized.
1973.73-263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,540.498,543.321,I know that what you say but what is your authority to that?
1973.73-263,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,543.321,548.563,"Well, we sited a couple of accounting text in our brief and we also sited the rules --"
1973.73-263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,548.563,550.497,Having books of this company kept --
1973.73-263,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,550.497,552.663,They were kept on the basis which we urge.
1973.73-263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.251,566.755,"So their own accounting, for the purpose of its audit and its certificate, treated this as you suggested should be treated?"
1973.73-263,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,566.755,567.502,That is correct Mr. Justice White.
1973.73-263,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,567.502,571.335,Does the SCC have an accounting rule on this?
1973.73-263,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,571.335,577.395,"Mr. Justice Douglas, I am not familiar with the SCC’s rules that may but I can answer that question."
1973.73-263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,594.22,603.451,It is not unusual I suppose for a taxpayer to treat an item one way for its internal accounting purposes and another way for taxes.
1973.73-263,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,603.451,605.537,There is nothing about that Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.73-263,1,24185,frank_norton_kern,,1316.68,1324.365,Mr. Chief justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.533,1873.431,"Mr. Kern, are the automobiles that you referred to are they used by the company a 100% of the time in construction or they use part of the time for construction, part of the time for other."
1973.73-263,1,24185,frank_norton_kern,,1873.431,1878.791,And part for operations and part for maintenance and in part for construction.
1973.73-263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1878.791,1883.235,You understand what the governments position is as to how that should be allocated or whether it should be allocated.
1973.73-263,1,24185,frank_norton_kern,,1883.235,1898.634,"Yes, the company keeps records on its books as to the usage and those records are available in an allocated portion of the depreciation as allocated to construction."
1973.73-263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2458.366,2459.838,These are tax cases or ICC cases?
1973.73-263,1,24185,frank_norton_kern,,2459.838,2460.656,These are tax cases.
1973.73-263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2460.656,2461.58,Tax cases.
1973.73-263,1,24185,frank_norton_kern,,2461.58,2466.426,But it was the -- of course it was the ICC accounting that got depreciation buried within it.
1973.73-263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2466.426,2467.403,Right.
1973.73-263,1,24185,frank_norton_kern,,2467.403,2484.26,"The government said that these cost had to be capitalized and the Court four times, the Court’s four times, each time it started off for the board of tax appeals held that they must be capitalized but in only in one of those cases was the term depreciation ever mentioned."
1973.73-263,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,2949.168,2951.596,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.73-263,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3072.481,3078.251,Will this anything be true of estate and local taxes paid up on this equipment?
1973.73-263,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3078.251,3085.546,The history of estate and local taxes and other caring charges such as interest is a long one.
1973.73-263,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3106.955,3113.047,But they were -- one of the cause of ownership to the equipment that was used in the construction of the capital assets.
1973.73-263,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3113.047,3119.803,That’s right and I think that the holding that those items were not capital is subject to some question.
1973.73-263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3194.316,3194.985,Thank you gentlemen.
