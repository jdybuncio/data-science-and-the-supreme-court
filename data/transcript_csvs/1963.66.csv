1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,227.897,228.305,Well --
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,228.305,229.803,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,229.803,232.205,"-- in -- well, point were in terms of cities."
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,232.205,232.701,City?
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,232.701,233.36,Yes.
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,237.518,239.638,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,239.638,241.586,"No, no."
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,241.586,242.107,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,242.107,243.404,That's right Mr. Justice Goldberg.
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,243.404,250.265,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,250.265,252.826,"No, I -- I don't conceived at all."
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,278.895,285.545,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,285.545,285.745,Well --
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,285.745,302.191,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,302.191,302.793,Well --
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,302.793,307.753,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,307.753,310.764,"No, that is that our contentions Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1963.66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.669,417.727,"But as long as he was hauling that kind of a commodity or that kind of a customer, you can haul at any place with any of the geographical areas."
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,417.727,419.726,"Yes, to anybody."
1963.66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.51,425.065,-- from a particular person --
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,425.065,429.747,"Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,429.747,433.704,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,433.704,437.203,The statute doesn't say anything about customers.
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,437.203,440.837,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,440.837,445.371,"No, no that is not -- that's not our argument Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,445.371,448.34,Are you saying that (Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,448.34,448.676,Well --
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,448.676,452.965,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,452.965,465.241,"Section 212 (c) in terms, does not say anything about customers and therefore would not limit the -- would not preclude the Commission from including in the common carrier certificate."
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,521.828,543.194,Why do you (Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,543.194,544.088,"Well, we don't read that as --"
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,544.088,545.1,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,545.1,559.094,We don't read that as a -- as a prohibition upon including in the certificate any other provisions that might be contained in the permit and which are not in any way inconsistent with that statutory mandate.
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,611.385,620.18,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,620.18,630.303,"That's -- well, if you interpret the language as a common carrier to mean that, then that might be the source of the objection and I will address myself to that objection too."
1963.66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,754.116,762.089,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,762.089,766.23,"No, Mr. Justice White, it did not."
1963.66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.197,814.164,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,814.164,816.047,Exactly and that is the question --
1963.66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,816.047,823.192,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,823.192,824.608,"Yes, that's right."
1963.66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.998,843.8,"More important law does decide it here, what happened to the (Inaudible) remand or?"
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,843.8,850.591,"Well, let me say this, first, that question wasn't even presented to the Commission in the first place."
1963.66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,885.101,896.54,But the -- certainly the Commission decided that -- and that is giving a certificate of substantial parity.
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,896.54,897.757,"Yes, the Commission --"
1963.66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,897.757,898.401,It thought it was.
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,898.401,900.798,It thought it was and it was never advised differently.
1963.66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,900.798,902.24,It might be wrong.
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,902.24,903.533,It might well be wrong.
1963.66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.109,1005.49,"But you -- you seemed to -- you seemed to agree that they're some regard of to who's responsible, there are some facts the Commission hasn't considered."
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1005.49,1006.434,"Yes, that's right."
1963.66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.41,1024.319,Was this certificate somewhat broader than in -- in one way broader than the old one?
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1024.319,1025.77,Is it broader?
1963.66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.77,1026.484,Does it give more?
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1026.484,1034.189,"Oh yes, yes, it certainly does in one relatively minor respect and in one very major respect."
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1154.534,1163.345,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1163.345,1165.065,"Yes, it does Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1165.065,1168.873,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1168.873,1169.653,Yes.
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1169.653,1193.761,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1193.761,1194.054,Well --
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1194.054,1194.825,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1194.825,1200.761,"Putting aside the question of substantial as opposed to complete parity, putting that question aside --"
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1200.761,1207.121,(Inaudible) get from the statute?
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1207.121,1212.558,"Well first of all, from the language of the statute itself, it says, ""Same commodities, same points, same territories."""
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1217.862,1226.711,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1226.711,1227.129,Well our --
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1227.129,1231.599,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1231.599,1241.552,We don't derive it from any place other than that but our position is that the restrictions which we have imposed here comply with the letter of the statutory mandate --
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1241.552,1241.825,(Voice Overlap)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1241.825,1242.499,-- because --
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1242.499,1247.419,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1247.419,1252.09,"No, but that isn't what we've done here Mr. Justice Goldberg and that I think is a crucial point."
1963.66,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1274.191,1278.053,You mean between retail and wholesale staff.
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1278.053,1283.15,Between retail and wholesale esta -- between outlets of retail and wholesale establishments.
1963.66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.371,1800.681,(Inaudible)
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1800.681,1801.354,There is a difference in the --
1963.66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.354,1804.118,-- grand or the other grandfather clauses (Inaudible)?
1963.66,1,23981,frank_i_goodman,,1804.118,1823.839,"There is a difference in the language but I think it relevant to point out that this very Congress in the very next session, the very next year in 1958, would've enacted another grandfather clause using exactly the same language that it used in the original grandfather clauses of the Motor Carrier Act, described that grandfather clause."
1963.66,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1864.94,1872.257,Mr. Singer.
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,1872.257,1892.761,"The basic issue before this Court is whether or not Montgomery as a converted carrier, precede a certificate which authorized the transportation of the same commodities between the same points or within the same territory as contained in its permit of the contract carrier."
1963.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.473,2085.386,"(Inaudible) covered two points now, haven't you?"
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,2094.085,2094.156,That's correct.
1963.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.156,2095.264,-- you've made that point.
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,2095.264,2095.641,That's correct.
1963.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.641,2106.061,"Now, you're saying that -- that they've also -- even if they had that -- even if they had authority to impose some restrictions that they couldn't impose the ones you're now talking about."
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,2106.061,2106.57,That's right.
1963.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2127.65,2129.994,"Now, is that -- is that point here now?"
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,2129.994,2130.742,Yes.
1963.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.742,2137.517,Your opponent suggests that this was never raised before the Commission or in the District Court and that couldn't be here.
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,2137.517,2139.218,That isn't correct.
1963.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.537,2171.609,But did you bring up the fact that you -- you suggested you did not bring up the fact that there were many of -- many of the -- many runs that you were making before you could not make in this --
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,2171.609,2175.05,"Well, we did this Mr. Justice White."
1963.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.159,2195.687,"Well, how about the Commission?"
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,2195.687,2197.837,"Yes, this was brought before the Commission --"
1963.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.837,2200.726,It's the same -- the same runs if you list in your brief?
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,2200.726,2202.414,"No, not the same examples."
1963.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.294,2214.401,Did you give some of those?
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,2214.401,2216.581,"We gave some of them, yes."
1963.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.759,2373.747,(Inaudible) to show that the Commission understood this?
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,2373.747,2374.591,Well --
1963.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.591,2374.825,(Voice Overlap)
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,2374.825,2375.758,-- Mr. Justice White --
1963.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.758,2377.568,Or that -- or -- or should have understood it?
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,2377.568,2381.499,They should've understood it because they -- they were purportedly the expertise --
1963.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.499,2383.245,Experts.
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,2383.245,2406.047,"-- in the matter and the only thing that we did in our presentation before the Commission was to show as required by the statute that the operations of Montgomery as of the statutory date, did not fall within the new definition of contract carry were those of the common carrier and were otherwise lawful."
1963.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2414.358,2430.259,"-- here it sounds like you're turning the question around that saying that, the issue that's really here is the validity of the precise restrictions that they imposed on Montgomery, if they might've -- if they could've put less restrictions on that question isn't here."
1963.66,2,20148,charles_w_singer,,2430.259,2435.22,"Well, the -- the question -- there're two questions before this Court as I see it."
