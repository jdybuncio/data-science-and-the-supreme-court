1998.97-1732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.959,"I think we'll start argument in the third case, No. 97-1732, California Public Employees' Retirement System v. Felzen."
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,40.198,42.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,93.252,96.815,They litigated their... what does litigating their objections consist of?
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,100.059,100.42,That's true.
1998.97-1732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,101.331,110.077,"I mean, they weren't subject to discovery or... or to any of the other procedures that a party is subject to."
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,110.438,124.996,"--Not in this case, although a district court judge could fashion a settlement hearing in which he would allow some sort of discovery of the objecting parties' experts or... or some limited... I would think that... that the court would have discretion to do that in appropriate circumstances."
1998.97-1732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.996,134.092,But it doesn't follow automatically from the fact that you submit that the other side is entitled to treat you like a party.
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,134.092,135.244,That's correct.
1998.97-1732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,201.181,202.81,What does a quasi party mean?
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,202.81,213.456,"Well, quasi party means they are not a formal party in the sense of names on the caption or allowed to intervene pursuant to rule 24."
1998.97-1732,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,235.672,237.054,That sounds like--
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,261.12,262.639,It has happened.
1998.97-1732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,309.922,312.193,But suppose there hadn't been a settlement.
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,325.371,329.665,Not in those circumstances because two of the factors that I've cited would not be present.
1998.97-1732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.05,338.524,"Well, I... I... I can fill in one of them."
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,343.018,347.292,--If they sought to participate--
1998.97-1732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.292,348.494,No.
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,351.736,353.666,"--Well, it's not clear then--"
1998.97-1732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,353.666,354.758,It has to come down to--
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,354.758,355.209,--How would they--
1998.97-1732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.209,359.31,"--that... that one provision allowing them to object that makes the difference, it seems to me."
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,362.655,364.165,--That would... that would be my point.
1998.97-1732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.638,408.536,I don't see the... the need for those rights in a settlement context any more than the need for those rights in... in... in a judgment context.
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,408.536,409.236,"Well, in fact, rule--"
1998.97-1732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.236,410.397,"I mean, you're right."
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,448.14,458.229,"--Well, in fact, Justice Scalia, I think allowing objecting shareholders to appeal dovetails very nicely with the clear legislative purposes and policies behind rule 23.1."
1998.97-1732,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.746,476.519,"They wouldn't be a party as... in the terms that Justice Scalia described, though, would they?"
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,490.39,491.471,That would be correct.
1998.97-1732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.984,547.139,Is it your... is it your position that... that what you're urging upon us applies not just in derivative actions but in... in... in class action suits?
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,547.139,549.84,I... I think the same rule would apply in both circumstances.
1998.97-1732,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,555.546,556.646,One of the... I'm sorry.
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,558.148,558.578,That's--
1998.97-1732,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,558.578,572.056,"I was going to say one of the... one of the... the points that was made toward the end of... of your opposing counsel's brief was that if, indeed, the same rule is applied to rule 23, the result is going to be incoherence in class action litigation."
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,587.316,588.796,--A point to the contrary.
1998.97-1732,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,594.742,596.453,--What about class actions not derivative?
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,596.453,609.653,"In the class action context, one of the amici, Public Citizens, put in information showing that 90 percent of class actions settle without objection, which means you're not going to run into a problem."
1998.97-1732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,616.838,617.59,Were there--
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,622.051,634.9,"With respect to class actions, we cite the relevant cases in footnote 11 of page 1 of our reply brief."
1998.97-1732,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,634.9,638.693,"But in class actions, they're non-named parties, but they are parties."
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,656.487,656.867,"Well, no."
1998.97-1732,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,685.317,696.285,"Well, they're bound, as a practical matter, in not being able to have a new derivative suit I suppose, but they're not bound in the sense that class action members who do not opt out are bound."
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,696.285,716.56,"Well, I think they're bound in precisely... precisely that sense, Justice Kennedy, in the sense that they are precluded then from bringing a derivative suit claim arising out of the same circumstances, just as a class member would be precluded from bringing a... a subsequent suit unless the class member elects to opt out."
1998.97-1732,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,716.56,719.17,Anybody a judgment binds can--
1998.97-1732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.917,751.712,"Will you... we'll continue with the argument in No. 97-1732, California Public Employees' Retirement System v. Felzen."
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,752.483,753.094,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.97-1732,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,877.96,887.637,"Well, Mr. Kellogg, could they even intervene of right under the conflict or the tension that you mentioned before between rule 24 and 23.1?"
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,899.965,904.737,"That's exactly right, and I don't see how those two provisions mesh very well together."
1998.97-1732,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,912.705,921.32,"And then it could be then... if... if you can show that you're not adequately represented, then... then there should not have been the recognition of the champion as an adequate representative."
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,923.501,923.902,--Right.
1998.97-1732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.045,932.039,You could make the same argument about automatic displacement.
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,947.01,947.059,"Well, I think--"
1998.97-1732,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,947.059,951.172,--because we're going to let this... this new person come in automatically and challenge the settlement.
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,951.172,968.797,"--I think my point is that 23.1 gives us an absolute right to come in and object without intervening to a proposed settlement, and there's no reason why we should not have an equivalent right on appeal to object to the settlement if our objections are rejected by the district court."
1998.97-1732,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,975.84,991.971,"Is it... is it fair to say that the right that you have under 23.1 assumes that there are going to be some circumstances in... in which there will be an inadequacy and that, in fact, is the reason why the right to notice and presumably the right to object following notice is given?"
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,991.971,997.684,"Well, I think you have to distinguish between the inadequacy of the existing plaintiffs and the inadequacy of the proposed settlement."
1998.97-1732,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1005.459,1012.865,"So, you would not... you would not infer from the inadequacy of the settlement, the inadequacy of the existing plaintiffs to represent the shareholders."
1998.97-1732,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1012.865,1017.166,"--You know, that... that could in some instances be a pretty fair inference that a collusive settlement indicates--"
1998.97-1732,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1149.586,1162.155,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1244.141,1245.671,Which respondent's brief are you referring to?
1998.97-1732,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1245.671,1246.523,--I'm sorry.
1998.97-1732,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1319.182,1322.094,"Well, now, what is the claim preclusion here?"
1998.97-1732,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1335.364,1338.197,"In fact, it is the same chosen action."
1998.97-1732,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1356.739,1363.365,"Well, what... what happens here is this corporation can't be sued again, and... and the right is still a derivative one in this case."
1998.97-1732,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1363.365,1373.111,"--It's also the directors and officers who are the real defendants in this case, Justice Kennedy, cannot be sued derivatively by other shareholders."
1998.97-1732,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1433.599,1446.489,"So, if... if I agreed with you here, why wouldn't the same be true... why wouldn't the people who intervene in Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust procedures also get a right to appeal?"
1998.97-1732,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1446.489,1447.52,Two answers.
1998.97-1732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1591.595,1600.948,"Well, what... what happens... let's... let's assume that... that you allow these shareholders to appeal and they do appeal and the settlement is set aside."
1998.97-1732,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1615.71,1616.199,That's correct.
1998.97-1732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1616.199,1618.803,"Right, and they can take up... and this can go on endlessly."
1998.97-1732,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1618.803,1630.28,"Well, in fact, as the empirical experience would strongly suggest, Justice Scalia, in the uniform application of this rule up until the decision below, that was not the experience."
1998.97-1732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.344,1651.101,"I... I'm... I'm unaware of any situation where... where, you know, we have set up a procedural framework that lends itself to... to... to... to turning into a perpetual motion machine."
1998.97-1732,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1651.101,1651.792,"Well, in fact--"
1998.97-1732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1651.792,1654.103,And... and... and this one certainly does.
1998.97-1732,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1654.103,1655.535,"--No, Justice Scalia, it does not."
1998.97-1732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1677.389,1678.379,"Well, isn't present anyway?"
1998.97-1732,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1688.238,1689.669,"That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1998.97-1732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1742.646,1744.336,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,1746.347,1755.352,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1732,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.938,1810.821,It cannot change any of the issues in the case.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,1811.462,1812.474,I'm sorry?
1998.97-1732,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1812.474,1815.484,"An amicus curiae, at least in our Court--"
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,1815.484,1816.045,Yes.
1998.97-1732,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1816.045,1817.437,--cannot enlarge any of the issues.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,1817.437,1818.098,That's correct.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1818.098,1820.81,"And, of course, they're not bound by the judgment either."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,1820.81,1836.17,"They're not bound by the judgment either, and neither in any meaningful sense were CalPERS and FSBA... I'll just refer to them as CalPERS... who came into the court of appeals in analytically essentially the same position as the Government here."
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1836.17,1839.111,"Well, I know, but you're not saying they're not bound by the judgment, are you?"
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,1839.111,1844.645,I'm saying that they have no rights of their own that are affected by that judgment.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1844.895,1845.847,"Well, they own stock."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,1845.847,1849.439,"--They own stock, but they are not suing in their own right."
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1884.774,1888.555,But only if they show the board isn't... is... is not independent.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,1888.555,1893.898,--They have to... they have to show they made a demand and that the board refused to act on it.
1998.97-1732,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1925.149,1926.851,It ends with a derivative claim.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,1927.472,1927.652,That's right.
1998.97-1732,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1927.652,1929.023,--no specific individual rights.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,1929.023,1929.403,That's right.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1944.854,1949.389,"No, but to the extent that the settlement affects the value of the stock... and often a settlement will."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,1967.079,1970.942,"--No, I can't... I would not agree with that, Justice Stevens."
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1979.217,1981.828,"No, but theoretically some settlements do affect the value of stock."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,1981.828,1998.761,"--But if a... if a shareholder says, you directors defaulted in your duties, you did bad things, you failed to do the things you were bound to be, then that shareholder... and he says, as a result, the value of my stock dropped, that's a suit on behalf of the individual shareholder."
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1998.761,1998.981,"No, no, no."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,1998.981,1999.292,That is not a--
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1999.292,2006.357,It's a suit on behalf of the corporation and the individual shareholder's interest in the outcome is measured by the value of that person's stock.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2006.357,2007.799,--The interest... no.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2008.228,2009.459,Well--
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2009.459,2020.225,"--I'm... I'm... with all respect, in a derivative suit, the only interest being litigated is the interest of the corporation, which may or may not have an effect on the value of--"
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2020.225,2020.926,"--Well, let me ask you this."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2027.34,2031.454,--It's because he is one of the owners of the corporation.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2031.454,2031.794,Right.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2031.794,2043.201,"And... and presumably the value of his interest in the corporation to that extent gives him, according to rule 23.1, enough basis to come in and say we're going to displace--"
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.201,2051.324,And the basis it gives him the standing to sue is precisely the same basis that every other shareholder has except they may have fewer or more shares is the only difference.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2051.324,2052.065,--Right.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.947,2055.562,And you admit the plaintiff has standing because the plaintiff might--
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2055.562,2056.03,--standing.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2056.29,2056.59,--What?
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2056.59,2056.951,Sure.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2056.951,2060.373,Because the plaintiff might be hurt because the value of his shares may be affected.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2060.373,2064.197,"I... I think... I think that possibility, although it's not a certainty--"
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.197,2068.248,"Well, it's enough of a certainty to provide standing under article 3."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2068.248,2069.371,"--Under article 3, I agree."
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2069.371,2075.795,And... and precisely the same interest is... is controlled for every other shareholder when the case is... is terminated.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2075.795,2082.069,"That's... that's... there's no difference in the rights of the particular shareholders, except as to their pro rata ownership of the corporation."
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2084.469,2090.603,So that the other shareholder is bound by the judgment in precisely the same sense that the plaintiff who brought the suit is.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2090.603,2098.639,--Which is the sense that the corporation no longer can bring that cause of action against whoever is the defendant in that case.
1998.97-1732,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2098.639,2105.273,"Well, are you suggesting that the individual could then turn around and bring an individual action not in the name of the corporation?"
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2105.273,2109.158,"If the... if he claims an injury, but it would be a different--"
1998.97-1732,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2109.158,2112.117,But for precisely the same injury that was the subject of the derivative action?
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2112.117,2114.07,--As... as an individual?
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2123.886,2126.387,In a capacity other than a shareholder.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2126.387,2134.944,"--He... he would bring... he would bring the action as... as someone who was injured by wrongful acts of the directors, yes, as an individual."
1998.97-1732,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2134.944,2137.374,"But he would be bringing it as a... I mean, his claim--"
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2137.374,2137.755,Yes.
1998.97-1732,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2137.755,2138.837,--The hypothesis is--
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2138.837,2139.044,"Yes, that was--"
1998.97-1732,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2139.044,2142.007,"--that as a shareholder, he was injured because his stock went down--"
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2142.007,2143.649,--This happens all the time.
1998.97-1732,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2143.649,2144.661,--or is worth less than it would have been--
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2144.661,2144.728,Right.
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2153.925,2155.547,"--Yes, but it couldn't be the same claim."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2161.603,2162.012,That's right.
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2162.012,2163.524,That claim is cut out.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2186.287,2192.292,I would... I would say derivative suits are different from class actions.
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2219.099,2219.78,Why not?
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2220.592,2221.821,--Because... excuse me.
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2221.821,2222.822,--They wouldn't be named.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2229.728,2243.616,"Again, they have a somewhat better claim because a class action member has a particular individual claim against that defendant which is being... which is being precluded."
1998.97-1732,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2243.616,2246.909,--But textually they are treated just about identically in the two rules.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2246.909,2254.744,"Textually it's essentially the same... the same words, Justice Souter, in rule 23(e) and in the last sentence of rule 23.1."
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2286.476,2289.357,Were we out of order then in the Amchem case?
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2306.59,2317.898,"Now, actually, Justice Ginsburg, in Amchem the petitioners in this Court had been subjected to an injunction in that case as well as being objectors."
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2351.67,2355.532,But Marino... that was a case of antagonistic interests.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2367.961,2368.512,Yes.
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2368.512,2371.484,"Because as I read the rule, they have no right to intervene."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2374.356,2381.422,I... I would believe that probably they do have a right to intervene under rule 24(b) as a permissive intervention.
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2381.422,2386.314,"They... well, they don't have any right, but then it's within the discretion of the judge."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2404.156,2407.907,"Well, look... look at the Fibreboard case that the Court has before it now."
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2421.257,2435.447,"But they didn't have the peculiar problem that the... that the 23.1 objector has; that is, he has to show that he's not adequately represented to intervene of right."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2462.945,2465.607,It... it might or might not.
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2471.043,2485.612,"But at least we've established that there would be no right... that this settlement, unless the district judge in his discretion chose to allow intervention, would be immune from appellate review."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2485.612,2491.165,--Rule 24 would allow permissive intervention.
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2498.931,2500.312,And that would be abuse of discretion.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2500.312,2504.015,"--It would be subject to an abuse of discretion standard, but there would be a record."
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2547.745,2555.251,"But is it not true... do you dispute the fact that the... in response to the notice, a shareholder can come in and object without intervening?"
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2555.251,2562.276,"--He could in this case because there was an order, and this was the point Justice Breyer made--"
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2562.276,2569.75,"Well, just as a general proposition, would you say that... that the notice is sufficient to give a shareholder standing to object without intervening?"
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2569.75,2580.356,"--I think perhaps a district judge could... could say, I will only entertain objections from intervenors because the rule... I mean, I have to... I have to say we are construing the text of the rule--"
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2580.356,2582.619,"Is it not the fact, though, that the practice of district judges--"
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2582.619,2583.09,--Practice.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.09,2588.193,--in reviewing has always been to allow those shareholders to respond to a notice to make their objections--
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2588.193,2589.072,Absolutely.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2589.072,2589.342,--Yes.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2589.342,2592.106,"Absolutely, and essentially like an amicus curiae."
1998.97-1732,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.096,2601.59,"Why... why if... if that's open... I mean, I'm trying to figure out what this... what the case... what turns on this case."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2624.765,2626.037,That's correct.
1998.97-1732,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2626.037,2628.208,"If you don't take the 24 route, it's the same."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2652.336,2655.479,"Well, in the first place, the courts have not gotten along with the simpler route."
1998.97-1732,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.347,2700.639,That... that all argues in favor that it's addedly complex.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2730.827,2737.452,"Well, with all respect, it is... I mean, that sounds like testimony before one of the rules drafting committees."
1998.97-1732,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2737.452,2737.622,--Fine.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2739.433,2739.643,Right.
1998.97-1732,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2739.643,2741.716,One answer might be right or wrong.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2754.153,2755.745,I'll accept... I'll accept both of those.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2782.852,2789.475,"Yes, but you surely have to say that's a minor matter because the lawyers for the plaintiffs are paid several million dollars for doing that restructuring."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2789.475,2790.276,--And... and... and--
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2790.276,2791.428,"So, it's a pretty important issue."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2791.428,2792.768,--Yes.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2792.768,2795.42,"Otherwise, you wouldn't have paid that kind of fees to have it resolved."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2795.42,2797.312,It was important.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2826.511,2827.432,"Mr. Kester, I think--"
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2832.746,2833.417,--Right.
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2834.826,2848.914,"The concern here... I mean, the... it was that the modifications were they said what the company had already agreed to and then there was a little question about there was no money in this for anybody except for lawyers."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2886.97,2901.941,"--And they want to then stop that settlement from taking effect and hold it up for a year, or whatever it takes, by filing a notice of appeal, and they haven't done the minimal act of going to the district judge and saying, we wish to intervene."
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2908.676,2920.995,"But we've been around that bush because you have conceded that they would not be intervenors of right, and then it's a discretionary matter which the district judge might or might not allow."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2920.995,2921.876,I'm sorry.
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2940.387,2947.472,"But then... then they would be attacking not the settlement, but the very maintenance of the suit because if the representative is inadequate, he can't maintain the suit."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2947.472,2949.172,That would... that would be a different sort of objection.
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2951.005,2954.718,"That would not be an objection to the settlement, which is what they want to object to."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2954.718,2960.191,"--Well, they would... I... it would probably include an objection to the settlement because they would say it was a settlement that was collusive or whatever."
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2974.592,2978.142,"Well, that's why they would not have a right to intervene."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2978.142,2984.948,"--They have a right... Justice Ginsburg, perhaps... perhaps this is a better way to say it."
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2993.566,2997.407,"Yes, but Mr. Kester, I'm asking you to be concrete about that because we have an actual case."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,2997.407,2997.817,--I understand.
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2997.817,3000.65,And I put it to Mr. Kellogg and now I'm putting it to you.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3000.65,3000.93,Okay.
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3000.93,3007.234,"As I read rule 24, as applied to this case, they have no right to intervene."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3007.234,3009.805,They... they waived any such objection.
1998.97-1732,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3018.34,3021.963,"Yes, but then... then we're back where it's up to the district judge who may or may not--"
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3021.963,3030.639,Who... who may... who is subject to rule 24(c) which provides certain parameters of when you grant these and... and when you don't and what you look at.
1998.97-1732,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3039.425,3069.745,"--Of course, if... if... if we find... if we find for your... your opponent in this case, unless we accompany our opinion with... with some statement to the effect that the district judge has to allow objections, the reaction on the part of the district courts, which up to now have been so liberal in... in allowing objections to be filed, could conceivably be, well, if allowing an objection is going to allow all these people to become parties, we're not going to allow objections."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3074.98,3075.579,--I understand.
1998.97-1732,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3075.579,3078.13,I'm just speculating as to whether that... that isn't a possible reaction.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3093.093,3096.816,"There were 24... 243,000 notices went out in this case."
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.034,3114.497,"You don't really think that any district judge would say, we're going to spend a million dollars sending out notices to all these shareholders, but we're not going to let them object."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3117.339,3119.652,"--Well, I... if... I--"
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3119.652,3120.882,"I mean, you don't really think that's going to happen."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3120.882,3124.084,--I... I... I... I imagine that the... that the district judge would entertain objections.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3124.475,3124.825,Sure.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3127.376,3136.873,"--But... but what... but what happens, Justice Stevens, after the settlement, after the final judgment is entered and then more people say, well, we... we still object and we're going to--"
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3136.873,3141.906,"--Well, they'd have to make... I mean, the conditions, the three conditions, that your opponent has asked for... they have to make a timely objection."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3148.13,3151.814,--I see nothing in the... because they don't tie this to the Federal rules.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3179.954,3191.601,"Well, and if you had to appeal from a denial of intervention, the issue on appeal would be whether it was an abuse of discretion to deny intervention, which would be the primary issue, and it wouldn't be... the primary issue would not be the fairness of the settlement."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3227.327,3237.753,"--There... there is no sure right of review if... if no one intervenes, but if no one cares enough, Justice Stevens, to intervene, why should there be a review?"
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3239.695,3246.849,"Well, the reason I suppose is that you want to... do you want to make it easy for shareholders, many of whom are small shareholders, to file objections?"
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3253.604,3254.125,--And--
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3254.125,3256.016,Maybe that's a good reason; maybe it isn't.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3257.198,3259.849,"--Maybe it is and maybe it isn't, but it's not in the Federal rules."
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3261.859,3264.383,"Well, provision for notice is in the Federal rules."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3264.383,3265.122,--Provision for notice.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3265.122,3276.231,"And the purpose of that obviously was to allow shareholders to object to settlements, and the reason for an appeal is that, everybody knows, there often large attorneys' fees in these cases which facilitate the settlement."
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3277.561,3279.173,I'm... I'm sure you have.
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3299.148,3301.379,It doesn't turn one into a party with a right to appeal.
1998.97-1732,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3310.285,3310.695,--I--
1998.97-1732,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3310.695,3312.567,You don't take that position.
