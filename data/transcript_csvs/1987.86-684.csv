1987.86-684,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.887,"We'll hear argument next in No. 86-684, California versus Billy Greenwood and Dyanne Van Houten."
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,55.666,64.771,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1987.86-684,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.845,292.584,"Mr. Pear, in response, your opponent raises now a due process argument based on the California law here and constitution giving the owner of the trash some protected liberty interest in the trash, and certainly the law in the State of California is different than that of a good many States."
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,297.35,298.755,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1987.86-684,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,413.598,417.691,But that isn't the argument as I understood it.
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,439.776,440.024,No.
1987.86-684,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,453.504,455.066,Say they didn't do it as a matter of constitutional.
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,473.714,479.931,"--Under the State law, but I would submit that it would not be a legitimate expectation under the Fourth Amendment."
1987.86-684,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,505.03,507.732,"Well, we say some things are obscene in California and not in other States."
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,518.447,538.86,"I would think that community standards have been determined by this Court to be an appropriate method of dealing with area obscenity, but counsel cites no cases, and I think it would be inappropriate to say you would have a community standard of Fourth Amendment rights, or a community standard of Miranda rights, Fifth Amendment rights."
1987.86-684,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,538.86,550.902,"Well, I agree, but the question here is whether there's a reasonable expectation of privacy, and I'm just wondering if every American citizen must have the same expectation or is it possible that there could be different expectations in different parts of the country."
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,553.932,569.645,"Well, taking this Court's analysis that a reasonable expectation of privacy involves a two part analysis, now the subjective expectation of citizens might vary from community to community, it might vary among the residents of a single household."
1987.86-684,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,586.811,596.977,"Most property concepts we turn to State law to define, and what could be more legitimate than a State Statute in terms of objective reasonableness of the standard?"
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,596.977,607.522,I don't think the issue is objective reasonableness in determining under Fourth Amendment what is a legitimate expectation of privacy.
1987.86-684,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,615.628,619.828,What if most States began to adopt a provision like California's?
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,624.343,629.918,"Your Honor, with regards to adopt what, a case?"
1987.86-684,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,639.992,644.678,"Well, the case interprets the California constitution and laws, presumably."
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,644.678,645.303,Certainly.
1987.86-684,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,651.597,658.219,Would that then affect our view under the Fourth Amendment of what's reasonable as an expectation?
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,658.219,669.418,"--As the opinion by this Court in Rickus indicated, you don't just look to Fourth Amendment cases to decide what Fourth Amendment is."
1987.86-684,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,705.06,712.681,"Should we apply the Katz analysis here, do you think, or should we look at it as a question of abandonment?"
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,712.681,717.055,"I believe those are not mutually exclusive, Your Honor."
1987.86-684,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,764.255,773.565,Do you think under the Fourth Amendment we still look at abandonment as a separate sort of test or approach?
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,773.565,773.94,I think it is part of the test.
1987.86-684,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,885.331,888.549,"We'll resume there at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Pear."
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,888.549,889.268,--Thank you.
1987.86-684,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,889.268,898.31,"Mr. Pear, you may proceed."
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,898.31,911.149,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-684,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,950.539,955.318,Not if they want the evidence badly enough.
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,958.021,963.44,"It's certainly not a volunteered-for duty, I'd assure you."
1987.86-684,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1052.109,1054.998,Would it have made any difference whether it was one or 26 times?
1987.86-684,0,36478,michael_j_pear,,1054.998,1059.496,"--I don't think so, Your Honor, as to the issue of Fourth Amendment."
1987.86-684,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1085.547,1087.921,"Thank you, Mr. Pear."
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1090.124,1098.293,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1180.728,1182.976,"What do you conceive to be the State law issue, Mr. Garey?"
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1182.976,1183.242,All right.
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1201.969,1210.09,"And then the search and seizure provision of the California Constitution was interpreted in the State Supreme Court Krivda opinion, was it not?"
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1210.09,1211.996,That is correct.
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1213.996,1223.743,"But we have determined, have we not, that the decision rested at least partially on Federal grounds?"
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1223.743,1224.538,"Oh, yes."
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1245.483,1249.231,"And therefore be reviewable here under Michigan v. Long, would it not?"
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1249.231,1255.901,It would be reviewable here under Michigan v. Long to the extent that the Federal question is posed.
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1257.243,1266.068,"Well, if it's been decided that both Federal and State grounds support Krivda, certainly the Federal question is posed, is it not?"
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1266.068,1270.395,The Federal question is posed but it is not posed entirely by itself.
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1348.128,1353.315,Did you raise this point in your Memorandum In Opposition to the Petition for Certiorari?
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1353.315,1356.985,"I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1356.985,1362.919,"If you didn't, there's language in our Tuttle opinion which would suggest that you have waived it."
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1362.919,1367.668,"Well, if I may proceed just a little bit, because--"
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1367.668,1368.354,Certainly.
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1368.354,1369.572,--Thank you very much.
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1491.195,1505.159,"If we were to reverse this judgment here under the 1982 Amendment, the California Constitution provision on unreasonable seizure would be interpreted the same as we interpreted ours, would it not?"
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1505.159,1505.972,I'm sorry.
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1507.097,1508.455,Yes.
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1523.417,1525.4,"No, actually it would not."
1987.86-684,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1543.065,1545.69,The evidence would come in anyway.
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1545.69,1547.126,The evidence would come in.
1987.86-684,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1547.126,1548.484,And the conviction would stand.
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1548.484,1551.047,That is also correct.
1987.86-684,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1551.047,1559.34,"What about private suit, could there be a private suit against the person who conducted the search in violation of California law?"
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1559.34,1560.604,You mean like a civil damage suit?
1987.86-684,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.604,1561.307,"Yes, a civil damage suit."
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1561.307,1567.82,The problem with that is exactly I think it is addressed in Mapp originally.
1987.86-684,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1568.617,1575.147,"Oh, I understand you may not win it but the suit's available so we wouldn't have been making a dead letter of the California law."
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1575.147,1582.456,--But as a matter of what rule this Court ought adopt under these very historically unique circumstances and I will address--
1987.86-684,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1582.456,1583.908,But that's California's problem.
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1598.651,1600.448,--The problem is this.
1987.86-684,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1767.442,1769.956,I'm not sure I follow this argument.
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1774.143,1774.581,--Correct.
1987.86-684,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.581,1775.002,Correct.
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1783.983,1784.468,Absolutely.
1987.86-684,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.468,1801.695,"Now, you're saying that it follows from that that the State Courts also as a Federal Constitutional matter, must enforce the violation of any State Constitutional right by the exclusionary rule, and the Federal Courts have to do the same."
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1801.695,1805.1,"Essentially, yes, but with one qualifier."
1987.86-684,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1805.1,1806.583,I don't see how the one follows from the other.
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1806.583,1807.411,"Well, if I may."
1987.86-684,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.052,1887.987,It is our business to enforce the Federal law.
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,1890.19,1892.892,"In general, perhaps not."
1987.86-684,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2047.703,2067.103,"Well, counsel, in open field searches, for example, where State law might make a trespass to come on to the open field or the premises, that hasn't determined the Federal law on whether evidence should be suppressed in a prosecution, has it?"
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2070.975,2074.286,"Well, that is correct."
1987.86-684,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2168.328,2172.012,Why isn't that up to the State of California?
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2172.012,2178.869,"Because the State of California at this point is powerless, and it is powerless by reason of Article I, Section 23(d)."
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2186.788,2190.349,They lost it because the people of California took it away from them.
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2191.568,2194.442,--I never suggested that it was an accident.
1987.86-684,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2196.863,2203.094,Your argument is that the 1982 amendment is unconstitutional?
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2203.094,2204.797,"As applied to this case, yes."
1987.86-684,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.922,2207.124,Or all cases like it?
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2207.124,2212.09,"All cases sufficiently like it where somebody couldn't come up with a good distinction, yes."
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2243.797,2249.56,How aware do you think the voters of the United States were of the contents of the Fourteenth Amendment when they ratified it?
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2249.56,2251.355,--Probably relatively little.
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2251.355,2253.855,So what does your argument bear on?
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2253.855,2260.118,It is only an answer to the question of the people of the State altered the rule.
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.118,2261.243,"Well, they did."
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2261.243,2264.288,"They did, and the net effect--"
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2264.288,2266.601,"You answer the question when you say, yes."
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2266.601,2279.845,"--Very well, then the answer is, yes, but the question then still remains is can any State, whether through its electorate, through its legislature or through its executive branch take away a right that the State has granted."
1987.86-684,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.845,2282.828,And then take it away?
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2282.828,2284.344,"Exactly, exactly."
1987.86-684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2343.117,2347.912,"But Mr. Garey, you're arguing mainly from procedural due process cases, Vitek v. Jones."
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2353.582,2354.3,No.
1987.86-684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.3,2355.035,No.
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2355.035,2355.41,I'm not.
1987.86-684,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2356.345,2357.048,Why not.
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2362.249,2366.216,"--Well, I think as a practical matter, a hearing before the garbage is searched, is that the question?"
1987.86-684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.827,2409.776,"May I ask you, are there some California cases that say that the trash search is all right provided, sort of like an automobile search, you have to have probable cause for it even though you don't have a warrant."
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2409.776,2418.117,"There is suggestion, and it's dicta, but there is suggestion in that, and indeed, that's a matter that the State Court can address itself to."
1987.86-684,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.611,2703.471,You don't have any dogs in California?
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2713.232,2728.179,"We have dogs, and I suppose we have snoops and I suppose we have all sorts of private agencies that might interfere with somebody's otherwise reasonable expectation of privacy."
1987.86-684,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.835,2736.161,"So you're pretty risky to leave something out on your curb in an opaque bag whether there are dogs around, anyway."
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2736.161,2759.573,"--It is an interesting fact that in this case, and really in any of the cases that I've read about including I think it's U.S. v. Terry where the DEA monitored somebody's trash off and on for a period of six months that at no time did the police in this case or the DEA in that case have to fight this horde of people that were standing around the man's trash in order to get at it."
1987.86-684,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2908.715,2911.449,"Well, what happens if an ordinary citizen comes by and picks up your trash?"
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2912.964,2915.478,Can you stop him?
1987.86-684,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2915.478,2915.962,Yes.
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2915.962,2919.945,It seems to me that it's probably an invasion of your privacy.
1987.86-684,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2919.945,2925.1,My question didn't say privacy on any part of it.
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2927.224,2930.942,I think that would depend on the law in the State in particular as to--
1987.86-684,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2930.942,2933.378,Could you stop him in California?
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2933.378,2934.673,--I should think so.
1987.86-684,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2934.673,2936.36,On what basis?
1987.86-684,1,35944,michael_ian_garey,,2936.36,2939.906,On the basis that he's violating your right of privacy.
1987.86-684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2945.513,2947.152,"I think you've answered the question, Mr. Garey."
1987.86-684,2,36478,michael_j_pear,,2953.15,2958.133,"If the Court has any questions, I'll be glad to respond."
1987.86-684,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2960.414,2962.319,May I just ask one?
1987.86-684,2,36478,michael_j_pear,,2965.146,2967.597,On whether the person could be stopped?
