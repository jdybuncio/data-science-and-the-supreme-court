1961.236,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,592.274,595.269,"The -- not New York -- not the committee, they took -- they took it."
1961.236,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,626.413,647.468,(Inaudible)
1961.236,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,647.468,669.763,"I would say this Your Honor, Justice Harlan that if the legislative committee had no other reason to call him, except for that coerced confession, there had been no other evidence to -- in anyway to justify as being called, as is the case here, I would say that he could -- that he would be immune from prosecution for refusing to answer those questions."
1961.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,816.329,819.819,(Inaudible)
1961.236,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,819.819,821.35,"Which one, the first one?"
1961.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,821.35,822.671,(Inaudible)
1961.236,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,822.671,824.792,"Oh, did you visit your brother?"
1961.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,824.792,828.963,(Inaudible)
1961.236,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,828.963,831.721,And he refused to answer whether he -- he visits his brother?
1961.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,831.721,833.436,(Inaudible)
1961.236,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,833.436,835.668,Then the question was a materiality of that.
1961.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,842.7,851.722,(Inaudible)
1961.236,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,851.722,855.826,It didn't state -- it's a (Inaudible) -- there's no opinion by the -- by the Court of Appeals.
1961.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,860.885,861.551,(Inaudible)
1961.236,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,861.551,864.237,"Were the Appellate Division, the Appellate Division."
1961.236,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,921.779,927.858,(Inaudible)
1961.236,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,927.858,951.434,"He was asked about those two questions and he said he's made a generalization that we have evidence or we have -- he was asked that -- he stated that first -- the 19th question, he said it, the first of the 19 questions were not based upon the illegally or immorally obtained evidence."
1961.236,1,30263,jacob_d_fuchsberg,,1553.695,1556.034,May it please The Court.
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2536.913,2542.815,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2606.759,2612.285,"How does -- how did the grant, the so-called grant (Inaudible)"
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2612.285,2638.578,"What happened in this case was Mr. Justice Frankfurter, he was asked a number of questions on all of which he asserted his right to decline to answer on grounds of self-incrimination again under the pertinent provisions of the New York State Constitution and thereafter was granted by vote of the Committee, immunity from prosecution from or because of and future use against him of any and all answers he might make in this regard."
1961.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2640.878,2645.825,Does your statute inquire that the committee affirmatively extend immunity?
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2645.825,2648.055,Apparently so Your Honor.
1961.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2665.106,2667.993,"Then, did they call him back, is that it?"
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2667.993,2669.422,"I believe so, yes Your Honor."
1961.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2669.422,2670.643,Put the same questions too?
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2670.643,2671.869,Yes sir.
1961.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2679.644,2680.776,Before you get into that --
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2680.776,2681.491,Yes Your Honor.
1961.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2681.491,2686.782,"The Committee informed of the -- (Inaudible) the witness, I'm not talking about the specifics (Inaudible)"
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2706.283,2708.241,"But that is apparently so Your Honor, yes."
1961.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2721.986,2738.369,"(Inaudible) -- thereafter -- thereafter, (Inaudible) thereafter, he maybe prosecuted for the (Inaudible)"
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2738.369,2745.285,"It's my understanding that that is a fact, however I cannot state any authority on the question because I don't know of any instance in which it was done."
1961.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2745.285,2746.677,May I ask one other question?
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2746.677,2747.035,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2747.035,2760.113,"When he refuses to answer as he did here, the Committee when the questions are put, does the committee have to go back to the legislature for -- as it's done in the case of a congressional committee?"
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2760.113,2762.225,"Apparently, not to the legislature."
1961.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2915.345,2920.039,Should you even be making the same argument of the Committee itself that bugged that room?
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2920.039,2921.486,I would Mr Justice Brennan.
1961.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2939.402,2941.122,"Well, that's what I understood you to be arguing."
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2964.528,2965.539,That would be precisely Mr. Justice Brennan.
1961.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2965.539,2971.336,"That's -- even assuming that -- in other respects, it might be a violation of the Forth Amendment, who had bugged the room."
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2971.336,2978.466,"Yes, I think that the -- the -- the purpose and eventual use of the information obtained by this method is -- is crucial."
1961.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2990.833,2994.62,"In other words, pertinency in that sense is not challenged."
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2997.189,2999.814,Both pertinency and purpose Your Honor.
1961.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3016.206,3032.378,(Inaudible)
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3032.378,3041.996,"I believe that under the Fourteenth Amendment itself, Mr. Justice Black, there are limits -- well, on what the State can do in any circumstances."
1961.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3069.987,3082.391,(Inaudible)
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3082.391,3084.808,"I would -- I would -- I would go so far as to say, yes."
1961.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3119.695,3123.862,(Inaudible) eavesdropping is not (Inaudible)
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3127.37,3131.884,(Inaudible) there was indeed no physical intrusion into a constitutionally protected area.
1961.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3131.884,3140.876,"That's (Inaudible) eavesdropping as such, it is not on the intrusion of the constitutionally protected area of (Inaudible)"
1961.236,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3140.876,3154.597,"Oh, it's my understanding that Irvine against California, Your Honor, has held that it was in fact a violation of the Fourth Amendment but of course in that case, on the prevailing doctrine of Wolf against Colorado, the conviction was not disturbed on those grounds."
1961.236,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5327.431,5330.031,Yes.
1961.236,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5371.208,5372.332,Is that cited in your brief?
1961.236,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5372.332,5379.146,It's cited in my petition for certiorari on page 7 with the -- with the citation.
1961.236,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5466.039,5480.974,"Now in that connection, I want to be clear Mr. Pfeffer, I think Fuchsberg answered the question of mine that, yes, your position is that by reason of this bugging, this Committee could not even have summoned this witness and put questions to it."
1961.236,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5480.974,5491.455,"That is argued unless there were -- unless there were an independent and directly show that there were independent grounds, if that bugging never occurred, they would've still called him."
1961.236,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5501.861,5510.366,"Well now the Chief Justice asked Mr. Uviller whether he'd make -- whether there was -- a distinction could be drawn if this had been a grand jury inquiry, would you draw that distinction?"
1961.236,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5510.366,5510.728,No.
1961.236,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5623.872,5649.011,"And you think -- you think that whenever the New York legislature passes (Inaudible) certain conducts and holding superior punishment for disobedient of this new statute, would that prove that that -- that conduct prior (Inaudible) was in violation of the constitution of the United States?"
1961.236,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5649.011,5675.79,"I think that if we assume and I think we must assume that law is a means whereby the people translate their moral judgements into effective criteria, then we must say and if we assume this, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, you more than anyone else have argued that it if the Fourteenth Amendment translates as a means of giving effect to the moral standards of the community, then I think the question answers itself."
1961.236,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5675.79,5685.814,My -- my (Inaudible) a statute passed by New York which proves that there before that (Inaudible) of the community or even (Inaudible)
1961.236,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5685.814,5695.596,I don't -- more is advanced Mr. Justice Frankfurter but they could have advanced so rapidly that the statute was passed within I think less than two months after this occurred.
1961.236,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5696.106,5718.274,"(Inaudible) -- I still ask you whether the fact that any state passes a statute (Inaudible) certain conduct to prove that that conduct prior to that statute of the -- in violation of the constitution of the United States because if it's in violation of the constitution of the United States, if it's that fact and I don't think a statute can say this?"
1961.236,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5718.274,5731.709,"I am using this statute Mr. Justice Frankfurter as evidence to support our contention that even were there no statute, were there no statute, this would equally be unconstitutional."
1961.236,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5731.709,5732.73,I follow that argument.
1961.236,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5732.73,5733.355,That's it.
1961.236,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5749.705,5756.082,"Well, the standard of due process as to what New York does is what is done generally throughout the country."
1961.236,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5778.258,5780.615,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, that's entirely true."
