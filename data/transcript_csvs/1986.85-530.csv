1986.85-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"We will hear argument first this afternoon in No. 85-530, Dennis M. O'Connor, et al., versus Magno J. Ortega."
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,12.224,24.115,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a Federal Civil Rights action for damages under 42 USC Section 1983 brought by respondent Ortega against petitioners herein."
1986.85-530,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,123.795,127.68,Did the petitioners remove anything from the offices?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,127.68,129.949,"--Yes, they did, Justice Brennan."
1986.85-530,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,136.436,138.721,That belonged to the respondent?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,138.721,139.438,"--That belonged to the respondent, yes."
1986.85-530,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,139.438,143.007,Did they take any government property at all?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,143.007,149.243,The record is somewhat unclear as to whether or not any government property was taken from the office.
1986.85-530,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,207.549,209.984,Would residents' files have been government files?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,209.984,221.006,"--Yes, they were government files, Your Honor, and he kept correspondence there, too, that on occasion she had to go into the office and remove correspondence."
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.042,249.892,Excuse me.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,273.39,273.89,--Justice Scalia--
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,273.89,282.513,Not rummage through some materials that on their face upon initial examination are immediately seen to be personal.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,282.513,285.198,"--Well, certainly the Court would have the power to do that."
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.169,324.923,"Because a desk is a desk, and anything in the desk is open to the employer?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,324.923,327.475,A desk is a desk.
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.154,347.189,"Right, but what if I have a file in here that says"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,355.877,359.079,"And the file is where, now, in the desk?"
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,359.079,360.062,It is in the desk.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,360.062,361.196,"Well, it would depend."
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.137,377.707,"Same kind of investigation, but in the course of doing it they encounter a file in the desk that is labeled personal--"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,377.707,378.14,--That is certainly--
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,378.14,379.409,--and then they look into the file.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,380.475,382.611,"--It comes closer to the line, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,382.611,385.646,"In this case the office was locked, wasn't it?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,388.146,390.748,It was usually locked in his absence.
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,393.817,397.204,And who else had a key to that office?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,397.204,399.154,The hospital administrator had a key to the office.
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,399.154,399.987,Is that in the record?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,399.987,401.606,"Yes, it's in the record."
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,401.606,408.929,So that the only thing in the record was that he had the key and he assumed no one else had a key.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,408.929,410.995,He assumed no one else had a key.
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,411.729,412.331,All right.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,414.097,416.498,"--It is a subjective expectation of privacy, Your Honor."
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,416.498,419.467,What do you need subjective for?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,419.467,437.246,"Well, the two pronged test of Katz holds that in order for the Fourth Amendment to apply you must deal with a subjective expectation of privacy which society is prepared to recognize as reasonable or legitimate, and that is a separate inquiry."
1986.85-530,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,454.54,472.419,"Mr. Miller, do you agree that in some circumstances employees in the private sector might have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their office or their desk?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,472.419,475.387,"Justice O'Connor, we are talking about two different things right now."
1986.85-530,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,496.551,507.342,Do you think that if there are such that there can be circumstances in the public sector when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,510.96,533.26,"Obviously, Your Honor, if we are dealing with a desk of a Supreme Court Justice, we have to put that in context, and although I am not, certainly not privy to the practices of Your Honors in maintaining the security of your office and any expectations you may have vis-a-vis your colleagues... certainly you don't have any supervisors."
1986.85-530,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,533.26,535.861,We won't debate the subjective element.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,555.739,558.441,In their desk per se we submit not.
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,590.596,591.948,What does privacy mean?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,595.066,598.268,"No, Your Honor, we don't feel it does."
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,609.024,614.212,"No, I am just talking about the persons against whom you expect you have a right of privacy."
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,614.212,617.814,--That is what I am trying to address myself to.
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,665.21,673.9,"Is there any reason, Mr. Miller, in such circumstances why the supervisor can't give the employee notice of what he plans to do?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,673.9,681.922,"Well, there are many cases, Your Honor, where we would submit that the notice requirement may clearly frustrate the need to inspect."
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,685.458,689.612,"You are looking for a computer, for example, as you were in this case, as I understand it."
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,692.397,697.449,--That was one purpose of one of the petitioners.
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,712.108,715.66,"Couldn't he ask the doctor, say, I would like to see what you've got in your office that belongs to the government?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,719.047,720.097,--He chose not to.
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,720.097,724.499,But is there any reason why... would it have frustrated the purpose of the search at all to give him adequate notice?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,724.499,725.735,It may very well have.
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.298,752.018,"Well, I suppose in this case if you had given them notice you would have said the computer is in the next office, and you would walk in and get it."
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,752.018,757.256,"--Your Honor, there were several purposes for entering that office and inventorying the contents."
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,757.256,758.489,"But the computer was one of them, was it not?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,758.489,764.16,"The computer was an element of concern for petitioner O'Connor only, and not--"
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,764.16,772.182,"Well, at least as to petitioner O'Connor, wouldn't his purpose have been served if he had given them notice and the doctor had said you get it in the next office?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,772.182,790.06,"--If that had been the only purpose of entering and inventorying in the office that could have been an alternative, but as this Court has said, the question is not what might have been, whether or not there was a less intrusive alternative available to the actor at the time."
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,791.577,794.679,"Well, but isn't your ultimate inquiry whether this is a reasonable way to handle the problem?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,794.679,795.362,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,795.362,801.016,"Isn't your ultimate inquiry one of reasonableness, and aren't there a lot of factors that might affect that?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,801.016,814.093,"Our ultimate inquiry or our initial inquiry at this point, we submit, is whether or not the Fourth Amendment even applies to this kind of an activity, and we submit that at the threshold it does not apply."
1986.85-530,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,814.093,830.268,"Well, this is... this case was decided on summary judgment, and I thought you conceded that there are some circumstances when a public employee might have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the office."
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,835.522,838.208,"I didn't concede that, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,875.214,879.535,"Did you just say that the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply, Mr. Miller?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,898.18,926.099,"That's correct, there is language against us in TLO on that point, but at least TLO, Mr. Chief Justice, made the initial inquiry into whether or not the Fourth Amendment was applicable, and in Wyman versus James and Hudson versus Palmer this Court held that in the context of those particular cases the search or whatever the activity consisted of, the contact, as it was termed in Wymam versus James, was not a search within the traditional meaning of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence."
1986.85-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,932.003,943.227,It is one thing to say that a search is not... that an investigation or whatever you want to call it is not a search within the terms of the Fourth Amendment but it is another thing to say that the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,954.416,958.903,"No, the Fourth Amendment in the abstract applies everywhere."
1986.85-530,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,983.019,986.987,I don't know that I have ever heard you say what all the purposes were.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,992.808,994.576,--Finding the computer was not--
1986.85-530,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,994.576,997.195,It was a general investigatory search?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,997.195,1002.266,"--Finding the computer was not per se a purpose of the search, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.305,1072.243,"Mr. Miller, the Court of Appeals said the investigation that gave rise to this concern, the propriety of the acquisition of a computer, that was one thing, and sexual harassment charges."
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1076.814,1077.83,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.166,1121.943,"Now, again, you say the facts are undisputed, and I am sure you are stating them accurately, but the Court of Appeals didn't recite those, and the District Court made no findings, so how do we get... aren't the key facts... is the Court of Appeals opinion adequate to give us the key facts, or is it not?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1121.943,1154.414,"No, the Court of Appeals opinion in this case is not adequate to give you the facts in the sense that the Court of Appeals stated that the prime motivation for the search appeared to be, in conclusionary language, a motivation to secure evidence for the ongoing personnel investigation when in fact the District Court had concluded that the purpose of the search was to inventory property and to secure the office, and that was--"
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.414,1156.266,Which do you say it was?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1157.799,1167.99,"--Well, we would submit, Justice Scalia, that the District Court made its findings on the evidence that was presented to the Court."
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1174.811,1181.465,Is there any reason why this couldn't have been done in this man's presence?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1181.465,1184.583,"That we don't know at this point, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1184.583,1188.952,Did it say anything... did it say why they couldn't have done it in his presence?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1188.952,1193.023,"No, there is nothing in the record indicating why they could not have done it in his presence."
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1193.023,1195.474,"Well, why did they do it in his absence?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1195.474,1198.759,There is nothing in the record indicating why they did it in his absence.
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.663,1206.363,"Excuse me, because I am still not clear on your--"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1213.686,1215.669,"--No, Your Honor, we don't feel it is."
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1215.669,1217.888,It would have been all right to go in there in the middle of the night?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1217.888,1220.756,"Yes, the timing of the day doesn't make any difference."
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1221.323,1225.76,Isn't it suspicious?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1225.76,1232.564,"--It may not look good, but once again that is not a constitutional requirement in this particular context."
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1238.484,1244.721,Is there a reasonable expectation that you won't go into his office when he is not there?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1244.721,1247.657,"--No, Your Honor, I don't feel there is."
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1255.679,1259.048,"What is he going to do, destroy the records or something?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1259.048,1259.965,That is very possible.
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1263.619,1275.926,"Well, how were you going to find... what evidence would you find of ""sexual harassment""?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1275.926,1284.715,--I am at a loss at this point to indicate to you any evidence that may have existed in that office relating to charges of sexual harassment.
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1284.715,1289.234,"Tell me, what could you possibly find that would bear on sexual harassment?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1289.234,1290.786,There could be all kinds of possible--
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1290.786,1292.486,Like what?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1292.486,1301.225,"--Some kind of a document, for example, containing a statement that in fact sexual harassing statements had been made."
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1307.446,1309.414,"We are dealing with the abstract, then, aren't we?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1309.414,1316.669,"--No, we are not, really, because in this case the stated purpose of entering the office was to inventory the office to secure state property--"
1986.85-530,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1316.669,1318.069,0 xxx.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1318.069,1324.573,"--The computer was not relevant to the inventory, and that is in the deposition testimony of Mr. Friday."
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.573,1328.209,I am still not clear on how you want us to judge this case.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1347.004,1354.943,"Justice Scalia, I would be happy to have the Court decide the case on the basis of the record before the District Court."
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1355.76,1358.395,You have no contentions with regard to that record.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1358.395,1359.995,We have contentions with regard to the record.
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1359.995,1360.529,What is your contention?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1366.465,1370.819,The purpose of the investigation was to inventory.
1986.85-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1403.007,1412.946,"So, in determining the validity of this entry we should assume that the purpose was to make an inventory and secure the office."
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1412.946,1413.815,Yes.
1986.85-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1413.815,1414.531,Okay.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1432.61,1434.729,A sorting through of the property.
1986.85-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1434.729,1435.795,For what purpose?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1435.795,1442.048,For the purpose of discriminating which was personal property and which was state property.
1986.85-530,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1485.661,1492.398,There wasn't any notion that they might find something that implicated them in wrongdoing?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1492.398,1495.183,"Notion on the part of whom, Justice Brennan?"
1986.85-530,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1495.183,1498.469,They were sent in there to make this inventory.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1505.325,1507.108,"Specifically, no."
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1561.828,1563.895,"Mr. Miller, the District Court doesn't say that either."
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1576.804,1579.123,"--No, the District Court did not use the word ""inventory""."
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1582.508,1585.527,Because one... they thought one... apparently the computer had been taken out.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1585.527,1587.027,"--No, there is nothing--"
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.027,1592.931,I infer computer but they do say particularly when something already has been removed.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1595.733,1597.335,"--Well, the computer had been removed."
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1599.87,1605.773,And that is the only concern the District Judge mentions except the fact they might put somebody else in after he got fired.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1605.773,1611.158,"It appears as though that is an afterthought of the District Court in that regard, Your Honor, because--"
1986.85-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1611.158,1618.581,"Well, it isn't an afterthought because he says the strength of the public necessity is the major thing he has got to look at, and this is the only public necessity factor he mentions."
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1621.8,1630.056,"--The Court indicated that the purpose was to secure the office and to make it available for further use, I believe, at some point."
1986.85-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.056,1631.956,"The doctor hadn't been discharged, had he?"
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1633.924,1635.543,"That's correct, Justice White."
1986.85-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.543,1645.648,So the Court of Appeals said there was no regular policy of inventorying offices for people who were just on leave.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1645.648,1647.183,"That's correct, the Court of Appeals--"
1986.85-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.183,1649.467,Is that right or not?
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1649.467,1652.069,--There was no regular policy in the form of--
1986.85-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.069,1666.395,"Well, if there wasn't a policy of that kind, then I take it your suggestion is that any time this particular employer wanted to enter an office to see if there is some state property there they can do it."
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1666.395,1667.245,--That's correct.
1986.85-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.245,1668.097,At any time.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1668.097,1668.814,That's correct.
1986.85-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1668.814,1672.716,Without any reason to suspect that there is or there isn't.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1672.716,1674.585,We assume there are going to be--
1986.85-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1674.585,1688.677,"That would apply under your argument, I take it, to any employee, any regular employee who isn't on leave, he is working."
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1701.585,1704.27,"--That wouldn't be a violation of the Fourth Amendment, if in fact--"
1986.85-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.27,1705.12,That is your position.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1705.12,1706.222,--those were the circumstances.
1986.85-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1706.222,1706.772,Yes.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1706.772,1716.162,"Yes, because when we are talking about the kinds of repositories that were inventoried in this case, a desk, a file cabinet, I believe a bookcase."
1986.85-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1716.162,1729.402,"So any time the public employer should be able to come in and say, the employee is sitting at his desk, and they say, please get up and leave, we want to search your desk, any time, day or night."
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1729.402,1731.187,In a constitutional sense--
1986.85-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.187,1731.654,Yes.
1986.85-530,0,31863,jeffrey_t_miller,,1731.654,1733.789,--that would not violate the Fourth Amendment.
1986.85-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1780.568,1782.453,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1788.107,1818.543,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, our argument rests on three propositions: first, that it is both customary and reasonable for a public employee to keep personal papers and effects in his work office and to expect that the privacy of such materials will be protected against arbitrary searches or seizures by his employer; second, that the application of the Fourth Amendment to office searches is not incompatible with the government's responsibilities as an employer."
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.238,1837.856,"Mr. Klein, let's assume this is a true story."
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1867.809,1888.455,"I think not, Your Honor, no, and I think... the reason is, I think those facts are different from this case, but I do think that in many employment circumstances, including the one you just described, Justice Scalia, that the expectation is that employers will enter the office, and that they will indeed, if the employee has gone home, be able to look for a file."
1986.85-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.149,1905.584,"Why does a locked door make any difference, Mr. Klein?"
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1905.584,1911.588,"It makes a difference in the following sense, that I think it confers an expectation and tells the employee something."
1986.85-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1935.27,1943.792,"What if we have an employee who was neither a psychiatrist nor a Supreme Court Justice, and he has a key to his door, and locks it at night when he goes home."
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1954.165,1965.789,"I think in those circumstances, if the situation is that there is an expectation that over the years that hasn't occurred, that other employees with locked offices, it doesn't occur, then I think the government can still enter."
1986.85-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1967.741,1979.149,"Well, but then all we need to change your conclusion, I take it, is if the government does in fact enter a couple of times, and then the expectation is destroyed because the government has entered?"
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1979.149,1980.615,Not necessarily a couple of times.
1986.85-530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2016.738,2017.94,Right through locked doors.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2017.94,2019.29,--Right through locked doors.
1986.85-530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2027.196,2030.232,How do the cleaning people get in?
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2030.232,2032.867,"If it is a locked door, how do they get in?"
1986.85-530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2034.234,2036.302,I am talking about in this case.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2036.302,2039.503,In this case the claim is that there was a key.
1986.85-530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2043.824,2048.025,It must have been cleaned some time in 17 years.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2048.025,2049.895,--Was his office cleaned in 17 years?
1986.85-530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2049.895,2050.261,Yes.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2050.261,2052.597,"Actually, I assume it was cleaned in 17 years."
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.597,2054.347,Who did he think had cleaned it?
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2054.347,2055.297,Who did he think had cleaned it?
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2056.799,2058.399,It is a very strange fact of the case.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2059.001,2060.451,It is not clear when it was cleaned.
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.451,2064.821,Maybe it was cleaned during... the cleaning crew came in during his business hours maybe.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2064.821,2080.08,"Apparently... the record is absolutely silent, so we are speculating, but for whatever it is worth he did spend many, many hours in the office, and so it is possible, but more important than that, that is very different from saying his employer came in and searched his desk even for a file."
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.08,2083.965,xxx clean his office and gave them a key to get in.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2083.965,2085.984,"That is perfectly plausible, although the record doesn't--"
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2085.984,2088.518,"Well, that is probably very likely, isn't it?"
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2088.518,2095.005,"--I think that's right, but that would say nothing about what the legitimacy of his expectation was inside of his desk and file cabinets."
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.792,2100.66,You put aside the desk.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2104.279,2106.898,--I think his expectation vis-a-vis--
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.898,2109.85,Is there more of an expectation in the desk than in the locked door?
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2109.85,2128.327,"--I do believe the desk is a greater expectation, yes, sir, and I think in this case it is critical to point out that even if there is this common understanding that people may enter from time to time, I think a desk is a very different matter, and this desk was thoroughly and comprehensively searched."
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2128.327,2137.917,"And if one of the cleaning crew went into the desk and that cleaning person was an employee of the United States, that would have been a fourth amendment violation?"
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2137.917,2139.369,If they went into the desk?
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.369,2140.219,Right.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2140.219,2143.737,"The question of whether that is a state actor, I am not sure about the answer to that."
1986.85-530,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2160.033,2180.196,"Mr. Klein, is it reasonable for a supervisor to enter an employee's desk to discover whatever might be appropriate for work-related wrongdoing of some kind?"
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2200.942,2203.276,I don't think that is reasonable.
1986.85-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.792,2254.244,"Mr. Klein, let me ask you one question in light of your comment there."
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2258.296,2260.564,"--There are two things that happened, Justice Rehnquist."
1986.85-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2300.539,2303.808,"That is more or less of a seizure, I take it, rather than a search."
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2303.808,2328.042,"I think that's right, although the seizing of the book of poetry and the other things, I think there is also a search issue that Justice Scalia touched on, and that is, I think if their purpose, which it seems to me to be so implausible as not to need really a factual hearing, if their purpose was to separate state and private property, the first question is, why were they doing it for somebody who is not about to leave?"
1986.85-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2339.683,2352.424,"Well, certainly one could agree with you and still feel that in a search like this or inventory, whatever you want to call it, you are going to come across things that you realize are personal at some stage or another."
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2364.549,2369.035,"Well, if that is what the law required, then this case, there was a constitutional violation."
1986.85-530,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2396.703,2400.905,xxx items like the book of poetry?
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2400.905,2420.485,"--The other items they took... now, mind you, they took everything for a couple of months, Justice Brennan, but the items they used and investigated on this record were a picture of a former psychiatric resident, that is, a doctor in study with Dr. Ortega, some poetry that this resident had sent to him, as well as a book of poems."
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2436.312,2444.084,"Did they take... in Paragraph 8 of the complaint, is that the list?"
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2444.084,2453.106,Those are the materials that the respondent alleges were in his office and seized for some period of time.
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2453.989,2457.158,Are those the ones... is that the list you say was--
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2457.158,2459.36,Those are the materials that were taken out of the office.
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.36,2461.129,"--Is that what the evidence bears out, too?"
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2461.129,2463.997,"They are uncontradicted allegations, Justice White."
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.914,2467.033,Was there ever an answer to this complaint?
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2467.033,2473.07,"--There is an answer to this complaint, but at the summary judgment stage they did not dispute that those were the materials."
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2473.07,2473.72,I see.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2482.559,2490.981,"The papers that I call private or personal, which are papers they admit to be personal, were this valentine, there was a book of poetry sent to him, and--"
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.981,2493.85,Introduced at his termination hearing?
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2493.85,2497.802,--They introduced it to impeach the doctor who testified for him.
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.635,2499.637,Was he terminated?
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2499.637,2501.02,"--Yes, he was terminated."
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.02,2505.658,"And they introduced these for purposes of impeachment, you say?"
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2505.658,2518.982,"He had a former resident of his who had sent him this material, and when she testified for him at the hearing, they tried to impeach her showing, I guess, that she was infatuated."
1986.85-530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2522.536,2526.155,Weren't those personal records his?
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2526.155,2528.356,"Absolutely, and they acknowledge that."
1986.85-530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2528.356,2529.856,"Well, you didn't say so."
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2529.856,2532.075,"If I didn't, let me correct myself."
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2577.52,2578.706,You keep shifting back and forth.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2587.728,2589.878,"I think that's correct, but I also think it goes beyond that."

1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2591.847,2594.216,"At least with respect to his desk, yes, sir."
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2615.895,2624.818,"--Well, then, if that is the approach you take, that where there is not an expectation of privacy, you know that there will be some intrusions."
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2661.293,2665.478,"No, I don't think that's right, but I think, that is, I think you have to analyze it stepwise."
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2680.672,2681.322,I am not talking about an entry.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2685.492,2687.192,--It does if you are talking about a search.
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2687.192,2689.511,--whether an office has any Fourth Amendment protections.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2689.511,2690.294,"Yes, it does."
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2690.294,2690.712,All right.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2690.712,2698.449,And I think that has been held by this Court in numerous cases that an office is one of those areas that are within the protection of the Fourth Amendment.
1986.85-530,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2749.668,2773.081,"Well, Mr. Klein, in the ordinary office situation if it is an office of public... a public office, public employee, public employer, can the supervisor not enter that office in most instances any time and see what is in plain view?"
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2788.809,2790.593,"No, I agree with you, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-530,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2801.551,2813.075,"Well, suppose the supervisor walks in and in his or her heart hopes to find some obvious evidence of wrongdoing that is work-related?"
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2813.075,2815.876,"I think if it is in plain view, so to speak, yes."
1986.85-530,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2864.793,2879.351,"Well, if the government had a universal regulation saying to all of its employees, when you work for the government you have to understand that we have a right to make an inventory search at any time."
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2880.469,2890.409,"I don't think that a universal regulation that like that would hold up, much as I don't think that you could reverse the Court's decision in TLO by simply saying anybody who comes into a school can have their purse searched."
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2972.396,2975.515,Was there a personnel investigation going on when the search was made?
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2975.515,2976.615,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2976.615,2981.334,And that is the personnel investigation that ultimately resulted in his discharge?
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2981.334,2982.368,That led to his termination.
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2983.053,2986.322,And you don't think this particular entry had anything to do with that investigation.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2986.322,2999.963,"My view is, it had a lot to do with that investigation, that indeed it was intended to further the investigation, that they had singled him out and were searching for evidence against him, and that is precisely, Justice White, why I think we ought to have a warrant in this case."
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2999.963,3005.8,"You think if it is that work-related, all that means is that you should have a warrant?"
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3005.8,3026.713,"I think on those facts, yes, sir, because they are claiming the right to search for personal information, but let me conclude on this point that even if the warrant standard, and I think on the facts here that is the right approach, because let me just say that I think that they were looking for information to use against him to take his job away from him."
1986.85-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3055.633,3060.036,"And of course the evidence you may uncover, I take it, may be personal material."
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3066.94,3068.19,"I agree with that, Justice--"
1986.85-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3068.19,3076.713,So that to say these people took personal material from the desk is not a complete putdown of the state's case here.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3082.634,3085.819,"--Well, I think if they had a warrant or if they satisfied the Fourth Amendment standard."
1986.85-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3085.819,3086.688,That would go to relevancy.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3086.688,3094.358,"No, it doesn't... I am saying under... I am not... I haven't here disputed that under an appropriate standard they couldn't seize that material."
1986.85-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3094.358,3098.911,"Even though it was material that you classify as personal and other people would, too."
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3098.911,3100.745,"Much as the same point I would make, by the way."
1986.85-530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3107.867,3110.303,"Well, here this man used to take the computer home, didn't he?"
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3110.303,3111.253,--He evidently did.
1986.85-530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3111.869,3116.487,xxx you are talking about.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3118.956,3120.623,That is what the Ninth Circuit found.
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3130.831,3133.882,What was searched in TLO?
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3133.882,3135.048,What was... excused me?
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3135.048,3135.582,In TLO.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3135.582,3136.365,What was searched?
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3136.365,3137.167,"Yes, what was the--"
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3137.167,3137.967,The purse.
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3137.967,3138.817,--The purse.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3144.338,3145.254,"Yes, sir, I am."
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3151.125,3162.199,Do you think a student would have as much expectation that the student's desk wouldn't be looked at by school personnel in the evenings as a student would have that the student's purse wouldn't be rummaged through?
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3162.199,3165.984,--I think a student's desk is different from an employee's desk.
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3171.905,3179.411,I think personally a purse is more different from a desk than a student's desk is different from an employee's desk.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3179.411,3184.815,"Well, I mean, I guess that is sort of... I have thought about this in these terms."
1986.85-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3239.965,3241.631,The purpose was?
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3241.631,3248.202,"The purpose that they allege, Justice Rehnquist, was to separate state and personal property."
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3272.519,3277.138,"xxx they might have looked at it to see what it is, but then they should have put it aside?"
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3277.138,3277.588,Yes.
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3277.588,3278.923,But they shouldn't have seized it.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3278.923,3283.308,"They shouldn't have seized it, and they shouldn't have gone so far as to read it to find out who sent it to them."
1986.85-530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3297.418,3299.504,Maybe he reads poetry to his patients.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3299.504,3300.37,--It is possible that he--
1986.85-530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3300.37,3302.205,Read poetry to his patients.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3302.205,3305.323,"--Even if he does, it is his personal papers, and much of what he uses--"
1986.85-530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3305.323,3307.859,"Well, it could be work-related is what I am suggesting."
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3307.859,3310.159,--The book of poetry could be work related.
1986.85-530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3315.763,3316.096,I see.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3316.096,3321.833,And they have made no claim that they issue poetry in California to psychiatrists.
1986.85-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3322.619,3325.135,"Mr. Klein, you have got a couple of minutes."
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3352.471,3354.404,I don't know of any such case.
1986.85-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3377.537,3386.042,I suppose it wouldn't be strange if a private employer went into a desk and seized some private property and refused to give it back that he might get sued for it.
1986.85-530,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3386.042,3392.679,"Oh, I think if he did what was done in this case, I think there would clearly be a tort action available for retrieving the property."
