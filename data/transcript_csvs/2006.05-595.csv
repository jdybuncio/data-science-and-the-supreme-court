2006.05-595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.022,We'll hear argument next in Whorton versus Bockting.
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,5.415,8.288,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-595,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,53.956,58.831,"Could you give an example, General Chanos, of one that is other than Gideon?"
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,60.582,67.466,The only example that this Court has pointed to in its 25 years of retroactivity jurisprudence is Gideon versus Wainwright.
2006.05-595,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,67.466,71.207,--And none other occurs to you?
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,71.207,76.071,None other occurs to me at this time.
2006.05-595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,103.08,107.581,I take it from your presentation you think we do have to go through the Teague analysis.
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,111.684,114.586,"No, Chief Justice Roberts."
2006.05-595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,122.13,133.628,"Well then, what do you do about 2254(e)(1), or I guess (e)(2), which seems to suggest at different rule if a case is made retroactive?"
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,133.628,157.733,"Well, 2254(e)(2) provides a cause and prejudice opportunity in the event that the state court denies relief on a procedural basis rather than a substantive basis and the petitioner can show cause and prejudice under 2254(e)(2)(A)."
2006.05-595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,189.986,197.54,"Now, my point was that looking at (d)(1), it says is the decision contrary to established law."
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,203.274,203.905,Correct.
2006.05-595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,203.905,210.489,"But on the other hand, you look at (e)(2) and it says here's what you do if you're applying a new decision that's that been made retroactive."
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,215.953,230.431,Our reading of 2254(d)(1) is that Congress intended to have the federal courts give the state courts deference to the extent that the state courts made a substantive determination.
2006.05-595,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,267.785,276.153,"Well, suppose the state has, which is going straight to AEDPA."
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,293.592,295.995,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,373.516,378.421,What is the source of the rule in Teague?
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,389.468,394.841,My understanding is that the rule in Teague is... the source is not the U.S. Constitution.
2006.05-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,421.519,422.75,Habeas is an equitable--
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,422.75,423.75,I'm sorry?
2006.05-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,423.75,432.606,"--Habeas is equitable relief and the Court has a lot of discretion in identifying the boundaries of equitable relief, doesn't it?"
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,432.606,433.728,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,433.728,435.06,I assume that's how we got to Teague.
2006.05-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,435.06,442.503,Let me ask this question as to the basic issue of whether you should be relying on Teague or the statute.
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,464.669,472.923,"While under the Court's retroactivity jurisprudence Griffith would control, under 2254 it would not."
2006.05-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,475.357,483.241,So it really makes a difference whether we rely on Teague or whether we rely on the statute if we disagree with you?
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,483.241,483.422,It make difference.
2006.05-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,484.012,493.108,"Well, I assume there would be a Rule 60(b) motion or the equivalent of it in state court."
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,496.12,498.464,"Yes, absolutely."
2006.05-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.464,505.167,"I mean, it's inconceivable that the problem wouldn't be solved in some fashion by the state court that rendered the decision."
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,505.167,522.937,"I believe that the petitioner would be able to make a subsequent habeas petition at the state court level and if they were somehow denied relief on a procedural basis, there would be nothing that would preclude the Federal court from granting them relief thereafter."
2006.05-595,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,522.937,528.112,"That's a odd position to take, to proliferate proceedings that way."
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,555.899,577.234,"Justice Ginsburg, what we're saying is that Congress in enacting 2254(d)(1) was stating that the Federal courts should give deference to the state court decision so long as it is a merits decision and so long as it complies with existing clearly established law and is not unreasonable."
2006.05-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.221,589.193,"You're saying not just ""clearly""; ""then clearly established law""."
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,589.193,589.623,That's exactly.
2006.05-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.623,592.374,"That is, at the time of the state court decision."
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,592.374,594.876,"Exactly, absolutely, at the time of the state court decision."
2006.05-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,616.24,618.001,The word was is somewhat ambiguous.
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,623.164,629.307,"Well, in either case, it is referring to the--"
2006.05-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,629.307,630.85,"I know you win under either view, but--"
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,630.85,631.889,"--Yes, exactly."
2006.05-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,631.889,634.272,--it could mean either of those two things.
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,634.272,641.004,"Our, our position would be that it would be up to when the decision became final."
2006.05-595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,662.029,667.272,Crawford did use the term bedrock?
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,667.272,667.733,--Yes.
2006.05-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,789.856,797.463,You make the same analysis if you say the right is not necessarily the right of confrontation but the narrower right of cross-examination.
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,797.463,800.823,--Would I make the same analysis?
2006.05-595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.823,802.395,Because that is central to Crawford.
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,802.395,803.526,Yes.
2006.05-595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,814.734,817.766,"Well, there is a new emphasis on cross-examination."
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,817.766,823.999,"--It alters, it modifies the manner in which we implement that right."
2006.05-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,852.508,853.099,Exactly.
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,883.868,885.049,"Well, there were--"
2006.05-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,885.049,893.086,I'm not sure that you can so... in such a facile fashion decide what is a bedrock principle.
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,903.542,905.605,"--Well, Justice Scalia--"
2006.05-595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,905.605,906.223,It is like obscenity.
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,906.833,908.924,--I understand.
2006.05-595,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,910.427,917.071,"That gets, if you follow Justice Scalia's argument, that gets you to, I think to the argument you have made."
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,961.799,972.548,--The other point is that there's a second component to watershed which is it must be a rule without which the accuracy of a proceeding is seriously diminished.
2006.05-595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,983.404,986.987,"Well, there wasn't cross-examination by defense counsel."
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,986.987,987.868,I'm sorry?
2006.05-595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,987.868,991.328,In this case there wasn't cross-examination by defense counsel.
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,992.129,997.623,"There was cross-examination of the mother, there was cross-examination of the police detective... there was cross-examination of--"
2006.05-595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,997.623,997.843,"Oh, oh."
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,998.705,1000.995,--Not of Autumn... not of Autumn Bockting.
2006.05-595,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1020.14,1021.74,--accuracy-enhancing then?
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,1021.74,1022.351,--I'm sorry?
2006.05-595,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1022.351,1028.544,"It's a question about how much more accuracy-enhancing, if at all?"
2006.05-595,0,25145,george_j_chanos,,1028.544,1032.438,"That, and it is really an analysis of Roberts."
2006.05-595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1063.689,1064.868,Thank you General Chanos.
2006.05-595,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1067.5,1078.329,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1100.102,1107.117,"Since you barely cite AEDPA, I think you assume we need to reach the Teague question before the AEDPA question."
2006.05-595,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1107.117,1127.092,"Mr. Chief Justice, we do not have an interest in the AEDPA question because it does not apply to Federal convictions, the 2254(d)(1), and there is no Federal conviction analog to 2254(d)(1), so we are not telling you that you should or should not reach it."
2006.05-595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1129.353,1132.235,"It is law that is applied in Federal court, though."
2006.05-595,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1133.905,1150.486,"Well, we have a general interest in the way law is applied in Federal court but we do not ordinarily opine on issues just on that basis and we haven't in the past opined on AEDPA issues unless they have some Federal analog carryover effect."
2006.05-595,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1225.525,1230.107,"Can't you make that argument about any, about cross-examination in general?"
2006.05-595,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1249.871,1250.171,Yes.
2006.05-595,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1284.353,1289.946,"Well I guess you're asking us to say Crawford, get one, take one, it is really not that important."
2006.05-595,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1293.119,1295.61,"No, I think Crawford that is an important decision."
2006.05-595,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1343.562,1354.198,"How many times have we dealt with a quote, ""new rule"", with the argument made that it was watershed and therefore should be retroactive?"
2006.05-595,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1355.77,1374.991,"No, I think that there have been... I don't know the exact number, but maybe 11 or 12, about half of which are ones, are proposed new rules and half of which are ones where the rule was already established previously and the question was whether it was going to be made retroactive."
2006.05-595,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1438.134,1439.436,But that's not this case.
2006.05-595,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1439.436,1446.949,Well there was actually in this case the mother's testimony about what the daughter said to her.
2006.05-595,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1446.949,1448.591,I'm talking about the daughter's testimony.
2006.05-595,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1448.591,1448.86,Yes.
2006.05-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1487.876,1489.118,"Is that the case in Federal courts, too?"
2006.05-595,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1489.118,1498.662,"Well, it is a matter of interpreting... what protection is left is only going to be by virtue of the residual hearsay rule."
2006.05-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1505.037,1511.392,"I mean, it is conceivable that Federal courts would interpret the hearsay rule to require precisely that anyway."
2006.05-595,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1511.392,1512.954,But Justice Scalia--
2006.05-595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1512.954,1517.766,In which case you shouldn't be making this argument because it applies only to state courts.
2006.05-595,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1517.766,1518.437,--No.
2006.05-595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1664.754,1666.744,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,1672.07,1674.631,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.187,1781.741,"Well, we didn't say in Crawford, I don't think we said in Crawford... I ought to know, I suppose."
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,1849.196,1852.418,"No, Your Honor, you are not bound to what the framers think."
2006.05-595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.098,1902.129,"I think that discussion of the, you know, the contrary decisions that had been produced under Roberts was just for the purpose of justifying the overruling of a case that... you know... that was not that old."
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,1916.108,1922.285,And I don't think that our burden would to be show that it always produces unreliable results.
2006.05-595,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1967.713,1972.625,"That's in an instruction, like Toomey versus Ohio."
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,1981.931,1987.455,"--I don't mean to say, Your Honor, that it is structural."
2006.05-595,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2134.422,2143.158,"Ms. Forsman, what about the cases we're had so far on this second Teague category?"
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2153.777,2158.309,"It would be, Your Honor, and it is appropriate that this be the first time."
2006.05-595,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2229.135,2237.042,What about the decision that said Ring v. Arizona was not retroactive on collateral?
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2237.042,2249.789,"Again, in Schriro versus Summerlin, the issue there was an issue with regard to ultimate accuracy of a jury versus a judge."
2006.05-595,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2282.45,2295.458,The problem with your case... maybe it's our problem because it was our rule... is that we're asked to adopt an across-the-board calculus as to the rule.
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2329.101,2330.673,"I can, Your Honor."
2006.05-595,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2409.356,2418.601,But Ohio versus Roberts was not overruled because of a judgment that it was not doing a good enough job in assessing reliability of these statements.
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2423.283,2426.595,"That's... Your Honor, that is the base of the decision."
2006.05-595,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2521.583,2526.986,You had the opportunity to challenge those findings under the Roberts regime in state court?
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2526.986,2528.428,--We did.
2006.05-595,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2551.053,2555.206,You can still argue... what hearsay exception did it come in under?
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2555.206,2561.707,It came in under a Nevada statute which was patterned after Roberts.
2006.05-595,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2563.61,2567.211,Adequate indicia of reliability.
2006.05-595,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2567.211,2567.582,Adequate indicia of reliability?
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2567.582,2570.345,"--Yes, adequate... basically, indicia of reliability."
2006.05-595,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2583.164,2585.405,Is that universal in Nevada?
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2591.729,2592.039,--No.
2006.05-595,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2596.294,2599.085,"This is for children under ten, isn't it?"
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2599.085,2599.816,Children under ten.
2006.05-595,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2599.816,2600.317,As you just said.
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2600.317,2601.296,That's correct.
2006.05-595,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2601.296,2610.082,"And here we had someone who was six years old and was hardly articulate, it seems from the little we have of this record."
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2617.027,2617.608,It was.
2006.05-595,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2656.356,2662.671,"So if you lose this case, you can go back to the Ninth Circuit and say, well, even under Roberts it shouldn't have come in?"
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2662.671,2667.884,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor, because the Ninth Circuit did not reach that issue."
2006.05-595,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2667.884,2677.371,"Would you comment, Ms. Forsman, on your opponent's argument based on 2254(d)?"
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2677.371,2678.482,Yes.
2006.05-595,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2798.781,2812.181,That's not... the state has to result... the state... it's adjudicated on the merits in state court and results in a decision that was contrary to clearly established Federal law.
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2812.181,2813.661,--Correct.
2006.05-595,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2813.661,2819.414,"So it seems to me that the question is what was the law, what was the clearly established law at the time of the state decision."
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2819.414,2868.447,"2254(d)(1), I think the only way that you can read that section compatibly with the four other sections which are quoted in our appendix 2 of our brief, the only way that you can do that is to recognize, although this Court will recall that it has described AEDPA as not quite a silk purse of legislative drafting, but the only way to make those sections compatible is to say, listen, what was going on when 2254(d)(1) was written was we were talking not about the timing of the new rule, what we were talking about is who is it decided by, because before AEDPA was adopted it wasn't apparent that it must be a decision by you, by this Court, that established by the rule."
2006.05-595,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2925.135,2931.81,Is there any language in 2254(d) that could incorporate the Teague exceptions?
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2931.81,2936.102,--There is not language in 2254(d)(1).
2006.05-595,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2947.378,2958.798,"What would we say if we were to say that 2254(d)(1) accommodates the Teague exceptions, that Congress meant to put them in but just forgot to do it?"
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,2960.989,3013.723,"I think that what you would say is that Congress would not have deprived you of the power to make a rule retroactively applicable and would have not then created the ludicrous situation which the state suggests would occur here, which is instead of the motivation in Congress in having someone like Mr. Bockting raise the issue from the very beginning in one unitary proceeding, as opposed to going back, which is what they've suggested he must do in order to get the advantage of a retroactive rule, is that Congress was cognizant of that and in order to make all of the statute... all of the provisions of the statute have meaning and not render certain provisions, including the sections that we quoted, superfluous, that you must interpret that to mean that the... that the... that 2254(d)(1) is not a timing statute."
2006.05-595,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3020.418,3037.067,"Isn't that making the tail wag the dog, because there's language in the provisions on successive petitions that refers to Teague, that you would read the Teague exceptions into 2254(d)(1) when there's nothing in the language there that can be interpreted to refer to them?"
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,3037.067,3038.66,No.
2006.05-595,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3272.583,3274.065,"Ms. Forsman, can I ask you a personal question?"
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,3275.788,3281.381,I was not.
2006.05-595,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3281.381,3287.375,I attend a moot court at Notre Dame in about your year and it was an awfully good moot court.
2006.05-595,2,23931,franny_a_forsman,,3287.375,3292.851,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2006.05-595,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3292.851,3293.221,"Thank you, Ms. Forsman."

2006.05-595,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3442.62,3444.951,You can finish your sentence.
2006.05-595,3,25145,george_j_chanos,,3444.951,3445.362,--Thank you.
2006.05-595,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3445.362,3446.894,Particularly if it is Justice Harlan you're quoting.
2006.05-595,3,25145,george_j_chanos,,3447.094,3447.985,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
