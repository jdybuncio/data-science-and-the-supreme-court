1978.78-5066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.689,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Dunaway against New York.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,16.895,20.863,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court."
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,209.789,212.608,Where was the -- where did the interrogation of Cole take place?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,212.608,215.141,At the Monroe County Jail.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,215.141,215.836,Where he was incarcerated on another charge?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,215.836,219.5,He was incarcerated then they took him to from the jail to an interview room and questioned --
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,219.5,220.715,He was already in jail on some other charge?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,220.715,222.79,"He was in jail on other charges, that's correct."
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,222.79,224.714,So he wasn't brought to the jail for interrogation?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,224.714,226.137,No he wasn't.
1978.78-5066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,239.572,243.803,I thought you -- I think for the third time you called him an unreliable informant.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,251.845,252.456,I've --
1978.78-5066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,252.456,258.558,-- must he give several reliable reports before he establishes his reliability?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,258.558,260.625,It would be preferable if he did.
1978.78-5066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,265.533,271.287,But it's inherently unreliable if it's the first time the police hear from the informant.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,271.287,285.05,"If the police hear from him the first time and they can -- then they go, like to the scene, and what they see if a person on a tip says, “So and so is selling marijuana and possesses -- and also has a firearm and he's on the corner of” -- let's pick two streets -- “main street and state street.”"
1978.78-5066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,305.138,315.18,"So from your point of view, the results obtained by the police validate the accuracy of the tip as it were?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,315.18,317.709,No because they didn't corroborate it before.
1978.78-5066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,317.709,323.153,"No but hypothetically, you said, if they did this in the hypothetical case?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,323.153,325.166,But they didn't in this case.
1978.78-5066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.166,336.148,What's your authority for the requirement of corroboration as you put it in a situation such as this where there was no search warrant or arrest warrant at hand?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,336.148,343.044,"In a situation such as this, there is no authority and I think this is the first case that we'll talk about that particular point of law."
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,348.719,349.712,That's the Draper case.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,349.899,352.167,Right.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,352.167,357.788,Am I quite mistaken in my apprehension that there's no issue of whether there was or was not probable cause --
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,357.788,358.316,There is no issue on that.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,358.316,360.193,-- in the case that everybody agrees there was not?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,360.193,361.393,There is no issue whatsoever.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,361.393,361.983,That's what I thought.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,361.983,364.668,Every court has held there is no probable cause in this case.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,364.668,365.645,And the state --
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,365.645,366.67,And the prosecutor --
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,366.67,367.883,-- state actually concedes it.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,367.883,372.565,Right but the argument will come down to reasonable suspicion when whether or not that existed and that's why I'm talking --
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,372.565,376.987,"Why would they raise -- there was not mind-run probable cause, isn't that correct?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,376.987,377.389,That's correct.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,377.389,379.582,That's what it thought.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,379.582,387.995,What subsequently followed was that the police then issued an order to go pick up and bring in Mr. Dunaway acting on this information.
1978.78-5066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,446.155,449.392,"Well why give us some facts, what did they do, did they --"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,449.392,457.272,"The police said, to -- the police testimony is, “We asked him if he would go downtown with us”, and he said, “Yes.”"
1978.78-5066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,469.383,472.625,And how many police officers were there altogether?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,472.625,474.247,There were three police officers.
1978.78-5066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,474.247,475.063,Three of them making an (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,475.063,479.353,Three police officers who stood -- who stands 6'3” over 210 pounds.
1978.78-5066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,485.468,489.839,"Ordinarily, that'd be enough force to look like an arrest, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,489.839,491.173,It certainly would.
1978.78-5066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,508.98,516.539,Was there anything inherently inconsistent between a person being arrested and going without resistance?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,516.539,531.442,"No, that's the exact point that I'm about to make Your Honor, is that if a person is accosted by the police and goes along voluntarily, there are many federal cases which hold that that still constitutes an arrest as long as the person being seized feels that he is so restricted."
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,587.5,594.108,Well didn't the state courts agree in their final judgment there was a detention?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,594.108,596.029,"The agreed that there was a detention, that's correct."
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,596.029,597.461,Against his will.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,597.461,600.798,"Well, they said, he went along voluntarily, but a detention and I don't see --"
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.798,601.742,"Well, it said, it was --"
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,601.742,603.938,Where do you find this voluntary in the (Voice Overlap)?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,603.938,605.858,"The appellate division opinion in the record, I believe it's page --"
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,605.858,608.029,But there was no opinion.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,608.029,610.696,There was an opinion by the appellate division the second time Your Honor.
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.696,612.417,Page 124 of the --
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,612.417,614.092,Of the appendix.
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.512,625.912,Well it says that this case involves a brief detention.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,625.912,627.309,"That's correct, it says that as well."
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,627.309,632.722,And it says that -- and that therefore is controlled by Morales.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,632.722,634.336,That's correct.
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,634.336,635.939,Which did involve a detention?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,635.939,640.665,"It did, and that's why I don't know why the appellate division threw in the word voluntarily."
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.665,642.764,(Voice Overlap) admittedly on less than probable cause.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,642.764,643.389,That's correct.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,643.389,645.328,"Right, well --"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,645.328,646.328,And the appellate division --
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,646.328,650.454,-- well I'm just reading the opinion now by Judge Moore (ph) how do you pronounce his name?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,650.454,651.911,Moore (ph)
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,651.911,658.622,"He says that “According to the police testimony, defendant was asked to come downtown to talk and that's voluntarily.”"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,658.622,659.527,That's correct.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,659.527,659.726,Is that --
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,659.726,661.046,He quotes the police testimony.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,661.046,661.964,Well but the --
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,661.964,664.559,But that's contrary to the finding of the fact made by the hearing court who says --
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,664.559,666.481,Does the Court of Appeals say that --
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,666.481,667.415,The Court of Appeals dismissed our application.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,667.415,669.493,-- had in fact that he did come down voluntarily?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,669.493,672.723,"The Court of Appeals dismissed our application for permission to appeal, and so we filed --"
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,672.723,675.54,Nobody found that he came voluntarily.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,678.058,682.132,"As of -- as an affirmed finding of fact I say that that's true, they didn't but they've put the word --"
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.132,684.515,The district -- the trial court found just to the contrary.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,684.515,685.542,That s correct.
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,685.542,686.189,And that --
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,686.189,690.253,And the people are contending in point one of their brief that he did go along voluntarily and this was a consensual case.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,690.253,692.09,"And this was a finding was otherwise, isn't it?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,692.09,692.751,Pardon?
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,692.751,695.261,Wasn't -- there's no -- the finding was otherwise.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,695.261,706.448,"That's correct and that's what I'm trying to point out to the court at this time that I think that the finding is otherwise, but the people say that he did go along voluntarily and they're relying on the use of the word voluntary in that appellate division opinion."
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,706.448,706.67,Well but --
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,706.67,710.0,"I don't see how they can use it when they say it at the same he was detained, it seems to me a --"
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.0,713.629,"(Voice Overlap) he said, to retry the facts here I think you ought to get to the law on this case."
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,713.629,716.185,"Okay, I'd be happy to Your Honor."
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,735.029,738.335,"The Fourth Amendment doesn't say anything about arrest, it talks about seizure."
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,738.335,740.009,It does talk about seizure Your Honor.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,740.009,742.965,"And that's the real question, isn't it?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,742.965,743.569,"Well, I believe that --"
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,743.569,743.8,And you're not seized --
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,743.8,747.121,-- if a person's arrested he is seized --
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,747.121,750.755,It's pretty clear that you're not seized if you consent to go along with somebody.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,750.755,750.99,That's correct.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,750.99,752.065,That's not a seizure.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,752.065,752.827,That's correct.
1978.78-5066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,752.827,759.184,"Yes, but if you get -- if you consent to go along with a man with a machinegun, I'm not too sure that's consent."
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,759.184,761.618,Well then it doesn't consent.
1978.78-5066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,761.618,762.55,"Well, what did all (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,762.55,766.079,"If you're consenting to the police authority of saying, “We're going to go downtown.”"
1978.78-5066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,769.881,770.127,"Well, the --"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,770.127,774.933,-- and you're going along voluntarily with the police is not consent and there are two different terms of art.
1978.78-5066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,774.933,778.94,"Well, if the police wanted him, why didn't they just telephone him and tell him to come on down?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,778.94,779.923,That's -- they didn't do that.
1978.78-5066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,781.555,782.585,"And they didn't send one, they sent four."
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,782.585,785.028,-- by phone.
1978.78-5066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,785.028,786.062,Four officers.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,786.062,787.299,Three officers.
1978.78-5066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,787.299,787.789,Three?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,787.789,788.733,That's correct.
1978.78-5066,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,788.733,792.713,To deliver a message to please come down.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,792.713,795.482,"They said, “We want to talk to you downtown.”"
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,795.482,811.694,"Mr. Nowak, I'm sorry to go back to the facts, but there seems to be a general consensus that there was no change in the finding of the trial judge, but the -- on page 126, the appellate division said, “This testimony shows that the police illegally detained the defendant for questioning.”"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,825.438,827.477,No I don't believe that's what they meant by that.
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,827.882,828.226,Which you --
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,828.226,834.776,"-- that the detention was legal because of the application of a -- of the Morales case, which is a New York Court of Appeals case, --"
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,834.776,835.567,"In other words, the reason (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,835.567,838.763,"-- what it says, “You can detain people on reasonable suspicion and not probable cause.”"
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,838.763,840.088,"I see, alright."
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,840.088,842.887,And that's why they classified the detention as being legal.
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,886.007,890.228,"Mr. Nowak excuse me again, but you're involved -- arguing the attenuation point now if I understand you correctly?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,890.228,891.102,That's correct.
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.102,900.954,"Yes, because there's an intermediate point and the legal proposition I have -- had disputed is whether or not a -- the police can ever bring a man in on -- just on reasonable suspicion."
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,914.286,921.178,"My view is that, at this time under the law of Brown it can not when he's brought in because in effect he is arrested at that point in time."
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.47,930.861,For fingerprinting or for a lineup?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,930.861,938.134,"For fingerprinting or for a lineup, now there could be a situation could be developed where they could go to his house and say to him, “Would you like to come?” And he says, “No.”"
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.134,939.126,"But he says no, you always have --"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,939.126,939.639,Okay.
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,939.639,940.592,"-- a case which says no, and they say no, we're --"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,940.592,941.074,Right.
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.074,941.427,-- we're saying yes.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,941.427,943.476,They'd take them him forcibly.
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.43,960.395,And that's for a lineup as well as questioning in review of your --
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,960.395,961.351,"I would think so, yes sir."
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,961.351,962.895,Or for a fingerprinting.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,962.895,965.099,I think that the Court held that in Davis versus Mississippi.
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,965.099,966.035,Yes.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,966.035,970.415,And it -- that's why I feel that that is the law of the state.
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1087.082,1092.736,"But when the -- when these police acted, Morales was on the books in that circuit, wasn't it?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1092.736,1100.691,"Morales in my opinion Your Honor has never been the law because it's been dicta, and I think if the Court would examine the opinion in Morales --"
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.691,1107.801,"No, what would reasonable police people think about Morales?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1118.245,1119.097,That's correct.
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.097,1124.68,Well what about police operating under judgments like this?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1124.68,1135.693,"If in fact the police are acting under a statute which is later declared invalid, there are court cases which indicate that the police are acting in good faith and that is a criteria to consider."
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.693,1142.359,"Well Morales is just a -- I suppose, just a construction of the New York statute to the powers of the police?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1142.359,1144.118,"I don't believe that it is, but in any event what if there was --"
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1144.118,1145.448,Well what it is then?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1145.448,1149.665,"I think it's their interpretation of what the federal constitution says, and that's what the New York court did."
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.983,1191.55,"Well what do you think -- Well, police don't expect you to (Inaudible) dicta in holding, is that it?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1191.55,1199.309,"No I'm not suggesting that they should, but I'm saying that there really was no reason or reasonable way or reason for the police to believe this was the law in the State of New York."
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1203.381,1212.976,"Do you say the police said to themselves, “We don't have probable cause and we don't need, and whether we need it or not we're taking the fellow down to the precinct.”"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1212.976,1213.815,That's correct.
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.815,1214.386,That's your --
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1214.386,1216.229,That's exactly what I feel.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1222.753,1234.533,"Well Judge Denman's concurring opinion did rely precisely on the point implicitly suggested by my Brother White's question, didn't he, Judge Denman?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1234.533,1235.845,She was bound by the holding of the Court of Appeals.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1235.845,1237.289,She?
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1237.289,1238.07,That's correct.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1238.07,1238.769,In --
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1238.769,1239.354,In Morales.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1239.354,1240.247,"In Morales, yes."
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1240.247,1249.651,"But the Morales opinion, I would only ask the Court to note that that opinion specifically makes the -- all the findings that she relies on and then says, “We have a second basis for our holding.”"
1978.78-5066,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1260.803,1265.97,"But this Court in alternative holdings, they're both holdings."
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1265.97,1273.058,"I guess it could be said, both holdings, maybe they made two separate ones and then there was no need to make it because they were relying on a consent issue."
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.396,1354.626,"Mr. Nowak, on the attenuation point, what is the ultimate conclusion one draws if one finds there was attenuation?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1358.198,1359.921,If one finds attenuation?
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1359.921,1360.408,Yes.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1360.408,1369.072,"Before one gets to that question the threshold question is, is there a voluntary confession under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments?"
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1373.901,1375.69,"As I understand it, there's no claim in this case."
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1375.69,1376.562,And there is no claim that this confession was not --
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1376.562,1378.259,And in fact was involuntary.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1378.259,1381.564,"No there isn't, and the same -- this is the facts of Brown and I say that our --"
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1381.564,1388.877,"What is it that attenuate -- I don't -- I have to confess, what is it that -- when he is trying to find out by asking whether there was attenuation?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1388.877,1391.179,"Should the confession be suppressed, should be the exclusionary rule be applied?"
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1391.179,1400.3,"But attenuation -- if at attenuation like an adjective, what -- if it is attenuated then what -- I mean, is that mean if it's attenuated then it's admissible or is it?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1400.3,1402.558,Then it's admissible in evidence because the purge of the initial --
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1402.558,1406.288,Then what is -- what are you looking for when you ask about attenuation? What kind of conclusion.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1406.288,1413.624,You are looking to see if the defendant's statement was sufficiently and independent intervening act of freewill.What was in --
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1413.624,1416.327,"But if you found it was voluntary, haven't you found that?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1416.327,1420.114,"Well, that's where I disagree because the purpose of the fourth --"
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1420.114,1422.182,"The two kinds of voluntariness, apparently?"
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1422.182,1425.64,Voluntariness under the Fifth Amendment is one question.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1445.58,1446.402,"That's it, that's it."
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1448.117,1448.951,"It has nothing to do with that, the voluntariness."
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1448.951,1452.534,"-- as you said, that's conceded that this was a voluntary statement."
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1452.534,1453.131,It was voluntary.
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1453.131,1461.225,The attenuation as I understand it and perhaps I misunderstand it is whether or not its sufficiently disconnected with the Fourth Amendment violation by the police.
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1461.225,1463.942,"That's correct, and if it's sufficiently --"
1978.78-5066,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1463.942,1466.265,"What makes it disconnected other than voluntariness, I just --"
1978.78-5066,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1466.265,1467.58,(Inaudible)
1978.78-5066,0,22894,edward_j_nowak,,1467.58,1469.998,The matter -- there are certain facets annunciated in Brown.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1599.295,1608.086,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-5066,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1700.195,1701.536,Well what difference does this make?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1702.448,1707.244,"Well there was a question before, Your Honor, about the fact that there were three officers and --"
1978.78-5066,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1707.244,1710.895,"Well really, what difference does it make whether there are 3, 1 or 24?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1710.895,1715.019,Well it comes down to the question of the voluntariness.
1978.78-5066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1768.872,1772.977,And you're suggesting the interview is not an exploitation?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1772.977,1777.706,I'm suggesting that they did not seek to exploit the illegality assuming that the initial detention was --
1978.78-5066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.706,1784.135,Well he was seized -- he was -- we're assuming he's being illegally held in that room.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1784.135,1785.296,That's correct.
1978.78-5066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1785.296,1796.73,"And you're suggesting that -- oh, I guess you are that questioning him while he's being illegally held is not an exploitation of the illegality?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1796.73,1798.441,Yes Your Honor and I'll tell you why.
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1802.798,1806.712,"Mr. Bressler, was he given a choice to enter the interview room or not?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1806.712,1808.449,I assume not Your Honor.
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1808.449,1812.75,I do to.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1812.75,1819.753,"Therefore, what I'm trying to do is make a comparison between this case and the Brown test on this balancing question."
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1819.753,1824.083,"Well, haven't you already held that just mere giving Miranda warnings doesn't --"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1824.083,1825.113,"That is correct Your Honor, I --"
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1825.113,1826.515,-- does affect the illegality?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1826.515,1835.952,"I accept that but I am saying that in a case like this where the officers in the first place acted in good faith because they were following what was then the law of New York, where they did nothing of it --"
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1835.952,1841.183,I know but now you're -- we've assumed -- we're assuming an illegality.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1842.67,1864.109,"That's correct, but in exercising your judgment in a balancing test as was expressed in Terry and Adamson and few other cases, I'm suggesting that the question I would like answered or what I think favors us is that if the police act in good faith and we assume the illegality and they do very little if anything to exploit that illegality other than move him from one place to another against --"
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1864.109,1865.583,Then interrogate him.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1865.583,1880.087,"-- and then question him after warning him of his Miranda rights telling him that he doesn't have to speak, that he can have a lawyer and that he can terminate it at any time, that under such cases the two-pronged reasons for excluding are not benefited."
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1899.337,1903.13,"That's not a Brown argument at all, that's not a Brown argument at all."
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1918.131,1919.518,No but Your Honor I am --
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1919.518,1933.81,"As I -- I don't see that -- did you present this argument to the appellate division that even if it's illegal and even if there was no attenuation, the officers were nevertheless in good faith and the evidence should not be excluded, you didn't argue that did you?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1933.81,1935.733,I argued Morales in the New York courts Your Honor which --
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1935.733,1937.661,Well in Morales --
1978.78-5066,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1937.661,1943.745,"Well you were the appellee and not the appellant in the appellant -- appellate division, were you?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1943.745,1945.763,"No, no we were the appellants the last time up."
1978.78-5066,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1945.763,1950.025,Because the Supreme Court had suppressed the confession?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1950.025,1952.829,"Yes, the trial court suppressed, we appealed."
1978.78-5066,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1952.829,1957.129,And you argue in Morales only insofar as you were saying this was legal under Morales?
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1957.129,1957.35,Right.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,1957.35,1962.682,Well of course the argument -- the question before the appellate division was somewhat different than it is now.
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2029.433,2035.637,"Well you -- then in New York on the Morales, you don't have it either an arrest warrant."
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2035.637,2042.492,"The way the law is in New York today, that is correct, you do not Your Honor."
1978.78-5066,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2198.384,2200.215,As to on what issue?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2200.215,2206.022,On both -- on the question of whether it -- he voluntarily went downtown.
1978.78-5066,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2206.022,2207.469,Whether he consented.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2207.469,2208.538,That he -- that's correct.
1978.78-5066,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2209.798,2212.447,And what part of the opinion do you rely upon it?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2212.447,2213.649,May I have a moment Your Honor?
1978.78-5066,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2213.649,2222.268,"Page 124 of the appendix, I think, the opinion you're referring to."
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2222.268,2232.236,"The court will note at page 124 about two inches below, Justice Moore (ph) says a little bit in, “According to the police testimony, defendant was asked and so forth and did so voluntarily.”"
1978.78-5066,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2232.236,2233.244,Yes.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2233.244,2249.136,"Later on in the opinion, at page 126 it point -- it's indicated with a bracket at two, it says, “This testimony shows that the police legally detained the defendant” and so forth.”"
1978.78-5066,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2306.435,2316.727,"Mr. Bressler, is it really that clear because wasn't the motion to make it exclusively on the law, so isn't it fair to say that the decision was a mixed law and fact decision?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2316.727,2318.097,Yes Your Honor that is absolutely correct.
1978.78-5066,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2318.097,2324.0,And on the mixed law and fact conclusion it is that the police conduct here is proper under Morales.
1978.78-5066,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2324.0,2324.684,Right.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2324.684,2325.596,"That is correct Your Honor, but I'm suggesting --"
1978.78-5066,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.596,2330.11,And under Morales it's proper to arrest on reasonable suspicion for questioning.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2330.11,2341.241,"Well there is an ambiguity, no question about it, but I'm suggesting that we -- if the entire three-man majority opinion is read, it seems clear that they absolutely credited the police testimony on their review of the facts."
1978.78-5066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.241,2348.479,"Now, Page 125 says, “We believe this case is controlled by the recent decision of the Court of Appeals in Morales.”"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2348.479,2348.825,Yes Your Honor.
1978.78-5066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2348.825,2354.148,In which the court rearticulated its view that you can arrest on -- you may detain on reasonable suspicion.
1978.78-5066,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2354.148,2355.268,Right.
1978.78-5066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.268,2362.882,"That's the way they disposed of the case, and that's why they said, the detention was legal."
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2362.882,2370.492,"That certainly a firm interpretation Your Honor, I would urge the other one but I think the issue is clear and it's understood."
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2370.492,2377.596,"Do you argue -- you haven't yet, that one -- the police may detain for questioning on reasonable suspicion."
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2377.596,2379.076,I'm sorry Your Honor I didn't hear you.
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2379.076,2385.05,Do you take the position that the police may detain for questioning on reasonable suspicion and without probable cause?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2385.05,2386.66,"Yes, I do Your Honor and --"
1978.78-5066,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2386.66,2389.597,As a matter of federal constitutional law.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2389.597,2391.68,"Yes Your Honor, as a matter of fact I'd like to explain why."
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2391.68,2396.096,Can they also arrest?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2396.096,2399.594,"To the extent there's a distinction, I would say an arrest, no."
1978.78-5066,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2399.594,2403.431,"Well, but the -- again the Fourth Amendment doesn't say a word about arrest."
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2407.887,2415.029,"If I may, I'll explain to you why if there was a -- what the distinction is."
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2513.58,2517.479,Well isn't that testimony here that one policeman held him by his belt?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2517.479,2523.796,"Yes Your Honor, the testimony of the defendant or petitioner himself said that he put his hand on his belt and guided him to the car."
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2562.112,2564.922,In Morales how long can you hold him?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2564.922,2569.567,"A reasonably brief period of time, I guess pretty much like Brown, you have to judge it -- each case on it facts."
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2569.567,2571.453,"Well, from 1 to 50 years."
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2571.453,2579.302,Well Your Honor in this case he made a -- he started to make -- he waived his rights and commenced making a statement within a very few minutes after he was questioned.
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2579.947,2586.229,"Well, according to you, he waived his rights when they stopped him, because he said he was willing to go down the police station."
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2590.388,2593.974,"Well, but I don't think at that time he was advised of his Fifth and Sixth --"
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2593.974,2595.086,That's right.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2595.086,2595.517,He was not advised --
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2595.517,2597.608,That's right.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2597.608,2605.094,"Then what we're talking about is the intermediate period, the 20, 30 or 40 minute trip downtown from the time he was first deprived of his immediate liberty."
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2607.662,2610.104,But why was he taken to the police station?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2610.104,2610.845,Why?
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2610.845,2614.127,"To be questioned, yes sir why?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2614.127,2616.243,That question of course is not clear on the record.
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2619.188,2621.522,It was not in the record.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2621.522,2622.684,"It is not, I --"
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2622.684,2624.477,(Inaudible) questioning right there.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2624.477,2632.008,"Well those officers, especially the two officers who were assigned to the case could not, because A, they weren't assigned to that detail, and B, knew very little about the case."
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2644.713,2649.39,Well couldn't the officer who did question him have come out to the house and questioned him?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2649.39,2651.297,Yes he certainly could've but that would --
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2651.297,2651.998,Could he?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2651.998,2652.844,Yes Your Honor he certainly could have.
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2652.844,2654.334,It'll be trouble for him.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2654.334,2656.088,Yes it would because he didn't know any --
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2656.088,2658.009,But no trouble to bring the man.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2658.009,2660.114,Well he didn't know where he was.
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2660.114,2664.858,"No, I mean after they talked to him, they got him at the new house."
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2664.858,2665.416,That's correct.
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2665.416,2669.696,"And they started to talk to him down there, could've they have then called the officer to come out and talk to him?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2669.696,2677.41,Yes and that would've meant that they detained him in the street or in somebody's house for the same period of time while the officer is coming downtown.
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2681.207,2693.283,"There's a lot of difference between being questioned in your room, in your living room and being questioned in the detention room in the middle of a place where you haven't got a single friend, isn't there?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2693.283,2695.488,"There certainly is Your Honor, however please consider the facts."
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2695.488,2698.502,"That's why you take him down there, isn't it?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2698.502,2699.947,"Well, let us consider the facts here."
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2711.394,2712.743,I didn't say that.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2712.743,2716.027,"I know you didn't Your Honor, but under the facts of this case that's what it amounts to."
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2716.027,2724.115,"Well, on the facts of this case, couldn't they have called the man and had him come out there and sat in the police car?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2724.115,2725.288,Yes they could've.
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2735.856,2737.697,An open room?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2739.362,2740.818,What I mean is it's a large room with a desk and a table.
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2740.818,2742.61,It's an open room?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2742.61,2744.496,I didn't mean unlocked.
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2833.573,2834.73,Cole was in jail?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2834.73,2836.999,He was Your Honor.
1978.78-5066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2954.618,2964.857,Say you have reasonable suspicion may you bring a person in against his will for fingerprinting?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2964.857,2974.355,"Well, if you have reasonable suspicion I cannot answer you directly, I don't think so, but I would suggest that there you can get a warrant because there's provision for it."
1978.78-5066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2977.069,2980.598,How can you get a warrant on reasonable suspicion?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,2980.598,2991.113,I believe that that is considered less intrusive if you have -- if I recollect -- if I recall correctly in Davis that this Court condemned dragnet procedures.
1978.78-5066,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3003.819,3008.544,Because maybe then there would be probable cause?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3008.544,3012.907,Well I think the question posited was that there was not probable cause.
1978.78-5066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3012.907,3014.23,Just reasonable suspicion.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3014.23,3015.31,Just reasonable suspicion.
1978.78-5066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.31,3027.568,"I take it your supreme -- your Court of Appeals thinks a person should be able to be, then you think that it should be able to be briefly detained for certain purposes on less than probable cause merely reasonable suspicion?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3027.568,3028.44,That is correct.
1978.78-5066,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3028.44,3036.842,How about a lineup face -- or calling him in for a lineup based on reasonable suspicion but not on probable cause?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3036.842,3048.161,"Well a lineup presents an altogether different problem, because with a lineup you have a live witness, somebody who could identify him and if you have a live witness there are other ways that you can make the same identification."
1978.78-5066,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3053.017,3058.121,"Well but, you see, you can just bring him down but supposing he doesn't want to come?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3058.121,3069.259,"No, forgive me Your Honor what I meant was assuming that I am the suspect, the reasonably suspected person, bring the victim down at some (Inaudible) you say, “You see anybody you know” where you know that the defendant, myself in this case would."
1978.78-5066,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3072.796,3073.044,Well but suppose the --
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3073.044,3075.241,But then don't you have -- its your problem?
1978.78-5066,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3076.595,3086.759,As Justice Stevens says suppose the victim is somewhat fugacious as the number of these -- rather the suspect is.He isn't going to show up regularly at any one place.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3086.759,3089.488,Well I'm trying to ask you a specific question.
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3097.267,3100.696,"But what if they could have any questions, fingerprinting and all?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3100.696,3102.458,Well you may be correct.
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3133.951,3135.704,"Mr. Bessler, can I just ask this?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3135.704,3135.869,Yes.
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3135.869,3146.519,Do you therefore interpret the rule as one that relates only to bringing a suspect in for questioning and does not extend to bringing him in for a lineup or for fingerprinting?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3150.05,3158.121,"That lineup cases have always found a way to get a court order, the ones I'm familiar with, and so the question is never been directly answered."
1978.78-5066,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3188.614,3194.763,"That's a question about -- where your Fourth Amendment rights are protected, that's a whole issue."
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3194.763,3203.992,"Well they have said, that under those circumstances that is reasonable and they have merely added what I consider another dimension to the definition of the word reasonable."
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3218.196,3237.76,"Well in that -- then I take it under the Morales case, if you had the facts as in Terry, the police could not only have stopped the gentleman for a brief -- they could've taken him down to the station then?"
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3237.76,3238.871,No I disagree Your Honor.
1978.78-5066,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3238.871,3238.928,Why then?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3238.928,3240.21,Because no crime had been committed.
1978.78-5066,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3244.526,3248.281,"Crime had been committed in (Inaudible), carrying a weapon."
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3248.281,3252.377,"No, but --I understand that Your Honor but that's not the type of crime they're talking about."
1978.78-5066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3269.015,3277.009,Where there's reasonable -- where there's some suspicion that the person they're detaining is involved in the crime?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3277.009,3282.839,"Either as a witness or possibly as a defendant, where they have reason to believe that he's involved and --"
1978.78-5066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3282.839,3285.057,Even a witness then?
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3285.057,3286.187,Yes.
1978.78-5066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3286.187,3291.442,Even though they don't suspect him of being witness at all but just knowing something about it -- I mean suspect him of being the criminal --
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3291.442,3300.908,"It's so close I don't know of a case that separate it, because usually if you know about you maybe an accomplice, although perhaps not chargeable with the full crime under investigation."
1978.78-5066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3317.283,3333.755,"But in this case, where -- I take it, we're on the -- we proceed on the assumption that there was not probable cause to believe that Dunaway was involved in the crime, or that he knew anything about it, probable cause, there was less than probable cause?"
1978.78-5066,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3333.755,3334.433,That's right.
1978.78-5066,1,35468,melvin_bessler,,3334.433,3338.866,"That is correct, that's conceded."
1978.78-5066,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3339.999,3342.443,Do you have anything further Mr. Nowak?
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3342.443,3346.713,Yes Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.78-5066,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3365.41,3367.093,Page 68?
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3367.093,3370.463,"A 58, page 58 of the appendix --"
1978.78-5066,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3370.463,3370.953,Not where --
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3370.953,3378.967,"-- the second answer from the bottom, it states “They knew just as much about the case as I did.”"
1978.78-5066,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3422.185,3424.428,And what's your view on these facts?
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3453.903,3458.178,I think your question is pointing out what if the police are acting in good faith when they're trying to execute at that --
1978.78-5066,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3458.178,3463.343,Is there any difference between that situation and when they're acting under a statute that is presumably --
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3463.343,3474.464,"If we can presume, which I still would contest that Morales is the law then I would say that if that is a factor to consider in -- and possibly whether or not there's a sufficient attenuation of the case."
1978.78-5066,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3474.464,3478.279,Well how was it -- wasn't that theory is completely rejected in Almeida-Sanchez?
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3478.279,3480.432,It -- well it was rejected in that case --
1978.78-5066,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3480.432,3481.352,"Completely, there's a statute --"
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3481.352,3481.862,-- as well as I believe in --
1978.78-5066,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3481.862,3484.794,-- there was a statute that expressly allowed the search of that case.
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3484.794,3495.5,"That's correct, but beyond that good faith alone should not be an excuse to the Fourth Amendment, and I think this Court has repeatedly held that in many cases including Henry."
1978.78-5066,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3495.5,3498.758,"But in any event this particular kind of argument, I take it, it wasn't made in the state court?"
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3498.758,3515.498,"I don't believe that it was, but even if it was, the -- as I am saying that -- what we're trying to prevent here, the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule and my position is that we should not make our citizens prove that they are innocent to the police when they are only reasonably suspected of criminal activity."
1978.78-5066,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3550.951,3557.354,"At the police station, I recall, he drew some diagrams of the place where the crime had been committed."
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3557.354,3564.154,"Minutes -- while he was confessing, they asked him if he would show them how what he means and he did, and the trial court as well said, that has to be suppressed."
1978.78-5066,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3568.905,3581.461,But did I understand you in your argument in chief to concede that his statements and the drawing of the diagram of the room were voluntary?
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3581.461,3587.89,"They were voluntary for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, in that they were voluntary because he was read his rights and he waived them."
1978.78-5066,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3593.043,3594.834,"Mr. Nowak, one small question."
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3606.375,3608.511,"I'm not sure that it would, I think --"
1978.78-5066,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3608.511,3609.504,He'd in custody --
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3609.504,3611.721,"-- he would be seized, he would be seized."
1978.78-5066,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3616.87,3621.7,"Yes, I would take -- let me get the statement of course in the car, it would still be the same sequence."
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3621.7,3622.91,"As long as they are in the car, correct."
1978.78-5066,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3622.91,3623.255,Right.
1978.78-5066,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3623.255,3639.854,"Well back it up one stage more, suppose standing on the sidewalk they began this conversation and then gave him the Miranda warning and then he did there all the things that he did downtown, what would be your answer there?"
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3639.854,3641.145,A whole different situation.
1978.78-5066,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3675.982,3677.309,I think I have it.
1978.78-5066,2,22894,edward_j_nowak,,3677.309,3679.269,-- so that it might it might be -- thank you.
1978.78-5066,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3679.269,3679.945,Thank you gentlemen.
