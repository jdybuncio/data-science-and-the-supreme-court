1983.82-1041,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,80.035,"Mr. Riggs, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,80.035,83.07,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.82-1041,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,155.166,160.42,"Would it make any difference in your view if these were term notes, not demand notes?"
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,160.42,162.356,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1041,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,162.356,163.689,Why?
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,163.689,169.36,The major case is Berkman in the United States Tax Court.
1983.82-1041,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,199.029,207.985,"Mr. Riggs, when you responded to the Chief's question about term notes, does that imply a term note at no interest?"
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,207.985,208.685,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1041,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.247,346.458,"Mr. Riggs, were tax lawyers advising their clients that the position you espouse is correct before the Crown case?"
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,346.458,354.212,"Justice O'Connor, I don't know how they were advising their clients."
1983.82-1041,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,379.93,393.253,"It goes to your second point, about the reasonable expectation of taxpayers, and I wondered whether that is essentially post-Crown decisions effects."
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,393.253,394.622,"No, ma'am."
1983.82-1041,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,417.138,434.064,"Well, I suppose a great many intra-family loans can be made without tax consequences under the provisions for the annual giving without tax consequences and the cumulative life exemption."
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,434.064,434.766,"Yes, ma'am."
1983.82-1041,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,452.478,456.946,Do you have to file a return if you make gifts that are within the exclusion?
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,456.946,458.465,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1041,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,458.465,463.6,"Now, let me put a hypothetical to you."
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,484.763,492.786,"No, sir, not unless you add something into the Gift Tax Code that has never been there before."
1983.82-1041,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,563.282,566.584,Let me carry the hypothetical one step beyond that.
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,583.196,584.496,No question about it.
1983.82-1041,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,590.1,608.244,"Well, what's the difference in terms of real estate transactions in the law of real estate between a lease which conveys part of the property, the use of the property, and the property itself?"
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,608.244,615.065,"The great difference, Your Honor, is the common law on which the statute is superimposed."
1983.82-1041,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,684.727,700.737,"Mr. Riggs, do I correctly understand your argument essentially to be that if Congress had wanted to tax this as a gift it should have said so specifically, expressly?"
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,700.737,704.741,"That's close, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1983.82-1041,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,719.65,735.51,"I thought you said among your three... I gather your third point was that this isn't really any job for either the Court or the Executive, that this is for the Congress to straighten out?"
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,735.51,736.16,"--Yes, sirree."
1983.82-1041,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,737.426,743.914,"Well, you know, in preparing for this oral argument I ran across this."
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,746.182,747.116,Certainly.
1983.82-1041,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,747.116,752.186,It's a statement by a very respected authority on federal taxation:
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,780.439,786.759,"Justice Brennan, I share your appreciation for that authority."
1983.82-1041,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,839.477,842.143,"Mr. Riggs, I want to be sure."
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,845.881,846.514,"--Oh, yes, sir."
1983.82-1041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,846.514,849.433,"Mr. Riggs, back up a minute."
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,856.42,857.17,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,857.17,859.372,--How about an IOU?
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,859.372,873.632,"Well, I don't understand an IOU, Justice Marshall, to be any more than, without any other facts, than simply an open account loan, which amounts to a non-interest bearing demand loan."
1983.82-1041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,873.632,875.549,Is there any case on it?
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,875.549,876.834,I beg your pardon?
1983.82-1041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,876.834,878.351,Is there any case on it?
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,878.351,886.022,"No, sir, I don't know of any of the present litigation that simply referred to the obligation as an IOU."
1983.82-1041,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,888.908,895.378,"And a note that doesn't have a term specified is due on demand, isn't it?"
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,895.378,895.995,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1041,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,920.696,928.033,Let me carry an earlier hypothetical yet a third step.
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,937.789,940.741,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1041,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,940.741,944.228,Taxable as a gift?
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,944.228,950.132,You have now the term.
1983.82-1041,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,985.972,987.872,"Let's cut it down to 50 years, then."
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,987.872,991.024,"I don't know where the line is, Your Honor."
1983.82-1041,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,991.024,1001.898,What is the basis for your saying that a lease for a term of years at no rent is not a gift?
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,1001.898,1010.92,"The common law on which the very knowledgeable 1932 Congress superimposed the gift tax, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-1041,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1022.145,1039.69,"And you say that if I own a property in fee simple and give my son or daughter a ten-year lease on it, that that is not a gift?"
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,1039.69,1044.26,There's no borrowing involved.
1983.82-1041,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1064.924,1072.928,"Well, that's the whole definition of a gift, isn't it, the transfer of a property interest without any consideration?"
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,1072.928,1082.634,"--The area in which we're in, Justice Rehnquist, is a transfer for consideration."
1983.82-1041,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1090.203,1112.319,"But I thought your answer to the Chief Justice's question would have indicated that an execution of a lease by a father to a child of say a very valuable property, commercial property, a lease for 20 years free of any rent, wouldn't be a gift."
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,1118.973,1119.657,"No, sir."
1983.82-1041,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.657,1125.861,"Why wouldn't that be a gift of a property interest, as the Justice--"
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,1125.861,1133.732,"I'm having a tough time, Justice White, Justice Rehnquist, about bringing this into our problem, and that is a loan."
1983.82-1041,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.072,1145.207,"--But even if it were, you wouldn't think that would govern this case?"
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,1145.207,1147.392,"--Exactly, Your Honor, exactly."
1983.82-1041,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1147.392,1176.411,"But the Solicitor General has cited a number of cases, has he not, dealing with cases arising out of charitable deductions for contributions to charities, where the right to use property for a given period of time rent-free has been treated as a transfer of property for that purpose?"
1983.82-1041,0,24544,frank_p_riggs,,1181.197,1185.767,"In the charitable contributions area, yes."
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1566.666,1577.605,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.82-1041,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1742.512,1748.566,"Well, but it applies, your principle applies, to far different situations than that, Mr. Wallace, doesn't it?"
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1763.826,1766.878,"That is correct, that would be a gift."
1983.82-1041,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.782,1777.935,"So I mean, we're not talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax planning alone."
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1801.701,1803.903,--That is correct.
1983.82-1041,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1803.903,1808.022,"And when you get into the property area, I'm troubled by where one draws the line."
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1845.647,1854.769,"Well, there are many difficult questions under the gift tax law, many of which will remain, however this case is decided."
1983.82-1041,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1953.582,1955.301,"Well, how is it theoretically any different?"
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1955.301,1965.49,"It has to be looked at in terms of the purpose of the gift tax, which was to supplement the estate tax."
1983.82-1041,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2011.019,2017.606,How did the transfers in this case defeat the application of the gift tax... or of the estate tax?
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2017.606,2018.489,Of the estate tax.
1983.82-1041,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.875,2053.779,"Well, then it must follow from that that the donor has some sort of a duty to invest, to build up his estate so the Government can get a big tax bite out of it."
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2053.779,2070.223,"That doesn't have to follow, in our view, because our theory of the gift is not that the donor has foregone an accumulation to his estate and that constitutes the gift."
1983.82-1041,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2142.855,2147.74,"Mr. Wallace, how would a taxpayer know when to file a tax return?"
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2151.191,2156.179,"Well, only with good tax advice, the same as--"
1983.82-1041,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2156.179,2159.864,I'd hate to be his tax lawyer.
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2164.451,2178.611,--The gifts have to accumulate to a certain sum per person before there is any responsibility to file a gift tax return.
1983.82-1041,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2207.278,2221.938,"Mr. Wallace, what happens if you give your son $250,000 with a demand note and he keeps it for three years, and then you fall out with him and you tell him, pay up?"
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2228.042,2232.079,"Well, it certainly was a gift in our view."
1983.82-1041,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2232.079,2234.281,It was a gift as long as you're a nice boy.
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2238.499,2244.803,We've never said that the gift is the gift of the principal and that that's the measure of the gift.
1983.82-1041,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2251.641,2253.159,He'd have to pay for the three years.
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2253.159,2254.509,For the three years.
1983.82-1041,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2254.509,2255.795,But not the last year.
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2255.795,2266.151,For as long as he was allowed the right to use it and to generate whatever income he could from it by whatever means he chose.
1983.82-1041,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2276.124,2281.512,"My only point was, if he had been a nice boy he would still... no gift."
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2281.512,2285.63,"Well, he would still have the same gift."
1983.82-1041,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2296.355,2302.176,"So he gives him this $250,000 every year, under your theory?"
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2302.176,2311.114,"He gives it initially, but it's an ongoing gift for as long as he forebears asking for repayment of it."
1983.82-1041,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2311.114,2315.149,"Not of the principal, just of the reasonable interest, the going rate."
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2315.149,2319.185,"The value of getting the use of that money, the right to use it."
1983.82-1041,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2319.185,2345.003,"Under the Government's point of view, Mr. Wallace, is there any difference really between... and I'm now speaking of an adult son, not one who has a claim for support... between lending $100, we'll say, and lending $100,000, except that IRS has more important things to do than going after gift taxes on the $100 gift?"
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2345.003,2348.221,"Well, that's right, and there's a yearly exclusion."
1983.82-1041,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2348.221,2350.406,"But they could as a matter of principle, from your point of view?"
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2350.406,2361.964,"If the rest of the exclusion were consumed with other gifts, they could as a matter of principle say that this is the little bit that put you over the top and there's a gift tax liability for it."
1983.82-1041,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2361.964,2363.747,"I'm sorry, Mr. Wallace."
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2369.368,2383.461,He's required to file a return if he has made gifts during the year that reach the level that is not excluded.
1983.82-1041,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2383.461,2390.781,"Let me ask you a question based on something of personal experience, perhaps."
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2431.089,2438.361,"Well, $1,000 per year is excluded from the gift tax."
1983.82-1041,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2438.361,2440.83,But how about... what's the total you can give to any one?
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2451.852,2451.935,"That is right, that is right."
1983.82-1041,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2451.935,2453.768,So you're talking about big dollars.
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2453.768,2465.176,"We're talking about big dollars before you incur any gift tax liability, unless you have given those big dollars in other ways and this is the amount that would put you over the top."
1983.82-1041,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2466.06,2476.317,"Mr. Wallace, the Service did not seek review in either the Johnson or Crown cases, did it?"
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2476.317,2484.323,"Well, we didn't seek review beyond the Court of Appeals level in the Crown case, because we had no conflict in the circuits at that time."
1983.82-1041,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2484.323,2486.039,Is that the reason for it?
1983.82-1041,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2486.039,2487.775,That is correct.
1983.82-1041,2,24544,frank_p_riggs,,3456.852,3461.522,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1041,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3590.257,3593.443,"May I ask, Mr. Riggs--"
1983.82-1041,2,24544,frank_p_riggs,,3593.443,3593.993,"Yes, sir, Justice."
1983.82-1041,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3593.993,3604.834,--The Chief Justice asked Mr. Wallace about the loan of securities as collateral for the donee's loan.
1983.82-1041,2,24544,frank_p_riggs,,3607.384,3618.474,"Your Honor, I know there's a case that's held exactly that it is not a gift, and I was trying with my co-counsel desperately to find it when it came up, but I cannot recall it."
1983.82-1041,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3622.676,3639.387,"Would you take the position that, say, a taxpayer in a high income bracket could turn over a portfolio of securities to someone else and say, I'm just loaning these to you and you just keep the income, and then when I want them back you give them back to me, there'd be no gift?"
1983.82-1041,2,24544,frank_p_riggs,,3639.387,3641.253,"Well, may I add one more thing?"
1983.82-1041,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3643.689,3645.541,"Returnable on demand, yes."
