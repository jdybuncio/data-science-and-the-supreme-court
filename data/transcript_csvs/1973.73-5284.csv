1973.73-5284,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.243,-- you may proceed whenever you are ready.
1973.73-5284,0,39217,robert_h_friebert,,8.243,11.813,Mr. Chief Justice and If it please the Court.
1973.73-5284,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,254.367,263.194,"I have the impression that somewhere in the record, the United States Attorney had referred to the youth -- the Act was at the arraignment?"
1973.73-5284,0,39217,robert_h_friebert,,263.194,267.176,"Yes, the Act was referred to twice at the arraignment."
1973.73-5284,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,392.846,400.063,"But you’ve already said or at least I thought I heard you say that if you’ve been sentence the Youth Corrections Act, he might have got as much as six years?"
1973.73-5284,0,39217,robert_h_friebert,,400.063,401.932,Correct.
1973.73-5284,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,404.532,426.584,"Mr. Friebert, before you carry on, suppose the court had stated either on the record or in it is order that if found that the youth offender would not benefit from the remedies provided by the Act, but stated no reasons for his findings, what would your position be?"
1973.73-5284,0,39217,robert_h_friebert,,426.584,438.815,"Mr. Justice Powell, I would still be here saying that that was an insufficient record that you would have to support his findings with appropriate reasons."
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1866.912,1869.561,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1921.415,1931.351,Do we know Mr. Norton under what -- the Trial Judge at anytime say I am not going to sentence under the Youth Corrections Act?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1931.351,1933.502,The sequence was this.
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1962.852,1964.296,So we -- and well --
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1964.296,1966.528,"At later point, when the --"
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1966.528,1972.001,"So at the time of sentence in any event, he did not say I am sentencing under the Act or I am not sentencing him?"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1972.001,1972.816,That’s correct.
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1972.816,1973.617,Right.
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1973.617,1994.945,"And then at the later point when the sentence was challenge, he ruled that he disagreed with the District of Columbia cases that said that there had to be an explicit finding and his determination that petitioner should not be sentence under the Act was essentially implicit in his sentencing him as an adult under probation."
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1994.945,2000.602,So he referred to what he did at the time of sentence as an interpretation -- as a sentence outside of the Act?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2000.602,2001.028,That’s right.
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2013.354,2027.934,"Did I understand you are trying to say that the sentencing hearing and the preliminary hearing were at the same time, that this was a telescope preceding?"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2027.934,2030.612,"Yes sir, as the recess, but I think --"
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2030.612,2035.871,But the Rule 10 hearing is when he was actually attempted to sentence him.
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2039.466,2040.392,"No, no."
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2046.597,2051.255,And that’s where the discussion of the Youth Correction Act occurred by the United States Attorney?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2051.255,2052.491,That’s correct.
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2052.491,2053.216,So that --
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2053.216,2055.054,And also by the petitioner’s own Attorney.
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2055.054,2062.789,"Yes, but there is no question that the subject matter of the Youth Corrections Act was brought to the attention of the judge at that time?"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2062.789,2065.226,"That’s correct, no dispute."
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2093.817,2111.197,"There is one case in the District of Columbia Circuit where on a guilty plea, a sentence was imposed under the Youth Corrections Act and it was reversed on appeal because it had not been dispose to him that there was a six-year potential under that Act?"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2111.197,2112.703,"Yes, in the Carter case--"
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2112.703,2113.886,Is that Carter?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2113.886,2118.671,I’m aware of that and the question there was really twofold.
1973.73-5284,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2218.789,2229.636,"Is there any showing in the record that on the day of sentence, the judge did or did not consider this on that day?"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2229.636,2230.478,"Well, yes."
1973.73-5284,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2237.277,2241.793,What time spent was in there?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2241.793,2242.812,I am not sure.
1973.73-5284,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.84,2268.771,"I still have great problem as to whether he -- I mean, apart the one we assume he did, but wouldn’t it be better if the record showed that I have considered this in and are find that this man does not qualified for it and therefore, I am not going to give it to him."
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2273.721,2287.175,"Well, we say that there are reasons that such a requirement might be desirable but on the other hand, some courts have noted that there are reasons why it maybe undesirable for the court to state --"
1973.73-5284,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2287.175,2292.915,How do you show that he made this finding?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2294.34,2302.067,"Well, just as show in many other instances that a finding has been made where is a precondition to further action --"
1973.73-5284,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2302.067,2302.824,Like what?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2302.824,2308.806,It is implicit in the alternative action taken by the court.
1973.73-5284,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2318.413,2325.763,If we overdo that presumption of the regularity in criminal cases brought up in Fifth Amendment.
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2341.966,2347.711,"Well, our position is not one of objection to such a requirement necessarily."
1973.73-5284,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2350.46,2354.735,Would you object to it or not?
1973.73-5284,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2354.735,2364.907,"Well, I think -- but I take it that you're not here to state whether you object to something or not, you are here to present the government's case and to answer arguments about what the government’s position is?"
1973.73-5284,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2364.907,2373.871,Well what is the government position as to whether or not the judge should make a “finding?”
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2373.871,2402.664,"Well, the statute provides that the judge has four options under the Act, and it is our position that Congress intended and this is amply demonstrated by the legislative history of the judges who proposed the Act that the judge would have complete discretion in determining how to sentence a youth offender, and that the use of the word find, it is not finding incidentally, it is find."
1973.73-5284,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2433.275,2437.78,So your answer is not required to make a finding?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2437.78,2444.085,"That’s right, but I was speaking only to the statement that we had made a concession."
1973.73-5284,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.053,2462.057,What chances do I get?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2468.469,2476.877,"Well, we are saying that in some cases, it might be necessary to spell it out and another there maybe other indications in the record that would make an explicit finding unnecessary."
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2476.877,2506.323,"Mr. Norton, does this record show, I will go back to the question I put to you before, does this record show that on the day of the hearing which was both hearing under Rule 10 or an arraignment and a sentencing hearing that before the judgment out to read the pre-sentence report, both the prosecutor and the defense counsel had discussed and called to the court’s attention the existence of the Youth Corrections Act?"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2506.323,2514.828,The prosecutor had definitely -- I am not sure whether defense counsel’s reference to a came before or after the recess.
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2514.828,2518.436,"(Voice Overlap) before the judge pronounced the sentence, both counsel --"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2518.436,2519.373,That is correct.
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2519.373,2522.178,-- had called this attention to this in oral argument?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2522.178,2524.507,That’s correct.
1973.73-5284,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2524.507,2573.324,"In connection with that question from the Chief Justice, on page 13 of the appendix as I read it, I wish you to whether this is right or not, following the recess and after the parties have come back into the court, counsel for the defendant and the very last thing he said to the court after stating the extenuating circumstances including the hedge and family situation of the defendant concluded by saying and I would ask that he be placed under probation on probation under the Youth Corrections Act and the court then proceeded with the formal sentence."
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2573.324,2575.058,"That is correct and that was after the recess, the recess is indicated on --"
1973.73-5284,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2575.058,2589.483,"Prior to the recess, the United States Attorney said to the judge and this is on page six that you may also be subject to the Federal Youth Corrections Act?"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2589.483,2591.409,That is correct.
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2591.409,2592.475,Page six?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2592.475,2600.601,Six and the recess is indicated at page 11 and then the sentencing followed immediately thereafter.
1973.73-5284,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2600.601,2609.555,Did not we hear earlier that there was some misstatement that the Youth Corrections Act had a maximum sentence of one year?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2609.555,2622.069,"Well, the statement was that the petitioner was asked if he was aware of the maximum penalty for the offense and he stated yes, it was one year and that is true."
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2718.279,2735.957,(Inaudible) Mr. Norton or is this the government’s position that you never get to any of these issues under (d) or anything else under the Youth Offenders Statute until the judge decides that he is going to sentence him under that statute.
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2747.992,2751.387,"That is correct and that is what subjection (d) does, it provides (voice overlap)"
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2751.387,2766.606,"Really, it seems to me when you parse the statute down, (a) which permits probation, the judge decides “well, I am going to sentence under this Act.”"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2793.203,2795.308,That is true; we do not think that --
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2795.308,2808.976,"If that’s so Mr. Norton [Attempt to Laughter], it just strikes me that if the judge has the option to use the statute or not, you do not get any of these questions until he decides he is going to use the statute?"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2808.976,2813.481,"Well, we do not see that you have to get into any of these questions at all."
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2834.377,2850.925,"Right now, and if we do not agree with that position and agree with yours that the judge was free to use this or not and that on this record, he decided that he would not use the statute, why is it not the end of the case without ever giving of the question whether there have to be findings under (d) or not?"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2850.925,2867.862,"Well, that is our position basically that the case is -- the question presented is one of whether such explicit findings are required and whether it must be a company by statement of reasons."
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2992.31,3000.567,"(Inaudible) case where on the record that appeared, I haven’t read that decision that it appeared then in fact the sentencing was under the statute?"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3000.567,3007.389,No the DC. Circuit cases have all -- the recent ones have all involved adult sentences.
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3042.898,3054.566,(Voice Overlap) is that been under an interpretation of this statute as the statute which must if applicable be used in the sentencing a youth offender?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3054.566,3055.497,That is right.
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3062.59,3070.263,Is that not the conflict on which the certiorari was sought whether it governed our decision or not?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3072.59,3078.137,That is the basic conflict between the court below and the DC Circuit.
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3097.775,3104.225,Has the Campbell Case in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia been reviewed by the Local Court of Appeals?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3104.225,3106.229,I do not know their current status.
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3157.14,3162.142,(Inaudible) Now on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals rather than the United States of Columbia?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3162.142,3164.21,"Now, this is in the US Court of Appeals."
1973.73-5284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3183.924,3190.607,But how about requiring a finding?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3190.607,3191.687,Well in that same case --
1973.73-5284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3191.687,3195.419,(Voice overlap) haven’t they said they will require finding?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3195.419,3208.737,"In the same case, the Reed case that Judge Riley’s opinion said that in some cases, it may not be necessary for the judge to make an explicit finding."
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3272.997,3288.524,"This -- the decision which the judge makes at that time, the choice of options basically different in anyway from the decision to place the defendant, a convicted person on probation or not to place him on probation?"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3288.524,3295.704,Essentially no and that this is a fundamental distinction between this case and say the Spectre case.
1973.73-5284,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3326.489,3343.48,"When he sentences the defendant after reviewing the pre-sentence reports and hearing and reading emaciation exercise, he imposes the sentence of for two to six years, by implication he has rejected probation, is that not so?"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3343.48,3346.489,That is certainly true.
1973.73-5284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3414.861,3418.94,He never was committed to the Attorney General for that purpose?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3418.94,3420.966,"For that purpose, no and --"
1973.73-5284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3420.966,3422.29,He was just put in the jail?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3422.29,3422.975,That is right.
1973.73-5284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3441.955,3447.117,Is this what the pre-sentence report recommended or do you know?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3447.117,3448.239,I do not know.
1973.73-5284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3448.239,3451.914,You do not know whether the pre-sentence report recommended treatment as an adult?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3451.914,3453.12,I am not able to answer.
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3571.498,3575.413,"In case to Mr. Norton, this was a young college student, wasn’t he, second year in college?"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3575.413,3576.296,That is correct.
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3576.296,3580.722,"Only time he have ever had any difficulty in his life, is that right?"
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3580.722,3582.504,I am not sure about the prior (Voice overlap)
1973.73-5284,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3582.504,3584.745,How does the record show?
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3584.745,3594.197,And I would suppose the judge would decide I will give him -- I have to give him something but I will be as lenient as I can be and so he gave him 90 days plus probation.
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3594.197,3596.062,That would be my reading of the situation.
1973.73-5284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3596.062,3604.889,That this was not the kind of offender who ought to be or who needed to be sent to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment for four to six years?
1973.73-5284,1,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3604.889,3611.559,"That is right and two more years of probation, he would -- after two years of probation, he would be out college and so."
