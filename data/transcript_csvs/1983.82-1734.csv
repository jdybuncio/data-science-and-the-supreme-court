1983.82-1734,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,43.077,44.362,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1734,1,30862,john_e_hawtrey,,846.996,873.563,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think before we can determine that there is an impermissible classification in this particular case, there's at least six questions that have to be answered in favor of the petitioner's position... the first one being, and probably the most important... is what relationship was before the trial court?"
1983.82-1734,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.977,980.583,"May I just ask, Mr. Hawtrey, if the parent-new spouse relationship is secondary, as you argue, it nevertheless was what controlled the decision in this case, wasn't it?"
1983.82-1734,1,30862,john_e_hawtrey,,980.583,989.522,--I believe that the position of the petitioner is that it controlled in this case.
1983.82-1734,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,989.522,990.839,"Well, isn't that what the trial judge said?"
1983.82-1734,1,30862,john_e_hawtrey,,990.839,993.891,I differ from that opinion.
1983.82-1734,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.663,1083.246,I must say I'm puzzled.
1983.82-1734,1,30862,john_e_hawtrey,,1111.182,1114.467,I think it influenced his decision--
1983.82-1734,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.467,1120.221,"Well, then, isn't it... don't we have the question whether it is a proper factor for him to have considered?"
1983.82-1734,1,30862,john_e_hawtrey,,1121.738,1123.24,--In part.
1983.82-1734,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1125.525,1127.894,What was the primary part?
1983.82-1734,1,30862,john_e_hawtrey,,1127.894,1139.868,"The court... the trial court's primary, in our opinion, the primary feeling was that the mother couldn't cope with the new relationship."
1983.82-1734,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1139.868,1144.253,You think he said that in his opinion?
1983.82-1734,1,30862,john_e_hawtrey,,1144.253,1149.223,"I think that that paragraph, when read together as a single paragraph, says that."
1983.82-1734,2,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,2541.174,2547.614,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless one of the members of the Court has another question from me, I don't have any further comments."
1983.82-1734,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2547.614,2549.63,"Thank you, gentlemen."
