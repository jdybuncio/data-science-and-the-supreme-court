1958.581,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,12.096,"Number 581, William W. Burns, Petitioner, versus State of Ohio."
1958.581,0,28405,helen_g_washington,,16.548,22.849,"May it please the Court, my argument will be very brief."
1958.581,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,386.443,392.183,Mr. Vance.
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,392.183,397.749,"Mr. Chief Justice and justices, please the Court."
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,565.303,567.949,What was the date of conviction?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,567.949,577.815,"The date of the conviction, if it please the Court, was in 1953."
1958.581,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,583.987,592.343,"If he had the $20 and had paid it to the Court, would he have been properly before the Supreme Court?"
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,592.343,598.884,"He would not because he had not, before doing that, notified the prosecuting attorney."
1958.581,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,601.586,606.337,Is that problem construed that way by your Supreme Court?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,606.337,620.078,"I don't know, if it please the Court, whether that question has ever been raised, because I think that just routinely the prosecuting attorney is notified, before they file the motion."
1958.581,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,620.078,623.809,Do they have to file notice before they appeal to your Court of Appeal?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,623.809,624.5,No.
1958.581,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,624.5,627.589,And then another one to -- before he appeals to the Supreme Court.
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,627.589,628.371,That is correct.
1958.581,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,628.371,630.173,They have to file both times?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,630.173,632.127,"Yes, with the prosecution."
1958.581,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,632.127,633.266,Alright.
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,634.285,635.621,That is correct.
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,635.621,638.731,You have to get permission don't you?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,638.731,640.655,Get permission of the prosecuting attorney?
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,640.655,642.359,"No, no, no, the Supreme Court or --"
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,642.359,647.006,"Oh yes, what he attempted to do, file is nothing but a motion for leave â€“"
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,647.006,647.672,Yes.
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,647.672,653.739,"-- a motion for leave, and there is no matter of right involved in this case at all."
1958.581,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,653.739,677.94,"But what I'm -- my point is does he have to -- suppose he had the money, he has already filed one with notice to the prosecuting attorney under his original appeal, now when he seeks to go to the Supreme Court, if he had $20 and paid it, would he have to file another notice with the prosecuting attorney?"
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,677.94,682.771,"Right, I take it from the statute if Your Honor please he would, because that reason is as follows."
1958.581,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,682.771,684.45,Is that the practice in your state?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,684.45,686.197,Yes it is a practice.
1958.581,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,696.286,698.951,But did he serve it on the prosecuting attorney?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,698.951,704.79,"Not in this latest attempt, he did on the first attempt when he abandoned, which he abandoned."
1958.581,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,704.79,711.864,(Inaudible)
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,711.864,712.34,That is correct.
1958.581,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,713.934,716.979,And the court did not consider his application.
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,716.979,718.95,No.
1958.581,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,718.95,720.193,Never got beyond the clerk?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,720.193,723.143,Never got beyond the clerk's office.
1958.581,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,723.143,733.727,(Inaudible)
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,733.727,740.243,"Not in the 1957 attempt, no, although required by statute, he had not done that and hasn't done so yet."
1958.581,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,757.746,768.336,But Mr. Vance this case is not before us (Inaudible) in Ohio that indicates that his failure to serve this notice had anything whatever to do.
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,768.336,769.512,No that's the peculiar thing.
1958.581,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,772.762,779.89,"As far as we know, all that we have is that it was not accepted in the Supreme Court because it was not accompanied by payment of $20."
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,779.89,780.982,"By $20, that's it."
1958.581,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,780.982,790.24,"Well then what significance can we attach to if it's the fact, I assume it must be, that he didn't serve the required statutory notice on the prosecutor?"
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,790.24,796.606,"Well I think that's significance in this, that even if he had sent his $20 he wouldn't have been properly before the Court."
1958.581,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,796.606,800.101,"Well, what significance can we attach to it?"
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,806.667,808.649,I think You Honor is correct.
1958.581,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,808.649,822.775,(Inaudible)
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,822.775,831.568,"I think he probably must because there is nothing except for my statement in the record, to indicate there was that debate, it's in my brief."
1958.581,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,831.568,833.225,The man had no lawyers.
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,833.225,837.23,"He had no lawyers, at his time, in 1957."
1958.581,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,837.23,839.749,(Inaudible)
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,839.749,842.316,That is correct.
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,842.316,848.519,Now is there -- will an appeal lie at any time after the Court of Appeals make an adjunct decision?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,848.519,851.912,Yes we have no time limitation for appeal to the Supreme Court.
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,851.912,852.808,From the Court of Appeals?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,852.808,856.768,That's correct.
1958.581,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,859.608,868.318,Well then why wouldn't the first notice be sufficient?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,868.318,897.851,"I raised that question in my own mind frankly, whether or not the effect of that first notice would carry over, but the statute says that when a motion for leave to file is -- a motion for leave to appeal is filed, a copy of it shall served first upon the prosecuting attorney and that this was not a proceeding on the notice filed back in 1950, but it was an entirely new notice and an entirely new proceeding."
1958.581,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,897.851,904.611,(Inaudible)
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,904.611,912.963,"That is correct and I can say in all candor to this Court that, that was not why the clerk returned the paper."
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,923.559,927.109,"He says that, he says that, the clerk says that what you just (Inaudible)"
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,927.109,928.184,Yes.
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,928.184,939.782,"But was there, clear me up, was there after the Court of Appeals for the first appellate division turned it down (Inaudible), did he then file a notice to the Supreme Court?"
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,939.782,941.796,He did and also served to prosecuting attorney.
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,941.796,943.458,(Inaudible)
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,943.458,944.295,Yeah.
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,944.295,945.594,And anything after that?
1958.581,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,945.594,946.18,What happened to that?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,946.18,947.386,He abandoned.
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,947.386,951.485,"When you say he abandoned, formally or how do you express that?"
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,951.485,954.97,"There was nothing ever -- never filed, there was no transcript brought up for any thing."
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,979.25,984.839,Well he is now worse off than having file something (Inaudible) than if he hadn't done anything and began to file (Inaudible)
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,984.839,987.528,"That is quite true, that's quite true."
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,987.528,1007.184,"So that in view of your actual statute of limitation anybody has been convicted, no matter how far back, the conviction was reviewed in your Courts of Appeals and your appellate courts, it can now file a notice of appeal."
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,1007.184,1012.263,"Yes, and that that is of course what makes it such tremendous importance in the State of Ohio."
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1037.093,1040.249,Is this an estimate of yours or have any statistical basis.
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,1040.249,1042.671,I have no statistical basis.
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1042.671,1063.414,"Therefore the question is how many convictions affirmed in Appellate, your intermediate Appellate court for which review was sought, no reason given and no reason was sought, proceedings cannot be brought saying he didn't -- we couldn't because he didn't have $20."
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,1065.326,1067.686,"That is just my guess, yes, I'm rather --"
1958.581,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1067.686,1078.36,"Well the same thing was said about Griffin when it was here, but I haven't seen that happen in Illinois or the other states --"
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1078.36,1078.775,Not in Illinois but â€“
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,1078.775,1087.657,Of course we think there is a tremendous difference a transcript of testimony which run in to the hundreds of dollars and a $20 filing fee.
1958.581,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1089.674,1095.476,(Inaudible)
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,1095.476,1101.827,"Well it's a lot easy to get $20, than it is to get $2,000 to get a transcript, that's the whole point."
1958.581,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1101.827,1107.731,Did he have a right to -- could he appeal as a matter right?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,1107.731,1109.021,There is no constitution question.
1958.581,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1112.045,1114.168,Well what about from there on?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,1114.168,1123.387,"No he -- unless is there a constitutional question involved, then he can only appeal by leave of court, in a felony case."
1958.581,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1123.387,1125.163,Did he have any constitutional question?
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,1125.163,1128.071,There were none involved in his case.
1958.581,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1128.071,1136.048,"But what's that phrase that you use in Ohio in denying these leaves of appeals, a regular phrase about no constitutional --"
1958.581,1,46452,william_m_vance,,1136.048,1140.109,No debatable constitutional rights involved.
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,1856.088,1857.256,May I please the Court.
1958.581,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1857.256,1860.477,Mr. Schoettmer.
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,1860.477,1883.992,"Counsel suggested that I knew this case personally as of the trial level and however that's just not so, I did not try the case, it's an assistant tried it who is long gone, however it fell upon my shoulders to take it after he left, I have to bury his dead, even though this man is obviously still alive."
1958.581,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1974.836,1976.773,What is the citation for the Wannamaker?
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,1976.773,1977.532,Your Honor --
1958.581,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1977.532,1978.493,It seems to be in the briefs.
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,1978.493,1989.913,"160, it's on page ten of petitioner's brief in the note, 164 Ohio State 174."
1958.581,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2036.536,2047.915,"May I ask the fact, the fact you are telling us that Ohio concedes for the purpose of this case, this Court may treat the letter as the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio."
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,2047.915,2056.087,"I think in effect in the law of the Supreme Court of Ohio that that has to be accepted Your Honor, even though we would love --"
1958.581,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2056.087,2058.953,That is not binding -- I want to ask -- that is binding on us.
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,2065.159,2068.719,"Well, it is a unique position for that reason."
1958.581,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2166.762,2169.959,That wasn't exactly the question I ask.
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,2198.575,2199.451,Not that I know of.
1958.581,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2199.451,2201.164,Yes well that's my only question.
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,2206.466,2212.257,"On that question, but this just establishes our point that much harder and that is this."
1958.581,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2260.094,2267.762,Even though it denies to an indigent person a right that a person with money could have?
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,2267.762,2280.985,You Honor I don't know why it's so necessary to say that money is such a separate and distinct type of condition precedent to any other type of condition that might be put forth.
1958.581,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2299.592,2311.178,"What discrimination have you in mind in which you can classify the granting and the not granting, has the element of time within which you must file it?"
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,2311.178,2313.872,"That's one Your Honor, no this is another."
1958.581,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2313.872,2316.137,(Inaudible)
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,2316.137,2318.854,"Counsel mentioned notice, now let's assume that --"
1958.581,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2318.854,2328.285,"What kind of a distinction is there between -- is there discrimination in any sense of that meaning, that one fellow you must give notice as against the fellow who didn't have to give notice, is that it?"
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,2328.285,2330.966,"That's right and if one does not, then he doesn't get --"
1958.581,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2330.966,2335.941,Is that discrimination in any invidious or hurtful sense?
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,2335.941,2349.513,"Well, I don't think it's invidious or hurtful and I suggest that to Your Honor in the light of my discussion with the Chief Justice in that, in the history of Ohio we've never had that circumstance develop in an appeal, up to this time, up to this man."
1958.581,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2349.513,2354.25,But you didn't have that because you didn't have the Griffin case until recently.
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,2354.25,2354.418,Well --
1958.581,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2354.418,2358.041,The Griffin case didn't make a distinction.
1958.581,2,28002,harry_c_schoettmer,,2363.652,2381.75,"Well, a pauper, what is a pauper as such Your Honor, I know you have -- this Court has declared to what is it, but even here, even in this Court, when you allowed a man to file in a pauper (Inaudible), is he a true pauper?"
1958.581,3,28405,helen_g_washington,,3199.134,3210.719,I don't know whether I ought to get into this view of counsel's concession that the letter of the clerk should be treated as the judgment of the Court.
1958.581,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3232.726,3233.831,"How you know, how do I know?"
1958.581,3,28405,helen_g_washington,,3233.831,3235.362,His letter says so.
1958.581,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3235.362,3266.302,"He simply says this is the regular thing, that you require a filing fee, but the specific problem whether a specific appeal, it then raises the general question whereby a court could say, is it a new problem for us hereafter to indigently establish, he weighs this, was not before the Wanamaker Court and is not to be inferred from the clerk's letter, it is just telling a routine order of (Inaudible)"
1958.581,3,28405,helen_g_washington,,3266.302,3289.305,"Well, the clerk's letter does indicate that the Court has ruled on this question and that he is following that ruling, at least that is my interpretation of it, and I think for practical purposes it has to be treated as the order or the judgment of the Court."
1958.581,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3289.305,3305.448,Mrs. Washington before you sit down I would like to express the appreciation of the Court to you for assuming this responsibility of defending this indigent prisoner.
