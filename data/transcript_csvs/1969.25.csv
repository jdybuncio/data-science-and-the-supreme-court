1969.25,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,64.662,68.68,Mr. Justice Black and may it please the Court.
1969.25,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,488.997,489.633,Go ahead.
1969.25,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,489.633,489.923,Yes.
1969.25,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,522.128,523.523,Mr. Friedman.
1969.25,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,523.523,526.991,Mr. Justice Black and may it please the Court.
1969.25,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,561.578,564.291,The differentials come off the top so to speak?
1969.25,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,564.291,565.447,That's right.
1969.25,1,34594,lawrence_d_hollman,,1893.842,1897.433,"Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court."
1969.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2010.058,2013.329,What differential did you say have been receiving many years?
1969.25,1,34594,lawrence_d_hollman,,2013.329,2023.361,"The nearby differential Mr. Justice Black, that is the farm location differential either under the Massachusetts Rhode Island Milk Marketing Order."
1969.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2023.958,2025.485,Which was how much?
1969.25,1,34594,lawrence_d_hollman,,2025.485,2030.184,Which was 46 cents and 23 cents Your Honor.46 cents?Right.
1969.25,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2413.312,2422.171,"Is the voting one farmer, one vote, or does it depends upon the size of his herd or the amount of his acreage?"
1969.25,1,34594,lawrence_d_hollman,,2422.171,2430.982,My understanding Your Honor is that the system the Secretary employs is one-farmer-one-vote by referendum and approving these orders.
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,3474.871,3478.302,Mr. Justice Black and members of the Court.
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3554.741,3561.737,"So, the percentage under the old regime was nearby producers for something about 8% or so?"
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,3561.737,3562.53,That's correct.
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3562.53,3564.662,"And now, the percentage is what?"
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,3564.662,3566.328,Approximately one third.
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3768.212,3771.434,You're not referring to the order that's before us to this case?
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,3771.434,3773.029,"Not in this case, no Your Honor."
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3773.029,3774.544,"Yet you're talking about the Connecticut, are you?"
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,3774.544,3780.181,I'm talking about how that it exist and only one other order out about 75 in the countries --
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3780.181,3783.742,And it did exist under New Jersey order but that was not out in the Blair case.
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,3783.742,3785.227,That is correct Your Honor.
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3796.452,3800.741,"This order covers the State of Connecticut and powered also, doesn't it?"
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,3800.741,3804.023,That is one reason why I brought in the Connecticut order.
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3804.023,3805.201,That's what confuses --
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,3805.201,3806.796,"Yes, it is very confusing."
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3877.553,3884.028,"No, but do not all of State of Connecticut as I read it, its east of the Connecticut River plus the towns of Grandview and Sophia."
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,3884.028,3888.072,"Yes, that is in respect to the order that presently considering."
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3896.119,3897.566,That's Connecticut market?
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,3897.566,3904.947,That's correct and those are the only two milk orders in United States that have this particular provision.
1969.25,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3904.947,3921.497,Are their any groups of these farmers who contend that the order has writing or has change by the Court of Appeals will cause them to be compelled to sell their milk at a lowest.
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,3921.497,3924.536,As a result of the Court of Appeals decision?
1969.25,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3924.536,3925.332,Yes.
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,3925.332,3942.0,"No, and in fact, it's my contention and I think this would be substantiated that most nearby dairy farmers are not desirers of exacting this penalty payment from their fellow dairy farmers."
1969.25,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3963.698,3968.756,"But is it true then for instance, what I'm trying to get at is, actual effect on it."
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,3984.02,3985.227,Not under our view.
1969.25,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4016.358,4018.394,Which group do you represent?
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4018.394,4023.454,"Well, we represent by a class action order that was contested in the District Court."
1969.25,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4025.727,4026.765,Distant producers.
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4026.765,4030.428,"Approximately 6,500 dairy farmers and after --"
1969.25,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4030.428,4041.093,And there's no claim on your part because I understand it that whether this Court of Appeals order stands or not.
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4047.66,4050.36,"Not at less than it cost to produce, no."
1969.25,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4051.149,4053.033,It's only the profit that's involve?
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4053.033,4053.432,That is correct.
1969.25,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4053.432,4054.64,Division of profits?
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4054.64,4056.267,That is correct Your Honor.
1969.25,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4056.267,4059.764,And you understand that to be true with reference to all others?
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4059.764,4061.006,That is my understanding.
1969.25,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4069.79,4071.744,Undoubted to that have to be just --
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4071.744,4075.267,And it does affect some more than it does others.
1969.25,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4119.442,4127.117,"Well, if you didn't quite finish -- at least, I don't think you get on that explaining how this came about."
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4131.935,4132.484,Yes.
1969.25,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4135.205,4141.02,And how -- that is also represents the views of the Secretary of Agriculture I suppose?
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4141.02,4151.814,"No, it represents the view the Secretary of Agriculture only to the extent that it has been included in these two orders out of about 75 in the United States."
1969.25,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4151.814,4158.908,But he is most -- as they rather recently reaffirmed his views that --
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4158.908,4174.345,"His actual finding in 1964 was that the differential was not resulting in such disorderly conditions as with warrant, its deletion at this time."
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4192.383,4199.093,As I understand that the basic question is one of power for that when he gets the power.
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4209.537,4217.61,"Well, what I'm saying there is that he also fail to make the proper finding even assuming that he have this power."
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4221.492,4225.244,And that's what the Court of Appeals held to understand it that without power --
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4225.244,4225.941,That's correct.
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4225.941,4226.867,Put any differential.
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4226.867,4230.919,That a more basic violation of the act could not be comprehended.
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4449.098,4453.637,Why is the necessary surplus in the land the lowest production period?
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4453.637,4461.389,"Well, there are, although the demand for milk is fairly constant, there are daily fluctuations."
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4469.223,4470.958,Of that the high production period?
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4470.958,4471.485,Yes.
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4477.062,4478.208,"Well in other words, you have peak periods --"
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4478.208,4478.366,Yes we do.
1969.25,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4478.366,4479.592,And you have to have enough production --
1969.25,2,19889,charles_patrick_ryan,,4479.592,4482.135,And this is in the right period.
1969.25,3,21809,edwin_h_amidon_jr,,6820.361,6823.796,"Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court."
1969.25,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6912.25,6917.697,Did that cost differential which you imply that exist the generation ago?
1969.25,3,21809,edwin_h_amidon_jr,,6921.447,6922.436,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.25,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6927.614,6932.941,It wasn't represented if they on the grounds in the Secretary's submission here today?
1969.25,3,21809,edwin_h_amidon_jr,,6932.941,6935.177,That's true Your Honor.
1969.25,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7094.007,7094.813,Mr. Freidman.
1969.25,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7094.813,7097.558,Mr. Justice Black and may it please the Court.
1969.25,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7161.495,7163.05,Is there a finding on this?
1969.25,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7163.05,7165.793,"There is no finding on that, no Mr. Justice."
1969.25,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7186.202,7187.37,At least the majority.
1969.25,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7187.37,7187.697,That's right.
1969.25,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7187.697,7188.925,If the management's going to say --
1969.25,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7188.925,7201.28,"And of course, the evidence in this case that indicates that when this 1964 order was put to a vote, it was approve by something like 89% of all the farmers in the area."
1969.25,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7201.28,7205.539,But this so-called referendum is a plebiscite on the whole order or all -- take it or leave it --
1969.25,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7205.539,7214.349,"That's right, take it or leave it and then many situations -- this is true of many situations, you face when you've deciding whether to do something with the pros and the cons."
1969.25,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7214.349,7214.971,I understand.
1969.25,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7214.971,7223.266,"Now finally, I'd like to talk just a minute about this point that they are only two other orders in the whole United States that have this provision."
