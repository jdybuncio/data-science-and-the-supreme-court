1993.92-903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.009,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-903, Posters 'N' Things, Limited v. the United States."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,10.258,13.02,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,63.242,66.534,"What is your authority for that latter proposition, Mr. Parrish?"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,66.534,68.404,That is cannot stand?
1993.92-903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,68.404,70.097,That it's unconstitutional.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,70.097,76.91,If it's un... it's based upon the concept that a mens rea requirement is read into a statute.
1993.92-903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,81.244,88.968,"But I thought you said if there's no mens rea requirement it's unconstitutional, and I asked you what your authority is for that proposition."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,88.968,97.754,The authority that we have for that proposition is the Morissette v.... the Morissette case is what we use for that.
1993.92-903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,97.754,107.801,"I reread the Morissette case because you cite it in your brief, and I didn't read that as saying anything about a lack of intent making a statute unconstitutional."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,107.801,119.65,"Well, the Morissette case dealt with the fact of whether or not you should look to other instances to determine whether or not a statute should be declared unconstitutional."
1993.92-903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,127.044,130.088,"Well, how does that get you to any constitutional proposition?"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,130.088,135.901,We don't believe you have to reach the constitutional proposition in order to remand this case to the Eighth Circuit.
1993.92-903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,135.901,146.206,"Well, then your principal... the principal authority on which you rely for the proposition that if the statute does not have an intent requirement, it is unconstitutional, is Morissette."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,146.206,147.498,The Morissette case.
1993.92-903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,176.588,178.328,Are you referring to this Court or other courts?
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,178.328,178.929,This Court.
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,178.929,186.832,You take the position that the instructions didn't require proof of any mental element.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,197.551,204.984,"Well, in their approach on that issue, that's not the case that was tried by the district court judge."
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,207.316,207.746,You mean he didn't give the... excuse me.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,207.746,208.147,--I'm sorry.
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,208.147,210.518,That he didn't give the instruction that the Government says he gave?
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,210.518,212.84,He did not give the exact instruction.
1993.92-903,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,215.143,219.775,"Well, Mr. Parrish, if you look at page 22 on the Joint Appendix, the charge is:"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,224.827,237.827,"--Then you go to instruction on page 31 of the Joint Appendix, to instruction 39, where the term ""primarily intended""... which is the vehicle that most of the courts have used to determine where the intent is in this case... as used in these instructions does not relate--"
1993.92-903,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,237.827,238.257,"Well, but the point--"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,238.257,239.277,--To the knowledge of the--
1993.92-903,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,239.277,242.518,--The point is you're saying that there was no scienter required.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,242.518,243.099,--That's correct.
1993.92-903,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,243.099,250.736,"And instruction 21, subparagraph 2, says you have you find that the defendant knew the nature and character of the item."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,254.206,255.408,It is a mens rea component.
1993.92-903,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,255.408,259.98,And so the defendant had to know the nature and character of the item.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,275.401,278.202,But that's the flaw in the instruction.
1993.92-903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.781,306.942,"Well, Mr. Parrish, I... the statute seems to speak in terms of drug paraphernalia, and that term is defined as items either designed for or intended for us in connection with drug use."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,330.726,335.781,It's not sufficient because these statutes have... these items have dual purposes.
1993.92-903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,335.781,349.189,"Well, I thought there were an array of items here, some of them being such things as are defined by the statute itself as being designed for drug use."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,358.295,361.207,"Well, designed for use goes to the intent of the manufacturer."
1993.92-903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,367.01,370.033,"Well, we may have two separate categories of items here."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,370.033,370.263,That's correct.
1993.92-903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.263,371.084,Is that possible?
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,371.084,373.155,You can have two separate categories of items.
1993.92-903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,373.155,373.466,Okay.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,373.466,374.397,However in this case you have--
1993.92-903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,374.397,383.563,"Well, as far as items designed for use as drug paraphernalia is concerned, how are the instructions deficient?"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,383.563,386.115,--In designed for use it goes to the manufacturer.
1993.92-903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,393.628,405.245,"Well if the item is designed for that use and no other and the statute says if you sell such items you're guilty of this offense, why isn't that sufficient?"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,405.245,407.148,--You're convicting the item.
1993.92-903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.733,419.274,"Well I'm not going to belabor it, but it seems to me there are two types of items."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,421.077,422.797,"Some are not, that is correct."
1993.92-903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,422.797,423.097,Maybe some are.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,423.097,428.4,But you can't tell by the way the court instructed the jury in 37 and 39.
1993.92-903,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,453.658,463.205,"Mr. Parrish, the judge in his charge three times told the jury that the defendant whose case the jury was considering had to know the nature and character of the items."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,471.078,471.749,--That's correct.
1993.92-903,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.749,479.714,"You say that although he repeated that the defendant must know the nature and character of the items, that that's wiped out?"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,479.714,488.78,"Well, your understanding the... in this case the jury was, in fact, instructed that her intent was not related to any knowledge."
1993.92-903,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,517.599,533.42,"You're not disputing, are you, that the Government did prove that the defendant knew the nature and character of the items that were sold in her shop, that she knew that they were primarily designed for use... that their primary use was in connection with illegal drugs?"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,533.42,540.303,"If you consider proof what the jury reached a verdict on without proper instructions, you would have to say yes, they did prove it."
1993.92-903,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,540.303,543.806,"Proof is what is adequate to go to the jury, not what the jury finds."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,553.503,554.324,We don't agree with that.
1993.92-903,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,576.227,579.038,I'm not sure I understand your question... your response.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,582.411,583.152,--That's correct.
1993.92-903,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,583.152,584.943,Justice O'Connor mentioned those.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,596.171,612.882,"We believe that the Government did not prove that; that there was not substantial evidence, due to the conflicting nature of it without some indication to this jury that the subjective intent, what Ms. Acty intended that these items go for, was given to the jury."
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,655.598,657.381,"Well, if that is correct do you lose the case?"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,657.381,659.862,--If that is correct it has to be remanded.
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,659.862,660.834,"I'm saying if that was a correct statement of law, do you lose?"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,660.834,663.546,"Which one, that the Government argued in its brief?"
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,663.546,670.679,"That primarily intended does not go to the state of mind of the seller who was, in fact, the defendant or the defendants in this case."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,670.679,673.032,Maybe I'm not understanding.
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,673.34,690.132,"Well, I thought you had just told me that the judge's instruction was that the so-called element of primarily intended for use was not a... was not meant to refer to the state of mind of the seller of the paraphernalia."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,691.832,694.845,"--The state of mind of the defendant, the petitioner in this case."
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,694.845,695.145,"The defendant, yes."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,695.145,695.626,That's correct.
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,695.626,696.267,And the petitioners were sellers.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,696.267,696.675,That's correct.
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,696.675,697.777,Corporate individuals.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,707.594,708.543,We win.
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,708.543,711.475,You win if you are incorrect in--
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,711.475,712.977,Because the court did not give that instruction.
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,712.977,717.11,--Let me approach it from a different direction.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,732.349,733.05,That's correct.
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,733.05,733.711,All right.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,736.031,740.375,"Well, we don't lose the case because the Government argues a knowledge instruction."
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,747.7,757.576,"Well, you don't deny, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, do you, that on three separate occasions the judge gave this understanding of nature and character instruction?"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,758.507,759.567,But nature and character--
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,759.567,759.937,"Well, do you?"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,759.937,760.779,--I don't deny that.
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,760.779,761.079,Okay.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,773.595,774.246,That's correct.
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,796.642,796.822,You--
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,796.822,798.632,We're talking about sending people away for a long time.
1993.92-903,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,798.632,813.132,"--You then are... and I didn't get this from your brief, but are you arguing that instead of knowledge, which the Government concedes must... knowledge in the sense the Government described it must be proven, that this must be a purposeful crime?"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,813.132,823.309,"It should be purposeful, based upon... and getting back to Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist's question of the standard that has been utilized, this Court has never actually confronted the mens rea standard at the constitutional level."
1993.92-903,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,823.309,825.661,Is that true with respect to both kinds of items?
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,834.426,834.937,Well--
1993.92-903,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,834.937,838.848,And is your answer the same with respect to both aspects of this case?
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,852.488,861.915,"--It would be precisely the same because in applying the objective standard or the strict liability standard, the other items, Mannitol, Procaine, and Inositol, were items that were included."
1993.92-903,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,865.206,865.596,"No, no."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,867.938,868.228,Okay.
1993.92-903,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,868.228,875.743,"--Are the listed items and the jury was instructed, as they were here, that you have to know the nature of the item."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,879.824,891.134,"It would be precisely the same with one caveat, that we still would want to know which item did the jury find only had one purpose and which items had dual purposes."
1993.92-903,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,891.384,892.584,Even as to the statutory items?
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,892.584,893.565,Even as to the--
1993.92-903,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,893.565,895.235,Even as to the statutorily described items.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,895.235,895.615,--Of course.
1993.92-903,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,911.778,917.19,"Mr. Parrish, there are all sorts of items that have dual purposes but the Government can nevertheless prohibit their sale."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,922.543,924.023,If they say it's... they can.
1993.92-903,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.738,936.923,Is it your position that the Government must prove that the retailer knew what his customer was going to do with the item?
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,936.923,943.597,"A must by some standard higher than just a simple knowledge or a low threshold knowledge standard, no, that's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-903,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,943.597,946.67,He has to know what his customer knew.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,952.394,952.674,"Well, drugs themselves."
1993.92-903,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.327,961.279,--But you don't have to know what... you don't have to know what your customer is going to do with it if you're indicted for selling cocaine.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,961.279,962.519,You do not know--
1993.92-903,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.519,964.772,"Maybe he's just going to, you know, put it in his cake or something."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,966.952,971.006,"--But then he has to get a license for it, and if you have to get a license for it you create a whole new standard."
1993.92-903,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,980.04,985.456,"Well, it's a dual-purpose item but the statute requires that it's... that it was designed primarily for use with illegal drugs."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,985.456,988.178,"If you're talking about design, Your Honor, you have to go the manufacturer."
1993.92-903,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,989.647,989.867,That's right.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,993.15,996.873,And you establish a standard that's acceptable for high-threshold punishment.
1993.92-903,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1002.866,1024.191,"Mr. Parrish, are you saying that if we had no confusion in the charge whatever, the charge is very clear that the Government must prove this defendant knew that the primary use... not the exclusive use, the primary use of this substance is in connection with illegal drugs, that that would be unconstitutional as a construction of the statute?"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1045.914,1051.647,We believe it's constitutional if you set the standard as to how you establish the knowing.
1993.92-903,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1055.901,1061.044,"How you establish the knowing is, for one thing, you look at the list that Justice Kennedy mentioned."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1061.044,1061.395,That's correct.
1993.92-903,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1061.395,1071.981,"That's clear notice that these items constitute drug paraphernalia, their principal use is in connection with unlawful drugs."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1081.036,1081.817,It would.
1993.92-903,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1110.545,1115.581,"They can... even though they have dual purpose, they can still be drug paraphernalia, can't they?"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1115.581,1115.989,Of course they can be.
1993.92-903,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1116.41,1116.811,Okay.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1116.811,1117.632,--I'm sorry.
1993.92-903,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1117.632,1124.275,And didn't the instruction require that the defendant know the nature of these items?
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1124.275,1126.006,It said it did not know the nature.
1993.92-903,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.771,1153.455,"You're assuming that that is the intent provision of the statute, but that is not the intent provision of the statute."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1153.455,1154.036,That is correct.
1993.92-903,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1155.356,1160.197,"It isn't the intent in the design that's crucial, it's the intent in the sale that's crucial."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1164.311,1165.633,--But there--
1993.92-903,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1165.633,1167.473,"--Not the mens rea of the designer, but of the seller."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1171.915,1172.676,--The instructions do not.
1993.92-903,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.676,1172.986,Dual or not.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1172.986,1174.689,The instructions do not.
1993.92-903,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1192.669,1205.538,"You... the instructions clearly say, ladies and gentlemen you have to find, one, that the items in question constitute drug paraphernalia; two, that the defendant, whose case you are considering, the seller here, knew the nature and character of the items."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1207.06,1211.802,But they go back again to 39 and it says it does not relate to the knowledge and intent of that person.
1993.92-903,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.802,1216.375,"39 relates to something else, to the designer, and that's not the intent we're concerned about here."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1216.375,1218.748,But the problem... the Federal courts have confronted this issue.
1993.92-903,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1223.81,1225.521,You're not saying... that's what I wanted to clarify.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1234.387,1234.557,That's correct.
1993.92-903,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1234.557,1236.71,So you're saying that there can be a knowledge standard.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1236.71,1238.07,"Oh, it can be a knowledge standard."
1993.92-903,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1239.462,1240.34,And that there is under this statute.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1245.883,1253.34,--We would acknowledge it's not enough knowledge as proposed in the instruction by the Solicitor General.
1993.92-903,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.34,1254.729,I don't want to get into that.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1254.729,1255.089,Within the statute... okay.
1993.92-903,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.089,1258.062,But you agree that if it had been made clear.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1258.062,1259.293,Absolutely.
1993.92-903,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1259.293,1269.92,"If it had been made clear that all this seller has to know is that these are drug paraphernalia... which is to say they are primarily intended primarily for uses as drug paraphernalia, even though they may have other uses."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1273.873,1274.344,Absolutely.
1993.92-903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1274.344,1274.905,Okay.
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1286.501,1296.887,"We did address that, Judge... Your Honor, when we outlined that all of the particular items whereof, including instruction 37 and 39."
1993.92-903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1301.352,1304.972,"Well what's... under what question is that question presented, is that subsumed?"
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1304.972,1310.686,"On the subjective scienter question, as to whether or not the judge accepted a fully objective standard in this case--"
1993.92-903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.686,1310.977,Well--
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1310.977,1312.088,--And a strict liability standard.
1993.92-903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1312.088,1318.923,"--Your question two deals with the standard imposed by the statute, not what instruction was given."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1318.923,1325.107,"That's the standard that the judge adopted in this case, Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and that was the one that was not in the statute."
1993.92-903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1335.583,1349.031,"I suggest that you don't devote any more of your argument to the particular instructions given in this case, because I don't think... and I think that probably the bench agrees with me, that that's fairly raised in the petition."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1349.031,1352.353,--I'm sorry.
1993.92-903,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1353.915,1360.701,"Incidentally, Mr. Parrish, you and this case and I come from the Eighth Circuit."
1993.92-903,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1362.401,1364.972,Judge Rawley was the district judge in this case.
1993.92-903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1449.269,1451.408,"Thank you, Mr. Parrish."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1453.441,1457.782,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1477.667,1482.619,"And, of course, I suppose you're doing it because the Government changed its theory while the case... after the case was granted, didn't it?"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1482.619,1486.583,"Well, Your Honor, the... in the lower courts."
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.583,1487.482,"There's nothing wrong with that, but--"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1487.482,1500.271,"Well, I think we certainly changed our approach to the case in this respect, in that in the lower courts the thrust of the argument being made by the defendants was that a subjective intent was required."
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.694,1566.583,"--Didn't they also argue in the court of appeals that if one does not read into it the subjective intent requirement that they contend for, that... I mean that if it... it would be unconstitutional if you did not read it in, and therefore you should read it in, and therefore the proper instruction was not given and therefore there should be new trial."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1567.424,1567.915,They did.
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1573.709,1573.869,I understand.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1573.869,1576.681,Which was the purely subjective intent instruction.
1993.92-903,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1583.757,1608.451,"Mr. Bryson, during the course of your review... and you're going to turn to the instructions, which I hope you do, can you clarify for me the Government's position as to whether or not instructions should be precisely the same in trial A, which consists just of a trial for having sold the listed items, and trial B, assuming that there are only unlisted items involved."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1611.723,1612.134,"--Well, I--"
1993.92-903,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1612.134,1614.314,"If you could address that during the course of your argument, I'd appreciate it."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1614.314,1614.605,"--Well, certainly."
1993.92-903,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1650.399,1656.343,"Well, but intended and designed applies both to the listed items and to all other items, does it not?"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1656.343,1662.757,"Your Honor, we think the listed items are... with exception perhaps."
1993.92-903,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1679.497,1681.82,Well the statute doesn't make that distinction in its language.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1690.694,1691.505,They say... that's right.
1993.92-903,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1693.077,1695.369,So there's no distinction between the two classifications of cases.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1695.369,1695.579,--That's clear.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1705.574,1712.761,"Mr. Bryson, to cut to the chase here, what is the Government's position as to the nature of the scienter?"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1725.218,1726.017,Yes.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1726.988,1727.499,So he's--
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1727.499,1730.301,"--Well, not necessarily intended by the manufacturer, but intended by the retailer--"
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1730.301,1730.662,"--Well, the intended provision--"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1730.662,1734.084,--Or someone in the chain of distribution who may use it.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1734.084,1734.385,"--Oh, okay, someone--"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1734.385,1736.195,Who may display it in a particular way.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1741.989,1742.209,--Right.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1742.209,1748.084,Which may not by their design necessarily commit themselves to drug use.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.084,1748.324,Right.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1748.324,1748.975,But... excuse me.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.975,1751.456,"So he has to know somebody else's state of mind, essentially."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1751.456,1754.277,It isn't a state of mind.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1760.922,1762.582,"No, it doesn't say use, is says designed... designed."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1762.582,1762.882,--That's right.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.622,1768.867,"You design something for a purpose if it's your intent to make them for that purpose, no?"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1768.867,1770.369,"--Well, that is true."
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.144,1784.147,Even if nobody designed it for that purpose?
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1784.437,1785.447,"--Well, somebody obviously--"
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.447,1787.24,--It seems to me you can say it seems to be designed for that purpose.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1787.24,1790.402,--Somebody obviously will design it for that purpose.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1810.674,1810.904,I really don't know how you can avoid that.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1819.239,1821.019,"Well, what--"
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1821.019,1825.845,Do you think it's hard to tell whether a car was designed for transportation without talking to the fellow who built it?
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1825.845,1828.726,"--No, it isn't hard to tell."
1993.92-903,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1858.245,1858.895,"Well, Mr. Bryson."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1858.895,1859.305,Excuse me.
1993.92-903,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1859.305,1863.619,Suppose the items are something like razor blades.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1863.619,1864.039,Yes.
1993.92-903,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1864.039,1875.046,"Now, they're not on the list of things that apparently are to be considered design for use as drug paraphernalia."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1875.046,1875.967,Uh-hum.
1993.92-903,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1875.967,1884.252,"What is the proper standard in instruction, then, for the jury for a retailer of razor blades?"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1884.252,1895.048,The standard would be if in the setting in which this particular item is being marketed it appears that it was intended to be used with drugs.
1993.92-903,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1895.048,1895.378,Well--
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1895.378,1897.169,And let me give you an example that goes to exactly that case.
1993.92-903,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1897.169,1909.388,"--Yeah, I mean should... is it... must the jury be told and is the standard that the retailer must intend that they be used for drug use?"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1909.388,1913.541,"Well, typically it will be the retailer in a dual-use item, but it doesn't have to be."
1993.92-903,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1980.544,1985.199,"But how does that square with instruction 39, which says that the term primarily intended"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1989.28,2005.491,"--Well, that instruction is intended to answer the suggestion that the defendant has to be person who primarily intends that drugs be used with this product, or primarily has designed the product."
1993.92-903,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2005.491,2014.447,"Well, if I were a juror I would say that the knowledge of the drug... this in the case of the razor blade hypothetical... is irrelevant under instruction 39."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2026.405,2030.136,"Well, instruction 39, we could have done without instruction 39."
1993.92-903,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2031.759,2034.48,"Instruction 39 would be inappropriate in the case that I put, would it not?"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2034.48,2038.424,"--I don't think so, because I think--"
1993.92-903,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2038.424,2042.143,"Well, you've said that the intent of the seller is relevant."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2042.143,2043.806,"--Well, no, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1993.92-903,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2087.313,2087.674,But--
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2087.674,2088.264,In the knowledge--
1993.92-903,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2088.264,2089.074,--You go ahead.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2104.065,2104.545,--Well--
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.545,2108.919,"I mean, what... obviously it has to relate to the intent of some particular person or persons."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2111.321,2112.87,--Well I think you have to... Your Honor.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2112.87,2116.633,"So, I mean, it could be the intent of the seller, it could be the intent of the manufacturer."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2119.446,2120.477,That's right.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.477,2121.188,That's the meaning of it.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2121.188,2121.966,I think that's the gist of it.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2122.467,2123.159,Do you think the jury understood it that way?
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2123.159,2123.708,"--Well, I think so."
1993.92-903,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2139.089,2145.131,You were candid in acknowledging in your brief that the formulas used by the circuits were not entirely satisfactory.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2145.131,2145.331,That's correct.
1993.92-903,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2145.331,2147.344,And that this charge wasn't entirely satisfactory.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2164.224,2174.362,"I think I would say, Your Honor, that the defendant must know that the goods are... the goods in question are primarily used with drugs."
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2174.362,2176.042,Mr. Bryson.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2176.042,2180.737,"And that the drugs must also be drug paraphernalia, as defined in section (d)."
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.466,2209.504,"Mr. Bryson, supposing someone went into a supermarket/hardware/drug store and said he wanted to buy a cocaine executive kit which would include a razor, a spoon, four or five items each of which is a dual-purpose item."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2221.943,2232.38,"Well, Your Honor, I think that is the hardest case that's presented by the statute, because what you have there is an item that hasn't... or a series of items."
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.671,2235.331,Just stick with my example.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2235.331,2235.872,"--Okay, I'll stick with yours."
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2248.08,2248.588,The customer told him--
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2248.588,2249.229,The customer tells him.
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2249.229,2249.73,--What I'm going to do with it.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2249.73,2258.706,"By the time you get to that point, the salesman knows that he is selling something which, in the aggregate, is intended to be used with drugs."
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2274.568,2275.189,But it clearly was in this case.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2275.189,2276.488,--That it became something that was intended for drug use.
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2285.663,2288.025,He needed the salesman to help him find each of these items.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2288.025,2288.235,Yes.
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.235,2289.097,To go through this big store.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2289.097,2294.109,"Yes, I would say... and you could take an example that... if I could just--"
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2294.109,2295.99,Change the example.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2295.99,2296.571,--Change the hypothetical.
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.663,2301.656,"Well, I think it violates the statute under your interpretation."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2301.656,2303.015,But I think it would be a very difficult case.
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2303.015,2303.195,Yeah.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2303.195,2303.525,And it's close to the line.
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2303.525,2304.066,Yeah.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2304.066,2306.207,"And there is some fuzziness at the edge, I think, in the statute."
1993.92-903,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2306.207,2310.459,"But you don't want us to decide this case based on the instructions, do you?"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2310.459,2312.632,"Your Honor, I--"
1993.92-903,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2312.632,2316.485,Didn't we take this case to decide what element the statute requires?
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2316.485,2316.503,--Yes.
1993.92-903,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2316.503,2318.256,We didn't take this case to review the instructions.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2318.256,2318.546,That's right.
1993.92-903,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2324.199,2326.871,"Oh, look, I'm one of the... I'm one of the culprits and I recognize that."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2326.871,2327.121,--Well--
1993.92-903,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2327.121,2335.096,"But, I mean, when it comes down to deciding the case and writing the opinion, it's not the Government's position that we ought to affirm on the basis of the instructions."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2336.338,2337.647,--That's correct.
1993.92-903,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2469.966,2474.237,"Mr. Bryson, it was my understanding that in the revision the word ""scheme"" was dropped."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2474.237,2474.537,--Yes.
1993.92-903,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2474.537,2486.476,"So you don't want to... even though it was in effect at the time of this trial, it seems by putting any heavy weight on that you're making this an extremely narrow case."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2486.476,2510.501,"Your Honor, we don't think the existence of the word 857... the prior statute is critical, but we think it's illuminating, particularly because there's no indication that when the 1990 change was made in the statute and the word (a), that there was any... there's no indication there was any intention to remove a mens rea requirement."
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2569.951,2586.32,"Mr. Bryson, can I just ask, is your acceptance of the view that there is some knowledge requirement in the statute based on your view that this is a strong canon of presumption under the canons of statutory construction, or are you of the view that if you didn't do that it might be a serious constitutional question?"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2590.554,2597.797,"Well, we make the concession because we think that... I would say it's the first, principally, of your... of the two options."
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2668.464,2670.386,"Right, give us the last couple and then I have a question for you."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2672.647,2672.927,--Okay.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2690.759,2692.111,"Where is that, which instruction?"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2692.111,2693.533,That's on page 28 of the Joint Appendix.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2712.664,2732.747,"Mr. Bryson, this may be just repeating what Justice Stevens was asking, but I take it it is your position that the statute is covered if all that the seller knows is that the individual to whom he's selling the dual-purpose item in fact intends to use it for one of the prohibited purposes?"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2753.04,2755.941,"Your Honor, I have to give you the same answer I gave to Justice Stevens."
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.757,2767.6,"And that's why we have prosecutorial discretion, is what you're saying."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2767.6,2776.366,"Well, Your Honor, I'm always worried to give the answer trust us, we won't prosecute those kinds of cases, because I find that those cases show up in my office when I get back."
1993.92-903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2776.366,2777.025,"Well, Mr. Bryson, I don't mean to--"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2791.184,2792.226,"It might not, Your Honor."
1993.92-903,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2829.492,2839.487,"No, but if I come in and say I'm sure they are, indeed, suitable for that purpose, but I want to be clean shaven, please sell me a package, there's no violation of the statute in that sale, is there?"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2839.487,2841.289,"--Well, actually, I think there would be, Your Honor."
1993.92-903,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2850.085,2850.274,Intended by whom?
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2850.274,2852.587,--To somebody who just happens not to have intended to use it for that purpose.
1993.92-903,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2852.587,2852.778,"Not by me, not by me?"
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2852.778,2854.287,But that doesn't exonerate me.
1993.92-903,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2874.62,2886.167,"Then, your... and I... this is implicit in what you said before... your reference to the... to the intent in primarily intended must be primarily intended by the customer to whom you address your offer."
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2886.167,2886.968,"No, no, Your Honor."
1993.92-903,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2887.369,2890.171,I mean to the class of customers to whom you address your offer.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2890.171,2890.792,"--Yes, that's correct."
1993.92-903,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2895.094,2895.545,Uh-hum.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2895.545,2895.976,That's right.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2895.976,2900.507,I thought you said... I thought you agreed with the instruction that it doesn't have to be the intent of any particular person.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2905.342,2905.683,Exactly.
1993.92-903,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2905.683,2909.165,So that if I come... that's why you had trouble with my hypothetical.
1993.92-903,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2919.119,2936.611,"Well, the argument you would have to make to bring that example within the coverage of the statute, I think, is that the good becomes intended to be used with drugs at the point at which you walk in, pick it up, and announce that you intend to use it for that purpose."
1993.92-903,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2945.898,2947.57,"Thank you, Mr. Bryson."
1993.92-903,2,16689,alfredo_parrish,,2949.941,2952.982,I don't intend to take my 4 minutes.
1993.92-903,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2954.914,2956.605,"What do you mean by intent, Mr. Parrish?"
1993.92-903,2,16689,alfredo_parrish,,2956.795,2961.83,"As defined in the statute, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-903,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3004.868,3010.06,"Mr. Parrish, I just want to confirm my understanding of what you just said."
1993.92-903,2,16689,alfredo_parrish,,3042.101,3052.068,"--And instruction 39 was taken out, where it says that it does not relate to any... the knowledge or intent of any particular person or persons, that's correct."
1993.92-903,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3052.068,3063.315,"I know that's your... your view is that that confuses things, but I just wanted to know that you are in agreement with Mr. Bryson that the model charge would be that the defendant knows the goods are primarily used with drugs."
1993.92-903,2,16689,alfredo_parrish,,3063.315,3064.427,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-903,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3065.999,3067.321,"Thank you, Mr. Parrish."
