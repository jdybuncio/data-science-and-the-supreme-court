1989.88-5050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.067,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-5050, Daniel Holland v. Illinois."
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,15.501,20.586,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,126.986,136.813,"Well, would you say a prosecutor could challenge two black jurors out of six black jurors?"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,160.318,179.893,"The issue in the case is protecting the process of selecting the jury, and in that situation, where individuals are removed by peremptory challenge on the basis of their race on the false assumption that they are unqualified, that is injury to the process and--"
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,179.893,180.044,No.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,185.139,189.973,--The fair cross-section argument has to be understood in a... in a very broad perspective.
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,189.973,193.696,"But what if the prosecutor says, I'm interested in having a fair cross-section jury?"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,208.467,209.498,Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,221.388,230.386,"Well, how does that give you a fair cross-section jury if... if... Justice White's hypothesis is that out of 12 there are 12 blacks?"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,230.386,247.617,"If the... if the prosecutor is allowed to use his peremptory challenges simply on the basis of his false assumptions and his biases, it is a severe injury to the selection process."
1989.88-5050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,250.419,254.339,But the selection process need not result in a fair cross-section in your view?
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,254.339,255.43,"--Well, that is... that is true."
1989.88-5050,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.973,296.889,"You're not making a claim here, I take it, that there is some systematic exclusion of black jurors throughout the county?"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,296.889,298.922,That... that... that's correct.
1989.88-5050,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.886,312.833,"That claim would be open to you under existing precedence, presumably, if the facts warranted it?"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,312.833,313.423,--Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,313.822,315.374,With respect to the venire.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,315.374,316.045,--Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.11,342.654,Does this objection apply only to racial distinctions?
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,342.654,350.008,The... the issue of... of what groups it... it... it... it would apply to is... is an open question.
1989.88-5050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,367.161,372.887,"Of course, one way... one easy way of limiting it is to... automatically is to say that only blacks--"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,372.887,373.037,Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.037,374.429,--can object to the elimination of blacks.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,375.211,377.645,"Well, yes, that's been done, and... and--"
1989.88-5050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.645,379.845,"--That eliminates a lot of problems, doesn't it?"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,382.917,388.293,--We're saying in this case that whites have the authority to object to blacks.
1989.88-5050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.293,388.443,Right.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,398.063,415.366,"If rich people and poor people are... are distinctive groups for purposes of determining damage to the system from its removal on the basis of that characteristic, and whether there is a showing that they were removed on the basis of that characteristic."
1989.88-5050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,430.006,432.697,How do we go about deciding the first question?
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,432.697,445.016,I'd... I would refer the Court to Lockhart which is a... which is an indication that it's difficult because this Court never said in Lockhart what groups or what distinctive--
1989.88-5050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,445.016,452.953,"Well, there's also rather strong in Lockhart, isn't there, that the fair cross-section applies only to the venire and not to the panel?"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,452.953,453.491,--Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.999,524.72,Excuse me.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,561.961,565.473,"--Yes, but the... the false assumption is--"
1989.88-5050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,565.473,566.494,So it's not a false assumption then.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,566.494,576.683,"--There is a false assumption that all rich people are necessarily biased and will be biased in this case and, therefore, I may... I may exclude a person simply because he--"
1989.88-5050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.683,578.463,He doesn't exclude that at all... that isn't his assumption at all.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,593.304,602.781,"--That's... that's... that's correct, but the question becomes is that a constitutional peremptory challenge as this Court has come to define it most especially in the Batson case."
1989.88-5050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,623.718,642.511,"If you're really... if you're really honest about your principle, peremptory challenges in general... the whole notion of a peremptory challenge is contrary to having a fair cross-section, isn't it, because the whole purpose of it is to eliminate a fair cross-section and somehow load the jury in such a way that it's more likely to be in your favor."
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,644.784,668.41,"The... the proper use of peremptory challenge is... is to supplement challenges for cause in order to remove those who are for particular reasons that the prosecutor simply cannot articulate, or, more importantly, cannot convince the judge... renders this person unqualified to serve."
1989.88-5050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,668.41,684.4,"But those reasons are very often generalizations about... you... you... you can't know the person individually so you make generalizations, often on the basis of race, religion, appearance, you know, manner of dress, job."
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,690.615,699.7,"Yes, and this is the tension between peremptory challenges and the fair selection of the jury."
1989.88-5050,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,781.849,790.985,"Incidentally, in your hypothetical I noticed you used martial status and wealth as being permitted grounds for disqualification."
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,790.985,798.08,Something beyond... I certainly didn't mean those to be decisive or necessarily--
1989.88-5050,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,798.08,804.196,It certainly could be argued that those are cognizable groups that come within the rule that you seek--
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,804.196,804.225,--Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,804.225,805.547,--to have the Court adopt--
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,805.547,805.837,Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,805.837,806.348,--is it not?
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,806.348,806.848,Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,816.103,816.915,"Well, how can we do that?"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,829.424,842.293,--It would be based on this Court's recognition that the removal of blacks by peremptory challenge suggests that prosecutors are misusing the challenges to remove on grounds of race.
1989.88-5050,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,842.974,849.449,"Well, that gets back to Justice White's original question, that this isn't the fair cross-section argument you're making at all."
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,851.361,861.238,--The argument has elements of equal protection analysis to it because there is the concern for the excluded jurors.
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.577,922.423,I suppose you would apply this same approach to civil trials in the federal courts?
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,922.423,936.701,"If this Court could determine that the Sixth Amendment applied in the civil context, that in fact the Sixth Amendment was applicable to civil--"
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,936.701,937.843,How about the Seventh Amendment?
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,937.843,941.135,--The Seventh Amendment demonstrates that there is a--
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.135,942.758,Certainly there is a right to a jury trial.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,942.758,943.749,"--a right to a jury trial, yes."
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.749,944.699,In the federal courts.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,944.699,965.593,"The difficulty... the difficulty, unfortunately, is that the Sixth Amendment... or not so unfortunately... but the difficulty is that the violation under the Sixth Amendment comes from the governmental interference, whereas under the Seventh Amendment there would be interference by a second private counsel or an opposing litigant as--"
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,965.593,965.733,"Well, I know."
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,977.78,984.155,--The argument we present is that certainly the government is not entitled to do so.
1989.88-5050,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1001.899,1005.202,"Counsel, what do you do with Negroes who are passing for white?"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1008.264,1017.941,It puts the burden on the defendant to demonstrate that this is a member of the... of the Black race.
1989.88-5050,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1047.151,1049.314,"It's a fast way to get an all-white jury, isn't it?"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1049.314,1054.907,The concern is not what kind of jury is gotten.
1989.88-5050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1134.203,1135.966,That stretches what we've said so far.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1168.57,1168.891,Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1168.891,1178.168,But you've got to start off with a venire of a fair cross section and then each side can then use its peremptories the way peremptories are always used on generalized group bases.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1192.169,1209.69,"The Court should conclude that the purpose of putting them on the venire is not simply for the symbolic value of saying that now they've reached the... that stage in the case and, therefore, we're free to remove them thereafter."
1989.88-5050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.69,1209.85,No.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1214.254,1214.425,Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1214.425,1216.074,After which they can both take their peremptories--
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1216.074,1216.235,Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.235,1216.785,--anyway they want.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1216.785,1220.838,Then the question becomes how peremptories can be constitutionally used.
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1287.765,1301.475,What do you think the theory in Batson is that permits the black defendant to challenge the use of peremptories against blacks?
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1303.726,1304.437,"Yes, your Honor."
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1313.404,1315.607,The denial of equal protection to the defendant?
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1315.607,1330.997,"--Yes, by... well, no, the Court focused in on the equal protection of the black juror, which the defendant was given standing because he was a member of the same race, to raise as an argument to overturn the conviction."
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.569,1343.819,"Well, why shouldn't... why shouldn't a... why shouldn't a white defendant have that same privilege and without even getting to the fair cross-section argument?"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1343.819,1349.864,"--The difficulty, of course, is that he lacks the traditional standing aspect because he's not a member of the same race."
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.864,1359.541,"Well, I know, but he's... he's a defendant and that's all you're really saying about the black, is that he's a defendant and you're giving him standing to remedy this denial of equal protection to the juror."
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1359.541,1360.032,Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1360.032,1362.555,If that's your... that's your theory?
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1362.555,1365.976,That's... that's one possible outcome.
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.25,1374.162,It sounds to me that that might be an easier argument than the--
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1374.162,1374.422,--Undoubtedly.
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1374.422,1377.006,--You're driving uphill in this case.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1377.006,1387.492,"Well, we're certainly not precluding the equal protection argument as being persuasive in this case because in effect there's that argument and there's more, because there are Sixth Amendment--"
1989.88-5050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1387.492,1391.315,Was your case tried after Batson came down?
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1391.315,1391.815,--No.
1989.88-5050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1405.796,1409.868,"Well, was a Batson claim raised in the lower courts?"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1409.868,1410.609,No.
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1504.927,1510.222,"Well, didn't the Illinois Supreme Court in this case say that Batson did not apply in this situation?"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1510.222,1512.223,"Yes, because the defendant was white."
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1512.223,1512.744,Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1517.248,1518.069,In the Illinois Supreme Court.
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1519.812,1521.501,"Well, I know, but it's raised--"
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1521.501,1521.681,Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.681,1522.332,--and it was decided.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1522.332,1522.712,Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1522.712,1525.516,Are you relying on it here?
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1525.516,1526.045,No.
1989.88-5050,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1543.238,1547.421,We very rarely do that if the lawyer is unwilling even to say he relies on it.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1547.421,1548.333,"Well, we didn't--"
1989.88-5050,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1548.333,1549.833,You haven't argued it yet.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1549.833,1550.464,--We haven't argued it.
1989.88-5050,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1595.671,1603.796,"The standing issue is really quite interesting because, as Justice White points out, Batson wasn't a member of the class that was at issue in the case."
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1607.64,1607.93,--Yes.
1989.88-5050,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1607.93,1620.879,And I don't know whether you're assuming that he had standing because he was of the same race or because he was a defendant who objected to the adverse consequences upon him of a violation of the Equal Protection Clause against others.
1989.88-5050,0,20951,donald_s_honchell,,1620.879,1639.923,"Well, the impact on the defendant of a violation of the Equal Protection Clause would be a Sixth Amendment violation because he has an interest in his jury serving as the conscience of the community which is denied if the fair possibility of the cross-section is frustrated."
1989.88-5050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1725.666,1727.115,"Thank you, Mr. Honchell."
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,1729.289,1749.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented today is whether the Sixth Amendment regulates the use of peremptory challenges during voir dire."
1989.88-5050,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2146.518,2147.049,"Well, he's not really saying that."
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2178.111,2184.145,"--Well, he's certainly saying that he wants to restrict this to defendants."
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2230.097,2258.517,"Supposing you had a state... that's probably very improbable, but just to get a point across... in which... a trial court in which the judge followed a practice of always excluding black jurors from an otherwise, you know, cross-section panel and the resulting jury was nevertheless composed of 12 people who were found to be impartial, would the defendant have any basis for... constitutional basis for objecting to such a procedure?"
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2260.538,2276.659,That sounds like Virginia versus... ex parte Virginia from back in 1879 when in that case a particular district judge refused to call any black jurors for the jury pool.
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.973,2281.925,But I'm assuming they're in the jury pool.
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2293.705,2299.521,"--No, because the Equal Protection Clause applies at all stages and a trial judge--"
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.521,2302.193,But could a white... could a white defendant object to that?
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2302.193,2307.658,--I think a white defendant would not be able to object to that.
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.658,2313.032,So that such a practice would be permissible in all cases where the defendant is not black?
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2313.032,2316.223,This would not be the means for attacking the problem.
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2316.223,2316.874,Then what would--
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2316.874,2317.936,The remedy would not be found--
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2317.936,2322.681,--What would be... the means would be by passing a law to get them to stop?
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2322.681,2326.474,"--Well, that would be in violation of federal and probably state law right now."
1989.88-5050,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2330.268,2337.134,"Well, I suppose it might be a due process violation if the judge did such an aberrational thing."
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2343.808,2352.444,"I think there certainly would be a cause of action that the excluded class of black jurors, which, by hypothesis, there must be a large number--"
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2352.444,2354.688,My question is whether a white defendant could object.
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2354.688,2370.946,"--I do not think... the Sixth Amendment would not reach it, and I do not think that a white defendant in a particular trial, if he was getting an impartial jury, would have standing... he would not have equal protection standing."
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2370.946,2375.61,"Why, then, would a black defendant have standing because he would also not be a member of the class?"
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2375.61,2386.918,"Well, in the previous decisions of this Court, class has always referred to race, and the defendant in Batson did have the same race standing."
1989.88-5050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.156,2494.959,"Supposing he is and suppose we accept that... even this back door approach, then what's your answer to the argument that the white defendant should have standing to attack the discriminatory exclusion of the black juror just on the ground that blacks are incompetent?"
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2494.959,2506.167,"--If nothing else, if petitioner were to approach the problem through the Equal Protection Clause, jurisprudentially it's cleaner than what he is trying under the Sixth Amendment."
1989.88-5050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.92,2527.302,It might even go farther than the Sixth Amendment approach.
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2527.302,2541.241,"--Well, consider the Fourth Amendment, search and seizure, that it's always been held that a criminal defendant who wants to have something suppressed is going to have to assert an interest in either the thing that's been seized or the premises that were searched."
1989.88-5050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.062,2543.785,What do you think the theory of Batson was?
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2548.006,2552.491,--I think that's what the theory was.
1989.88-5050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2553.412,2567.672,"Namely that... that... that blacks were excluded and that's going to hurt him because blacks might favor him, or what?"
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2567.672,2580.68,"--Whether he might have thought that blacks were going to favor him or not, I mean, I think that thus far has not been an interest this court has been willing to protect."
1989.88-5050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.406,2591.767,"Well, what difference does it make what... what defendant raises that issue?"
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2591.767,2603.215,--Because in the situation involving a black defendant there is not only third-party standing on behalf of the excluded people but he has his own injury.
1989.88-5050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2604.517,2605.178,Which is... which is what?
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2608.967,2627.01,"--The... I think the injury is the signal to him that the... that the system does not value him too highly if it removes all members of his raise, and the possibility of conveying the idea to the impanelled jurors that maybe they shouldn't take this black defendant too seriously."
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2925.996,2927.629,I must confess I'm a little puzzled by that argument.
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2933.382,2933.542,--Uh-huh.
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2933.542,2938.177,He can't both insist that they seat these two people and object to their seating.
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2938.177,2939.927,If he were a--
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2939.927,2941.509,Whatever he is.
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2941.509,2949.112,"--black defendant, he could ask the particular people not be excused under Batson."
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2949.112,2950.574,Yes.
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2956.989,2959.623,Or maybe he could plead in the alternative.
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2962.855,2965.026,I really don't think that's a very realistic problem.
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,2967.647,2976.984,"--Or another possibility is if, suppose it happens to be a venire which is predominantly black, as sometimes happens by the luck of the draw in Cook County."
1989.88-5050,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3012.039,3022.948,"Well, I take it the argument is not that there is an obligation to excuse in order to get a fair cross-section."
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,3048.514,3049.515,"Well, unless--"
1989.88-5050,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3049.515,3068.569,"The petitioner is not saying that there is an obligation in every case to use peremptory challenges to secure a fair cross-section, simply that the state cannot by interference prevent the laws of probability from... from operating."
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,3068.569,3087.011,"--Well, unless what petitioner is making is a heads I win, tails you lose, sort of argument that if there are six black potential jurors who appear, if there are that many, we are obligated to keep them, we can't reduce the number."
1989.88-5050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3145.329,3148.842,"Well, you... that isn't right."
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,3173.526,3175.699,"Again, those are equal protection ideas."
1989.88-5050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.039,3200.236,"Yeah, but all you get... all you're entitled to under the Sixth Amendment is a chance of the draw and... so the draw comes out."
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,3216.008,3220.401,"--Well, we think--"
1989.88-5050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3220.401,3221.421,That's a Sixth Amendment argument.
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,3221.421,3233.192,--We think the Sixth Amendment cross-sectional principle is fully satisfied at the time the jury pool is fairly drawn and the venire is fairly dispatched--
1989.88-5050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3233.192,3233.509,Right.
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,3233.509,3234.961,--from the jury room.
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3237.742,3238.633,"Well, let me... I'm sorry."
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,3239.865,3256.107,"--Beyond that, peremptory challenges should be exercised and I think constrained only by the Equal Protection Clause by the two adversary partier doing their best to impanel a jury that's going to give favorable consideration to their position."
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.107,3257.738,--Let me give you another example.
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,3262.723,3263.882,"Usually we do it that way, yes."
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3263.882,3268.086,And usually the ones who get in earliest have the greatest likelihood of being selected.
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,3285.089,3290.812,I think that would probably raise a due process concern.
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3290.812,3295.176,"You don't think it would raise an equal protection... I mean, a Sixth Amendment concern?"
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,3295.176,3298.318,I don't think so.
1989.88-5050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3298.769,3305.394,Just a fair trial--
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,3305.394,3307.517,A fair trial--
1989.88-5050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.517,3309.648,--if all the men were on the jury or all--
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,3309.648,3315.521,--What defendant is entitled to and what Petitioner Holland got here is a fair trial.
1989.88-5050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3315.521,3315.931,--Yeah.
1989.88-5050,1,28539,inge_fryklund,,3315.931,3319.324,That is everything that he is entitled to.
1989.88-5050,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3356.019,3358.289,"Thank you, Ms. Fryklund."
