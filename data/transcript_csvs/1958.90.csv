1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,36.764,43.404,"Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices, if it please the Court."
1958.90,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,414.98,417.338,Is that the same judge?
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,417.338,417.9,"No, sir."
1958.90,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,443.215,447.135,"Why -- may I ask, following up the question of my Brother Black."
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,447.135,447.383,"Yes, sir."
1958.90,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,447.383,453.562,Why didn't the -- the matter go to the sentence -- original sentencing judge?
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,453.562,454.562,He did.
1958.90,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,454.562,458.098,"Oh, that's a good answer."
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,458.338,459.541,Judge Kennamer passed on --
1958.90,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,459.541,460.091,I see.
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,460.232,462.28,-- and Judge Frank Johnson was appointed.
1958.90,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,462.28,465.357,"If you win, what do you get?"
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,471.347,471.595,"No, sir."
1958.90,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,476.604,482.667,Do you claim that you're entitled to be turned -- he's entitled to be turned loose or he's entitled to withdraw his plea of guilt and have a new trial?
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,484.293,489.945,Well I claim some other things other than that if it please the Court and which I want to get to right now if I may.
1958.90,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,521.49,524.341,(Inaudible)
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,524.341,528.892,"Well, he is accused, if it please the Court, whether or not it proved or not, it's unless."
1958.90,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,528.892,535.003,(Inaudible)
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,535.003,535.571,"No, sir."
1958.90,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,552.515,563.896,"Are you saying, Mr. Moore that if the indictment itself alleges that in fact the victim was unharmed, there could by no possibility be a capital sentence?"
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,563.896,564.782,"That is correct, sir."
1958.90,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,564.782,573.433,"But if it doesn't say so, there may be a capital sentence although the victim in fact was unharmed."
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,573.433,573.909,"Yes, sir."
1958.90,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,577.85,596.497,"Well I mean if -- if in fact the indictment, there may be a prosecution for and a conviction of the Lindbergh offense and the imposition of a death sentence, although the indictment says nothing about what happened to the victim."
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,596.497,598.119,"Yes, that's what the Parrino case holds --"
1958.90,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,598.119,598.328,Yes.
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,598.328,599.018,-- exactly.
1958.90,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,599.018,608.647,"And therefore -- but if the indictment itself qualifies it by saying that the victim was unharmed, then there couldn't be a capital sentence."
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,608.647,610.785,"That is exactly our contention, sir."
1958.90,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,611.336,619.759,"So I gather from the fact here, an information that was not an indictment, that's the point upon which you rest your challenge to jurisdiction that this should have --"
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,619.759,620.286,That's right.
1958.90,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,620.286,621.229,-- been an --
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,621.229,621.586,And I'm -- and I'm going to tell you --
1958.90,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,621.586,621.997,He should have been indicted.
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,621.997,623.06,"-- why, if I may."
1958.90,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,623.06,623.741,"That is your point, isn't it?"
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,623.741,624.648,Yes.
1958.90,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,631.005,632.964,Because it's a capital offense.
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,632.964,634.397,Because it's a capital offense and the only --
1958.90,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,634.397,641.832,But you prove it -- but you prove it because of what you and I went through of what happens if an indictment is brought.
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,650.849,652.511,"That's right, I know."
1958.90,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,652.511,653.808,(Inaudible)
1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,653.808,654.322,"Yes, sir."

1958.90,0,45584,william_b_moore_jr,,666.057,667.28,"No, sir."
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,1806.103,1814.086,"Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices, may it please the Court."
1958.90,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1859.854,1870.429,Well if this is the information that have been in the form of an indictment and is not on the trial (Inaudible)
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,1870.429,1871.48,If Your Honor please.
1958.90,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1898.996,1901.393,Well then aren't you (Inaudible)
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,1901.393,1902.501,"I'm saying, sir, that if --"
1958.90,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1902.501,1910.927,If it were under such an indictment shows no harm or (Inaudible) and it might be that --
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,1910.927,1935.313,"I would say that if Judge Hand's dictum in that case is right, then the Government is ahead on that point because in the entire case, it is undisputed and that was found both by the lower court and the Court of Appeals that the victim here was released unharmed and there has never been the slightest question as to that."
1958.90,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1979.631,2003.792,"Now suppose Mr. Silverman, he was charged with murder and the Government had no intention of proving anything except a second degree murder because you couldn't prove actual intent and the -- and the fact showed that, could you convict the man on an information rather than an indictment?"
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2003.792,2008.375,"I would say that if the crime of murder is based on premeditation, one would have to allege --"
1958.90,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2008.375,2008.566,"No, no --"
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2008.566,2009.306,In that --
1958.90,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2009.306,2009.557,-- you --
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2009.557,2010.191,-- sir.
1958.90,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2010.191,2015.32,-- you -- you just charge him with murder.
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2015.32,2018.347,I would say that in order to proceed for the --
1958.90,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2018.347,2018.806,(Voice Overlap) --
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2018.806,2020.811,(Voice Overlap) for the more -- for the more serious penalty --
1958.90,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2020.811,2020.898,Yes.
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2020.898,2024.8,-- one should allege the aggravating circumstances surrounding the crime.
1958.90,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2024.8,2025.056,Yes.
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2055.581,2061.268,If I may rephrase my understanding of what you have said before I concede too much.
1958.90,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2095.053,2096.259,Well let me put it this way.
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2154.629,2159.615,I have not read the cases but my offhand reaction would be that you could proceed --
1958.90,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2159.615,2159.992,You could proceed.
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2159.992,2162.482,-- in that fashion and that was in my reaction to your question.
1958.90,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2162.482,2164.297,I just want -- and then get your position.
1958.90,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2164.297,2165.976,There's no position here.
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2180.353,2187.219,"I would say, yes sir except the fact allegation could not be in an information because if you allege the --"
1958.90,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2187.219,2187.534,That's right.
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2187.534,2190.925,"-- capital nature of the crime, it could only be by indictment."
1958.90,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2190.925,2191.286,That's right.
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2197.051,2197.825,"I would think so, sir."
1958.90,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2197.825,2212.072,"But as I understand you, your argument is that or your position is that if it does not judge a capital offense, unless it shows all the ingredients one of which is that the person is released, no person was harmed."
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2212.072,2215.754,"That is the second string to my bow if it please, the Court."
1958.90,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2334.656,2344.12,Your first position then is that a man can be convicted and sentenced to death on an indictment although he's not charged if the person was harmed.
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2344.12,2347.557,My first position is that that is not a necessary Allegation.
1958.90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2370.303,2375.731,Along that the lines of your -- what you're just arguing have you a third string to your bow?
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2385.547,2386.295,"Yes, Sir."
1958.90,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2387.356,2394.84,"Why do you say -- why do you say -- or do you would think that the argument is concluded by saying, this is notice problem."
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2396.533,2396.645,Oh --
1958.90,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2396.645,2397.607,Namely --
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2397.607,2400.075,-- I did not mean to say that the argument was concluded.
1958.90,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2400.075,2401.775,"No, no but that -- is that -- that --"
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2401.775,2402.671,That my feeling is --
1958.90,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2402.671,2403.037,(Voice Overlap)
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2403.037,2414.581,-- that -- my feeling is that sense to a defendant would seem to indicate that one should inform him of the capital nature of the crime without the necessity for --
1958.90,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2414.581,2414.794,There maybe --
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2414.794,2414.908,-- speculation.
1958.90,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2414.908,2429.667,"-- other considerations particular in the federal -- in the federal penal system namely, the role that is expected to be played by -- by the process or the procedure with indictment."
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2490.241,2491.263,"Would or would not, I'm sorry, sir."
1958.90,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2491.263,2492.761,Would not.
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2552.91,2581.314,"If Your Honor please, I -- I certainly agree here that notice is not the only consideration, and that indeed a grand jury certainly if the federal rules have not been adopted one would have serious questions to whether there could ever be a waiver not on a constitutional level because the Gill case get away with that but on the authority of the Government to proceed in a manner other than by indictment."
1958.90,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2585.825,2594.084,"So, we have a problem of construction in the light of the whole tradition of history of prosecutions in the federal system?"
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2594.084,2600.854,I would say sir that I -- I should like to comment at least on one aspect of the formulation that you made.
1958.90,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2674.976,2689.898,"That -- that raises the whole -- of course if you're right, that an indictment charging what this information did could not eventually lead in death that it's the necessary part of the charge."
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2701.835,2713.011,"Well sir, I -- I must repeat again the two of possible three-string argument and I don't mean to be unnecessarily persistent about this."
1958.90,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2732.737,2740.205,"And that statute is -- just reading your statute, I'm inclined to find the convicting proof leading to that conclusion."
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2740.205,2749.919,"If that is right sir, then I submit that in this case there is unquestioned and undoubted evidence or undisputed evidence."
1958.90,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2798.78,2799.719,I -- I'm --
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2799.719,2800.281,Sir?
1958.90,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2800.281,2815.621,-- very low to go beyond the necessities of the case usually but it strikes me as it'd be highly undesirable to have this case go off just on the facts in this case and leave up in the air whether informations may be filed in these cases.
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2817.785,2818.503,"That's perfectly true, sir."
1958.90,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2818.503,2836.164,"(A) -- (a) is it necessary to be charged and if it's included in his deed that it was not necessary to be charged, then is the offense, that which kidnapping with all the possible consequences and therefore not is a measure of punishment and not part of the offense."
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2836.164,2848.359,"Well if you all please -- if as I believe your -- your remarks suggest, the Court may become interested in the broader problem here presented."
1958.90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2892.67,2899.009,But where is the hardship there really?It's just a difference of whether he's languishing in jail or languishing in prison isn't it?
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2899.009,2909.018,"Well, the -- the hardship here, Mr. Justice Stewart, but a man gets no credit for time in the federal system, prior to his sentence."
1958.90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2960.656,2960.839,(Voice Overlap) --
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2960.839,2962.064,-- the notes of the --
1958.90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2962.064,2964.476,-- districts where the grand jury meets maybe twice a year.
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2964.476,2969.513,Exactly sir and that was pointed out as the reason for rule set that.
1958.90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2969.513,2969.672,That is right now.
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,2969.672,2970.94,-- is permitting the waiver.
1958.90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2970.94,3012.566,"That now as the Rule 7 also expressed that considered public policy that in cases where the punishment might be execution, that this inconvenience and this hardship of being in jail as long as five or six months is countered -- more than counter-balanced by the importance and necessity of having a man charged with an offense as serious as that only by action of the -- of the grand jury and -- almost weighing the -- the gravity of the eventual punishment against the -- a few months in jail as a -- as a de minimis situation in that kind of an offense."
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3012.566,3022.001,"Mr. Justice, having formulated the proposition in those terms, I can't but agree but I believe that you would perhaps assume the -- the conclusion in the formulation."
1958.90,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3030.135,3031.535,May I ask you please?
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3031.535,3031.875,Sir?
1958.90,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3031.875,3053.731,"As far as the policy is concerned, do you think anything in your argument that would make it wrong for the Government to have the information of this (Inaudible) to say that the -- the victim was released unharmed and with the Government be bound by that if it said it that's how he'd be guilty and guilty too if that's what was said."
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3054.318,3054.577,(Voice Overlap)
1958.90,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3054.577,3061.458,(Voice Overlap) why wouldn't that be a better way of preserving the rights of the party that you're talking on the present policy?
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3061.458,3082.325,I would say that the necessity for letting -- for -- for alleging the lesser of the two possible aspects of the crime is at least to my untutored ear not a -- the -- the best way to approach the problem of the giving of -- telling a man what it is he is charged with.
1958.90,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3083.751,3083.836,But --
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3083.836,3086.819,"-- in terms of, you are charged with the greater crime."
1958.90,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3086.819,3099.093,"In my untutored mind, I can think of nothing better than charging a man in information with that but he's charged with namely kidnapping somebody and turned him loose without harming him --"
1958.90,1,35114,leon_silverman,,3099.093,3099.299,I --
