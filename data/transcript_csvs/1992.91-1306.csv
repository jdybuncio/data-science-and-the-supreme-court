1992.91-1306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.57,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-1306, United States v. Guy W. Olano."
1992.91-1306,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,53.468,56.836,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,114.84,120.409,Isn't that rather an unusual thing for a judge or a chief judge to do?
1992.91-1306,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,120.409,128.014,"I don't think so, Justice Blackmun, although we concede, Justice Blackmun, that this was a violation of the Federal rules."
1992.91-1306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,171.942,174.292,"General Starr, can I just interrupt you?"
1992.91-1306,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,189.452,191.57,--I don't exaggerate the point.
1992.91-1306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,194.772,195.005,Talking about the Federal system only.
1992.91-1306,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,195.005,210.198,"Yes, Justice Stevens, it is my understanding that judges, for example in the Northern District of Illinois have engaged in this practice and do engage in the practice, and that judges in the Northern District of California engage in the practice."
1992.91-1306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,230.492,233.211,"But then, but you have conceded that it's error?"
1992.91-1306,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,233.211,234.146,Absolutely.
1992.91-1306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,234.146,236.446,And that the practice is improper and should be stopped.
1992.91-1306,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,236.446,245.519,"It should be stopped, and I think the way to do that, Justice Stevens, is through the vehicle, I think the didactic quality of an opinion issuing from this Court will be helpful."
1992.91-1306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,274.704,276.973,But the problem is very easily solved.
1992.91-1306,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,281.794,282.527,--That is correct.
1992.91-1306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,284.36,288.912,"So really, if you had a clear rule we shouldn't have this problem in the future."
1992.91-1306,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,292.514,303.453,"Oh, I fully disagree with that because if this is plain error, if this is noted as plain error then this Court will have affected a transformation of plain error law."
1992.91-1306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,376.465,385.321,"But then the message, the educating message you want to convey is that although it violates the rule and it's plain in that sense, there's no sanction if you do it."
1992.91-1306,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,385.321,389.308,--There is no sanction in the sense of a reversal of a conviction--
1992.91-1306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,389.308,389.558,Right.
1992.91-1306,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,389.558,391.058,"--because of this, yes, Justice Stevens."
1992.91-1306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,391.058,392.676,But what other sanction would there be?
1992.91-1306,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,392.676,393.56,I think--
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1512.154,1517.207,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1306,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1595.291,1599.278,"That's because, Mr. Phillips, it was, this procedure was consented to."
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1599.278,1604.48,"--As to Mr. Olano, counsel did not object."
1992.91-1306,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1609.265,1612.9,To me that isn't all that clear that that was an objection.
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1615.336,1623.839,"You could read that a couple of different ways, Mr. Chief Justice, but you know it's interesting, the Government in the first two submissions to this Court read it the same way we read it, which was as an objection."
1992.91-1306,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1632.261,1634.13,At that time it was an objection.
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1634.13,1635.697,"At that time it was an objection, Your Honor."
1992.91-1306,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.697,1639.784,But eventually counsel subsided.
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1639.784,1641.101,Eventually counsel subsided.
1992.91-1306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1650.207,1653.909,Maybe it goes to all this confusion at the end of a long trial that we heard so much about.
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1653.909,1654.859,"I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?"
1992.91-1306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.859,1659.994,Maybe it goes to all this confusion at the end of a long trial when everybody is harassed and trying to get finished up that we heard so much about.
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1659.994,1661.096,"It may well go to that, Your Honor."
1992.91-1306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.096,1663.329,All errors can be forgiven under that context.
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1663.329,1664.298,"Under that standard, that is true."
1992.91-1306,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1688.263,1699.869,"I understood him to argue that even if this was a substantial error under 152(b) it wasn't, it was error to notice it--"
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1699.869,1700.321,That's correct.
1992.91-1306,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.271,1706.558,--unless it also was a much more serious error than just affecting substantial rights.
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1706.558,1707.958,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-1306,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1725.103,1725.436,But he's--
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1725.436,1728.369,The court of appeals exercised its discretion and noticed this one.
1992.91-1306,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1728.369,1737.41,"--I understand that he, he said that it was error to notice it even though it might affect substantial rights."
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1742.961,1744.063,"Well, I just wanted--"
1992.91-1306,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1744.063,1745.547,And you certainly disagree with him.
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1745.547,1754.336,"--I certainly disagree with him, but I do want to kind of take these in sort of seriatim stages to determine in the first instance do we have a substantial right."
1992.91-1306,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1761.073,1764.292,Why don't you go seriatim when you're arguing before nine people?
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1766.227,1769.762,"I have noticed that over time, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-1306,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1769.762,1775.297,You notice our error every time?
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1775.297,1775.916,No comment.
1992.91-1306,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1914.417,1923.023,"Well, Mr. Phillips, what if one of the jurors had not been properly sworn and that was never objected to."
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1928.391,1931.629,I wouldn't necessarily say that it was reversible per se.
1992.91-1306,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2043.045,2055.186,"Well you, surely the Ninth Circuit could stop it by simply saying that we don't want anybody to do it in this circuit any more without reversing a judgment that took 3 months to get tried."
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2055.186,2061.273,I don't know how you could say it any more plainly than the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure say it.
1992.91-1306,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2101.334,2108.237,"Well, Mr. Phillips, are we going to sustain that or not depending on an abuse of discretion standard?"
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2108.237,2111.439,I would urge this Court to follow an abuse of discretion standard.
1992.91-1306,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2122.747,2131.417,So plain... but you accept as a general rule that all plain error questions are reviewable simply on an abuse standard?
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2131.417,2132.103,In the... yes.
1992.91-1306,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2143.375,2144.958,So it's the point of may that gets--
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2144.958,2145.258,--Yes.
1992.91-1306,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2145.258,2148.927,--Did the court of appeals here say that it was exercising discretion?
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2148.927,2149.862,I'm sorry.
1992.91-1306,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2149.862,2157.099,Did the court of appeals here say that it was exercising discretion or does this opinion indicate that dismissal is mandatory?
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2157.099,2171.691,"It was analyzing the full range of considerations, including the weight attached to the advisory committee's condemnation of this particular practice and the fact, against the background of course of--"
1992.91-1306,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2171.691,2179.195,Is it a fair reading of the opinion to say that the court of appeals thought that it was exercising a discretion in this particular case?
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2179.195,2191.439,"--I don't believe the Ninth Circuit says specifically that it was exercising discretion in this particular case, although again I think it's inherent in any analysis of the plain error rule which says that you may notice."
1992.91-1306,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2200.461,2206.013,"Well, it would be rather difficult for us to sustain a judgment on the basis of a discretion that wasn't exercised."
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2206.013,2217.82,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, this is not a case where you are reviewing a judgment or a decision by an administrative agency where you would focus specifically on the record before the agency and the grounds asserted by it."
1992.91-1306,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2227.992,2234.229,"Well, suppose the court of appeals had said we have no choice in this matter but to reverse the conviction."
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2235.562,2240.55,Then it seems to me it would be appropriate to remand it to the court of appeals for the exercise of discretion.
1992.91-1306,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2261.796,2269.485,Do you know if there are cases in the court of appeals where the court of appeals say that they have discretion under this rule?
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2269.485,2271.002,Under rule 52?
1992.91-1306,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2271.002,2271.802,Yes.
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2271.802,2285.526,"I don't know of any frankly right off the top of my head in terms of rule 52 itself, but again it seems to me it's plain from the precise language of the rule that they have to, they have to exercise some discretion."
1992.91-1306,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2299.286,2306.106,Did the Ninth Circuit's opinion refer in terms to rule 52?
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2306.106,2309.058,"Off the top of my head... I mean, I'm assuming that it must have."
1992.91-1306,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2317.378,2321.366,"Well, did it, did the opinion really talk in terms of plain error?"
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2330.804,2336.541,"That may well be the precise, I mean that may be a distillation of the court of appeals' opinion, but again--"
1992.91-1306,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2336.541,2350.183,"Well, that, I think that's rather important because if the court of appeals doesn't refer to rule 52 or even if it doesn't refer to the may language in rule 52, I think it's hard to say they're exercising their discretion."
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2350.183,2359.907,"--Well, there is at least language in the court of appeals' analysis that says that it's undertaking to analyze this in terms, I gather, of rule 52."
1992.91-1306,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2389.158,2410.939,"Well, but if we're talking about discretion in the first place can we say as, can we say that we would... are you saying we should have reversed a court of appeals which affirmed this conviction after going through the same analysis and saying we choose not to notice it?"
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2410.939,2431.852,"Well, there is no question that there would have to be an independent analysis of the considerations that go into it, which is what I was trying to do here, is to say what supports the decision of the court of appeals to notice this error and then what would weigh on the other side, and is there such an abuse in this context that it would justify saying the court of appeals could not have noticed this error under these circumstances."
1992.91-1306,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.852,2436.238,What if the court of appeals didn't know that it had any discretion?
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2442.125,2455.052,"I think that's the same question Justice Kennedy asked, and I hope I'll be consistent, but I think the answer to that is if they say we're not exercising discretion because we believe we don't have any, then it would be appropriate for this Court to remand for the court to exercise its discretion."
1992.91-1306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2455.052,2456.118,But that's really not what they said.
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2460.254,2461.139,"Yes, that's correct."
1992.91-1306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2461.139,2467.11,"And one reason was that you can't always tell what happens case-by-case, so they adopt really a per se rule for this kind of error."
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2467.11,2468.443,"For this kind, but I think that--"
1992.91-1306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.443,2473.179,"But that is, one could argue that's an exercise of discretion for a class of errors."
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2473.179,2495.193,"--Yes, I think that is an exercise of discretion for the kind of structural errors that I was trying to identify a minute ago, that there are two different kinds of errors that this Court has recognized, some of which it is unwilling to notice, those are trial errors where it can evaluate the affect of the error on the outcome of the case, and others are structural errors where the Court has been much more reluctant to simply shunt those aside and say that they don't count."
1992.91-1306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2495.193,2506.732,"Well, but for that, then what you were talking about earlier, the inconsistency of the verdict, the fact that five defendants were just set free because there was no evidence, that's all irrelevant."
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2506.732,2507.334,It's not irrelevant.
1992.91-1306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2507.967,2509.784,"Well, for that theory it is."
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2509.784,2510.786,"--Oh, sure, on that theory."
1992.91-1306,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2686.746,2690.865,"Well, you can't prove it, but there are still degrees of plausibility."
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2715.746,2718.932,"Yes, Justice Souter, I think you can take that into account."
1992.91-1306,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2807.721,2810.656,Was rule 52 in effect at the time of Brasfield?
1992.91-1306,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2810.656,2813.091,"--No, Your Honor, rule 52 wasn't in effect."
1992.91-1306,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2839.858,2841.741,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
1992.91-1306,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2845.127,2846.495,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-1306,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2937.271,2947.96,"General Starr, I guess you're urging us to find that this doesn't rise to the level of a plain error recognizable under rule 52?"
1992.91-1306,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2947.96,2948.646,Yes.
1992.91-1306,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2948.646,2953.948,"But if it did, you would say subject it to a harmless error analysis?"
1992.91-1306,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2953.948,2959.233,"Well, plain error in the sense of obvious, I think it does satisfy that."
1992.91-1306,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3016.151,3018.019,"General Starr, can I interrupt just for one question?"
1992.91-1306,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3028.14,3028.524,Yes.
1992.91-1306,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3031.476,3034.026,So it has to be at least less than whatever that standard is.
1992.91-1306,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3034.026,3037.311,--That is correct.
1992.91-1306,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3046.917,3049.083,"Well, that's why I used the word miscarriage of justice."
1992.91-1306,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3051.719,3058.022,--But it is also the standard that this Court has articulated in Frady itself as to what this is all about.
1992.91-1306,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3058.022,3059.557,Then what's the difference?
1992.91-1306,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3059.557,3077.602,"It's difficult to say, but it seems to me, because the Court has not elaborately articulated what it is, I do think, despite, if I may say so with all respect, the looseness of the language, that rule 52(b) is aimed at getting at miscarriages of justice."
