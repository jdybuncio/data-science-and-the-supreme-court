1993.92-1402,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.439,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-1402, C A Carbone, Inc., v. the Town of Clarkstown, New York."
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,11.689,14.724,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1402,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,78.13,81.582,"Ms. Christian, what sections of the ordinance are you attacking?"
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,81.582,84.968,--We are primarily attacking section 5.
1993.92-1402,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,107.149,109.116,Thank you.
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,109.116,110.782,The designated--
1993.92-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,110.782,110.932,Excuse me.
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,118.472,125.876,"--I think, from the standpoint of constitutional analysis, Justice Scalia, it is also invalid under this Court's prior decisions."
1993.92-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.709,129.161,You don't care.
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,129.161,131.077,--The... precisely.
1993.92-1402,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,137.565,144.087,"Well, now, Ms. Christian, you started to tell us how the ordinance applies."
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,149.705,150.157,Yes--
1993.92-1402,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.157,157.978,--Or is it a matter of requiring you to pay the charge before you ship it out?
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,157.978,166.833,--The city prohibits petitioners from shipping the trash directly to out-of-State users or landfills.
1993.92-1402,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.833,178.741,"But after it's sorted and in the city's facility, or processed in the city's facility, and if you pay the charge to the city, then can you ship what remains out?"
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,178.741,191.049,"As... as we understand the ordinance as it has been interpreted by the city, the petitioners are required, after they have processed and baled the trash, to deliver it to the designated transfer facility."
1993.92-1402,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.182,227.24,And the petitioners are in the business of disposing of waste and they can do it more cheaply if they don't have to submit it to the town processing.
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,228.623,247.668,"--It is less expensive for the out-of-State customers of petitioners, and with respect to petitioners the Clarkstown ordinance, in effect, adds an expense of 81 for every ton of nonrecyclable trash."
1993.92-1402,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,247.668,262.26,"--Now, does the town impose that if you pick up waste from another... from outside the town and simply transport it through the town without any further treatment?"
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,262.26,263.394,"Well, petitioners--"
1993.92-1402,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.394,264.296,Does it apply to that?
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,264.296,268.331,"--It apparently does not apply to that, but, in fact, petitioners do not do that."
1993.92-1402,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,271.633,272.216,In the town.
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,272.216,273.049,In the town.
1993.92-1402,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,296.296,296.58,"Okay, all right."
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,300.665,307.985,"But the... that is correct, but the constitutional flaw is the export ban itself, the local processing requirement."
1993.92-1402,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,318.174,331.081,"Well, are there some municipal functions that the municipality can undertake as a monopoly and impose its will on everyone, like sewage disposal or something of that kind?"
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,331.081,333.45,"Certainly, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-1402,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,333.45,334.266,Can a municipality have a monopoly?
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,334.266,344.241,"Well, a municipality certainly, if it wished to take on the job of trash collection itself, could take the trash wherever it wants to take it."
1993.92-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,380.847,396.94,"In your view, if the city engaged in the hypothetical function that you were just discussing with Justice O'Connor, so that it owned the trash facility and collected it, could it enforce its monopoly by a criminal sanction?"
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,402.261,414.902,"I think we have to draw a distinction between a city that merely operates the transfer station itself as a municipal facility, and a city that also collects the trash."
1993.92-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,414.902,415.902,Assume the latter.
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,415.902,421.972,"If the city itself collects the trash, then it can take the trash wherever it wants."
1993.92-1402,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,433.364,450.925,"Well, what if New York law changed the provision that allowed the petitioner to have a license, and New York law said that individual municipalities can operate monopoly trash disposal, or organizations?"
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,450.925,463.316,"I think the issue there, Mr. Chief Justice, would be whether or not that is an appropriate subject for public utility regulation as a monopoly, and that would bring into play a totally different set of requirements."
1993.92-1402,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,463.732,465.599,"Well, that's not a constitutional question, is it?"
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,465.599,468.701,--That would primarily be a question of State law.
1993.92-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,481.194,493.917,Suppose in this case the city had advertised widely for bids for a transfer facility and awarded the transfer facility to an out-of-State company at an out-of-State site?
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,501.255,513.313,"I think that you would for this reason, because it would still prohibit the export of trash out of the State to any other point in interstate commerce, to any point other than the designated transfer facility."
1993.92-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,513.313,518.597,Would you call that protectionism or simply the State exceeding its appropriate jurisdiction?
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,518.597,528.238,"I think I would call that protectionism, because it... at least if, as in this case, the result is to confer a direct benefit on the town and its residents."
1993.92-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.7,586.223,"Ms. Christian, I don't gather that the Commerce Clause permits a State to favor commerce with one State over commerce with other States."
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,586.223,587.889,--That would be our point exactly.
1993.92-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.889,590.091,It's just a matter of favoring your own.
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,595.626,609.35,"I believe that this Court has struck down reciprocity requirements in the past that were limited in such a way that they are, in effect, prohibiting the export to any States other than the favored State."
1993.92-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,609.35,623.424,"Ms. Christian, did I understand your answer to Justice O'Connor was essentially that the town isn't doing enough to escape from this Commerce Clause check?"
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,638.333,640.785,"I don't think that's quite correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-1402,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,744.817,747.518,"Because there was a discrimination in those cases too, wasn't there?"
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,747.518,752.72,--There was a different treatment in those cases of local and out-of-town trash.
1993.92-1402,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,769.48,771.563,So you're really... you're basically just making... I shouldn't say just.
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,774.182,779.467,"--I think this is more of a burden on interstate commerce, yes, that is correct, Justice Souter."
1993.92-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,793.059,793.642,You don't--
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,797.427,799.76,I think it may be hard to draw the line between--
1993.92-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.76,800.027,"I'm sorry to hear that, because--"
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,800.027,802.895,--Discrimination against and burden on interstate commerce.
1993.92-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,805.645,807.18,--I know... you've said it's a burden.
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,809.882,824.641,"--I think it's probably a discrimination against petitioners' out-of-State customers who are required to undergo additional processing after their trash has already been processed and baled, at the designated facility."
1993.92-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,833.997,836.747,Well why isn't it a discrimination against exporters?
1993.92-1402,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,837.199,840.984,I think it is a discrimination against exporters.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,1490.689,1496.376,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1562.699,1563.449,Mr. Brashares.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,1563.449,1563.699,Yes.
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.699,1565.282,I don't understand what you're saying.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,1584.91,1588.194,"Well, Your Honor, I think this is what the Maine against Taylor case is probably all about."
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.361,1618.444,"Well, but it has to be reasonable."
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,1624.598,1624.681,--Well--
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1624.681,1634.453,"I mean, I don't know that our Commerce Clause law says that the only invalid restrictions upon interstate commerce are those that are imposed for protectionist purposes."
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,1634.453,1642.643,"--Well, Your Honor, I think... I think I am putting together, and I think appropriately so, protectionism and discrimination on a geographic basis."
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.442,1844.959,But all of these are legislative judgments.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,1850.594,1851.677,"No, there certain is, Your Honor."
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1851.677,1855.129,"So somebody says I want to take it to another plant; it's cheaper, it's out of State."
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,1857.412,1858.514,"Well, Justice--"
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1858.514,1861.049,Why is that not a discrimination against interstate commerce?
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,1861.049,1868.286,"--Well, Justice Scalia, first of all, there is no classification which in any way separates interstate commerce from local commerce."
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.136,1873.636,Dean Milk establishes that that makes no difference.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,1882.123,1885.241,"--Yes, but, Judge, there's no... there's no city line or county line discrimination involved here."
1993.92-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1936.322,1939.007,"Yes, but wasn't that just dealing with locally generated waste?"
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,1939.007,1950.064,"Well, Justice Stevens, the record in that case does not show that any waste was coming in from anywhere or was going out to anywhere."
1993.92-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1962.121,1970.608,"Well, all I can suggest is if it doesn't tell us whether there was any nonlocally generated waste involved, the case really doesn't address the precise issue that your opponent is raising here."
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,1970.608,1973.642,"Well, Your Honor, I think... I think it does address it in this sense."
1993.92-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.323,2029.507,"Well, it isn't the point that it's moving out."
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2061.293,2061.793,Well--
1993.92-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.793,2064.496,If you make the outside people pay more than they otherwise would pay.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2064.496,2073.435,"--Well, Your Honor, no, I don't think it... I don't... well, whether it's a burden... certainly, everything that raises the costs of parties operating in commerce is arguably a burden."
1993.92-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2079.922,2084.791,"See, it can't be justified by your need to control and dispose... have a total monopoly of all locally generated waste."
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2084.791,2087.826,"No, absolutely, Your Honor, I believe it can be justified by the... the town's need."
1993.92-1402,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2125.082,2138.14,"Well, we'll agree with you that you had to close down the landfill for environmental purposes, but it doesn't follow that you have an environmental purpose for this restriction if you can accomplish the same purpose by health and safety regulations, and I thought you said a moment ago that you could."
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2138.14,2146.059,"Well, Justice Souter, I would submit that those are relevant questions to raise in the context of whether there's a rational basis for the regulation."
1993.92-1402,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2158.015,2163.717,"Well, it's not a Commerce Clause issue unless you've got a justification for your burden, and this is your only justification."
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2168.704,2198.973,"Well, Your Honor, if it is a... if it is a regulation which has passed muster under the... under the Fourteenth Amendment, if it is deemed to have a rational basis, and the question then is does it, nevertheless, violate the Commerce Clause because of a burden that it imposes; I think when you get into weighing that burden against the legitimate purposes of the law, we're going back and reevaluating under the... under the rational basis."
1993.92-1402,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2198.973,2199.856,"Well, I'm not sure we are."
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2209.328,2209.828,I agree.
1993.92-1402,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2211.244,2213.827,And I thought... but I thought... I thought you were assuming just the opposite in what you said a moment ago.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2213.827,2213.994,"--No, Your Honor, no."
1993.92-1402,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2240.19,2240.407,Uh-hum.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2240.407,2252.014,"We have the unprotected interests, and they are not participating in the political process that produced that regulation, and therefore they should not be bound by the substantive due process determination that the Court has made in that case."
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.111,2273.777,I don't understand.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2283.733,2284.919,"Well, Your Honor--"
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2284.919,2287.102,--You can prohibit your local citizens.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2294.256,2296.123,"--No, no, Your Honor, I'm not saying that you can prohibit them."
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2311.3,2311.583,Why not?
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2315.168,2315.418,"--No, Your Honor."
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2334.26,2339.08,--Every local person has to buy at the Clarksburg shopping mall.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2356.606,2366.361,"--Well, Your Honor, if I may, I think... I think the hypothetical of all people must buy at the local supermarket, I think that would never get to the Commerce Clause; that would fall under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1993.92-1402,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2415.723,2420.711,And one of the... I think one of our problems is we're still not sure what those police power reasons are.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2424.578,2426.195,"--No, no, Your Honor, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--"
1993.92-1402,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2426.195,2429.28,--We assume... we all accept that the city gets an economic benefit.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2435.784,2438.802,"--Well, Your Honor, one of the reasons is the ability to monitor... monitor the waste."
1993.92-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2453.043,2453.276,Wait a minute.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2458.561,2468.536,"--Your Honor, it requires the town to have recycling laws and it... I don't believe it mandates a particular... it certainly doesn't mandate the full control."
1993.92-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2468.536,2472.821,"Well, but it doesn't mandate... it doesn't mandate the town to go out and inspect other facilities other than its own, does it?"
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2472.821,2476.022,I'm sorry... does it mandate?
1993.92-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2476.022,2486.83,"This ordinance, or New York law does not require Clarkstown to monitor what happens to its trash in facilities that are outside of its jurisdiction, does it?"
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2486.83,2501.34,"Well, the permit granted by the State to the Clarkstown transfer station requires it to make certain that the facilities to which the waste goes from the transfer station are properly permitted and appropriate facilities."
1993.92-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2502.19,2504.356,"Yes, but that can... that can be handled by other facilities."
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2508.344,2537.244,"--Well, Your Honor, the basic issue of is there an environmental justification for a city controlled, city monopolized transfer station, again I don't think... I think if that judgment is made under the Fourteenth Amendment that there is a rational basis for the city to use that method to advance a legitimate interest in the environment, the local environment, then I don't... I don't believe we go back and reevaluate that under the Commerce Clause."
1993.92-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2576.904,2580.773,"Well, but our civilization has advanced to the point where garbage is valuable."
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2580.773,2581.423,--Your Honor--
1993.92-1402,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2613.309,2623.099,"Well, do you rest your argument in part, then, on the notion that what is left, and what is at issue here, has no value and is not an article of commerce?"
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2623.099,2635.073,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't rest on that, because I think that the economic protectionism analysis that I've been through I think suffices for an affirmance of this case."
1993.92-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2711.538,2712.954,Can you help me with one factual matter?
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2730.147,2730.666,That's correct.
1993.92-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2730.666,2735.201,"And they say there's some practical reason why they can't do it, some 24-hour limit and so forth."
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2739.903,2743.705,"Your Honor, there's nothing in the record which suggests it's not practically feasible."
1993.92-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2744.471,2748.339,"And as far as you're concerned, representing the town, that would be perfectly lawful if they were willing to do it?"
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2748.339,2749.089,"--Yes, yes."
1993.92-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.089,2760.778,"And then do you draw the conclusion for that... for that reason, after the garbage is separated you are entitled to look at the nonrecyclable residue as locally generated because it was generated within the town?"
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2760.778,2761.23,That's right.
1993.92-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2761.23,2761.896,That's your theory.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2761.896,2762.229,That's right.
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2870.371,2872.287,But why is this case any different from Dean Milk.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2895.032,2897.049,"--Well, Your Honor, I think--"
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2897.049,2899.501,Would that be allowed anymore than--
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2899.501,2905.405,--If the law... I believe... I believe if the law said that the town has contracted for a plant--
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2905.405,2907.055,--To pasteurize milk.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2907.055,2907.524,--To pasteurize.
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2913.226,2913.795,There is.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2917.297,2918.213,--Absolutely.
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2918.213,2924.7,And the city says we can be sure that the pasteurization is being done properly if it's being done in this plant which we will supervise.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2924.7,2924.833,That's right.
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2924.833,2927.951,"So you think that that's the only problem there, was with Dean Milk, that the--"
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2927.951,2929.035,"Well, Your Honor, I think the problem with Dean Milk--"
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.035,2930.737,--City didn't require it to be pasteurized in its own plant.
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2930.737,2939.926,"--No, Your Honor, I think the problem with Dean Milk was that there was a sorting of private interest based upon the proximity to the city."
1993.92-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2961.57,2962.086,Mr. Brashares--
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,2981.282,2989.637,"Your Honor, if the Clarkstown law specified that all garbage had to be processed within 5 miles of Clarkstown, it would be unconstitutional."
1993.92-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2989.637,3006.765,"Mr. Brashares, before you... your red light goes on, I wanted to be clear that, in bringing up what Justice O'Connor asked your opponent, you are not relying, as some of your amici have been, on congressional permission?"
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,3006.765,3008.565,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-1402,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3074.474,3076.176,"Well, what was... what was that quotation from?"
1993.92-1402,1,43947,william_c_brashares,,3076.176,3083.746,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, that was from Norfolk Southern against Oberly, which is 822 Fed 2nd, page 388."
1993.92-1402,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3149.851,3151.935,"Thank you, Mr. Brashares."
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3154.537,3157.572,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1402,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.245,3195.28,Because that transfer station is within 5 miles of Clarkstown?
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3195.28,3196.196,--It is within Clarkstown.
1993.92-1402,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3196.196,3198.196,But may I ask a question?
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3198.196,3207.318,I believe there was a question to respondents if it would be valid if it... if the law required processing within 5 miles of Clarkstown.
1993.92-1402,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3210.17,3214.622,But is it correct that there... that the processing itself violates the ordinance?
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3219.824,3226.061,It is not what... it is not the processing done by--
1993.92-1402,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3226.061,3227.444,You don't violate the ordinance just by processing it--
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3227.444,3228.144,--No.
1993.92-1402,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3228.144,3231.882,--So long as you ship the residue over to their facility and pay them 81 a ton as a tipping fee.
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3231.882,3234.515,"That's right, and pay them 81 a ton, but for the processing."
1993.92-1402,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3234.515,3236.517,So you're not objecting to... you're not objecting to any restriction on process.
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3236.517,3237.034,No.
1993.92-1402,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3246.724,3247.224,And that's--
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3247.224,3247.424,It is--
1993.92-1402,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3247.424,3249.524,--That's the disposal of the... of the residue?
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3249.524,3252.276,--We don't know what they would do when they receive it.
1993.92-1402,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3258.246,3264.769,But am I correct that the 81 a ton doesn't have any impact at all on the portion of your business that deals with recyclable garbage?
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3264.769,3271.255,--The ordinance itself permits the recyclables to be shipped directly outside of... out of State.
1993.92-1402,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3271.255,3273.541,So you can continue to do that as long as you pay the 81 on the residue?
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3273.541,3274.457,That is correct.
1993.92-1402,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3275.373,3282.111,They why isn't the residue locally generated waste if it produced by the recycling that takes place within the community?
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3282.111,3284.313,--For one specific reason.
1993.92-1402,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3326.989,3328.889,"Well, you--"
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3333.81,3335.845,"No, that is not our position."
1993.92-1402,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3345.834,3350.521,It applies to discarded trash and you say we don't discard.
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3352.638,3354.89,"--Not quite, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-1402,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3393.529,3395.681,"Thank you, Mrs. Christian."
1993.92-1402,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3395.681,3396.115,Thank you.
1993.92-1402,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3396.115,3398.031,The case is submitted.
