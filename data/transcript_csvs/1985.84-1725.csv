1985.84-1725,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.061,The Court will hear arguments first this morning in United States v. the city of Fulton.
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,10.809,14.636,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1725,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,194.5,200.763,"Mr. Pincus, what exactly do you mean by the term FERC?"
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,200.763,208.12,"Yes, the rates... the rates are proposed by the SWPA or the other... any other power marketing administration."
1985.84-1725,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,224.408,233.734,"What the Assistant Secretary was asking for is the pattern that was familiar with the Interstate Commerce Commission when tariffs were filed, was it not?"
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,244.386,259.553,"Well, this case, this case is... in the Interstate Commerce Commission example, and indeed, in private utility regulation, the utility typically files a rate which will take effect but is subject to suspension by the relevant regulatory body."
1985.84-1725,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,259.553,261.957,Subject to refunds.
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,264.847,267.595,I don't believe that it's impounded.
1985.84-1725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.765,322.181,"Mr. Pincus, do you think that the statute and the contract in question would permit a retroactive rate increase?"
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,326.415,331.82,"We haven't taken that position, and that question isn't presented in this case."
1985.84-1725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.82,357.574,"I notice that, I notice that the language of the contract says that there can be a change in the rates to increase, decrease, modify or change them, and they will become effective on the date specified in the order, and I just wondered if the government had ever taken the position that that would permit a retroactive increase."
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,357.574,360.213,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor, and that's not what we're contending here."
1985.84-1725,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,390.061,398.183,"You say it took 33 months between the time of the promulgation of the tentative rate or the interim, and the final approval?"
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,398.183,425.625,"Yes, Your Honor, and that long delay is the problem that the Secretary faces in trying to recoup the cost of electricity for that what Respondents... the result that for which Respondents contend would have deprived the government of the incremental revenue for that entire 33 month period and essentially given them a windfall of paying rates that had already been determined to be below cost for that entire period of time."
1985.84-1725,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,425.625,428.062,"Are delays of that length, is that the usual?"
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,428.062,433.996,"I understand from the Department of Energy, Your Honor, that the process has been speeded up somewhat--"
1985.84-1725,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,433.996,434.62,To what?
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,434.62,435.542,--since these early days.
1985.84-1725,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,435.542,439.119,How much have they cut it back?
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,439.119,458.612,"I don't have the specific amount of time, but I gather that it no longer takes approximately three years to place rates into effect, but the delay still can be substantial, and there's no reason why interim rates can't be placed in effect since Respondents essentially suffer no harm because if the rate is subsequently found to be too high, they are entitled to a refund."
1985.84-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,468.967,485.413,"Well of course, if you are right on your interpretation of the Energy Act, in that the Secretary has... in that you claim the Act gives the Secretary complete ratemaking power."
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,485.413,488.099,"Yes, Your Honor, we contend--"
1985.84-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,488.099,494.081,And he's created his own problem by giving final approval to the FERC.
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,494.081,498.502,"--Well, Your Honor, we don't think it's a problem because we don't think that--"
1985.84-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,498.502,503.374,"Well, it is, it is if, it is if you say that, if there's a long delay."
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,504.999,519.961,"--Well, that's true, Your Honor, but what the additional review does is impose safeguards for taxpayers' rights to revenues that recoup costs and also safeguards respondents' rights by giving them an additional review to ensure that rates aren't too high."
1985.84-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,522.18,524.569,"And here the FERC raised the rates, didn't it?"
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,524.569,533.722,"The FERC at first thought that the Assistant Secretary was wrong and that the rates were too low, and it subsequently was convinced, upon getting some more information, that the rates were appropriate."
1985.84-1725,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,533.722,539.532,Is there any doubt about the FERC's authority to raise as well as to lower the proposed rate?
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,539.532,543.717,"Your Honor, the FERC cannot... can only approve or disapprove a rate."
1985.84-1725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,561.819,573.127,The... do you contend that the language of the contract goes no further than the language of the statute itself?
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,573.127,574.487,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1985.84-1725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,582.842,585.043,Because the language is a bit different.
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,615.142,616.095,"Of the contracts, Your Honor?"
1985.84-1725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,616.095,618.093,"No, of the statute which I read to you."
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,618.093,636.68,"We believe, we believe that the Secretary of Energy is substituted for the Federal Power Commission in the statute, that the Department of Energy Organization Act provides that except for authority, that with respect to authority previously possessed by the Federal Power Commission, it's basically divided into two parts."
1985.84-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,676.882,683.176,"And the FERC's in the Act at all, you claim, just by the will of the Secretary."
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,683.176,688.487,"Exactly, Your Honor, and I should point out that Respondents in their brief do not take a different position."
1985.84-1725,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,701.436,710.652,"I gather the Fifth Circuit agreed with your position, did it not?"
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,710.652,711.589,"Yes, the Fifth Circuit--"
1985.84-1725,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,711.589,715.619,And expressly disagreed with the Court of Claims' holding in this case.
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,715.619,716.805,"--Yes, Justice Brennan."
1985.84-1725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,920.754,935.623,"Mr. Pincus, what evidence is there that under the old scheme, before there was a Department of Energy, that the Federal Power Authority interpreted the Act as giving it the power to set interim rates?"
1985.84-1725,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,935.623,952.302,"Your Honor, there are three examples, three cases in which the Federal Power Commission did set rates into effect on an interim basis, one example under this statute, one example under the very similar language of the statutes governing the Bonneville power projects."
1985.84-1725,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1173.464,1174.354,Very well.
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,1188.256,1191.927,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1725,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1228.959,1229.583,Mr. Wheatley--
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,1229.583,1230.192,Yes.
1985.84-1725,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1230.192,1241.345,"--do you think the contract provisions have independent significance apart from the statute, or does the contract permit what the statute permits?"
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,1241.345,1261.151,"Justice O'Connor, I believe that the contracts have independent validity because when you read the language of those contracts, they are more explicit and more definitive than in fact the language of the statute."
1985.84-1725,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1261.151,1266.085,"Well, as I read the contract, it would even allow a retroactive increase."
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,1266.085,1268.631,"Well, the language of the--"
1985.84-1725,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1268.631,1276.082,"So the language of the contract, if that's what you are relying on, may be more generous than the government even urges."
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,1276.082,1293.872,"--Well, I don't see how the language of the contract could reach a retroactive result because it says the new rates shall thereupon become effective in accordance with and on the effective--"
1985.84-1725,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1293.872,1296.138,On the effective date specified.
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,1296.138,1296.917,--date specified in the order.
1985.84-1725,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1417.432,1422.538,"But you take the position that in any event, it wouldn't be allowed under the statute either, is that right?"
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,1422.538,1449.685,"We say that, first, if you read the contracts, the plain language of the contracts and the consistent practice under those contracts, and up to this case as well as the interpretation of the words in the contract by other courts and by the Federal Power Commission, those kinds of words in the whole group of Sierra-Mobile cases, if you take that whole--"
1985.84-1725,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1449.685,1457.182,But what if all you had was the language of the statute and the history of its application by the Federal Power Commission?
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,1459.367,1461.367,"--If you put... no, clearly not."
1985.84-1725,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1534.619,1540.804,"Well, that is certainly true, but your question is whether, whether you needed a final order before any rates could go into effect."
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,1540.804,1541.882,--That's correct.
1985.84-1725,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1613.383,1619.366,Do you think the FERC inherited power to approve rates directly from the FPC?
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,1619.366,1620.209,No.
1985.84-1725,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1621.582,1625.363,You think that FERC derives its power from a delegation of the Secretary.
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,1625.363,1627.284,--I think it does arise from a delegation.
1985.84-1725,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1627.284,1631.219,And the Secretary would have had the... could have kept the entire power himself.
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,1631.219,1641.841,"He could have kept that power, but he could have kept only the power that was granted by Section 5 of the Flood Control Act, and that power was limited by Congress."
1985.84-1725,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.568,1659.88,With the Secretary proposing them.
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,1659.88,1663.691,"--Yes, what they propose."
1985.84-1725,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1760.122,1772.773,"It is rather extraordinary, though, isn't it, Mr. Wheatley, for a utility, public or private, not to have any ability to set new rates in force short of a 33 month delay."
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,1772.773,1794.092,"Well, I think that the delay, Mr. Rehnquist, was a result of procedures which the Secretary of Energy and the <FERC> [= FERC], he could have increased, shortened that time considerably, and they have shortened it since that time."
1985.84-1725,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2077.978,2082.899,"Of course, an interim rate isn't so important unless you've go a period of heavy inflation."
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,2082.899,2110.824,"Well, the interim rate is I think a question of what... it could be important in an inflationary period, yes, but on the other hand, the contracts by their express language and their course of conduct, there was never any permission of an interim rate under that scheme."
1985.84-1725,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2110.824,2111.808,"Well, all I'm suggesting--"
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,2111.808,2112.245,Yes.
1985.84-1725,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2112.245,2126.24,"--is, you know, this doesn't affect the argument based on the language of the contract or the language of the statute, but when you are arguing past practice, it may be that the regulators saw a need for an interim rate only in a time of heavy inflation."
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,2126.24,2148.701,"Well, it could be that is so, but certainly when the Power Act and the Gas Act were enacted in 1935, Congress put in express interim rate authority, and it seems strange that in 1944, which is a few years after that, they didn't put the same authority in there if they thought it was important and necessary."
1985.84-1725,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2223.919,2230.916,"But you take the position that even had there been no delegation to FERC, no interim rate would be possible, is that right?"
1985.84-1725,1,20319,charles_f_wheatley_jr,,2230.916,2262.153,"I think that that is true because the Department of Energy Act, when it was enacted, simply transferred the situation as it existed under Section 5 of the Flood Control Act, to the Secretary of the Energy, and it's true that at that point the Secretary of the Energy had the power, the limited review and confirmation power of the FPC plus the power that the Secretary of Interior had under the Flood Control Act."
1985.84-1725,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2556.816,2559.206,"Thank you, Counsel."
1985.84-1725,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2561.143,2563.658,"Not unless the Court has any questions, Your Honor."
1985.84-1725,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2563.658,2566.125,Apparently none.
