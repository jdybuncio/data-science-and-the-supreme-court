2013.12-1173,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.373,"We will hear argument next in Case 12-1173, Marvin Brandt Revocable Trust v. United States."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,8.529,11.778,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1173,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,81.136,83.326,"Counsel, you are not reading this, are you?"
2013.12-1173,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,83.326,89.573,It's all right.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,89.573,97.447,--Here the patent did not reserve any interest in 1875 Act right-of-way.
2013.12-1173,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,113.331,121.016,"Well, under Section 1912, the government could -- did reserve an interest for a public highway; is that correct?"
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,121.016,122.905,No.
2013.12-1173,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,122.905,123.577,No?
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,123.577,133.618,"1912, Section 1912 has to be read in conjunction with this Court's decision in Northern Pacific v. Townsend, and Stringham."
2013.12-1173,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,140.975,144.99,"The patent you talk about, I am not recalling it exactly."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,149.722,159.827,"Yes, it mentioned it in the context of, that Brandt's title is subject to those rights for railroad purposes as had been granted to the railroad under the 1875 Act."
2013.12-1173,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,159.827,166.84,But it didn't characterize it as either an easement or a fee with an implied reverter?
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,166.84,178.789,That it was subject to those rights for railroad purposes as had been granted to the railroad sounds like it was granted subject to a servitude.
2013.12-1173,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,203.169,225.067,"What they are saying, I think the government's point is -- the other side is saying, and I don't remember the term of my property law."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,226.519,227.144,Well--
2013.12-1173,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,227.144,229.036,It shifts the -- it shifts it back.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,229.036,230.268,--A defeasible fee?
2013.12-1173,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,231.833,231.876,It could be.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,234.401,235.2,--That's what they're saying.
2013.12-1173,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,235.2,244.073,"And they are saying that that's, for purposes of who owns the land, the mineral rights, it's treated as an easement."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,257.807,258.89,Subject to a right of reverter.
2013.12-1173,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,258.89,259.415,--Yes.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,259.415,260.456,Yes.
2013.12-1173,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,267.839,270.133,"Well, it's different in this respect."
2013.12-1173,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,285.534,286.518,"Oh, that's nice."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,299.356,300.589,--Exactly.
2013.12-1173,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,300.589,303.651,"They didn't say it's a -- you know, for some purposes it is."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,310.742,311.695,Correct.
2013.12-1173,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.695,313.398,And that case has been around for how long?
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,313.398,315.24,Seventy-two years.
2013.12-1173,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,315.24,316.146,Okay.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,336.575,348.883,"No, but I think it's important that -- the argument that the government is making today is similar to their alternative argument that they made there in Great Northern, saying, okay, well, if it's not an easement, then it's a limited fee in a surface."
2013.12-1173,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,358.739,365.079,"But they are not really not alternative -- well, maybe it's all right to say they are alternative arguments, but they are mutually exclusive arguments."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,372.499,373.577,--Yes.
2013.12-1173,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,374.668,375.2,All right.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,404.564,409.515,"They would all -- I'm not sure that they would be invalid, necessarily."
2013.12-1173,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,409.515,410.265,Why -- why?
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,410.265,420.979,"Well, I'm not -- I don't know where all the city public highways' interests are, vis-a-vis how the land was originally patented."
2013.12-1173,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,435.832,450.005,"I assume your answer would be that if it's a choice between disappointing people who properly relied on the law, and disappointing people who were -- were not following the law, it's clear who should -- who should take it in the neck."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,451.201,456.122,"Absolutely, plus the cities also have the -- the power of the eminent -- the power of eminent domain."
2013.12-1173,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,459.699,472.426,"I thought this -- the cities were relying on Section 912, as applied to this 1875 Act."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,472.426,477.066,That's what -- that's what they -- that's what the cities were relying on.
2013.12-1173,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,518.409,523.282,"Well, can you explain to me something to me about that 1875 Act a little bit?"
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,539.65,540.634,Correct.
2013.12-1173,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,540.634,547.475,And I don't see anything in the 1875 Act statute.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,572.199,589.943,"As the government argued in Great Northern and as this Court adopted that argument, the key provision in the 1875 Act is Section 4, which reserved the right to Congress to dispose of the lands underlying 1875 rights-of-way to settlers."
2013.12-1173,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,614.933,623.976,But the railroad wasn't benefited by the end of the 1871 understanding of the right-of-way.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,650.262,657.664,"But it's -- it's not only my interpretation, it's the interpretation of the Court in Great Northern that it was an easement."
2013.12-1173,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,668.465,678.602,There were -- there were points along the right-of-way where the railroad needed a station or a wider area for water towers and so forth.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,695.314,695.782,The station--
2013.12-1173,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,695.782,701.671,"One way they could do them was to condemn them, but absent condemnation, could they just receive them from the government?"
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,701.671,709.418,"--Well, under -- under the 1875 Act, yes, Congress did provide for station grounds."
2013.12-1173,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,726.318,727.271,Oh.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,736.953,737.221,Yes.
2013.12-1173,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,751.451,758.978,Are there any instances in which the railroad can keep its station even if it abandons the right-of-way?
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,763.211,771.552,I think the right -- the station grounds are tied to the right-of-way.
2013.12-1173,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,777.237,780.798,Could I ask you again about Section 912?
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,824.358,832.043,"Well -- well, first, I don't -- 912 did not change the grant to the railroad."
2013.12-1173,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,839.087,841.553,"Well, you didn't get your property from the railroad."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,842.663,843.194,Correct.
2013.12-1173,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,843.194,844.209,You got a patent from the government.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,865.451,873.776,They were conveying it subject to those rights for railroad purposes is the specific language.
2013.12-1173,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,937.407,939.968,I still don't understand it.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,958.32,965.691,"I'm -- I'm -- one -- well, I'm -- I'm troubled."
2013.12-1173,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,980.139,980.373,"That's your argument, isn't it?"
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,980.373,985.377,"Well, I think that's the argument under -- under the common law, too, is -- is what--"
2013.12-1173,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,985.377,985.599,Yeah.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,986.346,986.899,--So they -- they merge.
2013.12-1173,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,986.899,987.748,--It may be a good argument.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,987.748,988.451,They merge.
2013.12-1173,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,988.451,989.054,But that's your argument.
2013.12-1173,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,989.054,1015.872,"Now, what about when 912 says when the railroad abandons a piece of the right-of-way, okay, it then says that the interest of the United States, with all right, title, and interest in the state of the United States shall be vested in the town that builds the highway."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1051.389,1053.077,Correct.
2013.12-1173,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1053.077,1053.873,All right.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1057.665,1058.428,Correct.
2013.12-1173,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1058.428,1059.262,Okay.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1059.262,1060.651,And there's--
2013.12-1173,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1060.651,1064.68,Let's take this in a normal easement situation.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1081.924,1085.142,"--In certain circumstances, yes."
2013.12-1173,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1085.142,1112.256,"So what's wrong with the concept that when this land was given to you as a railroad right-of-way, when it's abandoned, that the railroad, in essence, under 1912, and under the 1922 Act, that you are giving that easement to the U.S. to use as a right-of-way?"
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1136.512,1140.463,"It was subject to those rights for railroad purposes, correct."
2013.12-1173,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1140.463,1143.041,"Well, what was the language of the patent?"
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1143.041,1146.446,"Subject to those rights for railroad purposes, that conveys--"
2013.12-1173,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1146.446,1148.586,Was that the exact language?
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1150.007,1158.644,"--Exact language on page 78, Petitioner's Appendix."
2013.12-1173,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1158.644,1175.027,The Joint Appendix?
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1175.027,1178.276,"Petitioner's Appendix, 78, sorry."
2013.12-1173,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1178.276,1185.711,Too many briefs.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1186.554,1191.209,78.
2013.12-1173,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1191.209,1202.752,And what do you want us to read there?
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1202.752,1209.061,"Well, there was a question about whether that was actually the language, was it subject to those rights."
2013.12-1173,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1217.355,1222.477,"The 1875 Act, what was given to the railroad was a right-of-way."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1222.477,1225.196,A right to lay their tracks and a right of passage.
2013.12-1173,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1225.196,1237.456,"Just as I'm seeing the 1875 grant, it was the right-of-way through public lands."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1237.456,1246.531,"Well, yes, and as the government argued in Great Northern that that was -- that right in the 1875 Act was a right to lay tracks and it was a right of passage and easement."
2013.12-1173,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1246.531,1255.105,"Mr. Lechner, I know a great more than -- and that is very strong support for your view."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1263.196,1270.349,"First, the shift in Congress's policy."
2013.12-1173,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1280.517,1306.069,"I guess I had thought if you were just dealing with this as a matter of first impression that the shift of Congress's policy was a shift about whether to give away, you know, huge swaths of land to the railroads, and that Congress indeed decided, Enough of this, we are not going to give these checkerboard grants of land to the railroad, because they are making a mint from this, and we would rather give it to homesteaders."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1319.08,1330.027,"Well, Section 4 has a lot to do with that, and that is where Congress reserved the right to dispose of the underlying lands to the settlers."
2013.12-1173,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1357.032,1365.717,"I guess, you know, again, if you were just looking at this as a matter of first impression, the language of Section 4 does not seem to me to be very indicative of anything."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1378.524,1387.489,"But as the government argued in Great Northern, it would be silly to patent the underlying lands subject to a fee."
2013.12-1173,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1420.819,1432.329,"Well, in your answer it seemed to me, and maybe you have to proffer, that you confused limited fee with fee simple or absolute fee."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1435.703,1446.466,"Well, I was using limited fee in the context as this Court used it in Townsend, limited fee with the implied condition of reverter."
2013.12-1173,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1519.546,1525.497,"I don't understand how that can be, and yet, the government can argue contrary to what the government says."
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1527.136,1528.371,I'm saying--
2013.12-1173,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1528.371,1533.134,The Interior says one thing and the Justice Department here says something else?
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1539.443,1549.44,"--Well, I think, under this Court's precedent, you defer to the agency in charge of administering the 1875 Act, and that is the Department of Interior."
2013.12-1173,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1557.858,1560.607,I'm sure the government will have an explanation as to why we shouldn't.
2013.12-1173,0,41662,steven_j_lechner,,1560.607,1564.824,"If it pleases the Court, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal."
2013.12-1173,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1564.824,1565.73,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1576.539,1578.912,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2013.12-1173,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1603.495,1610.024,"Mr. Yang, I have to say I think the government gets the prize for understatement with its brief in this case."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1655.569,1658.489,--There is also other portions of the brief.
2013.12-1173,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1702.581,1703.206,"Wait, wait."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1712.919,1713.482,"--No, I think--"
2013.12-1173,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.482,1715.543,"I mean, it's either an easement or it's not an easement."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1720.636,1724.961,--I do with respect to the issue that we have here.
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1750.405,1751.232,I got that point.
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1751.232,1752.497,--with respect to the mineral lands.
2013.12-1173,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1775.77,1776.66,--That may be.
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1776.66,1777.317,All right.
2013.12-1173,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1777.317,1782.908,"But the term ""easement"" is a well-known term with an established meaning."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1795.964,1797.745,--It's a right-of-way.
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1827.935,1828.342,All right.
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1829.185,1834.855,"--And so, again, if we were to rewrite our brief, we would certainly do so much more carefully now."
2013.12-1173,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1967.348,1973.02,"Mr. Yang, the Petitioners say that there are thousands or even tens of thousands of people in their position."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1974.377,1976.767,"We don't have good numbers, actually, on that."
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1976.767,1978.088,But what are the numbers?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2057.75,2061.576,"Well, I'm not sure that there would be any common law cases."
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2061.576,2064.304,"No, I said in any case at all."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2064.304,2065.424,But in this context--
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2065.424,2065.927,"Yes, yes."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2066.424,2066.744,--In this context--
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2066.744,2067.185,What is the case?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2067.941,2071.869,"--even with respect to the pre-1871 statutes, the Court would sometimes--"
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.869,2073.255,"Oh, but they had -- they had a different view."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2073.255,2073.695,"--No, no, no."
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.695,2075.498,They didn't say it was an easement.
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2075.498,2076.526,It -- they did.
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2076.526,2077.657,I didn't read what -- it did?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2077.657,2080.349,They sometimes referred to them as easements.
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2080.349,2081.214,Which case?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2081.214,2083.648,I don't have it in front of me.
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2084.372,2086.331,Where do I -- where is it roughly in your brief?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2086.331,2088.339,--We didn't refer to those cases.
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2088.339,2089.002,"Oh, all right."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2089.327,2090.654,We might have cited the cases in our brief.
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2091.998,2096.839,"--I'm surprised that -- but the -- if you think there are some, I'll get my law clerks to look--"
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2096.839,2103.293,"But there are some, but the point was they were trying to discuss the nature of a statutory right-of-way."
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2114.211,2130.923,"--Can you imagine or explain to me why a property lawyer worth his salt since 70 years ago or more, 1942, wouldn't have read that case and advised his client, who was buying the land, if the railroad abandons it, it's yours."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2130.923,2131.485,--Yes.
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2131.606,2133.063,Where is some evidence of that?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2133.063,2133.922,--There are at least four reasons.
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2133.922,2134.938,"No, not reasons."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2137.101,2137.138,"Oh, yes."
2013.12-1173,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2196.743,2199.382,Did they give compensation to the people--
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2199.382,2200.255,--No.
2013.12-1173,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2200.255,2201.411,--to whom they pronounced that?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2201.411,2202.005,No.
2013.12-1173,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.005,2205.176,That can't change the meaning of the 1875 Act.
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2205.176,2209.065,But it reflects Congress's understanding of what the 1875 Act--
2013.12-1173,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2209.065,2212.435,It reflects a later Congress's understanding of what an earlier Congress did.
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2213.15,2213.794,"--Well, when we're--"
2013.12-1173,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.794,2217.393,--interpret statutes on the basis of what later Congresses think they meant.
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2217.393,2218.92,--This Court did in Great Northern.
2013.12-1173,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2219.164,2220.436,People have done it.
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2220.436,2221.841,--Okay.
2013.12-1173,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2249.612,2251.159,"Mr. Yang, could I take you back to my question?"
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2251.159,2251.69,Sure.
2013.12-1173,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2251.69,2252.986,"Thousands, tens of thousands?"
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2255.985,2264.794,"Again, we don't know because the way that these things are disposed of, there has not been a centralized way of tracking it."
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2330.033,2349.057,"Well, I see that they do and I certainly think bicycle paths are a good idea, but the problem that I see here is just what Justice Kagan is bringing up; that is, as I read this, I think there might be millions of acres in the last 70 years that have been conveyed."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2364.816,2365.737,"--Well, I think it's telling--"
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2365.737,2370.437,--because you haven't suggested anything that makes me think there aren't millions and millions of acres involved.
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2373.202,2375.858,"--Well, I think it's telling that between 1922 and the mid-1980s this issue does not appear to have arisen."
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2378.919,2384.152,"Exactly, because the lawyer would think -- when he reads the case of Great Northern, you think it's an easement."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2384.152,2392.227,--And then when the city takes the road and when the municipality -- excuse me -- when the municipality takes the right of way no one complained for 60 years?
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2395.444,2396.521,So how much is that?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2416.216,2417.519,--The amicus brief of--
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2417.519,2418.294,How often?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2418.294,2420.964,"--Again, we don't have good numbers on how often."
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2420.964,2424.87,"I know you don't have good numbers, but can you give me a rough estimate?"
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2424.87,2434.992,"I think a significant amount of time, because the -- if you look at the amicus brief of the National Council on State Legislatures, they explain this."
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2435.507,2440.458,"I will say ten times as much reliance on the one side than the other side, is that totally wrong?"
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2440.458,2445.176,"--Your Honor, I can't speculate on numbers."
2013.12-1173,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2449.798,2459.998,"Mr. Yang, would you clarify what you're -- what Mr. Lechner told us."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2468.213,2472.976,That's not correct because it needs to be qualified.
2013.12-1173,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2506.322,2510.726,Why then did no one from the Department of Interior join your brief?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2510.726,2512.163,They agree with our brief.
2013.12-1173,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2512.701,2513.9,"They don't have a choice, do they?"
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2514.61,2520.675,"--No, we have been in close consultation with the Department of Interior and they signed off on this brief."
2013.12-1173,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2528.287,2533.764,"But both of them want more federal lands, that's surprising, right, both agriculture and--"
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2533.764,2534.191,"--I think that's maybe a little unfair, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-1173,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2632.771,2637.535,"The patent here, Mr. Yang, which was, what, in the mid-1970s did not reserve anything."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2645.656,2648.406,And that was true both in Stalker and in Steinke with respect to the subsequent patents.
2013.12-1173,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2648.406,2661.478,"Well, I'm just suggesting that after Great Northern and then you're given this patent, which is unequivocal and does not reserve anything, why anybody would think that they haven't gotten the whole ball of wax is a mystery."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2661.478,2668.694,"Well, I think you would have to -- I think if you had a good lawyer, the good lawyer would say, Look, we've got -- there is uncertainty here."
2013.12-1173,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2692.309,2715.769,"It seems to me a fair reading of the history here, Mr. Yang, is that it really didn't occur to the government until very recently that these rights of way had value as anything other than railroad tracks, and indeed that the government was anxiously trying to give these things away because it thought that these spaghetti strips of land, it's of no use to the government, here, take them, get them off our hands."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2725.531,2727.904,I don't think that's quite accurate.
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2778.024,2789.318,"That's true, but when you talk about -- I mean, I went and read -- when I read -- I thought your brief was very persuasive and then I read Great Northern and I thought they have -- they are really quoting it correctly."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2824.495,2826.583,"--That was Townsend, which was dictum."
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2836.117,2837.859,"Well, I thought they said in the Stringer case."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2838.547,2839.656,"Oh, I'm sorry, Stringer."
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2839.656,2841.425,"--Yeah, that's the one you were--"
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2841.425,2847.623,"No, no, we are not relying on -- we are relying on Stalker and Steinke, which are 1875 Act holdings."
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2956.033,2958.579,--That's -- that's basically my problem.
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2971.471,2972.321,--One was before--
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2972.321,2975.451,And then you get -- they were all -- was any of them after Great Northern?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2975.451,2976.978,"--No, not after Great Northern."
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2976.978,2979.217,So -- so then in Great Northern it comes along?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2979.217,2984.606,"But Justice Breyer, I think it's a mistake to rely on these labels of limited fee and easement too strongly."
2013.12-1173,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3049.579,3055.359,Do we know how many miles of public roads and how many miles of bike trails have been -- you don't know that either?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3055.359,3060.013,"--On bike trails, this is -- this is not a Rails-to-Trails Act case."
2013.12-1173,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3095.357,3096.982,Are there highways that would be affected?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3102.762,3107.072,--It certainly would call into question the legality of the land transfers.
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3124.924,3126.846,Can you think of anything I can do about this?
2013.12-1173,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3143.495,3145.119,On easements.
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3145.119,3146.212,--So I'm somewhat in the dark.
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3146.212,3147.087,Yes.
2013.12-1173,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3238.342,3249.792,"--Maybe the reason you don't have records on this, which strikes me as pretty unusual that the government doesn't know what it owns, is that for decades, you didn't think that you owned a reversionary interest."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3249.792,3253.478,"Well, for decades, we thought we owned a reversionary interest."
2013.12-1173,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3253.883,3255.367,But you don't have any records on where these things are.
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3255.367,3258.507,"--Well, but Congress told us -- told everyone how to dispose of it."
2013.12-1173,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3292.289,3307.877,What would -- what would be the exposure of the United States if we -- if you -- are there takings claims now?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3307.877,3327.572,"There are takings claims also that would -- any 1875 Act case or right-of-way which has been abandoned, which has then put to another use, whether it be a highway under the current Section 912, or whether it reverts to the United States, or even if, for instance, it doesn't revert to the United States--"
2013.12-1173,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3327.572,3329.212,Are there any statute of limitations?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3336.912,3347.813,"--I -- I don't believe the APA would govern a claim of damages against the U.S. There are takings claims which -- which proceed under the Tucker Act against the U.S. Or the Little Tucker Act, depending on the amount."
2013.12-1173,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3349.423,3351.655,--What about adverse possession?
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3352.78,3354.999,Adverse possession is certainly an issue that might -- would come up.
2013.12-1173,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3354.999,3364.917,"--I would think if there's been no objection to these spaghetti strips of land, I don't think condemnation would cost the government a whole lot for that matter."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3365.291,3366.229,"Well, we've faced--"
2013.12-1173,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3366.229,3367.649,--what a spaghetti strip of land through--
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3367.649,3371.632,--We faced a very considerable amount of litigation in recent years.
2013.12-1173,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3371.632,3378.895,"Doesn't Interior or some -- I mean, doesn't the highway -- aren't there people in the government who keep track of where the highways are built?"
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3378.895,3380.925,"Well, for local roads?"
2013.12-1173,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3392.592,3394.685,"--Yes, but you should -- should know how much land the United States owns."

2013.12-1173,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3425.017,3426.235,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1173,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3426.235,3426.713,Thank you.

2013.12-1173,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3535.94,3536.925,What about on your side?
