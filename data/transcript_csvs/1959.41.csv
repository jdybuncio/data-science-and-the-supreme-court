1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,2920.527,2927.41,That amount is set specifically by the ordinance and it would depend of what particular activity that organization was engaged in.

1959.41,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2930.06,2931.002,And not their profit or in the --
1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,2931.002,2931.519,That's right.
1959.41,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2933.378,2938.368,And you can't tell how much of Little Rock's revenue derives from that source?
1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,2938.368,2939.728,"No, you cannot at this time."

1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,2979.507,2980.714,"That is correct, sir."
1959.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2980.714,2980.974,And --
1959.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2980.974,2984.537,And the directed purpose is made only to comply with him or with --
1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,2984.537,2986.025,"That is my recollection of it, sir."
1959.41,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2996.765,3004.971,Can you guess how many -- how many charitable organizations if you define them down there -- there are operating in Little Rock?
1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,3004.971,3005.347,"No, Your Honor."
1959.41,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3005.853,3009.416,Or would it be of what magnitude would it be 200 or 2000?
1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,3009.416,3010.299,"Oh, Certainly not."
1959.41,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3011.353,3012.617,How many -- 200?
1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,3012.617,3013.512,That would far exceed it.
1959.41,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3016.227,3017.489,30 charitable organizations.
1959.41,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3017.489,3024.323,"Mr. Kemp, the way the word organization is, to apply it in the ordinance, it seems to me that there probably would be several thousand."
1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,3034.785,3038.589,"Well, I think it was intended if they were charitable organizations."
1959.41,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3040.232,3040.814,This is --
1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,3040.814,3041.403,It's possible.
1959.41,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3041.403,3045.136,"This isn't charitable organization, this is organization --"
1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,3045.136,3045.365,Yes.
1959.41,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3045.365,3047.838,-- and that's what the ordinance is --
1959.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3047.838,3050.961,"Does it reach the bar associations, the medical associations?"
1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,3050.961,3052.465,"If requested, yes, sir."
1959.41,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3052.465,3053.521,Does it? (Voice Overlap) --
1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,3053.521,3055.182,If -- if request is made.
1959.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3055.697,3059.692,"How about all the fraternal organizations, the lodges?"
1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,3059.692,3061.756,"Well, I would assume that they would be hard to dispose of."
1959.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3061.756,3064.63,You don't think there are more than five or six of those in -- in --

1959.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3071.472,3087.513,"Well, the reason I -- I thought it was someone important in this language of this -- of the Supreme Court where it said the ordinance here under attack does not single out the N.A.A.C.P. and require information of it only."
1959.41,1,31342,joseph_c_kemp,,3114.903,3121.377,"As I've stated earlier, the admission is in here on the part of the petitioners that other organizations had complied."
