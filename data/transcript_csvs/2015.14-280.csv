2015.14-280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.775,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-280, Montgomery v. Louisiana. Mr. Bernstein."
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,7.775,30.905,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue is whether to decide the question of Miller's retroactivity in this case or in a Federal habeas case such as Johnson v. Manis, No. 15-1 on this Court's docket. In today's case there is no jurisdiction over that question because the point of Section 1257 is to enforce the Supremacy Clause."
2015.14-280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,66.255,73.795,So how would you describe the adequate and independent State ground on which the -- this decision rested?
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,73.795,88.705,"I would say that the lack of a binding Federal law question is an antecedent requirement, to borrow the terminology of the S.G.'s brief, before you get to the adequate and independent State ground analysis."
2015.14-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,88.705,92.085,So why don't we have jurisdiction to answer that question?
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,92.085,141.14,"You certainly have jurisdiction to answer the question whether Teague is constitutionally required in State collateral review courts. The second part of our brief said why it is not constitutionally required in State collateral review courts, and that's basically this Court's precedence from Danforth back to the beginning in Desist, and in Kaufman have said that the Teague -- what have become the Teague exceptions are matters of equitable discretion and not matters of the Constitution, and the Federal habeas statute on its face only applies in Federal court. So the Federal habeas court can grant relief if relief is warranted under the Teague exception."
2015.14-280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,141.14,169.48,"If a State says, we acknowledge that we are holding a prisoner in contravention of Federal law but we choose to do nothing about it, then the answer is Federal habeas corpus; there is not a second answer that the State can be required under the Supremacy Clause, under its own procedures, to enforce the Federal law? And if -- if I'm -- and if I were to take -- to argue that second position, I'm not quite sure what case I would have to support me."
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,170.485,176.4,"Well, I think that Your Honor's opinion for the Court in Martinez v. Ryan --"
2015.14-280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,176.4,176.49,Yeah.
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,176.49,193.665,"-- in 132 Supreme Court at 1319 to 1320, suggested that there are advantages to citing the Federal habeas right in the Federal habeas statute rather than what the Court called a freestanding constitutional claim."
2015.14-280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,257.62,267.715,"In effect, are we saying that the Supremacy Clause binds the States only in direct criminal proceedings?"
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,267.715,268.275,No.
2015.14-280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,268.275,272.93,"I mean, is that another way of phrasing your argument?"
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,272.93,286.14,"It would be that the Supremacy Clause only binds the states in direct proceedings and in collateral proceedings where it's an old rule, because that's the equivalent of a direct proceeding."
2015.14-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,311.635,318.08,How do you differentiate this case from Standard Oil?
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,318.08,329.14,"Because in Standard Oil, the issue was the underlying status of the Federal government arm, and the Court said that question is controlled by Federal law."
2015.14-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,363.24,369.35,But we did say that that State could define the exemption any which way it wanted.
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,369.35,370.08,Correct.
2015.14-280,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,370.08,378.16,"And so it could -- it's almost identical here; we would announce what the Federal law is, send it back."
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,384.815,403.24,"I think the difference and what makes this case special is that this Court has held since Murdock v. City of Memphis, almost a hundred fifty years ago, 87 U.S. at 326 to 327, that the 1267 jurisdiction is question by question."
2015.14-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,424.78,430.404,How -- how -- suppose -- let's think of the first Teague exception.
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,498.415,498.74,Well --
2015.14-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,498.74,499.58,Do you see where I'm going?
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,499.58,499.77,Yes.
2015.14-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,499.77,505.005,"That being so, it's a Federal Constitution rule, the exceptions of Teague, Teague drops out of the case."
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,507.84,514.11,"Well, in your hypothetical, respectfully, I don't think that would be a new rule. It would be an old rule --"
2015.14-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,514.11,518.685,"I've made it a new rule. For purposes of my hypothetical, I'm making it a new rule."
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,518.685,521.11,If it were a genuinely new rule --
2015.14-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,521.11,521.56,Yeah.
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,521.56,525.4,-- then under Danforth and going all the way back.
2015.14-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,536.65,539.78,Danforth was the case saying that the states could be more generous.
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,569.63,579.77,"Well, if it is a new rule, the Court has held -- and sorry to cite a precedent -- Linkletter has held that retroactivity on collateral review is not constitutional."
2015.14-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,580.63,581.28,That's true.
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,586.9,588.48,"But Teague said, we don't like Linkletter."
2015.14-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,588.48,588.75,All right.
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,591.95,592.39,Because --
2015.14-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,592.39,607.42,"I mean, why doesn't it violate the Constitution to hold a person in prison for 20 years, for conduct which the Constitution forbids making criminal."
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,607.42,610.17,"Well, it does violate the constitution."
2015.14-280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,610.17,616.825,"It wasn't criminal at the time -- I mean, it wasn't prohibited by the Constitution at the time he was convicted, right?"
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,616.825,617.56,Fair enough.
2015.14-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,617.56,618.525,That would be the reason.
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,618.525,620.01,Fair enough.
2015.14-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,620.01,621.63,That would be the reason.
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,621.63,622.075,Fair enough.
2015.14-280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,632.135,642.21,"Is there anything else you can say? Because I can say, witch is being a witch. There were some people in Salem who were imprisoned for being a witch."
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,662.33,678.97,"This Court has been reluctant, even when there is a violation of the due process clause, to create a judicial remedy, an implied judicial remedy on top of the Federal statutory remedy. That's Schweiker v. Chilicky, cited in our briefs."
2015.14-280,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,681.05,682.94,"That's not what is happening here, Mr. Bernstein."
2015.14-280,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,714.555,724.46,And the other question is whether that issue of retroactivity is itself a Federal constitutional issue.
2015.14-280,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,735.145,742.315,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Plaisance."
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,742.315,772.745,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Miller v. Alabama established a new substantive rule prohibiting mandatory life without parole for juveniles, which should be applied retroactively. This Court has jurisdiction to hear Henry Montgomery's claim because the Louisiana Supreme Court relied exclusively on Federal jurisprudence. In Miller, this Court held that mandatory life in prison was unconstitutional."
2015.14-280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,778.205,786.35,"Isn't it just like a State saying, we have a Fourth Amendment, and the Federal Constitution has a Fourth Amendment."
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,809.745,818.665,"In this case, Your Honor, the Louisiana Supreme Court did not State that it was exercising any independent grounds at all."
2015.14-280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,820.48,827.03,I thought that the -- the case it cited said that.
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,846.15,856.61,"It is my interpretation of that earlier case that the Louisiana Supreme Court said, we have a choice, and they made the choice to apply Teague."
2015.14-280,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,866.66,876.26,Did they not say in Taylor that they were not bound to follow Teague? Didn't they say we're going to follow Teague but we want to make it clear we're not bound to do that?
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,876.26,877.92,They did say that.
2015.14-280,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,877.92,881.36,They've never -- they've never retracted that have they.
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,881.36,886.685,"Correct, but the choice itself is not necessarily a matter of State law."
2015.14-280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,916.56,923.99,"I thought -- I thought it's unless they clearly state otherwise, we will assume that they're applying Federal law."
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,939.534,953.94,"It is my opinion that Michigan v. Long indicates the reverse, Your Honor, that the State must say, we are following State law in making this decision."
2015.14-280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,956.815,958.345,"Well, they did say that here."
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,968.295,976.98,"And I believe that that's sufficient to indicate to this Court that it is applying Federal law, it is not applying State law."
2015.14-280,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,976.98,983.585,"But Mr. Plaisance, I think what people are saying to you is that this is different from your standard Michigan v. Long question."
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1035.525,1045.03,I agree with Your Honor. And even in Danforth this Court said that the question of retroactivity is a pure question of Federal law.
2015.14-280,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1045.03,1047.61,"But I'm sorry, why don't you finish."
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1047.61,1069.89,"That's the answer to your -- to your explanation or hypothetical, that you said if the State decided that they were choosing Federal law, then what? What's the next step? And the next step is the question is retroactivity, which both the majority and the descent in Danforth said the question of retroactivity is a pure question of Federal law."
2015.14-280,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1069.89,1072.55,"Federal statutory law, right."
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1082.15,1101.53,"That's correct, Your Honor, but even in Yates, this Court said that on State habeas, if the State considers the merits of the Federal claim. And the merits of this claim are: Is Mr. Montgomery serving an unconstitutional sentence? Is Miller retroactive to address the fact that he's serving an unconstitutional sentence?"
2015.14-280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1101.53,1124.52,"How do you deal with Mr. Bernstein's point that your client would be worse off if -- if you are correct? That is, if the question comes up on Federal habeas, then the Federal court decide -- decides it without any AEDPA problem."
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1132.125,1134.91,"That would be my understanding, Your Honor."
2015.14-280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1156.405,1169.29,"But in -- how do you answer the argument? All right? Suppose you're right, but your victory is going to leave your client in a worse position because when he gets to the Federal court, he will be saddled with AEDPA."
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1169.29,1174.725,"Well, not if this Court rules that it has jurisdiction and makes Miller retroactive."
2015.14-280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1196.825,1203.045,"Mr. Plaisance, on the jurisdictional point, let me see if I understand what you're arguing."
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1260.335,1276.325,If it was clear to this Court that the State court made a conscious choice and sent enough of a signal to this Court that it was adopting Federal law to use as State law.
2015.14-280,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1299.265,1309.605,Suppose we hold that we can review the -- the -- we have jurisdiction because the State court said it was going to follow Teague.
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1336.06,1341.49,I think Louisiana would be bound to follow this Court's ruling as you set forth.
2015.14-280,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1341.49,1348.045,It would be? Why? Because it said that we would voluntarily follow it in Taylor? That bound them?
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1348.045,1353.895,"I think they made the conscious choice to follow this Court's laws, this Court's jurisprudence."
2015.14-280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.97,1363.125,They changed their mind. They have now chosen the course not to follow our jurisprudence.
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1371.2,1373.56,"But they didn't do that in this case, Your Honor."
2015.14-280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.89,1388.625,"Well, not yet, but if we agree with you and then we send it back and they look at it and say, oh, if that's what Teague means, we're not going to follow Teague, what stops them from doing that? And doesn't that make us look foolish?"
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1388.625,1389.96,"No, it doesn't, Your Honor."
2015.14-280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1389.96,1393.68,We rule decisions that can be overruled by somebody else.
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1393.68,1400.985,"If a State considers the merits of a Federal claim, it must grant the relief the Federal court --"
2015.14-280,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1400.985,1401.75,You're not in.
2015.14-280,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1401.75,1403.72,But the question is what's a Federal claim?
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1403.72,1405.55,The Federal claim.
2015.14-280,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1405.55,1414.045,Why did you cite Standard Oil versus Johnson in response to your questions to Justice Scalia and Justice Alito?
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1414.045,1416.81,I believe my friend the Solicitor General --
2015.14-280,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1416.81,1417.515,Do I have --
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1417.515,1418.36,Perhaps.
2015.14-280,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1418.36,1420.445,And the name in the case was Standard Oil v. Johnson.
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1420.445,1422.64,That was a case cited by the Solicitor General.
2015.14-280,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1429.18,1446.595,"Are you asking us to decide the question left -- left open in Danforth? Danforth said that it was a minimum -- there could be a constitutional minimum, but it wasn't answering that question. Are you asking us to answer that question?"
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1446.595,1450.0,"I'm saying, Your Honor, I don't believe you need to get to that question because --"
2015.14-280,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1450.0,1451.965,But let's assume we -- all right.
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1451.965,1456.555,Under Michigan v. Long this Court has jurisdiction. I'll reserve the balance of my time.
2015.14-280,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1456.555,1457.48,"Thank you, Counsel."
2015.14-280,1,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,1457.48,1464.625,Thank you.
2015.14-280,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1464.625,1465.715,Mr. Dreeben.
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1465.715,1497.67,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court does have jurisdiction to decide the question of Miller's retroactivity, because Louisiana has voluntarily incorporated into its law a wholly Federal standard. And in this Court's decisions in Standard Oil, Merrell Dow, Three Affiliated Tribes, and most recently Ohio v. Reiner, the Court has recognized that, when a State chooses to adopt Federal law to guide its decisions and binds itself to Federal law, there is a Federal question."
2015.14-280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1497.67,1498.19,This might --
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1498.19,1499.68,Does the United States --
2015.14-280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1499.68,1503.31,They can change their mind; right? You said voluntarily chose to follow it.
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1503.31,1503.6,That's right.
2015.14-280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1503.6,1506.975,And they can voluntarily choose they're not going to follow it anymore.
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1506.975,1510.69,That's right. And the same is true is in any Michigan v. Long case.
2015.14-280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1583.33,1605.155,"How does it work? It -- it should be pretty elementary, but -- I mean, I looked at the Indian case, and that seems a little far out. The -- the -- the -- though it definitely gives you support on your statement here, suppose you took Justice Scalia's example: We have Iowa State Rule 56."
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1626.31,1627.49,So I -- I --
2015.14-280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1627.49,1628.1,Is that right?
2015.14-280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1628.1,1630.98,"Now, I just -- how do you fit that in the words in 1257?"
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1630.98,1636.82,"Well, I doubt -- I doubt that that would satisfy the Court. And there's a theoretical answer, and then there's a practical answer."
2015.14-280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1642.34,1642.45,Yeah.
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1642.45,1651.44,"-- Procedure pretty uniformly say, we will treat Federal precedent as guidance in our decisions as -- for its persuasive value."
2015.14-280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1658.36,1661.57,"Well, they say in a particular case, it's guidance."
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1667.655,1668.7,"Well, I -- I think that --"
2015.14-280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1668.7,1674.37,"Now, can we review that because, in fact, it wasn't the Federal interpretation? But can we review it?"
2015.14-280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1674.37,1675.485,Yes or no?
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1675.485,1684.31,"There -- there is a distinction between this case and that, that may suggest that this case the Court has jurisdiction over, and that one, the Court does not."
2015.14-280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1684.31,1689.95,"So you say the Court does not, in the example of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that Justice Scalia gave?"
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1689.95,1691.35,I think this is a stronger case.
2015.14-280,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1691.35,1691.49,Okay.
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1691.84,1700.16,"I'm doubtful that the Court would have jurisdiction or choose to exercise it, because -- I accept, for premises of the argument, Your Honor's hypothetical."
2015.14-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1701.51,1724.8,"Well, but when you say that that's a doubtful case, I think you are implicitly acknowledging that, if we adopt your argument, we are going to get that case and lots of similar cases, and we're going to have to parse the words that were -- were -- the words that were used by the State Supreme Court: Well, we're following -- we're going to be guided by it."
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1731.03,1731.6,"Well, I think the Court --"
2015.14-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1731.6,1740.37,-- when there's a perfectly available and possibly superior remedy available to the petitioner by filing a Federal habeas petition?
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1740.37,1749.89,"So there are several reasons, Justice Alito. First of all, I don't think that it is that -- going to come up in that way to this Court, because that's not the way States treat their own rules of procedure."
2015.14-280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1763.135,1764.88,"Mr. Dreeben, what's the problem --"
2015.14-280,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1764.88,1770.89,"Pardon me. Did you misspeak? When -- when Federal law is adopted as State law, the Federal courts can review it."
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1776.475,1778.46,"Well, I -- I think, Justice Kennedy --"
2015.14-280,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1778.46,1779.23,You -- you said --
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1779.23,1780.24,This is -- this is what I'm trying to say --
2015.14-280,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1780.24,1784.8,"-- when -- when State law adopts Federal law as Federal law, then there's review. Okay."
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1784.8,1799.1,"The State has adopted Teague for a reason that does not exist in any of these civil procedure cases, and that is that the State knows that that Federal law will be applied to the very case in a habeas case."
2015.14-280,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.07,1833.09,You're -- you're -- you're saying hurray that -- that the Federal habeas Court will thereafter be bound by it --
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1833.09,1833.66,"No, because --"
2015.14-280,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1833.66,1835.31,-- because the State got there first.
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1835.31,1835.43,No.
2015.14-280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1866.585,1867.19,Could you --
2015.14-280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1867.19,1870.895,I was just going to suggest maybe we hear a little bit more on the merits.
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1870.895,1887.08,"Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice. The -- the rule in Miller v. Alabama, in our view, is a substantive rule because it goes far beyond merely regulating the procedure by which youths are sentenced for homicide crimes."
2015.14-280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1925.795,1929.43,"Would it be enough -- is -- is it enough if the States simply say, okay."
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1934.69,1935.28,Yes.
2015.14-280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1964.13,1976.07,"Mr. Dreeben, how do you explain how your articulation of your test wouldn't apply to the guideline changes in Booker that we made?"
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1976.07,1985.78,"So I -- I think, Justice Sotomayor, the key difference is that, with respect to the guidelines, there was always a -- a minimum and a maximum set by statute."
2015.14-280,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2022.79,2037.57,"What is the substantive difference -- pardon the use of that word -- between your formulation and Petitioner's formulation? He says, this is substantive because it did away with mandatory life imprisonment."
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2044.445,2051.66,"Justice Sotomayor, I don't think there is any substantive, to use the word, daylight between Petitioner's position and ours."
2015.14-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2160.985,2175.92,"Would it be accurate to say that a rule is substantive if it makes a particular outcome less likely or much less likely or much, much less likely than was previously the case?"
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2175.92,2177.91,"Probably the last, Justice Alito."
2015.14-280,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2181.95,2184.66,"The difference between much less likely and much, much less likely."
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2184.66,2188.36,"Well, I would put it in the words the Court has used previously."
2015.14-280,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2300.42,2304.47,And any States that have treated Miller as retroactive --
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2304.47,2304.96,Yes.
2015.14-280,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2304.96,2306.01,-- on State habeas.
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2306.01,2306.5,Yes.
2015.14-280,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2354.2,2367.265,"So what is the population we're dealing with if most States do apply Miller retroactively? I think there was a figure of 2,000 people with life without parole."
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2367.265,2370.66,"I haven't broken it down numerically -- may I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2015.14-280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2370.66,2370.75,Sure.
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2370.75,2385.43,"I have not broken it down numerically, Justice Ginsburg, but Michigan has not applied it retroactively, and it has a very large population of juveniles who are in the Miller class. And I don't think that Pennsylvania has resolved it, certainly not favorably yet for the defendants."
2015.14-280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2385.43,2386.23,"Thank you, counsel."
2015.14-280,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2386.23,2391.84,Thank you.
2015.14-280,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2391.84,2395.685,Mr. Duncan.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2395.685,2415.31,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I was going to begin by saying I would proceed directly to the merits, but I gather from the drifts of the argument that the Court has serious questions about jurisdiction, and so I'd like to briefly begin there. We're in an odd position with respect to jurisdiction because we won below and we win in the Fifth Circuit on Federal habeas, which has found that Miller is not retroactive."
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.67,2522.495,"It didn't say so, though. In -- in Standard Oil, the -- this is a quote from the opinion, ""the relationship between post exchanges and the government of the United States is controlled by Federal law."""
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2522.495,2523.05,Right.
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2534.175,2536.99,"Well, that would have been true no matter what the State did, right?"
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2536.99,2538.53,"Well, no, the State --"
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2538.53,2542.46,We're deciding a question of Federal law that would have applied on its own.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2542.46,2551.91,"Well, no -- well, with respect to Standard Oil, I think the -- my point is that the State didn't have to make its tax-exemption statutes turn on a Federal question."
2015.14-280,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2554.28,2579.33,"Don't you think that the State made its tax-exemption law turn on Federal law because there are Federal constitutional requirements in that area? Could the State have taxed -- I mean, there was the question of whether or not the Supremacy Clause would permit the State to tax sales to the post exchanges."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2579.33,2583.31,"I think that's possible, but this court didn't make its jurisdiction dependent on that."
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2585.05,2594.32,"In the provision I just quoted, it said that the relationship between post exchanges and the United States is controlled by Federal law."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2595.49,2606.415,"Well, so take the -- the Assistant Solicitor General brought up the case of Ohio v. Reiner where State made its transaction on unity statute turn on the validity of a Fifth Amendment privilege."
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2610.325,2621.065,"And Mr. Duncan, isn't it quite similar when Justice Scalia used this ""controlled"" language that the Louisiana Supreme Court has used similar language? It's dictated by Teague."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2632.29,2634.21,"Well, we think -- we agree with that."
2015.14-280,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2648.31,2665.77,"Well, in Ohio v. Reiner, which you just cited, was there any other way in which the State could have obtained review of the State supreme court's erroneous determination that the witness in question there did not have a Fifth Amendment privilege because she said that she didn't commit the crime?"
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2665.77,2667.84,I don't think so because this --
2015.14-280,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2667.84,2671.09,And do you think that's not a distinction between that case and this case?
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2671.09,2693.69,"Well, if -- if the Teague -- if the Teague standard is a discrete Federal standard that the State has made -- has incorporated, then the only way -- well, the Louisiana Supreme Court could -- the defendant could go to Federal habeas, sure, and you could get an interpretation that way. But it doesn't seem to us that the difference between Federal habeas and review of the State supreme court decision makes any difference with respect to this Court's jurisdiction."
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.4,2726.76,We weigh in when we have jurisdiction.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2728.58,2731.29,"Of course it matters, Justice Scalia, of course it does."
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2731.29,2734.285,What you said doesn't really make much sense.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2734.285,2735.71,I think it makes sense.
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.71,2738.61,"Let's get in there quickly, whether we have jurisdiction or not."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2740.81,2741.49,We're not saying that.
2015.14-280,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2757.07,2773.98,"We clearly have jurisdiction, don't we? I'm trying to figure this out. In my mind we have jurisdiction where there is a person -- that's the defendant -- and the defendant says the Court's decision -- that's your court's decision -- is contrary to the Constitution or statute of the United States."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2774.82,2775.55,That answers the question.
2015.14-280,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2775.55,2790.865,"So we have jurisdiction to answer the question. Now, the question is how do we dispose of the case in which we have jurisdiction? And we have three instances, I guess, in which the Court has done in disposing of such a case what the Solicitor General says."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2816.475,2816.97,"Well, that's --"
2015.14-280,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2816.97,2822.065,"We will say their interpretation of Federal law was wrong, and now we'll send it back to see what they do."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2824.03,2824.93,That's our position.
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2825.72,2829.395,What is the Federal law you're talking about?
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2829.395,2833.97,The application of Teague to Miller.
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2833.97,2837.535,"That's not a Federal law; a Federal habeas statute is a federal law, right? And Teague is an interpretation of that Federal law."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2837.535,2837.73,Well --
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2837.73,2840.23,Was that Federal law at issue in this case?
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2840.23,2841.84,The Teague -- the Teague standard --
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2841.84,2842.86,Of course it wasn't.
2015.14-280,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2842.86,2850.21,But the Teague standard -- the Teague exceptions could well be constitutionally required.
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2851.0,2852.415,Have we ever said that?
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2852.415,2853.085,You have not.
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2856.29,2857.49,You want us to hold that in this case.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2857.49,2859.115,"We do not want you to say that in this case, Your Honor."
2015.14-280,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2859.115,2861.55,Did we say the opposite in Danforth?
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2861.55,2865.339,You left the question open in Danforth.
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2865.339,2876.87,Could you tell me why you would think that something like Atkins would not be retroactive to States?
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2876.87,2878.33,Come --
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2878.33,2884.2,"As a compulsion, meaning not as by election of Teague retroactivity."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2884.2,2916.48,"That is a difficult question that we don't take a position on. But to answer your question, Justice Sotomayor, the -- the -- the argument goes that Danforth made clear that Teague is an -- is an equitable interpretation to Federal habeas statute, it's not constitutionally binding on the states, and that the Court left open whether the exceptions are binding, but the exceptions were part and parcel of Justice Harlan's Mackey understanding of -- of how he thought Federal habeas ought to apply. And so whereas -- whereas Atkins -- I mean, Atkins creates a binding constitutional right."
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2931.42,2940.13,"It has to do something different because, as Justice Breyer pointed out, you have wide discretion to structure it as you want."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2951.57,2951.66,Well --
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2951.66,2952.98,-- that you have to offer the minimum?
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2952.98,2954.73,"Well, I mean, that is -- that is the question."
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2966.54,2976.04,But we have any number of cases where States have viewed the exceptions as controlling the fact that they have to offer the constitutional minimum.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2976.04,2977.46,But this Court has never held that.
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2977.46,2978.54,Hasn't yet.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2978.54,2978.9,Unless --
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2978.9,2980.055,And why shouldn't we?
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2980.055,2981.28,I understand.
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2981.28,2983.095,That's really the serious question.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,2983.095,2984.61,It -- it -- it is a serious question.
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3025.46,3026.25,Mr. Duncan --
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3026.25,3026.38,Yes.
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3026.38,3027.96,-- can I give you just a hypothetical? I mean --
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3027.96,3028.08,Sure.
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3028.08,3054.9,"-- suppose that there is a State and it has a -- a mandatory minimum for a theft. It says the mandatory minimum for theft is 20 years. And suppose a court looks at that and says, you know what? That's incredibly disproportionate to a lot of theft, and so strikes the mandatory minimum. Says, you just can't have a mandatory minimum like that. Make it lower. Would that be a substantive ruling?"
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3054.9,3061.13,"We don't think so, Justice Kagan, because the mandatory aspect of it goes to the manner of imposing a penalty."
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3061.13,3062.93,It does not go to the manner of imposing.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3084.49,3097.3,"Well, so in -- in -- if in that hypothetical that doesn't go to the manner of imposing the penalty, then it's different than Miller because Miller made very clear that the mandatory aspect of the penalty goes to the manner of imposing the penalty --"
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3097.3,3097.68,But I think --
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3097.68,3098.64,-- not any substance.
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3098.64,3103.085,"So if you're saying, no, that's different because there was something else in Miller."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3148.83,3160.62,"Well, your -- Justice Kagan, the -- the relevant difference in terms of the Teague analysis is that this Court in Miller did not take the punishment of life without parole, the distinction category of punishment of life without parole off the table."
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3170.875,3175.745,"No, you're exactly right. It did not take LWOP punishment off the table."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3202.16,3202.51,I under --
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3202.51,3204.44,So they made the sentence different.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3204.44,3205.17,I understand that.
2015.14-280,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3315.86,3319.36,But you don't have a distorted new trial if you're just granted parole hearing.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3319.36,3320.09,That's right.
2015.14-280,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3357.66,3364.49,You were going to say -- at some point you started: Suppose you look at the watershed procedural change.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3409.86,3413.37,"Well, let's take the first one, the point: It's not just implicit in the concept of ordered liberty."
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3598.745,3600.77,"Mr. Duncan, I -- I -- I think not."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3628.85,3629.39,And --
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3629.39,3631.425,There has to be a different sentence.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3635.22,3635.81,"Well, there's no doubt --"
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3635.81,3637.725,That -- that increases the range.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3637.725,3645.28,"Right. Miller -- Miller quite clearly said, as you know, Justice Kagan, that it does not categorically bar a penalty but -- and -- and so -- and what did it mean by that penalty? It's --"
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3645.28,3656.94,"It allows something within the range, but it has -- it has completely changed the range that's -- that is -- that is given for any juvenile defendant."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3656.94,3657.75,"Well, we think that's --"
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3657.75,3660.5,And the range is important. It's not just the top end.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3676.875,3679.27,"Well, I -- look, I -- I -- I hope this is responsive."
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3692.81,3701.66,I'm -- I would -- I would not describe changing the range of sentences available as changing the sentence.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3701.66,3704.37,"It -- it puts element on the table, I think, is the most you could say."
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3704.37,3705.82,It doesn't change the sentence --
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3705.82,3705.99,Yes.
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3705.99,3706.63,-- necessarily.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3706.63,3706.84,Right.
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3706.84,3707.58,But this is what we --
2015.14-280,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3707.58,3709.02,You still get the same sentence.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3709.02,3710.75,You could still -- absolutely still. And what -- what did you --
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3710.75,3712.1,Which is what we said last year.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3731.25,3731.54,Well --
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3731.54,3732.935,That is the penalty.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3732.935,3733.08,Right.
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3733.08,3733.91,Is the range.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3733.91,3737.04,"It -- it -- life without parole has the same floor and ceiling, of course."
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3757.14,3760.665,Mr. Winsor -- Mr. Winsor --
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3760.665,3761.275,Duncan.
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3761.78,3765.195,-- I know that we didn't ever look at this issue. I'm sorry.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3779.28,3779.68,That -- that --
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3779.68,3781.28,They all did.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3781.28,3783.43,"Probably -- probably not, Your Honor."
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3791.565,3791.97,Why?
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3791.97,3792.62,It's a procedural rule --
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3792.62,3795.335,It just said you couldn't have mandatory death penalties.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3799.3,3799.44,Right.
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3801.02,3801.61,It says this exactly --
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3801.61,3803.175,-- process which we say is procedure.
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3803.175,3806.895,And to give sentences less than --
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3806.895,3808.09,It -- it would put new --
2015.14-280,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3808.09,3808.6,-- mandatory death.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3811.155,3817.745,"They certainly could have, so the question is whether it's substantive or procedural under the Teague rubric, which, of course, it was a pre-Teague case."
2015.14-280,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3826.56,3827.04,All right.
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3863.06,3863.56,That's the first one.
2015.14-280,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3863.56,3879.42,"And that's joined by the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and the fourth, I can't remember. But so is it seriously diminished? Now, we read through Miller, it's pretty hard to say."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3918.925,3922.88,But in every Eighth Amendment sentencing rule goes to accuracy in some significant --
2015.14-280,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3922.88,3923.0,"No, no."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3929.36,3942.605,"Well, again, take -- we haven't talked about the capital sentencing cases, but take a case like O'Dell where the capital jury was not informed of the defendant's parole and eligibility while considering its future dangerousness."
2015.14-280,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3973.46,3976.92,Is there any watershed procedural rule other than Gideon?
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3976.92,3981.03,"Well, this Court said, it's doubtful that any will emerge."
2015.14-280,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4004.995,4017.57,"We have one brief that tells us this Court has never barred punishment as cruel unusual under the Eighth Amendment, but refused to make a the decision retroactive."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,4017.57,4025.58,"Well, we disagree with that. There are cases -- take the -- take the case that refused to make retroactive the rule in Caldwell v. Mississippi."
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4077.1,4099.68,"Well, but I think that you, yourself, cabined it when you said that the difference is one -- there is some category of cases that do refer to process, to how a decisionmaker makes a particular result, and another category of cases which refer to what we've called substance, which is what results are on the table, what category of punishment is on the table."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,4104.35,4104.72,"Well, I --"
2015.14-280,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4104.72,4111.175,"This is not about the how -- or it's partly about the how, but there's also about what punishments are on the table."
2015.14-280,3,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,4111.175,4118.17,"Well, I just have to push back on the premise a little bit, where -- our position is not that a substantive rule is about what punishments are on the table."
2015.14-280,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4198.89,4203.33,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Bernstein, you have three minutes remaining."
2015.14-280,4,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,4203.33,4215.73,"What this fantastic discussion has shown is why the Court, as it always has in the past, should keep the Teague exceptions a matter of equitable discretion, rather than constitutional requirement."
2015.14-280,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4382.425,4387.055,"Thank you, Counsel. And, Mr. Plaisance, you have three minutes remaining."
2015.14-280,5,62594,mark_d_plaisance,,4387.055,4391.885,"Your Honors, I'd like to make two quick points. First of all, in jurisdiction."
2015.14-280,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4426.845,4437.805,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Bernstein, the court appointed you as an amicus curiae to brief and argue this case against this Court's jurisdiction."
