1972.71-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.985,"Number 71-711, National Labor Relations Board against Granite State Board."
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,35.927,39.38,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1972.71-711,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,227.523,233.415,"Mr. Come, were those public votes in the sense that they were not secret ballots?"
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,233.415,234.616,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-711,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,240.664,244.985,"Do you know what attendance there was, or is that in the record?"
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,244.985,251.124,"The record shows that, practically all of the members attended."
1972.71-711,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,275.827,279.632,And I gather there is no issue here of membership?
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,282.346,293.137,That is correct and the question here is the right of the Union to fine the members after they had resigned from the Union.
1972.71-711,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,293.137,296.523,And is there any issue of the reasonableness of the fine?
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,296.523,299.756,That is not in this case.
1972.71-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,312.239,316.998,Would it make any difference to your position Mr. Come when they resigned?
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,316.998,317.644,Yes.
1972.71-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,317.644,319.984,Now where would you have the cut off?
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,319.984,335.152,"Under the principle that the Board is applying, the cut off is whether they resigned before they engaged in the activity for which they are being fined."
1972.71-711,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,509.182,511.775,But I want to be clear Mr. Come.
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,528.373,530.017,That is correct.
1972.71-711,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,530.017,538.001,And is it that fact that the Board relies on particularly?
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,538.001,543.463,It was that fact that the Court of Appeals was relied on in reversing the Board.
1972.71-711,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,886.794,895.565,You suppose the results would be the same in your submission Mr. Come if there were an express provision to that effect in the constitution?
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,895.565,917.267,I would say Your Honor that the Board has not yet had occasion to consider whether a different accommodation between the Section 7 rights of the employees and the Union's right to impose reasonable discipline would be warranted if there were such information.
1972.71-711,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,917.267,923.389,"I expect that if the Board prevails in this case, you will get that chance pretty soon?"
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,923.389,939.256,"I would assume so, but all I can tell you is that up until now, the Board has not had occasion to face that question, and it has reserved."
1972.71-711,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.311,990.801,"We would like to hope for the employee in face of such a provision, would be tantamount to saying that Section 7 rights were un-waivable I suppose?"
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,990.801,991.591,That is correct.
1972.71-711,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,998.121,1003.157,Are there some other instances where you have upheld waiver?
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1003.157,1031.77,There are instances where waivers have been upheld and it really comes down to a basic and Board's and the Court's judgment would be as to the right to refrain is in Section 7.
1972.71-711,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1354.519,1358.049,"Mr. Come, you say that it was a severe step to have resigned from Union?"
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1358.049,1358.831,Yes.
1972.71-711,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1358.831,1370.052,What adverse consequences flow to these particular Union members as it was a result of their resignations in this case?
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1370.052,1414.549,"Well, the record doesn't show specifically what happened to them, I can only generalize that normally, resigning from the Union, the individual loses the right to participate in Union meetings at which policies are determined the -- and also the right to vote for the officers of the Union who are going to be his bargaining representative."
1972.71-711,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1414.549,1424.49,"So if the Union had governed a similar contract to the one which had expired at the conclusion of the strike, could it have prevented these man from being reemployed?"
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1424.49,1427.287,"No, it could not have prevented them for being reemployed."
1972.71-711,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1560.689,1587.356,"Mr. N. Come Do I though understand correctly that basically the Board's position is to -- without regard to all these special factors, the Union's authority begins and ends of with what it may do with a member, and once one has resigned, he is no longer a member, and therefore, a conduct after resignation is simply not subject to Union discipline --"
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1587.356,1587.362,Yes sir.
1972.71-711,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1587.362,1588.451,-- is that it basically?
1972.71-711,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1588.451,1589.72,That is it.
1972.71-711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1600.106,1607.294,Thank you Mr. Come.
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,1612.003,1616.626,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1972.71-711,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1945.055,1956.878,"Mr. Roitman, suppose at that point, some of them had voted against the strike and the strike Board having been taken, there upon resign, would your position as to them be any different?"
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,1956.878,1996.808,"Yes, our position with respect to them is that there was an established Union procedure, now they are not spelled out in the constitution, but there was an established Union procedure set forth in the membership application card and the check-off authorization record, under which an employee was free to resign his membership in the ten-day period following the termination of the contract, and that that was an appropriate time for any employee who did not want to participate in the concerted activity of the strike to resign."
1972.71-711,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2056.096,2061.944,"Then I take it that you are insisting, sticking upon the ten-day provision?"
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2061.944,2077.489,"Well, it's the Union's position with respect to that position that under Section 8 (b) (1), the Union is the appropriate party to determine what its rules are with respect to retention of membership."
1972.71-711,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2124.091,2138.173,"Well then this position, Mr. Roitman, that is to all 31, none having resigned within the ten-day period at the termination of the contract and within the first ten days of the strike, they remained members after that ten-day period?"
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2138.173,2140.881,"Yes, that's always been our position throughout this case."
1972.71-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2182.594,2185.029,"Mr. Roitman, excuse me."
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2185.029,2190.994,We just say that that Act puts the Union in the position of being the determiner of those.
1972.71-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2190.994,2209.461,"Since the Union constitution doesn't provide for this ten day resignation period and the rules do not apply and the contract doesn't apply, is that something the Union could withdraw at will, unilaterally?"
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2210.223,2214.469,"No, the Union --"
1972.71-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2214.469,2214.933,You called it a --
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2214.933,2217.551,-- membership is a contract of membership.
1972.71-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2217.551,2223.593,You called it a practice. Now is it something that he could enforce?
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2223.593,2225.071,"Yes, I think so."
1972.71-711,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2284.499,2291.413,"Well, that is sometime where the consequence of that form of collective -- a provision of the collective bargaining, isn't it?"
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2291.413,2299.061,"Yes, I think it is, but I think the Union's construction that two things just opposed the (Inaudible)"
1972.71-711,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2299.061,2308.651,What's New Hampshire law on the question whether one is still a member if he doesn't resign within a period like this?
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2308.651,2319.738,"The court in its decision merely stated that, that was one of the issues that the court would take after it heard the case."
1972.71-711,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2319.738,2320.713,Which court?
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2320.713,2322.403,The New Hampshire court.
1972.71-711,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2330.465,2335.366,What's your view whether that's a matter of state law or whether it becomes involved with --?
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2335.366,2347.481,"Well, I think this Court has said in effect in the Gonzales case, that that is the kind of an issue that the Federal government has not entered into and therefore it is a matter for the state court to determine?"
1972.71-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2347.481,2359.155,"Mr. Roitman, the Court of Appeals apparently and the trial examiner concluded, perhaps as you suggested that there was no evidence that the employees knew of the Union's practice or that they consented to it."
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2370.253,2395.227,"Well, we say on the face of that – on the face of evidence that when they signed the application card, this provision was right in front of them, that was certainly some indication of knowledge that certainly in the case of Johnson whom I mentioned previously, he knew about it because he had resigned at the appropriate time, had his resignation accepted and chose to reapply for readmission."
1972.71-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2395.227,2402.312,Are you confessing that this factual conclusion under the trial examiner that was upheld by the Court of Appeals?
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2402.312,2411.414,"Well, it's our position that basically yes that the Union does have the right to make that determination."
1972.71-711,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2441.994,2446.096,"Mr. Roitman, I am still bothered a little bit of this ten-day provision."
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2463.757,2491.693,"Well, then I think, you have perhaps back in the situation that this is a voluntary association and that absent restrictions, the voluntary association can be terminated by either party at any time as a matter of voluntary right of anybody to continue the association."
1972.71-711,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2491.693,2494.321,But with a ten-day provision that is not so?
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2494.321,2503.567,"No, we say that that is a part of the membership contract commitment to be bound by that state of affairs."
1972.71-711,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2503.567,2507.178,"And if it were one-day provision, it would not be so?"
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2507.178,2528.583,"Well I suppose as you can always stretch the elastic till it breaks, but our basic position would be that the Union that has the right and again the proviso of Section 8 (b) (1) to effectuate a rule with respect to retention of membership and I suppose it can be a hash rule as well a liberal rule."
1972.71-711,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2532.9,2539.233,On that basis it doesn't seem to me there there should any difference between one day or not?
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2539.233,2548.536,"Well, no days is just a saying that they can be no escape from membership."
1972.71-711,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2548.536,2550.98,"Once having accepted it, except by the information --"
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2550.98,2562.179,"Well, that is -- it's not an impossible position when we formed a more Union, there was no escape provision into it.[Laughter]"
1972.71-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2562.179,2568.871,"Mr. Roitman, where is the record as the Union position about this resignation?"
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2572.481,2573.246,"Yes, they would."
1972.71-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2574.596,2580.704,"I can't find it, I must have missed it?"
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2580.704,2601.779,"Each of the employees who resigned, the first two were sent their letters by the head of the Granite State Joint Board and it was called to their attention that their resignation would not be considered effective and that the fine would be imposed against them and later on in the record after the company --"
1972.71-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2601.779,2607.154,"But I want that, where is that record, the original one."
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2609.238,2617.547,"Yes, page 79, Your honor."
1972.71-711,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2623.722,2629.214,They would be barred --
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2629.214,2631.126,Yes that's correct.
1972.71-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2643.436,2647.947,Where in here is that they are relying on the ten-day rule?
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2647.947,2649.758,That is not spelled out in the letter.
1972.71-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2649.758,2652.802,Is it spelled out in any place?
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2652.802,2667.977,"It's spelled out -- well, the evidence with respect to that appears in connection of the examination of Mr. (Inaudible) at the first case."
1972.71-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2680.674,2689.91,But you are relying on that man? When did you start relying on the ten-day provision?
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2689.91,2709.337,"Well it was -- in the decision of the trial examiner, the first decision in the case, he sets forth some of the Union's arguments which he deals with, and that is one of them that he mentions."
1972.71-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2768.778,2785.037,But am I correct that up through the case in New Hampshire and the later of charges files with NLRB that this 10-day period then become an issue until then?
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2785.037,2786.512,"No, that's right."
1972.71-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2786.512,2790.382,"It wasn't an issue when they were fined, am I right?"
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2790.382,2791.844,"No, nobody raised that question."
1972.71-711,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2809.783,2815.618,"Even if they made it within the ten-day period, they still would have fined, am I right?"
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2815.618,2817.797,"No, I don't think so."
1972.71-711,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2890.676,2901.497,"May I ask you, I have been looking in the appended record but can't locate a form of application for membership which includes that ten-day provision?"
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2902.567,2914.81,"You will find it in the original application, petition for certiorari where the decision of the trial examiner is set forth."
1972.71-711,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2928.843,2936.273,Thank you.
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2936.273,2944.23,This is -- the last paragraph there it says that the authorization shall remain in effect unless I revoke it within 10-days.
1972.71-711,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2944.23,2945.174,"Thank you, Yes."
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2945.174,2975.014,"Each individual signed that, as you notice right underneath the restitution, the matter is also referred to in the Trail Examiner Genesis' (ph) opinion and I think he sets forth a copy of the -- yes, check-off in the the membership application cards in his opinion."
1972.71-711,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2975.014,2986.2,"Mr. Roitman, is it your position that the obligation of the Union members continued for the duration of the strike regardless of how long the strike lasted?"
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,2986.2,2990.66,"Yes, it's -- I think that's the central position that we take."
1972.71-711,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3046.193,3055.819,Was there any meeting of the Union membership subsequent to the September 21st meeting 1968 when they voted to impose the fine?
1972.71-711,1,27882,harold_roitman,,3055.819,3080.405,"Oh yes, there were constant meetings where the officers reported back to the membership on the status of negotiations and the situation once the Union was in where they voted to undertake items, for example like the insurance matter which I referred to a moment ago."
1972.71-711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3298.594,3301.545,"Mr. Come, do you have anything further?"
1972.71-711,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3301.545,3342.223,"I just wanted to point out as Mr. Justice Rehnquist noted that the Court of Appeals found on pages 5 (a) to 6 (a) of the petition, adopted a Trial Examiner's finding that there was no evidence that the employees knew of this practice or that they considered this limitation and their right to resign, that is with respect to this ten-day point that Mr. Roitman has been making."
1972.71-711,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3342.223,3360.001,"Well, suppose we were to say that if you've signed in it, you did not know about it, and it was effective, and then say is to whether or not they were members at the time they actually resigned?"
1972.71-711,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3360.001,3379.394,"Well, I think that there you would have an issue that would probably have to be remanded to the Board because as the Board found the facts here, this ten-day provision was not something first of all that had anything to do with resigning from the Union."
1972.71-711,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3428.073,3428.819,Thank you gentleman.
