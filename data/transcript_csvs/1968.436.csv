1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,25.147,25.434,May I please --
1968.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,25.434,27.26,Mr. Henderson.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,27.26,29.354,Thank you.
1968.436,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,216.125,219.417,"Mr. Henderson, may I ask, whom are we indebted for this?"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,219.417,221.242,"Not many, Your Honor, just one."
1968.436,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,221.242,222.368,The respondent?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,222.368,226.664,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,226.664,230.257,What was the question of my Brother Brennan?
1968.436,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,230.257,232.861,"Whose fight it is, this fight."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,232.861,234.467,Do you know about this?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,234.467,235.433,I was given copies this morning.
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,235.433,235.899,Yes.
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,235.899,239.75,"Well, this talk about the Submerged Lands Act."
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,241.367,247.26,"Well, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act actually is part of the Submerged Lands Act."
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,247.32,248.828,I thought it came earlier.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,248.828,249.367,"I beg your pardon, sir?"
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,249.367,253.538,I thought the Outer Continental Shelf Act came earlier.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,253.538,255.584,Well --
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,255.584,258.748,"The Submerged Lands Act is something else, isn't it?"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,258.748,263.706,"If Your Honor please, I always refer to that Act as the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act."
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,266.646,270.959,"There are two quite different statutes, aren't they not?"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,270.959,273.761,"If Your Honor please, I don't know."
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,275.498,276.752,That's what I thought.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,276.752,277.093,"Yes, sir."
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,277.093,277.453,And this --
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,277.453,278.231,And that's not my --
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,278.231,278.668,Yes.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,278.668,279.779,My document --
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,279.779,280.845,You're not responsible for this.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,286.947,302.945,"Now, when the trial judge dismissed the two civil actions, he held that the exclusive remedy for death on the artificial island was the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act -- excuse me, was the Death on the High Seas Act."
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,302.945,314.622,"Is there any question -- is there any issue between the parties here, in fact, that the -- as to whether or not this artificial island was within the contours of the Outer Continental Shelf?"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,314.622,315.125,None whatsoever.
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,315.125,316.042,Geographically?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,316.042,316.839,None whatsoever.
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,316.839,318.246,No dispute about that?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,318.246,326.174,No dispute about that as to either the Budrow Rodrigue case or the Dubois Dore case.
1968.436,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,709.927,714.316,I wonder if your -- how far you'd carry that.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,724.932,726.415,"Yes, sir."
1968.436,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,726.415,734.898,"Say, disaster occurred and there was a Death on the High Seas at that point."
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,734.898,736.335,On one of the islands or one of the artificial --
1968.436,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,736.335,757.697,"No, not an island at all, just a collision or a ship or something of the sort Having nothing to do with the Continental Shelf, way outside of the Continental Shelf, would you say that Death on the High Seas Act at the effect of giving cause of action also in the Louisiana law?"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,757.697,762.959,"Well,now the Death on the High Seas Act, of course, gives its own cause of action."
1968.436,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,762.959,763.792,I understand that.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,763.792,774.885,The Loui -- the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act would not give a cause of action because the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act applies only to these islands.
1968.436,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,774.885,778.952,I'm talking only about the argument you've been making here with respect to the Death on this High Seas Act.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,778.952,781.102,As to the old cases that were in existence --
1968.436,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,781.102,783.386,"No, on the Death on the High Seas Act."
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,790.875,791.857,"Yes, sir."
1968.436,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,791.857,803.055,"Well, I'm asking you whether that would apply in the circum -- in the situation I put to you without -- far beyond the Outer Continental Shelf."
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,831.872,839.799,"I don't think in that circumstances, Your Honor, that the direct line in the State of Louisiana really has any bearing."
1968.436,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,846.566,872.541,"It's essential for you to demonstrate not only that there is a possibility under the Death on the High Seas Act, but also that the Outer Continental Shelf Act does provide for the alternative applicability of Louisiana law."
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,872.541,873.872,"I call it supplementary, Your Honor."
1968.436,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,873.872,874.519,"Alright, I don't care what you call it."
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,874.519,875.598,Or cumulative
1968.436,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,875.598,877.118,Is that right?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,877.478,877.825,Not necessarily.
1968.436,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,877.825,878.539,"In other words, you've got to show that --"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,878.539,880.431,"No, I think -- I think, Your Honor, that --"
1968.436,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,880.431,890.907,You've got to show that this -- that Louisiana has jurisdiction by reason of the place where this act -- this death occurred.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,890.907,905.997,"In the instant cases, Your Honor, that point was clearly met because the Outer Continental Shelf Act does specifically say that as to these platforms involved, because they are adjacent to the state, that the Louisiana law does apply there."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.057,909.374,"Yes, but that's only as federal law."
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,909.374,910.572,"As Loui -- as adopted federal law, yes, Your Honor."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.572,912.852,It makes the federal law of Louisiana law.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,912.852,913.397,"Correct, sir."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.397,916.39,And doesn't give it -- Louisiana any jurisdiction over the Outer Continental Shelf.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,916.39,917.028,That's correct.
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,919.711,927.796,Nor does (Inaudible) Louisiana law talks only as a --
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,927.796,928.091,"Yes, sir."
1968.436,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,976.326,978.528,Legislative history of a Death on the High Seas Act?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,978.528,981.725,"No, sir -- yes, the Death on the High Seas Act."
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1065.284,1069.292,"But that would be in a Delaware Court, absent diversity of citizenship, would it not?"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1069.292,1069.768,I would think so.
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1069.768,1071.869,That would not be as a matter of federal law.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1071.869,1072.276,That's correct.
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1072.276,1074.186,It'll just be a matter of additional Delaware law.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1074.186,1074.54,That's right.
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1170.941,1176.846,"Not exclusive, but the legislative history also shows that the intent was to make a uniform remedy."
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1176.846,1178.488,A uniform basic remedy.
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1178.488,1179.117,Yes.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1179.117,1181.086,"Actually, they used the word “basic.”"
1968.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1181.086,1181.352,Yes.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1181.352,1182.921,In this discussion.
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1230.862,1234.084,Does the Longshoremen's Act apply here?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1234.084,1235.664,"Not in these cases, we d --"
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1235.664,1236.585,Why?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1236.585,1238.249,The Longshoremen's Act --
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.249,1242.773,Doesn't the Continental Shelf Act say -- refer specifically to the Longshoremen's Act?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1242.773,1243.793,"Yes, it does."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1248.513,1248.621,I see.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1248.621,1251.047,The Workman's Compensation Act in the --
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1251.047,1251.646,This is a--
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1251.646,1255.546,Negligent parties in this -- in both of these cases are not the employer.
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1255.546,1260.418,What would have been the situation if these people had not been killed but only injured?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1260.418,1266.706,"Then, the -- every law available to them, except of course the Jones Act --"
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.706,1270.232,"They would've been under the Continental Shelf Act, wouldn't they?"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1270.232,1276.927,"No, sir, they don't -- the Continental Shelf Lands Act really doest say anything about --"
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.927,1284.601,"All it says is -- it says, for the purposes of -- on these artificial islands, the federal law is the state law."
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1284.601,1285.077,Yes.
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1292.945,1307.256,"That is -- but the Continental Shelf Act says that a matter of -- as a matter of federal law, the state law will apply --"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1307.256,1307.795,This -- the state law --
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.795,1309.755,Two injuries on these artificial islands.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1309.755,1312.372,"The state law will apply, yes, that is correct."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1312.372,1318.222,Except where there's some other federal law that's applicable.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1318.222,1320.134,"No, it doesn't really say that."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1325.301,1325.997,"Well, alright."
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1329.347,1330.365,"Conflicting, yes, sir."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1330.365,1339.168,"And, you are -- are you suggesting that the High Seas Act is not in conflict with the --"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1339.168,1340.178,"Yes, sir."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1340.178,1341.186,Louisiana law.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1341.186,1341.617,"Yes, sir."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1346.728,1351.327,"Do you mean either one of them applies that would permit recovery and, therefore, they're not in conflict?"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1351.327,1353.548,"I didn't hear you, Your Honor, I'm sorry."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1353.548,1360.417,Either they -- either any law -- you can apply any part of any law as long as it allows recovery.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1360.417,1367.603,"No, I'm saying that “conflicting” does not mean “not identical.”"
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.603,1370.884,Does Louisiana law bar for contributory negligence?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1370.884,1371.663,"Yes, it does."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.663,1375.304,Does the High Seas Act?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1375.304,1377.029,"No, comparative negligence is a rule."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1377.316,1379.532,"Well, is that not a conflict or not?"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1379.532,1380.179,"No, sir."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1380.526,1382.922,You mean you'd apply the High Seas Act in that respect.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1382.922,1383.209,I am saying --
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.209,1386.802,But you want the recovery of the “for pain and suffering” under Louisiana law.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1386.802,1399.138,"What I'm saying, Your Honor, is that perhaps, and this is the meat of the manner right here, the word “conflict” does not mean un -- “different” exactly."
1968.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1421.809,1428.324,You would say that the (Inaudible)
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1428.324,1429.09,"Yes, sir."
1968.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1429.09,1430.001,And --
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1430.001,1433.223,"I've lost my cause of action under Louisiana law, that's right."
1968.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1433.223,1434.588,In this case?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1434.588,1437.103,"Yes, sir."
1968.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1437.103,1445.846,"And, say that (Inaudible)"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1445.846,1452.181,"If I can come within the terms of Louisiana law, I can get the benefits of the Louisiana law."
1968.436,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1506.746,1512.003,[Inaudible]
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1512.003,1512.542,"Yes, sir."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1512.542,1516.914,Do I understand -- are you claiming a right of recovery under both statutes?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1516.914,1520.195,Of course I'm claiming no double recovery.

1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1540.711,1541.13,Yes.
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1541.13,1543.286,"And one by the judge in admiralty, is that it?"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1543.286,1544.352,"It could be, yes."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1544.352,1544.46,Could be?
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1544.46,1547.741,"Yes, one -- the one in the High Seas Act would definitely have to be by the judge in admiralty, yes."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1547.741,1549.777,And the other would be by a jury.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1549.777,1550.496,If requested.
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1553.658,1567.658,"Now, which comes first and are you concluded if there's a finding against you in negligence, say, by the judge under the High Seas Act, does that throw you out of Court on the second?"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1567.658,1569.874,"Yes, it would."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.389,1584.82,Is that Dore case the Higa case?

1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1589.12,1589.959,"No, sir."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1598.618,1602.019,"But, there's that -- But there's an earlier decision."

1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1615.72,1618.403,"No, I think that the whole matter could be tried jointly."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.946,1703.293,"Yes, but your action --"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1703.293,1705.15,If you can bring yourself within the terms.
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.15,1711.545,"Yes, but your action in -- your action would, in either case, so be for negligence."
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1711.545,1711.605,Yes.
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1711.605,1720.887,"You see, in your case, which is different than between the Jones Act and unseaworthiness, completely different situation."
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1758.875,1766.36,"No, I say that it is to the issue at -- at issue here as to the narrow issue you would hear there and here, in this case, there is not even a second remedy."
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1778.801,1779.388,"Well, I understand --"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1779.388,1779.975,And say “yey” or “ney.”
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.975,1780.622,I understand that.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1783.604,1784.323,Yes.
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1784.323,1785.449,"Now, that's --"
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1785.449,1790.287,"Yes, if you would say that the two laws are in conflict, yes, Your Honor, I would --"
1968.436,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1790.287,1798.192,You've lost your case in spite of the reservation in the High Seas Act.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1798.192,1810.695,"No, I would say that, then, the case which I've mentioned to Justice Fortas, is that if he Louisiana laws under these conflict rules allow recover here then, yes, there could be recovery here."
1968.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1817.988,1819.306,You have five minutes for rebuttal.
1968.436,0,37975,philip_e_henderson,,1821.765,1823.741,"But, I did want to save some time for rebuttal."

1968.436,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1914.533,1917.635,"So, you didn't do this in your brief?"
1968.436,1,29849,james_e_diaz,,1917.635,1924.809,"No, Your Honor, it's merely an outline of my argument here today which varies in perspective from the argument I presented in my written brief."
1968.436,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1924.809,1930.126,Did you argue in your briefs the Submerged Lands Act?
1968.436,1,29849,james_e_diaz,,1930.126,1931.384,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.436,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1934.983,1940.879,"This isn't our practice, to have documents like this at this time."

1968.436,1,29849,james_e_diaz,,1953.394,1954.352,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.436,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1954.352,1956.089,"Alright, you may proceed."
1968.436,1,29849,james_e_diaz,,1956.089,1956.915,"Thank you, Chief Justice."
1968.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1983.47,1984.788,When was that enacted?
1968.436,1,29849,james_e_diaz,,1985.914,1989.674,"Your Honor, I believe that was enacted in 1948, sir."
1968.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1989.674,1998.477,"Yes, and the statute which we know of as the Submerged Lands Act was enacted in 1953."
1968.436,1,29849,james_e_diaz,,2001.235,2002.253,"That is correct, Your Honor."

1968.436,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2064.641,2068.701,Isn't there also the question of whether it's exclusive or not?

1968.436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.002,2682.098,"Well, under the High Seas Act, while there -- and before the Continental Shelf Act, there was a limited applicability of state law, wasn't there?"
1968.436,1,29849,james_e_diaz,,2695.32,2696.446,That's correct.
1968.436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.446,2697.692,No state law.
1968.436,1,29849,james_e_diaz,,2701.692,2702.051,That is correct.
1968.436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2702.051,2704.087,Only state law as federal law.

1968.436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2707.381,2721.74,"So, state law was put aside and the -- that Act said that if there's a Federal Act that is in conflict with the state law, well, it would be the federal statute that would apply."
1968.436,1,29849,james_e_diaz,,2721.74,2723.656,That is correct.
1968.436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2723.656,2740.543,"Well, would you -- are you arguing that the Savings Clause then in the High Seas Act is, in effect, repealed or set aside by the Continental Shelf Act insofar as the -- these artificial islands are concerned?"
1968.436,1,29849,james_e_diaz,,2742.327,2775.321,"That is correct, Your Honor, and that's why I say that you need not decide whether the Death on the High Seas Act is the exclusive remedy because this specific legislation on point is the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, so that even if the state law could be supplemented, which we do not but even assuming it could be supplemented under Death on the High Seas Act, this specific Act in question, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act would not permit it because the state law would be inconsistent with the applicable federal law."

1968.436,1,29849,james_e_diaz,,3389.246,3409.715,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I am saying that I -- that the Fifth Circuit also held that on the basis of the Berry Brothers and the Pure Oil versus Snipes that here were two conditions precedent that had to be met."
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,3587.123,3587.894,May it please the Court.
1968.436,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3686.884,3706.083,(Inaudible)
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,3706.083,3706.735,If Your Honor please --
1968.436,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3706.735,3708.12,(Inaudible)
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,3708.12,3715.435,I think that that -- that the word “conflict” is -- the approach is wrong in trying to see where they're not identical.
1968.436,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3766.536,3771.564,"Sir, I know your time is up, but I want to follow the Chief Justice's question to you --"
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,3771.564,3771.592,Yes.
1968.436,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3771.592,3773.177,By this question.
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,3827.974,3829.998,I would say that there's no inconsistency.
1968.436,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3833.399,3836.812,Why?
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,3839.969,3853.625,"I think -- I say that the rule of law is that it does not follow that if there is one avenue by which a destination can be reached, that there can be no other avenue."
1968.436,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3860.91,3861.217,I suppose --
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,3861.217,3862.385,That does not mean he can't get it under contract --
1968.436,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3862.385,3863.583,"Well, let me ask you this."
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,3863.583,3864.16,And get something better.
1968.436,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3864.16,3865.785,"Yes, let me ask you his quickly."
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,3889.365,3897.512,"If they die or -- diametrically oppose, if one says that you -- that, as a policy of the United States, that --"
1968.436,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3897.512,3898.185,"If I turn to the latter, it's yes."
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,3898.185,3901.347,"That you can't do this, then you can't do it."
1968.436,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3904.208,3909.286,"Well, wouldn't that be true (Inaudible)?"
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,3909.286,3914.204,"No, I don't think that there is a diametric opposition."
1968.436,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3919.861,3921.568,(Inaudible)
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,3921.568,3922.285,"Well, they're different."
1968.436,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3924.419,3924.936,"Well, I know."
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,3929.195,3944.636,"Beyond the two years, I do -- actually, as a matter of fact, the Louisiana Act has a one-year statute, but is -- if we assume that the Louisiana has got a three-year statute, then if the person can bring himself within the terms of the Louisiana Act as adopted federal law, he can have a recovery."
1968.436,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3973.331,3981.129,(Inaudible)
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,3981.129,3981.551,"No, sir."
1968.436,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4009.465,4022.711,(Inaudible)
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,4022.711,4036.49,"Because, then, the legislature was wasting its breath and ink in extending that the law -- in saying that the Louisiana law shall be extended out there because it's got to have a different result or what's the good of extending it out there?"
1968.436,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4047.45,4056.055,(Inaudible)
1968.436,2,37975,philip_e_henderson,,4056.055,4060.634,"Yes, but then it would -- then you'd have a different result by the Louisiana law that's out there."
