1986.86-281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.837,"We will hear argument next in No. 86-281, John William Ray versus the United States."
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,86.039,101.116,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, with this Federal criminal case petitioner requests that the Court acknowledge the demise of the concurrent sentencing doctrine that has been utilized by this Court since at least 1891 in the Clawson case."
1986.86-281,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,131.468,139.491,May I ask before you get too deeply into your argument are you going to discuss the government's motion that the issue really isn't here because these sentences were not the same?
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,139.491,144.209,I was going to try to attempt to answer that while I am working on the special assessment.
1986.86-281,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,145.06,145.594,All right.
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,147.596,149.379,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1986.86-281,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,256.048,262.201,"--May I ask you before you finish the sentencing, have you described completely the sentences that were imposed?"
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,263.601,277.378,"There as a $50 special assessment, Your Honor, I am sorry, on each of the three counts, for a total of $150, and that is pursuant to what we are going to reach in a minute, 18 USC 3013, the new Special Assessment Act."
1986.86-281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,368.805,386.182,"--Mr. Connors, I would think that if we were to agree with you on your view of the concurrent sentence doctrine, that is, that the Fifth Circuit should have considered your claim on that count here, we would not decide it ourselves, but would probably send it back to the Fifth Circuit."
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,391.484,409.196,"I recognize that, Your Honor, but it becomes important because one of the contentions made by the government is that there was sufficient evidence to find my client guilty of the six-ounce... or let me word it this way, that the six-ounce delivery is involved in the conspiracy of Count 1."
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.568,471.02,Weren't you going to deal with this special assessment as to whether--
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,471.02,476.424,"Let me turn to that right now, Judge."
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.036,493.652,--Yes.
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,493.652,502.141,"--that that law became effective November 12, 1984, so under their theory that would have... no appellate court should invoke the concurrent sentencing doctrine--"
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,502.141,514.965,"In the Federal system that means the concurrent sentence doctrine is done away with in any case, and I don't... you really don't care on what ground you win your case on, do you?"
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,524.84,528.542,"--Right, Your Honor, and I agree with you, but I was so scared when--"
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.542,531.077,You don't need to argue on behalf of any other clients.
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,531.077,543.301,"--When they filed their motion, though, I was so scared the Court might give us about a two-sentence motion and nobody in the country would know the concurrent sentencing doctrine is gone, and they would continue using it for some time until you all could actually--"
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,543.301,545.336,You mean it is gone in the Federal system.
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,545.336,546.103,--In the Federal system.
1986.86-281,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,549.205,551.757,"In other words, you don't mind if we grant the government's motion."
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,559.744,562.396,I guess a two-sentence one.
1986.86-281,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,562.396,566.417,Is it clear that the $50 applies to each count?
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,566.417,570.136,"Your Honor, there has been a bunch of debate and at least three appellate decisions so far."
1986.86-281,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,594.151,595.519,And so does the government.
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,595.519,596.203,"Yes, sir."
1986.86-281,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,596.203,597.419,That is their interpretation of it.
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,598.471,599.005,"Yes, sir."
1986.86-281,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.857,605.625,May I interrupt a minute?
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,631.109,645.1,"I think, Your Honor, we do agree with the government's position, but we would like our knowledge and that of the members of this Court shared with the appellate judiciary throughout... the Federal judiciary throughout the country, so it will stop illegally using--"
1986.86-281,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,645.1,647.719,"I suppose that is really our responsibility and not yours, though?"
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,649.071,649.788,--I understand that.
1986.86-281,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,649.788,651.773,Your job is to get your client the relief you think he is entitled to.
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,651.773,653.856,"Right, Your Honor, so we can get back to the Fifth Circuit."
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.856,666.865,"Well, I would think the three Courts of Appeals who have construed this Act must know that the concurrent sentence... that these counts... that these sentences aren't concurrent."
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,673.103,673.536,I don't know.
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,680.857,683.525,"I guess the Fifth Circuit missed it, too."
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,683.525,692.665,"Yes, that is what I am saying, and I believe they... if I remember their opinion in this case, they called that $150, they call it a fine in the actual opinion from the Fifth Circuit."
1986.86-281,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,694.1,697.469,Didn't the United States Attorney miss it also?
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,697.469,701.354,"He missed it in the original, when I was asking for petition for cert, Your Honor."
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.324,709.876,"Well, the same result would be with a fine, if you imposed a fine on each count."
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,709.876,711.728,That is the decision in the Pinkus case.
1986.86-281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,713.094,722.286,"Mr. Connors, I hate to be a skunk at a garden party, but you really... you really haven't been harmed by anything that has to do with this assessment, right?"
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,727.421,728.121,In the Fifth Circuit.
1986.86-281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.673,733.058,"Yes, so that is no part of your appeal at all, is it?"
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,733.058,734.177,"No, it is not--"
1986.86-281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,734.177,735.144,You haven't been harmed by it.
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,735.144,736.294,--It hasn't been paid and it--
1986.86-281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.294,738.044,"Right, it hasn't been paid or anything."
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,740.162,741.996,"--No, sir."
1986.86-281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.996,748.852,So do you want to tell us how that is up before us then?
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,748.852,753.054,"By their motion to vacate, I got the impression they would like me to get out of here."
1986.86-281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.054,756.006,They can't move to vacate if they didn't seek an appeal.
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,756.006,758.04,They have confessed error--
1986.86-281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.04,760.492,"They can do that, just come up and move to vacate?"
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,760.492,768.246,"--They have confessed error in the past, and the last two times this issue was before the Court they confessed error each time and it disappears off the docket."
1986.86-281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,768.246,774.067,"Confessing... yes, but they have confessed error on an issue that had been a subject of the appeal."
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,774.067,778.721,"The concurrent sentencing doctrine, yes, sir, in Rubin and Mariscal, and so the Court--"
1986.86-281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,778.721,781.323,But this $50 fine is not the subject of an appeal.
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,783.525,784.858,"--I never appealed on that, no."
1986.86-281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,786.225,787.993,"You couldn't appeal on it, because you didn't pay it."
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,787.993,802.236,--Right.
1986.86-281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,841.627,853.502,"What is irrational about the distinction between concurrent sentences and nonconcurrent sentences, if you are going to talk in constitutional terms?"
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,853.502,854.954,"Ask me that again, Your Honor."
1986.86-281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,854.954,862.541,"Well, you are saying there is a violation of equal protection if your client can't appeal and somebody else can appeal and get review."
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,875.785,878.319,Let me try to answer it this way.
1986.86-281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,898.031,908.256,"Well, to make out a violation of the equal protection clause you have to show not just that your client is in a class treated differently from another class but that the distinction between the two is irrational."
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,931.002,938.275,"To address your question, that gets us to the Parole Commission's guidelines of what they have already said they are going to do in this client's case."
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.972,963.156,xxx sentence on this count was set aside?
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,963.156,967.127,"Yes, sir, Your Honor, the Court doesn't note... have this document before it."
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,970.162,971.246,Does the government have that?
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,971.246,974.798,"--Yes, and they have noted it in their brief on the merits at Footnote 25."
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,983.054,985.839,"By the way, what was vacated by the Fifth Circuit?"
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,988.208,990.743,"--The conviction, but not the jury's verdict."
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,990.743,992.343,How do you do that?
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,992.343,993.945,By writing an opinion and signing it.
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.945,994.512,"Well, I know that."
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,994.512,995.212,I don't understand it.
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,995.212,998.33,"I know, but it says the conviction is vacated."
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,998.33,1004.067,"And it can be reimposed whenever the government wants, and at that time we can seek review in the future."
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1004.067,1012.989,"Well, what if the Court of Appeals just thought there wasn't enough evidence and they just reversed the conviction?"
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,1015.058,1018.643,And order an acquittal on that count.
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.643,1022.279,And what would it do with the jury's verdict?
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,1022.279,1023.697,Obviously it voids--
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.697,1024.364,It just leaves it there.
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,1024.364,1025.833,--I thought it voided the jury's verdict.
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.833,1033.903,"Well, if you set aside a conviction, you would think you were having something to do with the jury's verdict, wouldn't you?"
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,1033.903,1041.008,"You would, but this fine distinction that three of the circuits are using that it is okay to vacate convictions but not the jury's verdict--"
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.008,1043.294,And the Parole Commission seems to think that.
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,1044.96,1051.381,"--Their guidelines seem to say even if it is vacated they can still use the... in fact, that is what they say in this case."
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1057.368,1058.054,Because why?
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,1058.054,1066.224,"--there is sufficient evidence to support that conviction anyway, and they get back into sufficiency."
1986.86-281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1078.116,1083.019,His appeal from where to the parole folks?
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,1086.537,1086.971,"--Yes, sir."
1986.86-281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1130.166,1140.439,One way to cure that would be to say that the Court of Appeals has no business vacating a conviction without reviewing the evidence.
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,1144.493,1151.33,"--Your Honors, that is exactly what the first opinion in the Ninth Circuit's case of DeBright said."
1986.86-281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1211.654,1212.87,"Thank you, Mr. Connors."
1986.86-281,0,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,1212.87,1213.704,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1986.86-281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1213.704,1217.022,"We will hear from you now, Mr. Bryson."
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1217.022,1261.385,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, our position in this case is that first, the sentences that were imposed were not concurrent, and therefore the question of the validity of the concurrent sentence doctrine is not properly before the Court in this case, but second, if the Court feels that the concurrent sentence doctrine, the validity of the concurrent sentence doctrine should be addressed in this case, we submit that the doctrine should be upheld in its traditional form, which is to say that when concurrent sentences are present, that an appellate court can in an appropriate case affirm the concurrent sentence count without having to review the merits of that count or any challenge under that count."
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1262.32,1264.939,Don't you have to cross-petition to ask for that relief?
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1264.939,1272.343,"--Well, You Honor, we are not asking for any relief, any judgment that is greater than the judgment that the other party is seeking."
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1272.343,1274.461,But you are saying if we reach the issue we should modify the judgment below.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1274.461,1289.97,"Well, no, Your Honor, we are not asking that... in other words, if we had wanted to get the extra $50, let's say, that it appears that one could... one could argue that the Court of Appeals overlooked the fact that there was $150 as opposed to $50."
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1302.545,1302.895,I understand.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1302.895,1305.23,And therefore we are not asking for a greater judgment.
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.949,1317.122,"No, I think you are asking for a greater judgment if you assume that three concurrent sentences are more severe because of their collateral consequences than just two."
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1332.666,1336.951,"Well, except that we may be foreclosed by virtue of our failure to cross-petition--"
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1336.951,1337.368,Right.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1337.368,1360.234,"--from asking for the judgment that would be as favorable as we would be entitled to, but nonetheless we agree, which is all that we can do by virtue of not having cross-petitioned, we agree that at least so much of that judgment as would require the Court of Appeals' current disposition to be reversed, we agree that it should be reversed to that extent."
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1368.006,1370.856,You are just confessing error.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1370.856,1375.56,We are confessing error on the basis of a sentence that--
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1375.56,1376.16,Yes.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1376.16,1377.945,--we think the Court of Appeals misconstrued.
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1377.945,1378.812,And you made a motion.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1378.812,1380.814,And we have made a motion to that effect.
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1380.814,1381.847,You made a motion earlier--
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1381.847,1382.28,That's correct.
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1382.28,1382.766,--a couple of months ago--
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1382.766,1383.282,Yes.
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.049,1387.734,--asking us to vacate and remand.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1387.734,1389.003,That's correct.
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1389.003,1399.109,"Of course, the irony of this case as I see it is that the net result of your joint position may well be that when this... when there is review on the third count they may find there is sufficient evidence, and--"
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1399.109,1401.644,"Well, we are, as a matter of fact, quite confident--"
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1401.644,1402.378,"--you don't complain about that, but--"
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1402.378,1406.03,"--that there is plenty of evidence on that count, but that remains to be seen."
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1411.749,1421.141,"--In light of the special assessment statute, isn't any argument about the concurrent sentence doctrine sort of moot?"
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1421.141,1422.957,"Well, it is largely moot, I think, Your Honor."
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1422.957,1424.843,Because there never will be a concurrent sentence.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1424.843,1432.949,"There are only two settings, I think, in which one could arise in the Federal system, assuming that Congress doesn't repeal the statute any time soon."
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.738,1445.59,"Well, that would be an erroneous--"
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1445.59,1446.057,Exactly.
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.057,1447.323,--an erroneous... that would be a--
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1447.323,1449.391,But there may be a few such cases.
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1449.391,1449.808,--Yes.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1449.808,1451.576,I would assume as time goes on the courts--
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.576,1452.643,What is the other one?
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1452.643,1456.897,--The other situation would be in an Assimilative Crimes Act case.
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1480.596,1490.201,"So if the government's position with respect to the special assessment statute is accepted and it is followed, there never will be another concurrent sentence."
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1490.201,1492.487,"--That's correct, until the statute--"
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1492.487,1493.353,In the Federal system.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1493.353,1500.843,"--In the Federal system until and unless the statute is overturned, assuming we are correct both on our challenge to the Assimilative Crimes Act--"
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.843,1501.326,Yes.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1501.326,1508.413,--case and also to our contention that the special assessment applies consecutively.
1986.86-281,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1508.413,1517.019,And so if we accept your confession of error here we are electing not to address the concurrent sentence doctrine.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1517.019,1517.603,That's correct.
1986.86-281,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1517.603,1521.055,We are saying this was a case in which there weren't concurrent sentences.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1521.055,1523.44,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-281,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1534.397,1540.384,"Mr. Bryson, can we assume that it is true that these fines are routinely sought?"
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1554.561,1556.044,"--They are mandatory, Your Honor."
1986.86-281,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1556.044,1556.811,They are mandatory.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1556.811,1565.786,As the statute... it was devised in order to try to create a fund for witness compensation.
1986.86-281,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1656.093,1659.311,The latter seems to me the most extraordinary of all--
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1659.311,1662.43,"Well, it is extraordinary."
1986.86-281,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1673.638,1685.363,"--I think it is odd because a court is undertaking to vacate a sentence without any finding that there is anything wrong with it, and not on the request of the government."
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1685.363,1717.167,"--That is our principal objection to it, of course, in that courts should be very slow to be vacating presumptively valid convictions on grounds of convenience, but on the other hand what the Court in the Hooper case, which is the D.C. Circuit case that began this... invented this device really, what the Court said was that this count will essentially be put in the deep freeze, and we will hold onto it, and if it turns out later that the government needs the count for some purpose, then we may go back and review it."
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.392,1733.426,xxx conviction and still leave something--
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1733.426,1736.561,"--Well, I think the way you do it is simply declare that you have done it--"
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.561,1737.163,--What is in limbo?
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1737.497,1740.865,"--Well, it just depends on what the Court of Appeals calls it."
1986.86-281,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1781.709,1786.811,They do this presumably pursuant to their supervisory powers over the District Court.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1787.43,1799.754,"I think under 2106 is where the authority came, which is essentially the statutory authority for a Court of Appeals to dispose of the case as it sees appropriate."
1986.86-281,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1800.171,1805.058,Could it be that the court doesn't know the difference between vacate and suspension?
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1805.058,1821.251,"--Well, in the Hooper case they talked in terms of a suspension of the sentence, but I think what they really meant was a little more than just suspension of the sentence, because I don't think, Your Honor, that they meant to leave in effect the verdict of conviction for use as a verdict of conviction--"
1986.86-281,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1821.251,1824.603,I think the verdict of conviction is rather important--
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1824.603,1825.069,--It is.
1986.86-281,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1825.069,1826.555,--for you to know whether it is there or not.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1826.555,1835.761,"It is, and that is why I think... that is one of the Achilles heels, I think, that this Hooper process suffers from, is why we don't believe that is the appropriate--"
1986.86-281,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1835.761,1838.113,When do we get an opportunity to pass on it?
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1839.979,1851.604,"--Well, I don't think so, but were the Court to get to it we would say that for precisely the reason you have said, that this verdict of conviction is important and it seems to be lingering there in the air."
1986.86-281,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1851.604,1857.507,It could be for the purpose of keeping us from getting to it.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1857.507,1867.215,"Well, it certainly has the effect of preventing any further review because the judgment has been vacated."
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.436,1904.555,"Mr. Bryson, may I ask you another question about this case?"
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1913.077,1913.744,That's correct.
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1913.744,1916.463,Was this the first time they laid down this remarkable doctrine?
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1918.065,1918.915,"Oh, it is settled, Your Honor."
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.915,1919.815,They do this all the time.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1920.417,1927.421,I would say 50 percent of their criminal cases in the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits are disposed of unpublished and--
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.421,1928.687,"--No, I don't mean the unpublished opinion."
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1938.061,1938.711,"--Oh, I am sorry, no."
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1946.398,1946.867,They have.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1947.784,1949.45,They have done that in a number of cases.
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1952.654,1956.106,"That is a good reason not to publish the opinion, I suppose, if you want to be inconsistent."
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1956.106,1961.51,"--Well, they certainly have done this in published opinions."
1986.86-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1963.294,1975.235,"Have they ever, to your knowledge, actually exercised their power to take a second look where they say we... you know, the suspended animation business, that the government has ever come back and said, please go ahead and review it?"
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1975.235,2010.741,"The only case in which I know that has happened is a case not out of the Fifth or Eleventh Circuits, but out of the D.C. Circuit, a case called Miller, which was decided... I think it is in 449 F 2nd, in which the government said after the Court of Appeals had applied the Hooper doctrine and vacated this concurrent count had said, wait, this was a separate offense, it was a serious offense, we think the public interest requires that you review this separate offense even though there was a concurrent sentence, and the Court of Appeals acquiesced and did review it and did affirm it."
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.715,2028.302,I suppose... what do you call your handbook now for U.S. Attorneys?
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2028.302,2029.821,--U.S. Attorneys' Manual?
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2029.821,2037.825,I suppose there ought to be some... are you going to amend it to talk about the assessment so that this mistake isn't made again?
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2037.825,2046.514,"Well, I would like to be as optimistic as the question suggests in thinking that an amendment in the U.S. Attorneys' Manual would immediately alert everyone in the field."
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.3,2052.752,"Yes, but U.S. Attorneys shouldn't any longer claim that sentences are concurrent in the Federal circuits."
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2052.752,2054.504,"--Well, interestingly, the U.S. Attorney in this case--"
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2054.504,2054.92,Didn't.
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2054.92,2055.719,--didn't make that argument.
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.411,2070.898,What was the government's answer to that?
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2070.898,2073.031,It didn't address the question of concurrent sentencing.
1986.86-281,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2102.184,2111.456,Have there been any other instances around the country where a Court of Appeals has recognized that there can be no concurrent sentence?
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2111.456,2111.892,--No.
1986.86-281,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2132.889,2139.292,"You speak of concurrent sentences, Mr. Bryson, and anticipating collateral consequences."
1986.86-281,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2151.433,2156.271,It would be if he were right in his analysis of his case.
1986.86-281,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2308.019,2309.219,"Thank you, Mr. Bryson."
1986.86-281,2,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,2311.854,2312.337,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1986.86-281,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2507.064,2508.7,But it was cocaine?
1986.86-281,2,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,2508.7,2509.233,Pardon me?
1986.86-281,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.233,2510.485,But it was cocaine?
1986.86-281,2,29759,joseph_a_connors_iii,,2510.485,2525.678,"Yes, sir, six ounces were delivered, and based on the snitch's overheard conversation, petitioner said that he had three and that they would have to go back and see if they could get the rest."
1986.86-281,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2551.812,2552.478,"Thank you, Mr. Connors."
