1968.49,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,33.176,"Number 49, Zenith Radio Corporation, petitioner, versus Hazeltine Research, Inc., et al."
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,34.852,45.653,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1968.49,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,136.911,151.983,"Mr. McConnell, I'm sorry but you -- there is an issue that's submitted to us, isn't there, as to whether both Hazeltine Corporations are bound here or whether it's just a subsidiary and not the parent?"
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,151.983,152.349,"That's right, Your Honor."
1968.49,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,152.349,153.233,Is there a difference on that?
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,153.233,155.551,I'm going to reach that in the course of my argument.
1968.49,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,155.551,161.283,That's why I didn't really understand why you made your opening statement because there is that issue.
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,161.283,165.945,"There is that issue, Your Honor."
1968.49,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1158.542,1184.88,"Well, is there any issue as to the effect of the release that Zenith executed in this litigation that was settled that has a bearing on the present problem or are you agreeing that what the release operated to benefit Hazeltine?"
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1194.755,1195.824,No.
1968.49,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1195.824,1203.56,"But, various companies who were members of the Canadian radio patent pool were parties."
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1203.56,1204.603,"Well, I --"
1968.49,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1204.603,1204.96,Is that right?
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1204.96,1207.703,I haven't been frank with Your Honor entirely.
1968.49,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1216.686,1251.064,"Alright, well -- but, however it may be, as part of the settlement of that litigation, as I understand the papers before us, Zenith executed a release and that release, in substance, exonerated or relieved of the defendants, with whom Zenith settled, of liability for any past acts -- of any further liability to Zenith for any past acts."
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1251.718,1252.324,No.
1968.49,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1263.151,1292.552,"Well, I -- one important issue here or if it is an issue is whether you do or do not, whether there is or is not agreement that that settlement operated to benefit Hazeltine as a -- as a joint tort visa or whether it did not, are you agreeing on that or is that an issue in dispute before this Court?"
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1292.928,1298.551,"There is an issue in dispute on that, first, as to the fact."
1968.49,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1343.068,1357.642,"Mr. McConnell, you've got a very elaborate job and I -- here, and I don't want to interfere with you in this elaborate case, but I -- all I want to know is whether we do or do not have to worry about the effect of the release."
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1360.932,1361.573,You do.
1968.49,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1361.573,1367.962,Your adversary says that that release does release Hazeltine and you say that it does not.
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1367.962,1369.14,Exactly.
1968.49,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1369.14,1369.188,Alright.
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1369.188,1383.242,"I say, further than that, not only does it not release Hazeltine but it isn't even an issue in the case, except brought in later by offers of proof, alright."
1968.49,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1383.242,1385.919,"Well, it could be amended, couldn't it?"
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1385.919,1401.122,"Under the rules, Your Honor, under the federal rules unless an affirmative defense is pleaded during the trial, so you could meet it."
1968.49,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1401.122,1403.208,During the trial or during the time?
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1403.208,1410.624,During the trial or so close to it that the parties are there trying their lawsuit.
1968.49,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1458.285,1464.432,But you're going to argue the thing on the basis that the Court might disagree with you?
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1464.432,1470.704,"If this Court disagrees with me, well, I say it had absolutely no bearing on the subject."
1968.49,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1474.67,1478.566,I thought the rules were exceedingly liberal?
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1478.566,1482.024,Not in this respect and for a reason.
1968.49,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1500.113,1506.725,Are you saying now that this offer was only made after the case was appealed and in the Court of Appeals?
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1506.725,1513.811,I am saying that this offer was made after findings of fact had been made and the case have been tried.
1968.49,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1513.811,1515.374,But it's still in the Trial Court?
1968.49,0,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,1515.374,1528.929,"Yes, still in the Trial Court, but the release was available at the trial and not offered new theory."
1968.49,1,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5172.756,5174.293,Chief Justice.
1968.49,2,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,5177.32,5178.765,Pardon me.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5178.765,5184.14,Thank you.
1968.49,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5228.333,5229.864,"Is that something new, Mr. Chadwell?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5229.864,5230.393,I beg your pardon?
1968.49,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5230.393,5232.626,Is that something new and unique?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5232.626,5234.116,In this case?
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5497.102,5499.084,"When you say England, do you mean Canada?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5499.084,5500.126,"No, sir, I mean England."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5509.171,5510.345,You're talking now about the --
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5510.345,5521.033,"I am talking now about the English pool, about which Mr. McConnell said nothing although his judgment includes about $15 million for England."
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5553.284,5556.707,Did the Court of Appeals say anything about their credibility?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5556.707,5571.571,"The Court of Appeals did not expressly mention it, except that they did refer to one particularly outrageous instance of it by saying that Zenith's cause was not helped by that testimony."
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5602.938,5607.103,"Well, let's assume the two were believed in the sense."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5614.097,5619.031,"Well, I think it's important that their testimony were impeached."
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5630.407,5632.392,"Well, is there any other testimony?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5636.799,5638.979,"To the -- yes, we made offers of proof."
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5645.034,5646.951,How about the first trial?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5646.951,5651.167,"Well, we were not at the first trial."
1968.49,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5688.974,5694.124,"Mr. Chadwell, in -- the original was on damages."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5696.586,5700.797,They testified at the original hearing not only about damages.
1968.49,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5701.782,5707.109,"Well, did Hazeltine put any evidence concerning damages at all?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5707.109,5711.314,They put on these two men who testified concerning the amount of damages.
1968.49,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5711.314,5713.238,I thought that was Zenith.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5713.238,5714.208,I beg your pardon?
1968.49,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5715.357,5720.465,"Well, did your side put on anything concerning damages that were contrary to what they put on?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5720.465,5722.408,Not at the first trial.
1968.49,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5722.408,5724.245,"So, this stands uncontradicted?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5724.245,5731.894,"Well, at the first trial, but it stands contradicted by their own testimony that they gave at the second hearing."
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5731.894,5738.818,Is that the only reason that there wasn't any countervailing testimony in the first trial?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5738.818,5739.325,"Well, I don't know --"
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5739.325,5741.256,That you took the position that --
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5741.256,5744.043,"Well, I personally was not at the first trial."
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5744.043,5744.282,"No, but you --"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,5744.282,5746.076,And I can't say the reason for it.
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6003.197,6005.234,Which Court held that?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6005.234,6008.066,The trial judge held that.
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6172.538,6174.191,I'm just wondering about that.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6174.191,6175.661,"Yes, sir?"
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6175.661,6183.494,"If it was so wrong what they said, why wasn't that contraverted at the first trial?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6192.949,6198.121,"Well, I can't answer that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6229.709,6239.905,"What did the -- the Trial Court said ""yes, there's an embargos but that, after the embargos were lifted, he still thought that the pools kept Zenith out."""
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6239.905,6239.958,Well --
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6239.958,6243.581,It still gave a judgment with respect to England.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6243.581,6245.411,That's right.
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6263.894,6269.26,I'm just saying that what the Trial Court came out -- all that they did was to award a judgment for England.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6269.26,6269.387,Right.
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6269.387,6271.424,After the date of the embargos.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6271.424,6271.684,"Yes, sir."
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6272.659,6273.705,Mr. Chadwell --
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6273.705,6273.758,I beg your pardon.
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6273.758,6277.336,"Mr. Chadwell, what are the facts?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6281.906,6282.306,"No, I'm not --"
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6282.306,6284.978,"But, I'm not clear about what the facts are."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6296.474,6297.611,That's completely wrong.
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6297.611,6300.84,"Alright, tell me what the facts are, first, about Australia."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6300.84,6301.61,"Yes, sir."
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6301.61,6303.072,Is that right or wrong?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6303.072,6314.584,"In Australia, there was an embargo from 1951 -- from 1939 until April 1960."
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6314.584,6314.746,Well --
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6314.746,6318.334,The embargo there was lifted a year or so later.
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6318.334,6322.374,"Alright, your damage period begins in May 1959."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6322.374,6322.982,"Yes, sir."
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6322.982,6327.558,"So that, there was an embargo in Australia for that portion of the damage period?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6327.558,6328.146,Correct.
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6328.146,6329.507,"Now, turn to England."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6329.507,6330.243,"Yes, sir."
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6330.243,6338.995,"Was there or was there not an embargo in England during the damage period, namely May 1959 to May 1963?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6338.995,6342.183,"There was no governmental embargo during that period, Your Honor."
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6345.745,6347.08,"No, that's the end of my question."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6353.485,6356.633,"Well, the precise facts are those we've just stated."
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6370.809,6383.849,"Alright, but -- so that, when these men were testifying that there was no embargo, I don't know what the context of that testimony is."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6385.554,6386.53,"Yes, sir."
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6386.53,6388.526,And you attacked that testimony.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6388.526,6389.047,"Yes, sir."
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6389.047,6401.875,You do not want us to get the impression that they falsely testified that there was no embargo in England during the damage period.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6403.294,6404.42,No.
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6435.716,6438.371,I am familiar with that point and I understand that point.
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6442.524,6447.749,What was the real purpose of your argument on the embargo in light --
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6447.749,6450.071,"Yes, well, the purpose of it -- excuse me, Your Honor."
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6450.071,6450.381,Yes.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6450.381,6462.082,"The purpose of it was that we tried to reopen the case, and did reopen the case, to -- for the purpose of proving embargos, though they were denied."
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6697.491,6709.726,"Mr. Chadwell, I -- based on some experience, may I ask you really, in the subs -- these people were not cross-examined in the first trial."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6709.726,6711.178,They were in the second trial.
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6711.264,6718.517,"Now, on the second -- what you call the second trial, which is the production of evidence --"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6718.517,6720.121,"Yes, sir."
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6720.121,6735.787,"-- after the findings were made, pursuant to permission of the Court and, I take it, your point must be that, on cross-examination which is really what it was, wasn't it, there was no cross-examination in the first trial was this man?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6766.646,6767.29,"It certainly is, Your Honor."
1968.49,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6767.29,6784.778,"Because, every time you examine a witness particularly on an expert subject of this sort, you bring out lots of facts that they don't had duce on their direct examination."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6784.778,6803.417,"True, but I submit to the -- to Your Honor that when they make statements that are as flat as these were, both times, is something more than you'd normally expect to get by some modification of their testimony."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6803.417,6807.304,"Mr. Chadwell, are you emphasizing the English part of this?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6807.304,6807.662,"Yes, sir."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6807.662,6810.584,And your adversary emphasized the Canadian part.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6810.584,6810.646,Right.
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6810.646,6812.031,What's the reason for that?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6812.031,6828.178,"I think the reason is that, when I started out, I wanted to show how they had buried their testimony with respect to the English part and where we had a second hearing or an additional hearing and did not have one on the Canadian part."
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6850.602,6852.542,Did the Court say so?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6852.542,6871.749,"As I said, Mr. Chief Justice, they did not say so except with respect to the second point and, on that, they said that Zenith didn't gain anything by putting in this testimony concerning convertibility of such."
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6871.749,6889.596,"And, plus, the fact that the District Court, saying this again, after it was all threw with the second phase of the case, nevertheless, thought that these two witnesses weren't believable enough in respects, to award a judgment with respect to England."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6889.596,6890.159,They did.
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6890.159,6891.17,In addition to Canada?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6891.17,6898.163,"It did, but -- now, that judgment with respect to England, Mr. Kayser is going to cover Canada."
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6899.285,6901.807,I see.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6901.807,6909.835,But that testimony with respect to England was all important to the two there.
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6909.835,6922.024,"Well, were you -- are you going to argue that, given their testimony even as change to the second trial, given the truth of it that nevertheless they are not entitled, that the proof was insufficient --"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6922.024,6922.411,Yes.
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6922.411,6924.945,-- to show impact of the fact of damage?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6924.945,6930.065,"There -- yes, sir, and the reason is that there, as I said --"
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6930.065,6933.266,"But of course the Court of Appeals' take, I suppose."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6938.294,6938.631,No.
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6985.339,6991.9,"Is the Court of Appeals bound to view the testimony on a -- in a case like this in the light, most favorable to the --"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6991.9,6993.524,"No, sir, and that --"
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6993.524,6994.721,Employee or not?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,6994.721,7002.692,"And that is a point that I would like to discuss, which you've just briefed, although Mr. McConnell did not refer to it."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7124.38,7127.697,Did they testify already before the judge?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7127.697,7129.282,"Yes, sir, they did."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7129.282,7130.82,He heard their evidence?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7130.82,7131.941,He heard their evidence.
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7131.941,7133.871,And solved that immediately.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7149.606,7149.999,"Yes, sir."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7149.999,7155.671,Largely because of that belief that these two witnesses in here were not credible?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7155.671,7158.222,"Well, I don't think it was only that, Mr. Justice Black."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7158.222,7159.722,"Well, I said largely."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7159.722,7189.489,"Well, I think another very important point to this -- to the Court of Appeals, in fact they said so, is that there was the delay in -- or complete failure to do anything about shipping sets to England because they were awaiting the change of the 625-line broadcast system, and the correspondent shows that, the contemporaneous correspondent shows it without any question of a doubt."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7219.212,7227.98,"Yes, but there is a difference, is there not, between the law in England and the law in Canada on that subject?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7227.98,7228.837,On the subject of --
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7228.837,7231.148,"Well, on the subject of the importation."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7234.147,7234.774,"Well, the --"
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7234.774,7236.768,What could've kept them out of England?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7236.768,7245.368,The only thing that could've kept them out of England that I know of was their desire not to go there until there was a shift in the broadcast standard.
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7248.935,7251.841,Because its difference with reference to Canada.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7251.841,7257.987,"Well, the government -- the plaintiff claims that the pool kept them out, but the pool had nothing to do with it."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7258.607,7260.46,In Canada or in England?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7260.46,7261.529,"In England, I'm talking about."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7261.529,7263.348,"In England, alright."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7269.603,7270.693,"Well, no."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7296.186,7298.344,I'm a little mixed up on these things.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7298.344,7298.843,Yes.
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7298.843,7302.305,How much -- how many millions in England is the judgment and how many millions in Canada?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7302.305,7312.399,"Well, it's approximately $15 million in England and -- in TVs, plus about $2 million in radios."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7312.399,7312.811,And then in --
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7312.811,7314.46,"No, I think it's 13 million and 2 million."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7314.46,7318.368,"How about in Canada, how much was the judgment?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7318.368,7320.339,$19 million in Canada.
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7320.339,7320.992,Mr. Chadwell.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7355.881,7357.135,"Your Honor, in the jack --"
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7357.135,7359.44,"So, Gypsum isn't such a case."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7359.44,7375.324,"Well, in the Jackson case, which was just decided by the Court of Appeals of the District in 1965 and it's discussed at pages 82-83 of our main brief, says that where the -- that a question of credibility can't."
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7401.402,7405.485,"Yes, but the Court of Appeals hasn't said any one of those things here."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7405.485,7406.837,"No, I say --"
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7406.837,7413.164,You said any reason whatsoever for disregarding the testimony of these people --
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7413.164,7416.144,The statement I just made was he only one.
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7416.144,7426.204,But I would agree that even with -- that you still certainly might win by saying that even if their testimony is believed.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7426.204,7427.758,I think that's right.
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7427.758,7429.206,But the Court of -- but --
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7429.206,7430.429,I think that's right.
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7430.429,7439.554,I take your argument to mean that the Court of Appeals not only rejected this testimony but was wholly justified in doing so.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7439.554,7441.175,I think they were wholly justified in doing so.
1968.49,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7441.175,7443.824,"Tell me, what standard do we apply here?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7443.824,7448.555,I think you apply the standard of the DuPont case that I stated.
1968.49,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7448.555,7451.078,"Well, with no authority do we -- the Gypsum case."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7451.078,7452.786,"I'm sorry, the Gypsum case, yes."
1968.49,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7452.786,7454.963,"You mean, then we redo what the Court of Appeals --"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7454.963,7455.302,"No, sir."
1968.49,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7457.093,7459.66,"Well, if we don't redo it, then there must be something less we do."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7461.413,7474.999,"Well, I think that in order to sustain the Court of Appeals, what they did, you either accept their review of the record and their conclusions with respect to the record or you've got to review it."
1968.49,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7474.999,7476.037,That's what I'm trying to get to.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7476.037,7478.542,"Yes, sir."
1968.49,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7478.542,7482.518,"We look at their review and say whether, in some respect, it erred."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7486.574,7488.122,Yes.
1968.49,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7488.122,7492.393,We look at it and test what they did against what standard.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7497.627,7500.385,I think the same standard that they tested it against.
1968.49,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7501.098,7513.646,"That sounds to me, Mr. Chadwell, like doing over again what they did, taking this record and applying the Gypsum test and independently concluding whether the Gypsum test required a reversal."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7513.646,7520.683,"Well, I think the question is whether the Court of Appeals followed the test that it laid down with this Court in Gypsum."
1968.49,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7523.784,7526.187,Yes.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7526.187,7526.998,They said they did.
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7527.115,7529.536,That is a non-jury?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7529.536,7530.112,"Yes, sir."
1968.49,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7530.112,7532.152,"You can say, in a jury case it would be different."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7532.152,7534.915,"Yes, in a jury cast it's different."
1968.49,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7570.423,7577.272,"Well, in doing that, how much did the record that would tie do you think we've got to look at?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7577.272,7587.532,"Well, I would think that you would have to do the job that the Court of Appeals had done in order to decide whether they were right or wrong in what they did."
1968.49,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7587.532,7590.621,"Well, that sounds to me like doing over again what they did."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7590.621,7597.982,"Well, we had -- we pointed out in our briefs, I think, what the record shows on these things."
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7597.982,7621.778,"Well, Mr. Chadwell, as a result of your argument on the embargo in England, do you want us to hold that they're entitled to no damages or do you want us to hold that the damages should be diminished by raise of the fact that they have not tried to build up any business while the embargo was in effect?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7621.778,7635.616,I think that there should be no damages because the evidence does not show through findings or through evidence what the damage should bon this other theory.
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7644.489,7645.748,"Well, is that --"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7645.748,7646.704,I do not disagree.
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7646.704,7648.299,Is that agreeable to you?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7648.299,7653.684,"Well, we think that it's -- that it is not necessary to do that."
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7679.987,7690.359,"Mr. Chadwell, is that concluded and based on the fact that we ought to wipeout of our consideration the testimony of these two men?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7690.359,7695.503,I think you've got to consider it against the other testimony in the record and the other facts.
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7709.283,7713.093,But there was no embargo during the statutory period.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7713.093,7714.437,"That's right, and that show --"
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7714.437,7724.726,"Well now, they do contend, do they not, that the pool prevented them from doing business in England during the statutory period."
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7724.726,7726.219,During the damage period.
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7726.219,7726.646,Yes.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7726.646,7727.8,They -- damage period.
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7727.8,7728.099,Yes.
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7735.619,7743.48,"Because that testimony is contradicted by their contemporaneous documents to the contrary, as I have just said."
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7746.727,7750.87,"Now, when did those contemporaneous documents come in?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7750.87,7752.665,They came in from 1950 --
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7752.665,7754.288,"No, when did it come into this record?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7754.288,7756.296,Into this record?
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7763.39,7764.532,Were they admitted then?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7764.532,7766.377,They were admitted then.
1968.49,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7797.426,7820.398,"Mr. Chadwell, since it is true in this case that the case was closed, findings of fact were issued, and you had it reopened for the purpose of taking additional proof, wouldn't it, on the basis of that, be just as fair for us to adopt the government's position and remand this case?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7820.398,7823.024,"Well, I think this Court could certainly do that."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7841.89,7850.184,Do you think one is bound to reach the same judgment with reference to the Canadian judgment and with reference to the English judgment?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7850.184,7851.058,"Yes, sir."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7852.227,7853.902,Do you think we must do that?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7853.902,7855.407,"Yes, sir."
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7855.407,7859.221,Because you think your argument is better in one than the other?
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7863.984,7865.89,"Well, of course, you could, but I --"
1968.49,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7865.89,7867.308,"Well, why wouldn't it be justified?"
1968.49,3,29529,john_t_chadwell,,7868.656,7870.293,"Well, they are entirely different."
1968.49,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7885.566,7886.876,Mr. Kayser.
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,7886.876,7888.804,May it please the Court.
1968.49,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8061.326,8065.882,"Before you get to that, Mr. Kayser -- before you get to that, if I may interrupt you."
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8091.56,8091.64,Yes.
1968.49,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8091.64,8104.125,"And that this evidence, with respect to the set conversion -- convertibility of the sets, being refuted, there's no evidence in that so --"
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8104.125,8105.793,Repudiated by the witnesses themselves.
1968.49,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8105.793,8110.584,"So, it goes to the question of the fa -- what has been called the fact of damages."
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8110.584,8112.122,"Yes, that plus --"
1968.49,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8112.122,8141.482,"Now, suppose if we should disagree with you on that without getting into the subtleties of that statement, if we should disagree with you on that, I take it that neither you nor Mr. Chadwell is submitting to us that the patent pool -- you're not trying to defend the legality under the antitrust laws of the patent pool and of Hazeltine's participation in it."
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8141.482,8143.937,"I would like to answer that in two parts, if I may."
1968.49,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8171.382,8171.668,I understand that --
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8171.668,8172.663,"Now, on your second question --"
1968.49,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8172.663,8173.905,-- you've made that clear.
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8173.905,8201.365,"On your second question, the fact is that we -- as shown in our brief, entirely cited from any aspect, we believe that it is -- that the record shows that, from January 1958, if they in fact had had an interest in entering the English market from then after the embargo and through the damage period, they could've obtained the license."
1968.49,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8203.303,8205.73,"Yes, but I want to be very clear on one thing."
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8226.553,8235.044,"We -- frankly, Your Honor, as we have seen this case, we have not seen it fit to go into that question."
1968.49,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8246.084,8246.808,That's adequate.
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8250.86,8253.402,"We do not, but we are not arguing it."
1968.49,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8255.254,8258.962,What did you argue before the Court of Appeals on that subject?
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8258.962,8267.343,"On the Court of Appeals, we -- frankly, Your Honor, we made a very brief argument."
1968.49,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8285.478,8299.263,Could we take your briefs in the Court of Appeals on the question of legality as the total of your argument here if we come to that?
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8299.263,8300.082,"No, Your Honor."
1968.49,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8306.928,8314.225,"Well, I would've thought in the Court of Appeals you would have to reach it exhaustively because you had the findings against you."
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8323.755,8336.744,"Your Honor, we -- faced with the situation into which we had been thrust there, frankly, we had to form a judgment as to what emphasis to place."
1968.49,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8439.397,8442.796,Why were they not pleaded in the first trial?
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8442.796,8480.401,"Your Honor, again, we were not counsel but I think the reason they were not pleaded at the first trial was because, under the theory of action which was set forth in the original counterclaim, there would've been no conceivable basis to plead them because, as set forth in that counterclaim and in that motion to file it and, in the affidavit of Mr. Carodi, counsel -- one of counsel for Zenith, it was recited that the acts complained of which formed the basis of this counterclaim which was not filed until 1963, three years after the answer had taken place, after the filing of the answer."
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8707.301,8711.159,"Well, did the pool directly communicate with Zenith?"
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8711.159,8714.056,"No, Zenith has communicated with the pool."
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8714.056,8723.87,But was Zenith ever warned that it required a license from the pool to operate in Canada?
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8724.792,8729.652,"Directly, there were meetings."
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8729.652,8733.415,I thought we were told there was a communication to Zenith in which it was --
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8733.415,8733.46,There were --
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8733.46,8736.541,Proposed a license form for a --
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8736.541,8739.054,"Yes, but --"
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8739.054,8740.686,For domestic production.
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8740.686,8752.036,"Those communications, Mr. Justice White, were between Zenith and the pool, not made known to the distributing public."
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8759.251,8762.948,So the pool said stay out unless you're going to build a factory up here.
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8762.948,8769.659,"No, the pool sent Zenith a license form in --"
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8769.659,8771.046,For what?
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8771.046,8775.645,"Which called for manufacture in Canada, yes."
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8775.645,8786.86,And was it informed that -- wasn't it informed that -- wasn't Zenith informed that the pool held controlling licenses -- controlling facts for which --
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8786.86,8788.662,"No, that --"
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8788.662,8790.13,Zenith required a license?
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8790.13,8801.075,"No, that letter, as I recall, referred to three patents which it was believed -- the letter said it was believed that Zenith would infringe."
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8801.075,8806.819,"And so -- and they needed it -- in order to operate, they needed those licenses?"
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8806.819,8808.754,"Zenith said they didn't need those licenses, --"
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8808.754,8809.247,I see.
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8809.247,8810.177,-- Your Honor.
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8821.794,8828.183,"Well, way of 10% if the pool's view was that you need something with us before you can operate in Canada."
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8828.183,8829.447,"That was suggested, but no action --"
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8829.447,8831.193,"Not only suggested, but said."
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8831.193,8834.922,"It was said, yes, and no action was ever taken."
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8838.309,8840.207,"Well, how did this suit get started?"
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8840.207,8871.437,"This suit has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the foreign business of Zenith or with the Canadian pool, the English pool, or the Australian pool, and I think, possibly, I would like to turn to that point since the question is raised right now because Mr. McConnell, when he was asked on that question, said ""yes, there was a finding to the effect that there was a connection between the instant patent suit and the Canadian operation."""
1968.49,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8871.437,8874.354,He finally said it was on domestic production.
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8874.354,8878.117,"Yes, that there was a connection."
1968.49,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8977.621,8982.602,"Well, that doesn't matter one way or the other, does it?"
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8986.361,8987.953,Whether --
1968.49,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8987.953,8996.156,Whether this suit grew out of a domestic controversy or a controversy that enter its origins related to the foreign countries?
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,8996.156,9000.472,"We don't think it does, Your Honor, but Zenith has argued that point in its briefs."
1968.49,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,9068.925,9070.257,What about the distributors?
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,9080.196,9083.102,"Mr. Justice Marshall, this is part of my next point."
1968.49,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,9083.102,9083.533,Good.
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,9083.533,9085.478,Thank you.
1968.49,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9247.428,9252.301,Is there any finding on that testimony in the Trial Court?
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,9252.301,9261.336,"No, Your Honor, that's one of the things that the Solicitor General pointed out, that you couldn't tell what the Trial Court's supposed theory was."
1968.49,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9315.746,9317.373,I didn't get that last.
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,9317.373,9324.161,We shall show in a minute the fact is that he did -- that Zenith did not have difficulty getting distributors.
1968.49,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9342.149,9347.476,It's either the Court's find on that question was whether that testimony was true?
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,9347.476,9348.402,Not as I recall.
1968.49,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9365.082,9368.304,"Mr. Kayser, may I ask you this?"
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,9509.353,9534.671,"Well, Your Honor, I don't believe that I can agree that there is -- there was a record which would justify any conclusion of the fact of damage because, granted a pool policy, we nevertheless have the fact that Zenith considered itself fully licensed, took that position, and was never in any way interfere --"
1968.49,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9534.671,9548.756,"But, as I think my brother here -- was developed in the colloquy with my brother White, the pool nevertheless took the position that it would not permit the importation of Zenith products into Canada."
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,9602.171,9602.198,I think --
1968.49,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9602.198,9604.819,Are those the issues before us?
1968.49,4,43627,victor_p_kayser,,9604.819,9612.264,"I would think so, Mr. Justice, depending on what you mean adequate basis."
1968.49,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9748.385,9780.244,"Number 49, Zenith Radio Corporation, petitioner, versus Hazeltine Research, Inc., et al."
1968.49,5,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,9781.918,9792.717,Mr. Chief Justice and may members of the Court.
1968.49,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9883.973,9899.046,"Mr. McConnell, I'm sorry but you -- there is an issue that's submitted to us, isn't there, as to whether both Hazeltine Corporations are bound here or whether it's just a subsidiary and not the parent?"
1968.49,5,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,9899.046,9899.394,"That's right, Your Honor."
1968.49,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9899.394,9900.298,Is there a difference on that?
1968.49,5,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,9900.298,9902.978,I'm going to reach that in the course of my argument.
1968.49,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9902.978,9908.329,I didn't really understand why you made your opening statement because there is that issue.
1968.49,5,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,9908.329,9913.034,"There is that issue, Your Honor."
1968.49,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,10007.925,10011.119,-- were there any factors -- was there any factor --
1968.49,6,43627,victor_p_kayser,,10011.119,10015.314,"There was no indication that the pool -- that, beginning after the release --"
1968.49,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,10015.314,10017.084,Why was it at all?
1968.49,6,43627,victor_p_kayser,,10017.084,10029.256,"That is right and, incidentally, the Court of Appeals did make reference to the release in its opinion at page --"
1968.49,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,10029.256,10047.209,"The annual report indicates that Zenith itself was saying ""we wouldn't have any more than this strong distribution system absent the pool."""
1968.49,6,43627,victor_p_kayser,,10047.209,10064.099,"Your Honor, given the proposition that Zenith, in making its claim and in having a market, starts from scratch would have to start, we say, from scratch in 1957 because of these releases."
1968.49,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,10100.912,10108.611,"Mr. McConnell referred to an annual report showing $14 million annual business, I gather."
1968.49,6,43627,victor_p_kayser,,10113.16,10120.693,"The report that he refers to, I believe, is the -- is a report which I think they made to the Commerce Department or something like that."
1968.49,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,10125.5,10134.877,"I see, and you -- do you think we can or cannot properly take judicial notice of the report to which he refers?"
1968.49,6,43627,victor_p_kayser,,10134.877,10139.906,"I think, Your Honor, you could take judicial notice of it bec -- but, I don't think it means anything."
1968.49,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,10139.906,10141.648,I said properly.
1968.49,6,43627,victor_p_kayser,,10141.648,10145.148,"Yes, but I don't think it means anything."
1968.49,6,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,10184.596,10187.032,Does that refer specifically to Canada?
1968.49,6,43627,victor_p_kayser,,10187.032,10189.114,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1968.49,7,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,10527.612,10534.305,"I was taking the task by Mr. Chadwell for not mentioning England, but I ran out of time."
1968.49,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,10536.625,10542.143,"Before you ran out of time, you're going to get on this point where it's made an impression."
1968.49,7,43062,thomas_c_mcconnell,,10542.143,10548.504,"I will, Your Honor."
