1991.91-971,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.908,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-971, Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,57.409,61.202,"Mr. Chief Justice, and Justices of the Court, good morning."
1991.91-971,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,125.013,135.781,"Mr. Corson, I think this case arose under a previous version of section 43(a) of the Lanham Act."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,135.781,136.931,That is correct.
1991.91-971,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,136.931,139.532,"Now, it's been revised."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,139.532,140.643,Yes.
1991.91-971,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.643,148.297,Do you think that under the revision of this statute that secondary meaning always must be shown?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,148.297,149.99,Yes.
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,187.132,194.867,"If we think that secondary meaning is not required in a trade dress case, do you lose?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,194.867,196.049,Yes.
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,196.049,208.278,So that the brief for the Private Label Association states the question accurately... it states it differently than you do... but it states accurately the question that's before the Court?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,208.278,211.31,"I believe it does, but with contextual variation."
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,213.2,221.257,So we have to assume that this would be a protected trade dress if secondary meaning is not required?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,221.257,222.397,"That is correct, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,246.202,247.043,Why was it changed?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,248.623,258.38,"The basis for changing it was not well articulated, sir; it was simply the judgment that on viewing it, it was arbitrary or fanciful."
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,258.38,259.97,Was there some agency involved?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,259.97,260.62,"No, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,260.62,262.163,"Well, who changed it?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,262.163,264.094,The Fifth Circuit... the judgment--
1991.91-971,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,264.094,267.636,"Well, so it was changed within the Fifth Circuit then, is what you're saying."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,267.636,271.239,"--Yes, de novo, on de novo... basically under a de novo standard it was viewed."
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,287.088,290.901,Did it overturn any prior decision of the Fifth Circuit?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,290.901,293.703,"--Not that I recall, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,294.745,296.474,It wasn't based on any change in the statute?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,296.474,297.466,"--No, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,304.26,307.34,"And it recognized that it was in... contrary to other circuits, or not?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,307.34,309.093,"It did not discuss that, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,309.093,310.192,Was it?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,310.192,311.003,Yes.
1991.91-971,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.003,320.23,"But we didn't take the case on the question of whether the restaurant is inherently distinctive in its trade dress, did we?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,320.23,324.444,"No, I believe it's on the question really of whether secondary meaning is required."
1991.91-971,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,324.444,325.864,"Exactly, yes."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,325.864,328.445,And I think the notion--
1991.91-971,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,328.445,340.644,"So we should just assume the inherently distinctive trade dress, for purposes of answering the secondary meaning issue?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,340.644,347.619,"--That is a difficult proposition that has caused confusion in the case, Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,347.619,354.822,"Yeah, but I thought you said that you lose if we decide secondary meaning is not necessary."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,354.822,355.754,That is correct.
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,357.263,366.12,"Well, if it wasn't inherently distinctive, you never even get to secondary meaning, do you?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,366.12,372.554,"If it is not inherently distinctive, of necessity you have to address the question of inherent distinctiveness."
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,415.894,429.391,"Well, I would think... I would think here... I think any... based on trade dress would be almost impossible to prove if you require secondary meaning in the case of a new business."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,429.391,431.492,"The difficulty, sir, is that--"
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,431.492,432.313,Is that right?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,434.023,435.065,--Depending on--
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.065,443.34,"Wouldn't you hate to be recognized... trying to prove a secondary meaning on behalf of a restaurant chain that had just started out, or just one restaurant?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,443.34,443.71,--Yes.
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.71,444.752,It would be kind of tough.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,444.752,445.252,Yes.
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,465.767,466.798,Do you see that... do you think that's a--
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,466.798,468.33,--The Second Circuit rule.
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,468.33,470.361,--the Fifth Circuit would be right for 6 months or so?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,470.361,471.002,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,474.623,485.422,Do you have authority in trademark law where such temporal protection is granted in other instances?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,485.422,486.033,"No, sir, no sir."
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,514.679,519.803,"Well, it seems to me that your concession makes your case much more difficult."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,528.318,529.81,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,529.81,539.017,And it seems to me... maybe I'm wrong... but the rationale of your temporal protection is to punish or prohibit copying.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,539.017,543.929,"Sir, I believe the argument is a narrow one."
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,574.54,574.998,I understand that.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,580.023,593.571,"The rationale for it is exactly the fact that if somebody comes into a market, they are fresh and new to the market, they develop a trade dress which is highly unusual, that for a limited period of time they should be afforded some protection."
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,593.571,594.012,Why?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,594.012,599.245,"Because they have spent time, and money, and energy in developing that... and because one of--"
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,599.245,601.886,"But that's a copying rationale, not a confusion rational."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,606.701,607.011,"--And because, sir--"
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,607.011,609.432,"And if I'm wrong, please advise me."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,609.432,622.131,"--Okay, and because... I'm going to bring something else to it at this point... and because as looking at it from the appearance, a judgment can be reasonably made that it is arbitrary, fanciful, or suggestive."
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,639.002,640.412,"Well, then--"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,640.412,641.654,This case is distinguished.
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.654,649.988,--it's wrong to immediately copy a new trade dress that is highly unusual?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,654.392,659.585,"No, right after that there would be a requirement that secondary meaning be proved."
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,659.585,662.718,"Well, I know, but you can copy it unless you can prove secondary meaning."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,662.718,663.068,That's right.
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.48,673.343,What do you think secondary meaning means?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,673.343,685.702,--It means the public recognizes that the trade dress is a symbol of an exclusive origin for the goods and services sold in connection with it.
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,715.371,719.633,It... and there's a finding in this case that there is no secondary meaning?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,719.633,722.655,"There is a finding in this case that there is no secondary meaning, sir, yes."
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.655,725.567,Was that in the district court?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,725.567,726.749,That was in the district court.
1991.91-971,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.749,731.914,Is the term inherently distinctive one that is found in the statute?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,731.914,733.313,"No, sir, it's judicial gloss."
1991.91-971,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,733.313,735.073,From the Fifth Circuit?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,735.073,740.537,Um... from trademark law and the common law that antedates the statute.
1991.91-971,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,740.537,744.43,Uh... and what does it mean?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,744.43,766.994,"It means that we, from the appearance of this particular mark, trade dress, what you will, infer that it is arbitrary or fanciful, as those terms are used in trademark law, so that we will say it is inherently distinctive, or we will give it a presumption of distinctiveness."
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.994,770.265,"Oh, when you said a while ago, you described it as highly unusual."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,770.265,771.647,"That would be a way, too."
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.647,773.177,And highly unusual.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,773.177,774.84,There's a problem with the language.
1991.91-971,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.84,781.663,You also say arbitrary or fanciful... all those could be included within the meaning of inherently distinctive?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,781.663,787.429,"Technically it's arbitrary, fanciful, or suggestive... those three are historically the ones that--"
1991.91-971,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,787.429,789.49,"And that's what, by the common law?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,789.49,792.231,--That is common law heritage that's been codified.
1991.91-971,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,792.231,800.807,"Mr. Corson, does any of these cases that involve trade dress involve restaurants as well?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,817.339,818.578,That's precisely the problem.
1991.91-971,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.578,822.061,"And you're paying some money for the food, and you're paying some money for the ambiance."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,828.286,829.746,It has functional characteristics.
1991.91-971,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.05,858.603,"Well, a whole business... I mean Macy's might have a distinctive Macy's look about the store."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,869.071,870.972,"The analogy is packaging, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,870.972,872.444,--Is... the analogy is--
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,872.444,873.165,Packaging.
1991.91-971,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.165,873.904,--Packaging.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,873.904,874.836,Packaging for the product.
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.062,892.367,"Well, then I don't understand, again, your concession about a temporary protection... if it's just descriptive or functional."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,895.168,898.941,"That's correct, because it would be denied the presumption on the basis of its appearance."
1991.91-971,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,914.202,911.17,I don't think it is packaging.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,925.199,926.07,--If that's the case--
1991.91-971,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.07,927.14,This is not the package.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,928.562,943.27,"--If that's the case, Justice Scalia, then what you are doing is protecting the delivery of a product, and making the provision of that particular product exclusive to one source so that the competitors may not sell that product."
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,951.175,960.111,"You can sell the same kind of a product, you just can't copy the other fellow's ambiance."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,960.111,960.922,--If you--
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.922,962.783,You can have your own.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,962.783,965.835,"--If you take his position, you can't sell that product."
1991.91-971,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,994.074,1001.548,"Well, I suppose to have a Lanham Act recovery, you have to be sure that the item is nonfunctional."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1001.548,1002.57,Yes.
1991.91-971,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1002.57,1005.592,To which the trade dress is applied.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1015.896,1016.647,Yes.
1991.91-971,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1016.647,1018.848,"But we don't have that issue here, do we?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1018.848,1019.719,That is correct.
1991.91-971,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1019.719,1026.545,We just took this to decide whether secondary meaning must be required.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1026.545,1027.473,That is correct.
1991.91-971,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1027.473,1029.707,So maybe we ought to talk about that a little bit.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1029.707,1030.366,That is right.
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1053.152,1060.486,Is the line that you draw between trade dress and other kind of trademarks what is registerable?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1060.486,1062.008,"No, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1062.008,1068.761,Are we going to have problems in drawing lines between what is a trade dress and what is some other type of protected mark?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1068.761,1071.753,"No, you can avoid that problem."
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1071.753,1072.394,How?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1072.394,1082.081,"In regard to trade dress, it is conceivable that there are some types of trade dress which can be registered."
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1100.564,1104.126,So then we have a subset of trade dresses.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1106.257,1109.47,This would become a whole business image trade dress case.
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1109.47,1120.516,"May I ask you... in your judgment, could your opponent have obtained a registration, have registered this trade dress?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1120.516,1122.296,"Not in a million years, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1122.296,1124.269,It would not be subject to registration?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1124.269,1125.208,It would not be subject to registration.
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.749,1145.541,"Now, are you saying that about this particular trade dress, or are you saying no trade dress can be registered?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1145.541,1146.983,"No, this particular trade dress, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.983,1155.338,"Even if it were... even if it's inherently distinctive, it cannot be... it could not be registered, and even if it's nonfunctional and nondescriptive."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1155.338,1167.828,"If it were registered... assume it was inherently distinctive, and it was registered, there could be a litigation, immediately thereafter, which would rebut the presumption if it could be proved it had no secondary meaning."
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.828,1171.811,Let me ask you one other sort of basic question.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1176.292,1176.753,"Correct, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1176.753,1180.666,There is no... they did not allege a common law cause of action under a Texas common law?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1180.666,1184.347,"I believe they did, but it folded in under the 43(a) section."
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1188.371,1197.606,It's at least theoretically possible in some States that even though there's no remedy under 43(a) they might nevertheless recover if the State chose to give protection.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1197.606,1199.707,"That is correct, and New York would be an example."
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1199.707,1210.166,"Yeah, does any State... any circuit other than the Second Circuit follow this rule of incipient, secondary meaning or whatever... what, you know, developing secondary meaning, or whatever you call it?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1210.166,1216.059,"No, sir, the New York district courts are grappling with it; the Second Circuit does not know what it thinks of it very clearly just yet."
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1219.82,1221.792,And you think it's good law or bad law?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1221.792,1238.713,"I think for a trade dress that on the face of it qualifies as being arbitrary and fanciful for a limited period, some protection... not in the form of lost profits from diverted customers, but simply some portion of development costs might be reasonable."
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1244.457,1253.113,You say if it's just a matter of business image there can be no protection.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1265.05,1269.224,"Yes, sir... no, technically, trade dress ought to be limited to appearance."
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1269.224,1274.317,"If you said what is your image, I would think it's what people think of you, or what... how people look at you."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1274.317,1278.529,"Justice White, that is precisely a problem with the jury instructions in this case."
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1290.877,1301.634,"You say if this chain of restaurants has an image in the public mind, what is it?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1302.203,1304.456,That's a problem.
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.556,1307.138,"--I know, but why isn't it secondary meaning?"
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1307.138,1310.791,--It doesn't have secondary meaning because there's too many images.
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1322.767,1324.329,The Circuit looks at it in totality.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1324.329,1325.859,"Say again, sir?"
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1325.859,1330.414,The Fifth Circuit doesn't just look at one thing or the other.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1332.194,1333.015,That's right.
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1427.316,1431.36,"Well, you say they have that protection for 6 months, or 9 months, or a year."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1431.36,1431.951,"Oh, but this--"
1991.91-971,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1431.951,1432.759,I just don't understand that.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1432.759,1433.841,"--They're well past that, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.261,1458.455,It doesn't seem... I think what Justice Kennedy's saying is it doesn't seem any more reasonable to protect it for 6 months than it does for a longer period.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1458.455,1459.336,That's a fair judgment.
1991.91-971,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1459.336,1465.58,"I mean... yeah, but the problem you're addressing, as Justice O'Connor pointed out is, it seems to me, a problem of functionality."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1473.117,1474.487,Also a descriptive--
1991.91-971,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.487,1475.648,But that's out of this case.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1475.648,1477.158,"--No, and also descriptive characteristics."
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.548,1495.491,"Yes, but in your McDonald's case, suppose they have the golden arch."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1511.6,1514.605,"--Sir, McDonald's did it differently."
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1514.605,1518.436,"I mean, the golden arch is a big part of their unique picture."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1518.436,1519.147,Very much.
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1548.805,1558.172,"No, but here, under the findings of the jury, as I understand it, they, in effect, said that the stripes and the plants, and the way they have the carports and so on are the equivalent of a golden arch."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1558.172,1559.113,--But they're not.
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.113,1559.402,Is that--
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1559.402,1559.913,The public--
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.913,1561.943,--But then you're arguing it's not inherently distinctive.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1561.943,1565.276,--The public doesn't recognize the appearance of their restaurant.
1991.91-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1583.247,1585.05,Different from a trademark.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1585.05,1585.33,Because it doesn't serve.
1991.91-971,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.33,1587.371,Why is it different from a trademark in that regard?
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1605.754,1607.364,You have two questions.
1991.91-971,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1607.364,1607.624,Right.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1607.624,1608.856,I'll answer the last one first.
1991.91-971,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.443,1630.949,"Well, I... you're proposing a system for protecting trade dress to handle the incipient trade dress."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1643.417,1644.637,That's a fair criticism.
1991.91-971,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1644.637,1648.13,It is a fair criticism.
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1648.13,1648.671,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.671,1655.927,"Of course, we don't have to decide whether there would be a 6 months when... all you want us to say it can't be 11 years."
1991.91-971,0,33792,kimball_j_corson,,1655.927,1656.718,"That's correct, sir."
1991.91-971,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1661.33,1663.37,"Thank you, Mr. Corson."
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1665.621,1679.151,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.942,1715.684,--your client?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1715.684,1716.886,--Absolutely.
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1716.886,1717.507,Where?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1717.507,1726.232,"In Houston, Dallas, El Paso, and cities all over the State... as Taco Cabana moved into exactly the same markets that Two Pesos opened in."
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.16,1738.461,May I just ask one factual... you said 1983?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1738.461,1739.192,That's right.
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1746.277,1749.529,They used the same inherently distinctive design?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1749.529,1756.603,"--No, it was a converted Dairy Queen restaurant that was not pink, that didn't have the garage doors, didn't have the two-box structure."
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.67,1769.272,Is it critical to your case that there was competition?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1778.728,1791.176,"The traditional rule, which has also been applied under 43(a) is that if a competitor innocently adopts a similar trademark or trade dress, in a remote area--"
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1791.176,1794.847,"Suppose they travel through San Antonio and say boy, that's a good-looking plan."
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1797.589,1800.18,--I think we could have enjoined them.
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1800.18,1800.911,You think you could.
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1800.911,1801.352,Yes.
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1801.352,1803.182,Is that essential to your case that you could?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1803.182,1811.389,"Not at all, because as the Fifth Circuit specifically said in this case, what we are talking about here is the zone of the natural expansion of Taco Cabana's business."
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.948,1828.12,So the heart of your case does not turn on copying.
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1831.762,1840.248,"--That's right, the intent of Two Pesos is not essential to a violation of 43(a)."
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1862.351,1866.805,"One other question, and then I'll let... could you have registered your trade dress?"
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1866.805,1868.595,I think we could.
1991.91-971,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1922.961,1929.896,"Well, some courts have found that restaurants just can't be covered."
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1931.107,1932.539,"I don't think that's... no, I don't think that's right, Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-971,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.742,2006.716,I know if I go into a Howard Johnsons it's likely to look a certain way.
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2036.216,2036.594,"Right, then--"
1991.91-971,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.594,2038.957,"That is a, somehow, a Lanham Act violation?"
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2038.957,2040.65,--I think probably not.
1991.91-971,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.733,2113.797,"Did they mean by functionality exactly what I mean, that is that people go to the restaurant just because they like that decor?"
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2113.797,2141.356,"The jury instruction on functionality is, in fact, a fairly length one, and allowed Two Pesos to argue that what was... what Taco Cabana was claiming protection for served any significant function as part of what it was selling to the public, that competitors and other Mexican restaurants needed, or reasonably needed this feature... whatever it was... or this combination in order to offer a substitute product."
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.202,2180.552,"Well, why would your client spend all this money on a so-called trade dress if people didn't really... if it really didn't think people... it was going to attract people and it would mean that they would come there rather than someplace else?"
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2180.552,2191.067,"--Well, because the reason a trade dress, like a trademark, is adopted is not to attract people, but to identify the business to the customer, to consumers."
1991.91-971,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2201.944,2205.507,"Well, isn't that secondary meaning, though, in a sense if you say I've been there before, and--"
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2205.507,2216.523,"--Secondary meaning... we have to, I think, be careful about this... secondary meaning is a concept of widespread recognition throughout a market, here throughout Texas."
1991.91-971,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2251.708,2254.129,--It's a very esoteric distinction.
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2254.129,2260.943,"Well, the statute, in section 2 of the Lanham Act makes a very... makes exactly this distinction, even though it doesn't use these terms."
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2276.003,2277.796,"Well, that goes to whether you can register or not."
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2277.796,2278.964,--That's right.
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.964,2281.247,Those words aren't in section 43(a).
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2281.247,2281.896,"No, that's right."
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2282.968,2289.513,"If your whole... the whole statutory issue, as I understand it, is whether your opponent has provided the public with a false designation of origin."
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2289.513,2292.544,--Or a false description or a false representation.
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2292.544,2296.245,Which do you rely on mostly in 43?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2301.61,2304.903,"Well, in fact, I think all of them do."
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2314.37,2318.404,And you wouldn't insist on saying it tends falsely to describe or represent the same?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2318.404,2320.023,"--Well, I think it does that."
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.003,2336.075,It falsely represents... representing it to somebody.
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2348.493,2349.412,That's exactly right.
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2363.393,2370.206,"I'm not sure, then, why you're so terribly harmed by our adopting the requirement that a secondary meaning is required."
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2370.206,2376.58,"This case, I think, exactly illustrates why that doesn't make any sense."
1991.91-971,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2423.911,2440.253,"But isn't that... isn't that some evidence, or grounds for an inference that the reason the competitor adopted the trade dress was because it sold... not because it was attempting to confuse?"
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2440.253,2445.156,"No, some evidence... yes, I think it is probably some evidence."
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2480.7,2482.25,"Yes, but couldn't you have registered during those 3 years?"
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2482.25,2483.852,"--As I say, I--"
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.852,2484.723,And then have gotten your protection?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2484.723,2486.634,"--As I say, I think we could have."
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2486.634,2491.095,"Isn't that perhaps the mistake that was made, that you should have registered?"
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2491.095,2494.688,"I... well, I don't think it was a mistake."
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2537.777,2542.749,Is there some requirement in trademark law that the mark acquire a secondary meaning?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2542.749,2548.403,--Let me try to be careful about this.
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.403,2555.118,If I... say... may I attack a registered mark on the ground that it does not have a secondary meaning?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2555.118,2557.449,Not if it's inherently distinctive.
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.355,2586.297,What is the... what does inherently distinctive mean?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2595.784,2597.184,"Yes, absolutely."
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.714,2611.084,But to win under this--
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2611.084,2611.696,--recognized.
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.696,2617.639,"--statute, this section, you've got to prove that it's a false representation to people."
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2617.639,2619.039,That's right.
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2636.012,2639.202,And it also makes it impossible for you to acquire a secondary meaning.
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2639.202,2639.803,That's right.
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2641.065,2650.231,So I take it you don't challenge... wasn't there a finding that you had... your client had never acquired a secondary meaning in this--
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2650.231,2653.203,"--Throughout the State of Texas, that's exactly right."
1991.91-971,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2668.861,2674.805,"--Well, that finding, then, was that it simply hadn't acquired the meaning throughout the State, not that it hadn't acquired the meaning anywhere in the State."
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2674.805,2675.546,--That's exactly right.
1991.91-971,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2675.546,2675.786,Yeah.
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2675.786,2685.912,"I think if the question had been put to the jury, has Taco Cabana's trade dress acquired secondary meaning in San Antonio, I suspect we would have gotten a quite different answer."
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2698.28,2702.053,"Yes, but the way we granted certiorari, maybe you're entirely right."
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2728.051,2729.082,That's right.
1991.91-971,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2729.082,2746.673,"Well, as it comes to us, I assume that we take the case on the assumption that there is an inherently distinctive trade dress, that it is nonfunctional, and there is no secondary meaning."
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2749.655,2755.209,"Yes, I think that is the legal question that this Court took to decide."
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2867.091,2870.263,May I ask you kind of a basic question of approach to the case?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2873.055,2873.776,6.
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.776,2876.778,--1946... and it's kind of a common law statute.
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2897.391,2901.114,I think... let me try to answer that this way.
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3052.242,3060.646,"Suppose all you had... suppose there wasn't any distinctive trade dress, but you had distinctive food in the sense that it was awfully good Mexican food."
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3071.996,3077.439,"Well, aside from trade secret claims, the Lanham Act would say nothing whatsoever about that."
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3077.439,3077.98,So I--
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3077.98,3079.48,The product is unprotected.
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3079.48,3088.306,--So they could steal... they could steal all your recipes and copy your recipes?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3088.306,3089.117,"Well, as I--"
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.117,3091.248,And you would have no protection for it?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3091.248,3094.05,--No protection under the Lanham Act.
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3099.192,3104.627,"Oh, I know, but... you're not talking about a trade secret."
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3108.21,3109.362,That's right.
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.362,3112.855,With whom you didn't have a contract not to compete.
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3112.855,3123.24,"As I say, the Lanham Act does not restrict competitor's right to sell, essentially, the same product... assuming it gets that product."
1991.91-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3123.24,3131.264,But that is if you sell it... if you sell it in the context of a... of a trade dress that is uniquely--
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3131.264,3137.719,"Well, what it protects is the trade dress."
1991.91-971,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3163.746,3167.038,--What if Taco Cabana has a mariachi band?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3173.773,3177.746,I think the answer to that is yes.
1991.91-971,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3206.435,3213.259,"But if they had the band in front of the door, and they all wore orange uniforms and orange hats, your answer would be different?"
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3213.259,3215.79,It might well be different.
1991.91-971,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3227.739,3228.778,It also assumes that these bands don't always wear orange.
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3230.01,3231.62,"I assume that's true, too."
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.62,3236.294,Earlier I asked you about registration.
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3254.647,3255.488,"Well, what--"
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.488,3258.357,Or do they have to be just copying the one you're using at the particular time?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3258.357,3277.472,"--What we have to show, in order to become entitled to protection, is that they came confusingly close to an image that the consuming public can and does, in small or large numbers, identify itself... our restaurants with."
1991.91-971,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3286.218,3289.94,But you then... you do take the position you must put on some consumer testimony to win your case?
1991.91-971,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3295.322,3297.012,"You could, but it would be risky."
1991.91-971,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3341.102,3341.783,"Thank you, thank you, Mr. Taranto."
1991.91-971,2,33792,kimball_j_corson,,3367.702,3373.543,"Sir, if it's inherently distinctive, it may be challenged on the ground that it's functional or descriptive and contains those elements."
1991.91-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3378.668,3382.45,"Well, here's... did you answer my question, really?"
1991.91-971,2,33792,kimball_j_corson,,3384.251,3385.032,I'll try again.
1991.91-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.33,3392.977,"Well, here's a mark; here's a mark; and somebody wants to challenge it."
1991.91-971,2,33792,kimball_j_corson,,3399.552,3401.582,"That should be enough, yes."
1991.91-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3401.582,3409.737,"Well, I thought... I thought... I thought he also had to prove that it didn't... that it wasn't inherently distinctive."
1991.91-971,2,33792,kimball_j_corson,,3409.737,3416.952,"No, if you prove it has second... if you prove it has no secondary meaning, what you have proved is that the public doesn't recognize this as a mark."
1991.91-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3416.952,3419.483,Then you disagree with your colleague on the other side.
1991.91-971,2,33792,kimball_j_corson,,3419.483,3420.234,"I do, I do."
1991.91-971,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3423.435,3428.58,And you give that answer with respect to trade dress or all trademarks?
1991.91-971,2,33792,kimball_j_corson,,3428.58,3433.383,"--Certainly as to trade dress; and with respect to trademarks I can go that far, also, sir."
1991.91-971,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3434.004,3434.795,I didn't hear the answer--
1991.91-971,2,33792,kimball_j_corson,,3434.795,3436.465,"--I think I'd go that far, also."
1991.91-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3479.574,3486.007,"--Well, what if it's a... there's a false representation to maybe 100 people, but no more?"
1991.91-971,2,33792,kimball_j_corson,,3491.559,3494.842,"--I think... no, it has to be recognized... recognition generally in the marketplace."
1991.91-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3499.146,3504.519,So here... but there is nothing in 43 that even mentions secondary meaning.
1991.91-971,2,33792,kimball_j_corson,,3511.414,3522.702,"Two points... it's judicial gloss, in part; and also, if you look to section 2 of the act, they clearly preclude the registration of a mark without proof of secondary meaning unless it's--"
1991.91-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3522.702,3523.162,"--Well, this isn't a mark."
1991.91-971,2,33792,kimball_j_corson,,3525.744,3526.185,--That's true.
1991.91-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3526.185,3533.057,This is a trade dress and that says... I gather you agree a trade dress can be protected under 43?
1991.91-971,2,33792,kimball_j_corson,,3533.057,3534.259,Yes.
1991.91-971,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3546.097,3548.398,"Thank you, Mr. Corson."
