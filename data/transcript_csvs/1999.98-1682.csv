1999.98-1682,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.42,"We'll hear argument now in No. 98-1682, the United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,10.039,12.758,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1682,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,68.81,75.898,"Mr. Feldman, is there evidence in the record of actual signal bleed as opposed to the potential for it?"
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,78.016,80.868,There's very substantial evidence of that.
1999.98-1682,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,104.567,127.497,"While I have you interrupted, what level of scrutiny do you think our precedents dictate... govern our analysis here in light of the fact that we've said that cable television and the Internet are entitled to strict scrutiny?"
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,127.497,138.871,"The Court has never said that with respect to the question of indecency on cable television, and in fact, the Court has specifically declined to decide that question in the past on a number... several occasions."
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,186.436,196.244,"Mr. Feldman, do... do I have to... do I have to assume, for purposes of this case, that what is at issue here is just what you call indecency and not obscenity?"
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,213.705,217.073,--I think that for purposes of this case you have to assume that it's indecency.
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,217.073,218.057,Why do I have to assume that?
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,218.057,228.631,"Well, because... I suppose because that's... that's what... insofar as... insofar as there's obscenity that's being broadcast on cable television, it's already independently unlawful under the statute."
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,228.631,235.035,"Well, you... you can have... you can have more than one means of... of preventing that evil, it seems to me."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,251.161,251.611,Yes.
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,262.186,266.488,I don't care what community you're in.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,270.125,270.942,Well--
1999.98-1682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,270.942,278.814,"On that score, Mr. Feldman, you... in your brief you urge particularly that we look at exhibits 1, 2, and 44."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,278.814,279.564,--Um-hmm.
1999.98-1682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,279.564,284.033,Are those typical or are those the worst cases?
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,284.033,287.936,Those are... I can't... I can't answer that question because I can't say which they are.
1999.98-1682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,293.257,298.192,"Yes, but for example, one of them, 2, is not as graphic as 1."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,298.192,298.575,Right.
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.469,312.935,Yes.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,349.994,351.794,--I... I would... I would agree with that.
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.794,355.148,That... that would be a good answer if there existed any such channels.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,366.17,378.394,"Well, I... I guess the... the... I don't think there's a record made as to whether there are other channels that broadcast materials that... that wouldn't be obscene under... well, let me put it this way."
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,378.394,380.946,What does the statute cover in... in its terms?
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,384.667,388.702,I think it's channels primarily devoted to sexually explicit programming.
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.702,389.185,Right.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,401.01,403.795,"Well, I don't know based on this record whether there are or not."
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.08,411.817,I have a... I have a very deep suspicion what the answer is.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,411.817,414.686,"--Well, I... I don't know... I don't know what the answer is."
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.596,432.731,Maybe it should have been.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,432.731,433.231,--I beg your pardon?
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,433.231,434.114,Maybe it should have been.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,449.974,460.931,"Well, I think it's exceptionally difficult to litigate an issue such as whether material is obscene that's broadcast on a nationwide channel because there are standards that differ from State to State and the case law and the results--"
1999.98-1682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,460.931,464.549,"Mr. Feldman, wouldn't that be the... wouldn't that be the prosecutor's choice?"
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,487.499,488.082,--No.
1999.98-1682,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,489.215,490.451,"May I ask this, Mr. Feldman?"
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,495.736,497.687,"If it were all obscene, then... then--"
1999.98-1682,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,497.687,498.57,The statute is a nullity.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,499.472,502.191,--The statute wouldn't... wouldn't have been necessary--
1999.98-1682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,502.191,503.124,Can you tell me--
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,503.124,505.893,"--But I... I do think that... well, I'd just go back to what I said--"
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.893,508.578,--You'd prosecute each one of these movies one by one.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,512.28,514.446,"--Well, that's not... that's not historically what has been done."
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,547.703,552.921,"Mr. Feldman, I... I'm sure everybody would agree that this happens in some instances."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,572.735,574.302,How... how often the children are actually tuning in to it?
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,574.302,576.037,--How much... how much of it is being--
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,576.037,579.323,I don't think there's any way to know how much the children are actually tuning in to it.
1999.98-1682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,588.412,593.399,--Does that include the... the homes of the parents that subscribe to these channels?
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,593.399,593.815,I don't think it does.
1999.98-1682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,605.206,610.61,I... I think the figures you cite show there there's a substantial problem.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,623.518,627.287,I think it has to... it has to be a... it has to be a significant problem.
1999.98-1682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,628.322,630.272,--Significant problem nationwide?
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,630.272,636.475,"--Well, I guess I... I would want to know whether what you're talking about is the availability of it in 1... or 10 homes or the number of children that are actually watching--"
1999.98-1682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,636.475,642.998,"I think it's fairly much of an academic point based on your figures, but I just wanted to know what the... what the standard was to the extent of the evil."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,642.998,659.175,"--I think that the... the only... well, the reason I can't answer that is I think the question and the question on which the district court decided... well, the key question here is to compare the extent to which there's a burden of speech that's imposed by section 505 with the evil that it's addressing."
1999.98-1682,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,677.569,689.444,"Well, certainly in our kiddie pornography cases, Ferber against New York, we did not require any very comprehensive showing of how many children were engaged in it."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,691.062,700.585,"--That's correct, and if you look at the Pacifica case, there was one complaint by... from one parent that triggered the Pacifica litigation, and there was no showing in that record that there was more than one child who listened to it."
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.66,712.576,What material?
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,731.556,733.673,"--They... they... well, I suppose they could be--"
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,733.673,744.864,"You... you want us to decide this case on the basis of... really what Congress was after was channels that use some... some naughty words that shouldn't be used, indecency and not... not obscenity."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,744.864,745.214,--No.
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.056,765.627,"That's not what Congress addressed in... in using the word indecency, which is... which is defined very broadly."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,767.146,768.596,"Right, that's true."
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,770.181,780.47,"For purposes of the facial challenge, we have to assume the existence of... of a person who uses the most innocuous of... of those programmings."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,780.47,783.572,I don't... I... I don't... I don't think that that's correct.
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,794.78,804.702,"I thought that's... I thought that's what a facial challenge was, that if... if you could show that this would be unconstitutional as to anybody, you can... you can plead that person's defense."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,825.615,841.541,"--It involves... well, the FCC took that... that definition and said that one is a subset of two, and it defined them both in the same way that... the same definition that it has used in the regulation of dial-a-porn on... on telephone lines which has been upheld now in the lower court."
1999.98-1682,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,841.541,842.491,It may be a subset.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,842.491,843.16,It's a subset.
1999.98-1682,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,843.16,844.977,Is it still that we're dealing with one?
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,844.977,847.779,I... I don't think that there's any determination of which we're dealing with.
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,858.92,862.955,"And so for purposes of the facial challenge, we must assume anybody--"
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,862.955,863.239,Right.
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,863.239,865.241,--who does anything which is indecent.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,865.241,868.443,"You know, I... maybe you can assume that."
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,869.126,869.559,We must--
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,869.559,875.347,It has to be a channel... it only applies to channels that are primarily devoted to... to that kind of programming.
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,875.347,876.897,"--Well, to indecent programming."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,876.897,877.582,Right.
1999.98-1682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,888.939,891.039,We have to deposit in our minds a dirty word channel.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,891.606,892.324,"No, but I don't think so."
1999.98-1682,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,894.658,903.999,"Well, if... if the... if the sentence actually is broken down, in providing sexually explicit adult programming or other programming that is indecent."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,916.307,916.873,--Well--
1999.98-1682,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,916.873,921.425,There's no reason why you should try to resolve all these nuances.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,921.425,922.344,"--Well, I probably prefer not to."
1999.98-1682,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.134,961.169,"Mr. Feldman, can I ask you one question about Pacifica?"
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,971.707,973.526,They don't... they don't specifically describe it.
1999.98-1682,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.526,977.611,--They don't tell us what... what words are heard over the... this--
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,977.611,978.13,"No, they don't."
1999.98-1682,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,980.43,981.415,--But that's a big part of your argument.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,983.951,987.903,"--Well, you know, I would prefer if the district court had, but the tapes are in the record."
1999.98-1682,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,996.942,1003.413,"Well, you see an awful lot of strong language on... on WGN or whatever the best channels are."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1006.731,1007.482,I think you might be--
1999.98-1682,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.482,1008.199,--if strong language is enough.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1008.199,1018.005,"--Well, if... if... again, the... the record is full of tapes of... for instance, there were tapes of material that was broadcast on... on Spice and on Playboy on certain, specific, randomly selected days."
1999.98-1682,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1018.005,1022.826,"So, we should have to make our own findings about what the aural content is by ourselves looking at these tapes."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1022.826,1023.159,It's--
1999.98-1682,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.159,1024.291,I'm not particularly anxious to do that.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1024.291,1024.709,--Right.
1999.98-1682,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1042.054,1042.74,Mr. Feldman--
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1047.275,1050.226,It's actually much... it's the same... some of it is the same language.
1999.98-1682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1057.499,1065.786,But what of the argument that unlike Pacifica where there was no opportunity for the parent who just switched on the signal to control it?
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1077.561,1078.163,Right.
1999.98-1682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1116.152,1119.906,The idea that the Government is a kind of a super parent.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1138.367,1143.271,--There are some analogies to the situation to... to a law like that about violence.
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1172.005,1173.04,"Well, why... why should it, though?"
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1193.288,1196.656,--It's... I think it's more complex than just to say a parent who says it.
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1213.082,1213.951,"Yes, but on the district court's--"
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1213.951,1214.884,And they find their children--
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1214.884,1232.663,"--But the district court's proposal is that the parents will be advised in... in connection with, I guess it's section 504, that in fact this kind of bleed goes on and in fact they... they can block it absolutely--"
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1232.663,1233.146,--Right.
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1233.146,1235.031,--if they want to call for a blocking device.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1259.83,1269.769,"Well, I think that actually gets to the other half of the argument, and it's the... the reason why Congress acted is because a scheme like the district court envisioned can't work and it can't work for three reasons."
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1281.827,1282.496,I don't understand.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1282.496,1283.329,"--Well, let me explain why."
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1296.153,1300.307,The Government presumably can tell them to give the notice and tell them what notice to give.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1300.307,1300.657,It has to be... right.
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1315.15,1315.55,I just don't understand that.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1328.741,1334.361,"Well, I think you have to sketch out exactly what would be said and how it could be said in such a way to counteract the two things I just mentioned."
1999.98-1682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1345.586,1347.454,"Well, but the broadcasters accept that."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1355.81,1359.929,I'm not sure that... that the channel here is or the other channels are willing to do it.
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1361.429,1363.864,They're certainly willing for purposes of this case.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1363.864,1369.535,"--Well, because they... it hasn't been spelled out for them exactly what kind of a notice is required and what would... what effective--"
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1369.535,1374.188,"Well, but we're talking now about the... about the expense and... and the effect of the expense."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1383.711,1394.102,--I... I would suggest that they've calculated something different which is that the minimum amount that they could do that was consistent with the vague guidelines that the district court gave would be something that they could do that wouldn't have much effect on that.
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1394.102,1395.702,"Well, let's... let's assume they've made their mistake."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1397.404,1399.687,"Well, I think--"
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1399.687,1407.327,"In other words, why... why... if they've made a mistake in calculation, why should we decide this case on the basis of saving them from that mistake?"
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1407.327,1410.112,"--Well, because I don't really... I guess I don't really think they've made the calculation."
1999.98-1682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1414.765,1416.265,"Well, let... let's assume--"
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1416.265,1416.915,We'll explain to you what we'll do.
1999.98-1682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1429.858,1435.346,"--Well, for purposes of developing the... let's just assume that in the district court, they said, we're not concerned about the cost."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1451.689,1465.531,"Well, I think it's not an... I guess I don't think it's an odd argument to make when it's in the context of... of a case where they're trying to get out from under a statute and where they're not genuinely faced with a particular regulatory program."
1999.98-1682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1488.761,1492.879,"Well, but your guessing and... and the burden is on... is on you to sustain the legislation."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1492.879,1509.924,"--Right, and I... I think... you know, I think that that partly goes back to Congress having looked at the situation and said there are so many reasons why a system like section 504 can't work, starting with the fact that these are parents who have already decided they don't want these channels, and only then they find that they're getting them anyway."
1999.98-1682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1509.924,1513.042,"Well, even as to that, I think it may be a cost consideration."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1517.644,1518.863,For some it may be.
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1566.677,1569.646,"Mr. Feldman, you spoke of what Congress had contemplated."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1577.901,1578.784,That's correct.
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1620.145,1627.315,"Well, I suppose if that happened and then they started complaining, the answer would be, you asked for it, you got it."
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1627.315,1636.588,"Well, that might be the answer, but I think they would be in here with the same kind of argument they're making now, which is this is... this is... this violates the First Amendment because it's content-based, which it would be--"
1999.98-1682,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1636.588,1638.757,You'd have a different argument from the one you're making now.
1999.98-1682,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1638.757,1646.046,"--Well, they would be saying this is content-based, which it would be, and it violates the First Amendment because it's leading these cable operators to completely drop our programming."
1999.98-1682,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1660.988,1662.055,"Very well, Mr. Feldman."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,1669.411,1679.017,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1704.834,1707.953,Did the district court find that this was protected speech?
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,1707.953,1709.036,"Yes, it did."
1999.98-1682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1709.036,1713.505,I don't... I didn't discover that in... in the findings of fact by the district court.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,1713.505,1720.177,"Well, I don't know you'd find that in... in the findings of fact other than in the conclusions of law that indecency is protected by the First Amendment."
1999.98-1682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1720.177,1725.296,Where did it find that what is involved here is only indecency and not pornography?
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,1725.296,1740.258,"There wasn't a specific finding on whether or not we are dealing with obscenity here, but perhaps the confusion that arises from that point comes with the emphasis the Government has placed on certain exhibits that give an atypical view of... of really what's out there."
1999.98-1682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.66,1778.031,"Well, what... this applies only to channels that are exclusively devoted to sexually explicit programming."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,1778.55,1779.583,That's not quite correct.
1999.98-1682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1788.071,1792.29,"--Okay, primarily dedicated to sexually oriented programming."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,1839.171,1843.056,I would... I would describe Playboy Television as one of those channels.
1999.98-1682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1868.523,1871.992,Do you... was this case presented just as a facial challenge?
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,1871.992,1883.133,"Yes, it was, and as a result, on the face of the statute, it applies in a much more broad way, not to anything approaching obscenity, but to channels that are primarily dedicated to sexually oriented--"
1999.98-1682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1883.133,1884.417,If there exist any such channels.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,1896.627,1897.627,--And I don't--
1999.98-1682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.627,1909.284,"And... and unless there are some findings that, indeed, there are channels that... that just engage in... in innocuous indecency, I... I'm not prepared to say the whole statute is bad."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,1909.284,1913.652,"--Well, and that was actually the underlying premise of the district court's decision."
1999.98-1682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1938.954,1942.989,"There's some of that, but is... is there nothing beyond that?"
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,1942.989,1943.94,"--Well, yes, there is."
1999.98-1682,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1963.819,1971.608,May I... may I ask for a clarification on what the overall statutory and regulatory scheme entails?
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,1984.199,1987.767,I'm not aware of a specific statute that touches on basic cable channels.
1999.98-1682,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1987.767,1988.469,Or regulations?
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2000.194,2013.252,"The tradition is... is that they do not, although again I don't know of a regulation that touches on that, except for the regulation that this... this Court addressed in the Denver Area case which dealt with leased access channels which are not subscription channels."
1999.98-1682,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2041.354,2051.293,"Isn't that what the case is about, the less... I mean, can I get over the first problems by simply assuming... is this a fair assumption?"
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2112.7,2121.473,"--Well, in fact, we do argue that the statute applies to any channel that is primarily dedicated to sexually oriented programming, whatever channels those may be."
1999.98-1682,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2121.473,2135.114,"And that must be adult explicit material, and as far as I know, there is no channel that wouldn't fit within the definition as I described it, though you could argue about whether or not it is patently offensive."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2138.583,2146.772,"Well, one of the interesting things about this case is that we did ask the Government for an ability to try and distinguish between that which is sexually--"

1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2167.335,2170.304,"--Yes, and that was the heart of the district court decision."
1999.98-1682,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2170.304,2191.2,"Mr. Corn-Revere, on page 42a of the appendix where the court is giving its opinion in this case, it says, plaintiffs conceded that their programming is essentially 100 percent sexually oriented in contrast to the other entertainment channels that display only occasional or sporadically... sporadic sexually explicit scenes or programs."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2207.162,2216.685,"Well, we acknowledged before the district court that Playboy is primarily dedicated to sexually oriented programming, but disagreed on whether or not we crossed the line into indecency in many cases."
1999.98-1682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2286.531,2291.566,Can we talk about the Government's arguments with reference to 504?
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2313.931,2316.566,"Well, Justice Kennedy, that's why we would agree--"
1999.98-1682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2316.566,2326.255,"And... and I'd like to talk about that a little, and you... and perhaps you should tell me if you think that's something that I can just assume or if I need findings of fact on that."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2336.044,2336.361,--No.
1999.98-1682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2352.155,2362.645,"You... you think we can't know that there are... are parents who are so busy working and making a living that they don't have adequate time to supervise their children, they don't care about this sort of thing?"
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2364.897,2365.48,--Well--
1999.98-1682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2365.48,2366.547,Can't I make that assumption?
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2368.815,2378.556,"--I think when it comes to making a decision that's going to restrict a significant amount of speech that is protected by the Constitution, that something more would be required than simply an assumption."
1999.98-1682,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2409.792,2425.87,"Well, tell me whether you think the Government... the Congress could prohibit broadcasting on ordinary channels patently offensive sexual material during early evening hours."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2427.17,2428.453,--I think it would require--
1999.98-1682,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2428.453,2433.441,--without violating the First Amendment in order to protect children?
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2433.441,2440.361,--I... I think that would require an analysis of whether or not less restrictive measures than a ban would also touch on that problem.
1999.98-1682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2460.591,2489.694,"What do you say to the argument that's made here that on the assumption that there are indifferent parents, the district court was really being utopian in thinking that on... on the section 504 modification it proposed, that effective notice could be given to parents that would get their attention and explain to them that bleed was possible and make it clear to them that they really did have an option to... to block it entirely?"
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2502.87,2509.874,"Well, my response, Justice Souter, is that we at least ought to try that first before we decide that we're going to restrict a significant amount of protected speech."
1999.98-1682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2509.874,2513.576,"Well, don't we want to know more than... that the fact that we might try it?"
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2540.912,2553.07,"Well, I think it's no more utopian than this Court was being in Denver Area where it listed other alternative measures that would have been less restrictive, including a possible coding requirement or blocking available by a phone call, which is what we have with section 504."
1999.98-1682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2553.07,2556.755,But I don't think we're really getting to the... what I intend to be the heart of the question.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2570.23,2570.982,"Well, yes, I do."
1999.98-1682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2580.038,2582.12,What would such a notice consist of?
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2586.274,2591.428,"--It can take various forms and, in fact, has in practice."
1999.98-1682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2600.034,2603.736,And what would... let's assume it were a written notice that went with the bills.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2604.802,2616.627,"--It would say that there is a phenomenon known as signal bleed, that... that many households may find offensive that may contain sexually explicit or sexually oriented programming and that you have a right to block it."
1999.98-1682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2628.867,2640.742,"Now, of course, your... your argument in... in your brief to the effect that it would not be disastrously expensive is that there would not be that much response to it, not that many people would want to block."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2656.454,2667.928,The inference that the Government makes that that demonstrates the ineffectiveness of notice provision simply underscores the Government's failure to demonstrate the pervasiveness and difficulty of solving signal bleed.
1999.98-1682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2667.928,2669.828,"So, you're saying it's a burden of proof issue."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2669.828,2684.271,"Well, it's partly a burden of proof issue, and that's how the district court viewed it when they suggested that if there is a low rate of lockbox distribution, that that is as indicative of the fact that the Government never demonstrated the pervasiveness of the issue in the first place."
1999.98-1682,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2718.694,2721.146,"When you say on the market, you mean for sale?"
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2721.146,2722.179,--That's right.
1999.98-1682,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2722.179,2725.098,Rather than what's actually out there in the homes.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2725.098,2739.691,"Well, I... I can't tell you, based on the record, how many televisions are currently in homes that have channel locking features, but we do know that 80 percent of those on the market have them and that approximately 20 to 30 million televisions are sold every year."
1999.98-1682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2739.691,2759.319,The Government's figures as to the number of houses in which presumably signal bleed occurs and the number of children in those houses... should we assume that the figure of the number of children did not reflect anything one way or the other about the availability of these other blocking devices that you're... you're considering?
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2759.319,2760.371,"That's right, and that's one--"
1999.98-1682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2760.371,2762.973,"So, that's... that's the maximum possible figure."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2762.973,2766.842,--The maximum possible without respect to these other measures that others might use.
1999.98-1682,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2766.842,2768.627,May I ask you a factual question?
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2789.373,2797.527,"No, it doesn't, and that's one of the curious things about the record because that's one of the issues that the district court asked the Government to demonstrate more fully at the permanent injunction stage."
1999.98-1682,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2797.527,2799.496,"Well, there were lots of tapes put in."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2799.496,2800.613,There were a number of tapes.
1999.98-1682,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2805.233,2811.871,"I asked about 1, 2, and 44 because those are graphic, particularly 1 and 44."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2811.871,2813.406,Let me address those.
1999.98-1682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.406,2820.827,"Before you get off that question, I... is the thesis that little kids aren't going to watch this unless it's really good reception?"
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2822.761,2825.046,I think given the range of other media that are available--
1999.98-1682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2825.046,2827.998,I don't see how it makes very much difference how clear the picture coming through is.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2830.115,2830.584,--I think--
1999.98-1682,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2830.584,2835.152,"Well, it seems to me if you can't understand what's going on because the thing is so clouded, it's not all that dangerous."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2839.64,2844.425,"--Well, not... not if you look at the Government's tapes, particularly tape number 2 which... which Justice Ginsburg alluded to."
1999.98-1682,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2844.425,2845.294,You don't see much of anything.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2845.294,2849.762,Tape number 2 was actually a compilation tape made by a Department of Justice attorney.
1999.98-1682,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2877.063,2880.265,Are you talking about video rather than audio?

1999.98-1682,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2912.486,2916.973,The basic difference between the broad and the tailored is not broad versus tailored.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,2988.237,2988.703,--That's--
1999.98-1682,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2988.703,3002.395,"And... and don't force them to opt in... rather opt out, or we get into the repairman problem, plus the fact we don't know, plus the fact my kid is at somebody else's house, and I trust my neighbors, but they're not so activist as me."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3010.983,3025.457,"--Notwithstanding those practical difficulties, every one of the examples that the Government was able to provide... and it really was only a few anecdotal examples... where signal bleed occurred, the individuals were able to get blocking from the cable operator upon request."
1999.98-1682,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3057.512,3062.749,"Well, in addition to making the call, does something have to be done to the television set?"
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3062.749,3067.736,"--Well, it would depend on the method that the cable operator uses to address the issue."
1999.98-1682,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3067.736,3072.622,But in many cases it would require someone to come and do something to the television set.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3072.622,3080.21,We disagree that it would necessarily require a service call since someone is calling in to ask for a trap that can be attached to the television set.
1999.98-1682,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3088.549,3095.387,"What does Playboy do if somebody calls up and says, I want... I'm getting this on channel 2, you know, the educational channel?"
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3102.407,3107.195,"--Just as a point of clarification, it's not Playboy that responds to those calls."
1999.98-1682,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3107.195,3107.628,No.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3109.294,3111.913,And... and also signal bleed doesn't intrude on other channels.
1999.98-1682,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3115.032,3115.415,You're clients.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3125.021,3127.69,The normal practice has been to do that.
1999.98-1682,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3127.69,3128.957,To send someone to the house.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3128.957,3129.607,That's right.
1999.98-1682,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3146.003,3151.907,"Is... is it the case that if more than 3 percent wanted to do it, then it wouldn't be economical at all and you'd prefer this system?"
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3151.907,3154.942,"Well, we disagree with... with the Government's figures on that."
1999.98-1682,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3154.942,3155.409,All right.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3157.275,3165.048,"Well, based on the figures that we presented in our reply brief at the post-trial stage, we suggest that the breakeven point would be closer to 80 percent."
1999.98-1682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3172.57,3173.503,That's a pretty big spread.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3174.253,3175.236,That is a--
1999.98-1682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3175.236,3176.455,--get closer than that?
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3177.005,3181.34,--That... that's a very big spread because the Government overestimated the cost of the traps by three times.
1999.98-1682,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3215.496,3220.298,"--That was not a litigated issue, how much it would cost."
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3220.298,3222.064,It was litigated.
1999.98-1682,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3222.064,3223.031,It was litigated?
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3223.031,3224.616,"Yes, it was."
1999.98-1682,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3224.616,3229.904,I thought you were telling us that you have a... you and the Government are wide apart in how much it would cost.
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3229.904,3234.539,"We could never reach agreement on that point, but the figures are in the record--"
1999.98-1682,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3234.539,3236.908,Where is the finding of fact that you're talking about?
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3238.343,3249.817,"--The finding of fact by the district court was 6 percent, but that was expressly based on the assumption that you would require a service call and then didn't discuss the remaining factors that were addressed in the briefs."
1999.98-1682,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3255.535,3262.125,"Well, when you say the assumption that there would have to be a service call, was the district court making a finding that there would have to be a service call?"
1999.98-1682,1,40251,robert_corn_revere,,3262.125,3263.508,I don't know if you'd call it a finding.
