1988.87-548,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.772,"We'll hear argument first this afternoon in No. 87-548, Trans World Airlines v. Independent Federation of Flight Attendants."
1988.87-548,0,35934,murray_gartner,,13.122,16.49,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-548,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,984.279,995.068,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-548,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1073.837,1075.872,Is it waivable only by contract?
1988.87-548,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1075.872,1105.558,"I believe that the only circumstances that I know of, or that the employer may displace the crossovers if he agrees to do so by collective bargaining agreement, or alternatively... and this is of course not this case... if the strike was an unfair labor practice strike, in which case the unfair labor practice strikers have a right of reinstatement and a right to bump the crossovers or the new... and the new hires, notwithstanding the Mackay decision."
1988.87-548,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1447.445,1456.015,"xxx seniority, that had more seniority than they did."
1988.87-548,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1456.015,1457.134,That's correct.
1988.87-548,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1469.608,1473.06,But they didn't get hurt any more than they would have if there had been a big layoff?
1988.87-548,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1474.595,1479.714,"--That's true, but a layoff affects all persons and is a decision of the employer."
1988.87-548,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1491.438,1509.935,"But you have to get down to saying that you're entitled, with respect to the crossovers... you're entitled to treat them as, because they continued to work, as having, as being able to overcome their lack of seniority?"
1988.87-548,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1509.935,1516.755,"Well, no, we don't think that it operates in quite that way."
1988.87-548,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1517.222,1519.707,"Well, the employer kept them on."
1988.87-548,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1521.409,1524.778,"--That's correct, and we believe that that was their right under the statute."
1988.87-548,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1551.512,1563.486,"But they have to claim, in order to overcome the returning strikers' seniority, they have to use the same argument that the new hires use, I suppose?"
1988.87-548,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1570.24,1572.842,"No, I don't think so."
1988.87-548,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1581.865,1584.734,But they weren't... they weren't protected against people with more seniority.
1988.87-548,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1584.734,1597.457,"--I think the finding of the District Court, Justice White, is that the seniority rights in the contract did not apply to pre-strike reinstatement, and therefore had no bearing on this particular decision."
1988.87-548,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1598.743,1600.743,"Thank you, Mr. Robbins."
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,1602.195,1610.384,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1741.019,1745.071,Would you just... you say that's the holding of Florida East Coast?
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,1745.071,1746.34,"Well, I--"
1988.87-548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1746.34,1748.09,"You said ""held""."
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,1748.09,1750.625,--I'm sorry.
1988.87-548,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1834.147,1836.413,You mean like hiring replacements?
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,1836.413,1848.288,"Well, hiring permanent replacements is an exception to the statutory rule under 2 Fourth, as it is under the NLRA section 883."
1988.87-548,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1849.407,1850.84,Why is it?
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,1850.84,1869.452,"--Because when this Court, in Mackay, balanced the two conflicting rights, it deemed... and I would parenthetically note, indicted, in that case... it nevertheless deemed that the right of the employer to operate its business by hiring new hire replacements--"
1988.87-548,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1869.452,1876.14,"That's what really gives the new hires their position against the strikers... namely, the employer's right?"
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,1876.14,1878.926,"--At the conclusion of the strike, yes, Justice--"
1988.87-548,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1878.926,1882.878,And wouldn't that... why isn't that the same with respect to the crossovers?
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,1882.878,1887.948,--Because we have a different set of factual circumstances.
1988.87-548,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1887.948,1892.65,"Well, the point is the right, though, to run his business is still there."
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,1892.65,1895.686,I think the employer's right to run his business--
1988.87-548,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1895.686,1898.221,"Well, that justifies the new hires staying on."
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,1898.221,1910.696,"--But I think it has to be carefully balanced, against the expressed statutory right that employees have to be free from employer retaliation when it engages in one of the critical aspects of union--"
1988.87-548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1910.696,1912.648,But the Court balanced that in Mackay.
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,1912.648,1920.253,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and I have no quarrel with the balance at this point that this Court drew in Mackay."
1988.87-548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1927.073,1935.263,"Your opponent says that the people who were used as replacements in Mackay were actually employees of the company, not just people taken off the street."
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,1935.263,1942.417,"I disagree with that assessment, and I've looked at the facts as carefully as I can in Mackay."
1988.87-548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1985.446,1987.462,But they were employees of Mackay?
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,1987.462,1990.747,They were employees at other far reaching locations.
1988.87-548,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.747,1990.964,What about in Erie?
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,1994.032,1995.199,There were crossovers involved.
1988.87-548,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.199,1996.401,Weren't they allowed to keep their jobs?
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,1996.401,1997.417,"Yes, they were."
1988.87-548,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1998.684,1999.101,They were.
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,2008.625,2009.742,"--That's correct, Justice--"
1988.87-548,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.742,2011.744,And returning strikers couldn't boot them out.
1988.87-548,2,31066,john_p_hurley,,2011.744,2014.779,"--Well, that issue is not before the Court in Erie Resistor."
1988.87-548,3,35934,murray_gartner,,3356.34,3358.09,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-548,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3358.09,3366.961,Do you want to... could you... do you agree with the last statement that had there been no promise of permanent employment here--
1988.87-548,3,35934,murray_gartner,,3366.961,3367.495,No.
1988.87-548,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3392.763,3396.381,--But they didn't have as much seniority as some of the strikers.
1988.87-548,3,35934,murray_gartner,,3396.381,3397.631,But the seniority--
