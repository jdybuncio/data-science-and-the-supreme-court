1987.86-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.872,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 86-489, W. T. Langley versus Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation."
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,11.622,23.696,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this Court is called upon in this case first to resolve a question of statutory interpretation, what meaning do we give to 1823(e)."
1987.86-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,104.065,108.535,Why didn't the bank agree that those... that much land would be delivered?
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,108.535,110.821,"Well, first, the bank, of course--"
1987.86-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,110.821,111.454,"They did, didn't they?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,111.454,112.754,--wasn't the true seller of the property.
1987.86-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,112.754,114.189,"Well, I know, but they made the deal."
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,114.189,128.698,"If Your Honor will refer to the mortgage itself, which is in the Appendix at Page 29, you will see the fact that there were 1,628.4 acres in the mortgage tract."
1987.86-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.465,133.25,What do you want us to look at?
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,134.352,140.423,On Page 29 of the appendix is... that is one of the pages of the mortgage.
1987.86-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.077,154.231,And you say that some substantially lesser acreage was in fact conveyed?
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,154.231,154.764,"Yes, ma'am, I do."
1987.86-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,162.67,171.359,"In your complaint, did you seek to set aside the transaction or to simply counterclaim for the decreased value of the property?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,171.359,173.561,We counterclaimed.
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.312,216.071,"Mr. Shockey, it seems to me you are saying that a promise is an agreement, but a representation of present fact is not an agreement."
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,242.456,250.477,"Well, what the case boils down to at this point is the, and I will explain to you how it is different--"
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,250.477,254.096,"You argue that the promises are agreements, right?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,254.096,267.106,"--Promises that Mr. Caughfield as the president of the bank had the capacity to deliver, if you will, interest rate, term of loan, and things of those nature, okay, but Mr. Caughfield wasn't delivering the property."
1987.86-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,290.638,295.44,Why wasn't he promising that that customer would deliver so many acres?
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,295.44,297.292,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1987.86-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,298.625,304.712,"Why wasn't the officer, the bank officer promising that the bank's customer would deliver so many acres?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,304.712,308.664,We in fact contend that he was promising that there would be.
1987.86-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,314.234,320.638,Why wasn't that as much an agreement as anything else?
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,320.638,335.814,"Well, Your Honor, the representations as to how many acres there would be and how many mineral rights he would get were an ingredient, if you will, of the sale between Leenerts Farms, who was the other bank customer, and my clients."
1987.86-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,349.241,367.202,"Well, the promises that you now rely upon or the representations that you now rely upon were apparently made by the actual owner of the property who sold it to your client?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,367.202,367.768,No.
1987.86-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.504,377.074,"The owner of the property never said he had 1600 acres, or whatever it was?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,377.074,381.962,I believe it is alleged in our complaint that the Langleys met the seller at the closing.
1987.86-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,381.962,390.918,And the document at closing included this document that you called our attention to?
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,390.918,397.255,"The documents at closing included a sale agreement, a deed, possibly you may refer to at common law, which is included--"
1987.86-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,397.255,399.857,For that number of acres?
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,399.857,411.463,"--Right, and a separate document, a mortgage, which is the lien instrument under Louisiana law, which also contains the reference to the 1628.4 acres."
1987.86-489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,413.647,415.116,I must confess I am kind of puzzled.
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,419.418,423.203,"Well, the problem is, there was a representation--"
1987.86-489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,423.203,427.257,There was an oral statement earlier that there was more acreage.
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,427.791,428.774,"--No, there was less acreage."
1987.86-489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,433.578,434.745,Less than 1628?
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,434.745,438.899,"--Yes, I believe the exact figure is 1522, as alleged in the complaint."
1987.86-489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,438.899,443.851,Why do you have to rely on an oral statement about 1628?
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,445.219,446.103,"Well, I understand."
1987.86-489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,455.074,458.942,"Yes, but it surely cleared up any... I mean, it surely made it clear that that is the amount of acreage that they were talking about."
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,458.942,461.228,"Well, it surely makes it clear that that is what the Langleys thought they were buying."
1987.86-489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,462.461,466.18,"I don't understand, though, why he has to rely on an oral statement."
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,466.18,482.474,"Well, would love to rely on my mortgage, and if the Court would rely on my mortgage I would be very enthralled, but the point is, I don't think the mortgage itself fits the requirements under 1823(e)."
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.628,498.084,"Well, in the mortgage, I assume the representation as to the acreage is: a representation from your client to the bank rather than a representation from the bank to your client."
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,498.084,500.603,"Yes, and--"
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.603,501.236,Isn't that right?
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,510.142,514.113,"--The answer to your question is yes and no, and I will explain."
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.907,542.613,"And the mortgage, by the way, that also wouldn't be an agreement, either, the representation as to what the acreage is?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,542.613,560.657,"The representation contained in the mortgage, you know, that is a document prepared from, if you will, prepared from the same, the sale document."
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,572.615,584.44,"A mortgage is an agreement, certainly, but you would say that that portion of the mortgage consisting of the representation that there are so many acres in the land, that is not an agreement in and of itself?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,584.44,585.542,That is what I believe.
1987.86-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,586.059,595.648,Ordinarily a representation of a warranty or whatever you want to call it in a mortgage like that runs from the mortgagor to the mortgagee.
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,601.051,603.686,"Right, and of course, where did my client get the information?"
1987.86-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,605.788,610.324,"Well, what has happened to your lawsuit against the bank president and the bank?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,610.324,614.292,"The bank president, for your information, went into bankruptcy."
1987.86-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,619.78,621.382,And that is still pending.
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,621.382,622.332,That is still pending.
1987.86-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,622.332,627.036,Presumably your client could get some kind of adjustment on recovery in that lawsuit.
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,627.036,630.071,Assuming the gentleman is solvent.
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,640.776,646.513,"Mr. Shockey, tell me if I am mistaken about what you are saying."
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,695.096,697.548,That would be an agreement.
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.548,709.19,"So the only failure here is, what distinguishes an agreement from a nonagreement is spelling out the condition that exists anyway, whether you spell it out or not."
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,711.09,716.594,I believe that is the conclusion that we are left with.
1987.86-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,784.202,789.106,"Mr. Shockey, let me pursue this same inquiry from a slightly different direction."
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,811.387,813.437,Our defenses--
1987.86-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,813.437,823.529,Would they be... would they be things like warranties that normally would not be available against a holder in due course?
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,823.529,833.885,"--They would not be available against a holder in due course who was otherwise a legitimate holder in due course to accrue value, no default, et cetera."
1987.86-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,833.885,843.157,"And what we have here is a statute that automatically makes the FDIC a holder in due course in legal effect, don't we?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,843.157,848.026,"Except for two things, and let me respond to your question in two parts."
1987.86-489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.695,905.397,"Mr. Shockey, before you get into the legal argument, can I ask you a question about the facts?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,909.283,911.135,"--I believe so, Your Honor."
1987.86-489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,911.135,913.837,I can't seem to find it.
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,913.837,918.972,"No, sir, it is not in the appendix."
1987.86-489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,920.407,921.274,It is in the record.
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,921.274,922.374,"I do believe so, yes."
1987.86-489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.374,927.828,Does it contain the normal boilerplate that all prior representations are merged into the agreement or something like that?
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,927.828,931.465,"Frankly, I cannot recall the provisions of the instrument in that specificity."
1987.86-489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,931.465,932.932,I see.
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,932.932,937.017,"I would like to refer you, as I indicated, to the Sedima case."
1987.86-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,973.876,978.243,There still is a question of what does an agreement mean.
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,978.243,979.195,What is an agreement?
1987.86-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,980.045,982.497,You say it means a promise.
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,982.497,995.622,But it does not mean representations as to the quality of the thing that is the subject of another transaction between the borrower and another party.
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.622,1006.93,"More precisely, you say it means only express promises, because when you make a representation of a material fact, there is an implied promise that the deal is off if that fact isn't true."
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,1012.251,1017.237,I don't follow your point.
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.237,1025.324,"I sell you a car and I say the car has... I say, I warrant, this car has eight cylinders."
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,1052.578,1064.635,"But the difference between your analogy and our case is, you are talking about you selling to me, two parties to the transaction, and the party making the representation is the seller."
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.657,1083.863,"But you are claiming that that representation goes to, goes to the validity of the deal between your client and the bank."
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,1088.751,1089.134,Certainly.
1987.86-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1117.018,1125.588,"Are you trying now to show us that the word ""agreement"" in the statute doesn't mean what one would ordinarily think ""agreement"" would mean?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,1125.588,1129.826,"Well, I think it means what one would ordinarily think ""agreement"" means."
1987.86-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1129.826,1132.194,"Well, then, why do you have to go to the legislative history?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,1132.194,1136.063,Because I am sure the legislative history is going to be relied upon by my opponent.
1987.86-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1136.063,1137.13,Okay.
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,1147.537,1151.322,"Most of the legislative history is sparse on this Act, more so than on any that I can recall before."
1987.86-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1161.178,1176.771,"Isn't what you are trying to say, or perhaps you have already succeeded in saying it, is that there is a difference between an agreement as contained in the statute and a representation that is fraudulent that would be a basis for setting aside the transaction?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,1176.771,1188.245,"--That is what I am saying, because under, you know, at least under Louisiana law, and we have the Civil Code, but the idea of fraud is not that much different from what I learned in law school about the common law."
1987.86-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1206.123,1211.794,Would you have won if this had occurred in the Eleventh Circuit?
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,1211.794,1212.661,I think so.
1987.86-489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1232.357,1234.407,The FDIC knew the facts here?
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,1234.407,1235.642,"--Yes, sir."
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.021,1257.99,I don't understand your injecting fraud into the analysis all of a sudden.
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,1274.284,1277.886,"Well, that's true."
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1284.09,1289.694,"And you think that that prevents it, that would prevent it from being an agreement within the meaning of this statute?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,1289.694,1290.594,"--Yes, sir."
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1290.594,1294.348,"Well, then, why have you waived your rights on those other two?"
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,1304.054,1325.284,"Well, all of the Federal Circuit Courts have uniformly recognized that that sort of representation, if you will, the Gunter court went to the point of trying to distinguish between promissory fraud and fraud that did not involve a promise to deliver at some future point in time."
1987.86-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1353.303,1375.467,"Well, you would most like us to say, then, that any fraud, whether it is promissory fraud or fraud in a representation, which is not an express promise, any fraud can't constitute an agreement, and failing that you would fall back on the fact that at least an implied promise is not an agreement."
1987.86-489,0,46311,william_c_shockey,,1376.0,1377.335,I would love for this Court to so hold.
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1555.534,1581.434,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question in this case is whether Federal law permits petitioners to rely on unrecorded oral understanding to defeat their straightforward written obligation to repay to the FDIC more than $450,000 in borrowed money."
1987.86-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1642.842,1652.448,"Well, Mr. Taranto, you say it's fair, but do you really think Congress meant to totally repeal the doctrine of fraud and the inducement as applied to this kind of transaction?"
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1652.448,1670.675,"I think what Congress intended to do in Section 1823(e) was in effect to give by law the status of a holder in due course to the FDIC, and that status would, as Justice O'Connor suggested, preclude the assertion of personal defenses, including fraud in the inducement."
1987.86-489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1670.675,1678.063,"Fraud in the factum, so-called, survives holder in due course status."
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1678.063,1678.681,That's right.
1987.86-489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1678.681,1681.8,How do you distinguish that kind of fraud from fraud in the inducement?
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1681.8,1714.104,"Fraud in the factum, as I understand it, occurs when one person fraudulently induces somebody to sign a different document from the document that person thought they were signing, so it is akin to forgery or duress but it is different from what is alleged here, which I think is expressly in the complaint termed fraud in the inducement, that representations were made fraudulently that induced them to then sign the document that they had no difficulty reading or understanding."
1987.86-489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1714.104,1726.829,Are there any factual misrepresentations by a bank officer that could ever give the borrower a real defense under the statute in your view?
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1726.829,1739.804,There could be fraudulent... there could be fraud in the execution of an obligation assumed by the bank when it granted a loan.
1987.86-489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1773.143,1781.314,Would it make any difference that the FDIC in this instance did have actual knowledge before it took over the assets?
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1781.314,1786.284,We don't see how an actual knowledge requirement can be read into the statute.
1987.86-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.621,1853.595,"Mr. Taranto, can a fraudulent promise, a promise that the promisor has no intention of performing, can that constitute fraud in the inducement?"
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1853.595,1861.285,"I think it can constitute fraud in the inducement, but it would not be a permitted defense under 1823(e)."
1987.86-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1861.285,1878.06,"I understand, but my point is that even if we accept the interpretation of the word ""agreement"" that the petitioner would have us adopt, we would not have succeeded in establishing fraud in the inducement as a defense."
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1878.06,1879.412,That's right.
1987.86-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1926.125,1929.845,"Mr. Taranto, why aren't those policies equally implicated by fraud in the execution?"
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1929.845,1955.394,"The policies as we understand them are designed to allow people who make... who assume obligations, make a note in this case, to insist that any term that they think is relevant to the note be placed in writing."
1987.86-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1958.412,1977.826,"Well, I understand that, but from the point of view of the FDIC, does it really make any difference whether the facts as your opponent alleges here, or just changed a little bit, supposing the bank president wrote up an agreement with the different sized acreage and he showed it to him and says, this is what the deal is going to be, and then he went home and substituted a page without telling him, and what shows up in the files is what we've got."
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1982.98,1991.919,"--Well, we do think that the statute places some limitations on the FDIC's protections."
1987.86-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2001.708,2005.227,It seems ironic to say that the use of the actual knowledge doesn't matter.
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2012.666,2024.907,--We think the critical distinction is whether the borrower had an opportunity to place in writing conditions he relied on and failed to exercise that opportunity.
1987.86-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2034.746,2038.9,"He had the opportunity in the fraud in the execution case, too."
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2038.9,2049.755,"--But as I understand your fraud in the execution case, the borrower didn't have any opportunity to prevent the bank from doing what later turns out to be fraud, as in the Mio case."
1987.86-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.755,2054.493,"Mr. Taranto, don't you at some point have to come within the terms of the statute?"
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2060.246,2075.257,"We think that any basis of the bargain, any representations, whether they are factual or promissory, constitute warranties which in ordinary commercial law are agreements."
1987.86-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2114.715,2122.82,Wouldn't the fraud in the execution that Justice Stevens mentioned to you qualify as an agreement in those terms?
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2122.82,2129.391,"--If I understand that fraud in the execution example, that may well be a real defense in holder in due course doctrine."
1987.86-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.391,2136.061,"Well, I know, but the statute doesn't say anything about holder in due course."
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2150.988,2152.44,I am not sure--
1987.86-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.44,2155.292,It sounds to me like it is as much an agreement as--
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2155.292,2183.276,"--I am not sure that in that case the asset would be one that the petitioner can fairly be said to have obliged himself under, so that... however one fits the... that example into the language of the statute, there has never been any attempt by the FDIC to depart radically from the basic distinction in the holder in due course doctrine between the personal and the real defense."
1987.86-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2195.1,2205.724,"--One of the conditions to establish fraud in the execution, as I recall, is that the person asserting it not have had an opportunity to detect a fraud."
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2227.655,2232.542,That would certainly be one way of accommodating that exception.
1987.86-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.542,2234.125,I don't know if it's a way of accommodating.
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2235.811,2245.016,"As I understand, that is the essential rationale behind most, if not all of the real defenses, forgery, duress."
1987.86-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2245.016,2247.551,--I am just repeating what the Chief Justice asked you earlier.
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2252.003,2256.824,There is no evidence specifically in the legislative history--
1987.86-489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2256.824,2257.774,Or in the statute.
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2257.774,2277.752,"--or in the statute that Congress surveyed the whole range of questions that could arise when the FDIC seeks to enforce a note that it obtains from the bank, and I might add at this point that that is the primary reason why we think any argument about preemption of common law, if we were to get to that, cannot survive."
1987.86-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2350.367,2368.262,"When you talk about the integrity of banking statements and so forth, ordinarily that would not be thought to suggest that a statement of a bank showing a note payable for $300,000 was free of any defenses like fraud in the inducement."
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2379.886,2381.819,As against the bank?
1987.86-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2381.819,2382.838,Yes.
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2382.838,2390.908,"Yes, and as against the bank officers in this case a fraud defense not only could be asserted but has been asserted and remains alive in this case."
1987.86-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2390.908,2395.412,So I don't see where you get into the sense of integrity of the bank statements.
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2395.412,2424.248,I think what Justice Jackson had in mind when referring to the integrity of banking statements was the FDIC in its several roles as examiner of the institution and then as the insurer that steps in once a bank fails must be able to take those bank statements in effect at face value the way a holder in due course would take a note purchased in good faith at face value.
1987.86-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2424.248,2446.662,"But the inference from that observation would be that if the FDIC knows that there is no integrity to a bank statement, why should they win, if they know that this is a false statement?"
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2446.662,2455.6,I think there is a statutory answer and then a policy answer.
1987.86-489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2516.256,2524.678,"Mr. Taranto, the old common law rule under the D'Oench case, would that yield any different result possibly?"
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2524.678,2538.437,I think that there are situations in which the O'Dench rule would cover... that it would cover certain situations that in our view 1823(e) would not.
1987.86-489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2538.437,2539.621,What type of situation would--
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2539.621,2548.543,Principally it applies and has been consistently to apply to the FDIC acting in its capacity as receiver.
1987.86-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.046,2929.757,"--Do you think the result in D'Oench would have been different if the FDIC had known that the note was really not a note at all, it was a spurious note?"
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2929.757,2942.649,--We think D'Oench either expressly or all but expressly says that the result would not have been different because it says whether bank examiners were in fact deceived or not is simply irrelevant to the issue.
1987.86-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2986.694,2989.63,"Well, do you ordinarily speak of that sort of thing as preemption?"
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2989.63,2994.665,"Well, I think some of this Court's cases have spoken about it as preemption."
1987.86-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3125.15,3130.387,The bank is subject to the same fraud laws in most states as any other.
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3137.726,3155.188,"It certainly does, but in both common law and now for 40 years in federal law with respect to the FDIC for those who come in after a bank fails to be in a better position, whether they are a receiver or corporation."
1987.86-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3155.188,3163.96,"Since you never know whether a bank is going to fail, it just alters a very substantial part of ordinary common law governing fraud, doesn't it?"
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3163.96,3184.021,"Well, the considerations that an individual would ordinarily be expected to take into account should include the considerations about what will happen if the bank fails, just as somebody buying a security of some type from a corporation should take into account priority rules that may occur if the corporation goes into--"
1987.86-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3184.021,3188.842,It may be a desirable result but I don't think it is accurate to say that nothing would be changed if we did that.
1987.86-489,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3188.842,3205.704,"--The principal change, we think, would be exactly the one that Congress intended to encourage in 1823(e), which is to add an extra measure of encouragement for people when dealing with banks to place everything that they understand to be a basis of the bargain in writing."
1987.86-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3208.756,3211.358,"Thank you, Mr. Taranto."
1987.86-489,2,46311,william_c_shockey,,3213.808,3246.329,"When this bill that became this Act moved through the legislative process, it was amended on the House floor, as I recall, to change the word which was ""simultaneously"" in the original draft, talking about when this agreement must be placed in writing and all that sort of stuff, to the word ""contemporaneously""."
1987.86-489,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3312.306,3315.072,"Thank you, Mr. Shockey."
