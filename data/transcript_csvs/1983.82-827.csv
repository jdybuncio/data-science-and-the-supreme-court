1983.82-827,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.145,We'll hear arguments next in Minnesota against Murphy.
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,68.455,71.597,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,277.661,279.243,"Mr. Lynn, may I ask you a question right there?"
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,279.243,279.644,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,279.644,286.337,At that point in the development of events could she have lawfully told the police without first talking to the probationer?
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,286.337,290.06,"There is a problem there, Your Honor, unrelated to the facts here."
1983.82-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,299.026,300.408,For what purpose?
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,300.408,303.23,For the purpose of monitoring his probation.
1983.82-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,303.23,309.553,Was the Alpha House not under a restriction which would have prevented it from giving information to the police?
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,309.553,311.184,"It was, Your Honor, yes."
1983.82-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,311.184,316.267,It could give that information to her for the limited purpose of monitoring the treatment?
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,316.267,321.332,"And reporting to the judge who was, of course, monitoring this probation, yes."
1983.82-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,321.332,328.816,But you say there is at least a question as to whether before talking to the probationer she could have passed the information on to the police?
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,328.816,330.987,"There is a substantial question as to that, Your Honor, yes."
1983.82-827,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,330.987,338.974,"Mr. Lynn, these restrictions that you just referred to in responding to Justice Stevens, are those restrictions imposed by state law?"
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,338.974,340.654,"Imposed by both, Your Honor."
1983.82-827,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,364.409,368.152,What did... Did the Supreme Court of Minnesota pass on that question?
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,368.152,369.021,"They did not, Your Honor."
1983.82-827,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,370.363,371.825,So it is not before us either.
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,371.825,373.125,"I believe not, Your Honor."
1983.82-827,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,373.125,395.099,"Mr. Lynn, if when the probation officer questioned the Respondent he had refused to answer on grounds that his answer might incriminate him could Minnesota have revoked his probation for his refusal to answer?"
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,395.099,396.579,"I believe not, Your Honor."
1983.82-827,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,429.031,432.543,You would concede that in making your argument?
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,432.543,434.043,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.252,603.415,"Mr. Lynn, before you get into your argument, may I ask a sequel to the question Justice O'Connor asked?"
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,630.564,632.212,"Your Honor, I would make a distinction."
1983.82-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,641.639,655.648,"No, suppose it related to violations of law occurring during the period of parole, is it your submission that he could refuse to answer those questions and still the Constitution would protect him from revocation--"
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,655.648,659.362,"--That is my reading, Your Honor, of the decisions of this Court."
1983.82-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,660.223,663.105,"--Well, this Court has never addressed that question in a parole context."
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,663.105,664.655,"--That is exactly right, Your Honor."
1983.82-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,691.773,703.991,Is it the practice in Minnesota... You are relying on federal law rather... Is it the practice in Minnesota that the parole officers in effect have an understanding with the parolees they do not have to tell them things they do not want to tell them?
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,703.991,706.303,"I really do not know what the practice is, Your Honor."
1983.82-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,706.303,709.405,It seems to be very contrary to my understanding of the way this normally works.
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,709.405,719.851,All I can say is that in my experience as a state court prosecutor this issue very rarely ever comes up as to what transpired in the interview.
1983.82-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,719.851,723.722,And what the nature of the duty of the parolee to be candid with the parole officer is.
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,725.365,726.905,"Certainly yes it has, Your Honor."
1983.82-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,729.316,734.471,"Yes, be truthful but you say that does not mean you have to answer any questions if you do not want to answer them."
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,740.616,748.34,"I believe... Your Honor, I guess cannot answer for the State of Minnesota because I do not believe that that issue has been addressed in our courts either."
1983.82-827,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,769.564,776.377,"Well, are you qualifying your answer to my question then?"
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,776.377,779.011,"Only to the extent, Your Honor, that--"
1983.82-827,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,779.011,783.773,By saying you do not know if the probationer has a Fifth Amendment right?
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,783.773,790.008,"--I am saying, Your Honor, that the issue... Yes, I guess I am saying that."
1983.82-827,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,793.411,796.491,So you withdraw your concession.
1983.82-827,0,39806,robert_h_lynn,,796.491,798.843,In that limited circumstance.
1983.82-827,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,926.346,927.546,Mr. Lynn.
1983.82-827,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,927.546,928.307,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-827,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,928.307,939.234,Do I gather from your last couple sentences that it is your view that the Supreme Court of Minnesota thought this case was governed by our Miranda decision?
1983.82-827,2,39806,robert_h_lynn,,939.234,941.377,"Not precisely, Your Honor."
1983.82-827,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,961.9,986.746,I more or less read the Supreme Court of Minnesota's opinion as saying that a prophylactic requirement had been adopted in the Miranda case in the custodial interrogation arrest situation and they were going to fashion kind of another Miranda doctrine in the parolee or probationer-probation officer situation.
1983.82-827,2,39806,robert_h_lynn,,986.746,988.889,"I think that is precisely correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-827,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1013.165,1018.178,"Mr. Lynn, does the probation officer in Minnesota have the power to arrest?"
1983.82-827,2,39806,robert_h_lynn,,1018.178,1023.72,"The probation officer, Your Honor, has the same powers of arrest as a citizen."
1983.82-827,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1023.72,1028.453,Is the probation officer's office located where?
1983.82-827,2,39806,robert_h_lynn,,1028.453,1033.936,"It is located in the government center, Your Honor, which includes the courtrooms of the county--"
1983.82-827,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1033.936,1036.668,Is it in the court building or the police building?
1983.82-827,2,39806,robert_h_lynn,,1036.668,1038.37,"--It is in the court building, Your Honor."
1983.82-827,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1038.37,1044.604,Did you say that the probation officer has the same power of arrest as a citizen?
1983.82-827,2,39806,robert_h_lynn,,1044.604,1053.32,"Under our arrest statute, Your Honor, there are powers applied to a peace officer and then there are citizen powers."
1983.82-827,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1195.223,1196.343,Very well.
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1204.099,1213.324,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-827,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1278.068,1281.268,"Mr. Strauss, really are you fairly reading the Minnesota Supreme Court opinion?"
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1292.227,1301.234,"Well, the source of compulsion they seem to identify to the extent they identify one has something to do with the probation conditions."
1983.82-827,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.234,1306.246,"You may disagree with their conclusion, but they did not ignore the requirement is all I am suggesting."
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1306.246,1316.262,"Well, I think they were insufficiently precise about realizing that they had to find actual compulsion on the defendant to speak, but I think you are right, Justice Stevens, that--"
1983.82-827,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.262,1324.768,"Well, what if they construed the Minnesota probation condition to impose a legal obligation on the probationer to answer all questions?"
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1324.768,1327.249,"--Well, two answers to that."
1983.82-827,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1341.849,1344.05,"Yes, but it is not because of an absence of compulsion."
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1344.05,1345.452,"--Oh, that is right."
1983.82-827,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1349.155,1353.918,"Well, it seems to me that is what they are saying when they say he was under court order to respond truthfully to his agent's questioning."
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1363.834,1367.014,"--Well, the probation conditions are set out and the probation condition requires--"
1983.82-827,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1367.014,1374.661,"As you know a statute means what the state court tells it does, and I would assume state probation conditions mean what the state court tells us they mean."
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1374.661,1382.576,--I do not find in the Minnesota Supreme Court's opinion explicit instruction of those probation conditions to require the probationer to speak--
1983.82-827,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.576,1388.61,They apparently just thought it was rather obvious that a duty to respond truthfully included a duty to respond.
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1388.61,1395.886,"--Well, the probation conditions which after all are written in a fashion that is supposed to be understood by the probationer say he must be truthful."
1983.82-827,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1401.077,1412.585,Did it also say that if the probation officer sees fit she can take you back to the judge without any more than that?
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1412.585,1416.528,"Yes, she can take him back if she has reason to believe he is violating his probation."
1983.82-827,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1416.528,1417.007,And you do not consider that coercion?
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1417.007,1418.118,"Oh, certainly not."
1983.82-827,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1431.869,1444.345,You do not think a threat to have your probation... Suppose she said if you do not confess to me now I will have your probation revoked.
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1446.498,1448.119,"Oh, yes."
1983.82-827,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1450.87,1455.014,The only difference I submit between the two is she never used those words.
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1455.014,1456.494,"Well, she never said that to him."
1983.82-827,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1457.946,1459.306,But it was obvious was it not?
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1459.306,1460.858,"--Oh, I do not think it was obvious at all."
1983.82-827,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1473.287,1481.381,I was just hoping you would say there might be possibly a little bit of coercion.
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1481.381,1486.733,I think... The term the Minnesota Supreme Court used is pressure.
1983.82-827,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1526.448,1528.301,May I just ask this?
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1535.755,1540.39,"Our view obviously as a matter of federal constitutional law is that, yes, it could have been revoked."
1983.82-827,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1540.39,1541.359,It is different--
1983.82-827,3,21501,david_a_strauss,,1541.359,1543.682,"Yes, we disagree with the State on that point."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,1867.226,1873.741,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Courts:"
1983.82-827,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1895.676,1900.439,"Mr. Wernick, are you saying that the probation officer could have held him in contempt?"
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,1900.439,1908.015,--He was under a court order to respond truthfully to his probation officer in all matters.
1983.82-827,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1942.116,1944.058,Is that kind of an unsettled question--
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,1944.058,1972.617,It is an unsettled question and I am analogizing to Baxter v. Palmigiano where this Court said that if a prisoner asserts the privilege at a prison disciplinary hearing an adverse inference could be raised at the hearing and similarly perhaps if a probationer asserts the privilege to a probation officer the probation officer could draw an adverse inference and that along with some other fact could be used to revoke.
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1972.617,1981.202,--To add to my education where is this case that you can be held in contempt for not answering a probation officer?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,1981.202,1986.125,"I used the word ""contempt"", Your Honor, just because the Court has used the word historically--"
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1986.125,1987.597,Contempt means contempt.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,1989.297,2000.684,--It means... What I meant to say was that he could have had his probation revoked and the Minnesota Supreme Court so said for refusing to discuss matters with his probation officer.
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2000.684,2002.106,But it is not contempt.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2002.106,2003.706,It is not contempt.
1983.82-827,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2092.266,2107.494,"Are you suggesting, Mr. Wernick, that there is a constitutional right to keep the cat in the bag to use your words or is it a constitutional right not to be compelled or forced to let the cat out of the bag?"
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2107.494,2122.464,"The constitutional right is not to be compelled, but where the government leads you to believe that the cat is already out of the bag and, therefore, you make a disclosure the government has mislead you and has impaired your ability to assert the privilege."
1983.82-827,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.464,2125.416,What is your authority for that proposition?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2125.416,2129.039,That where the government has mislead as to the purpose?
1983.82-827,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2129.039,2132.772,"Well, the same thing was involved in Oregon v. Mathiason."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2134.274,2137.915,"No, the Court did not reach that point in Oregon v. Mathiason."
1983.82-827,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2153.075,2154.676,Whether or not Miranda applied.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2154.676,2156.278,Whether or not Miranda applied.
1983.82-827,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2157.427,2163.583,So what is your authority for the proposition that in this particular case they would be different then Mathiason?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2163.583,2165.904,"Well, this case is different from--"
1983.82-827,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2165.904,2167.944,What is your authority?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2167.944,2174.98,--The old authority I guess is the first case Bram v. United States or Shotwell Manufacturing.
1983.82-827,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2234.718,2238.641,Do you think it had something to do with the treatment problems that she was dealing with?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2238.641,2241.073,--Whether it did or not she is still--
1983.82-827,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2241.073,2242.705,"Well, let's answer it."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2242.705,2245.516,"--Yes, it did have something to do with treatment."
1983.82-827,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2245.516,2247.126,So she had a right to ask him that question.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2247.126,2259.425,"No question, Your Honor, she had a right to ask the question, but she has to ask the question in a way that is consistent with the privilege against compelled self-incrimination and she already knew that she was going to go to the police."
1983.82-827,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2263.757,2276.936,"What reaction do you think there should be to his reference, Murphy's reference, to the fact that she thought he might want to talk to lawyer?"
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2276.936,2280.869,I think she would have to allow him to call the lawyer.
1983.82-827,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2280.869,2285.621,"Well, that indicated he was aware of the problem."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2285.621,2288.442,I believe he was aware that there was a problem.
1983.82-827,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2312.319,2320.274,"Mr. Wernick, I do not read the Supreme Court of Minnesota's opinion as relying on implied representations by the probation officer."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2320.274,2321.295,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-827,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2360.352,2365.383,But that is asking us to make a factual finding that the Supreme Court of Minnesota did not find.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2365.383,2370.726,"Well, it is really a legal conclusion, Your Honor, I believe because the facts are in the Supreme Court opinion."
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2528.851,2544.639,Can I ask you if the probation officer calls in a person on probation and says I hear you have been out drinking in bars and you know that you are not supposed to do that.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2565.055,2569.706,"--I would say... Well, the Court raises a very difficult question there because--"
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.706,2571.068,"Well, what is your view of it?"
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2571.068,2574.258,--My view is that it probably cannot but--
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.258,2575.49,It cannot you say.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2575.49,2577.26,--Not just for refusing--
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2577.26,2598.455,"Well, then suppose the probation officer says if you refuse to answer, of course, your probation will be revoked and the fellow says well I will answer yes I have but he says you have compelled me to answer so you may not revoke my probation or use this against me."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2601.487,2602.389,--I think that they--
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.389,2605.17,For the purpose of revoking probation?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2605.17,2606.252,--Yes.
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2606.252,2607.981,So that is not compulsion.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2609.393,2612.604,"That would be... In a sense yes, that would be compelled--"
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2612.604,2613.054,Yes what?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2613.054,2616.186,--Yes it was compelled but yes it is--
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2616.186,2618.738,But it is not barred by the Fifth Amendment.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2621.569,2631.917,"--That is because, Your Honor, the values underlying the self-incrimination clause go to protect the adversary nature of the criminal justice system."
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.57,2646.397,"Well, in this case I guess you not contend that there was any physical or mental coercion in this case."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2652.841,2653.361,Yes.
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2653.361,2660.275,I take it that those statements could be used against him for the purposes of revoking probation.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2660.275,2664.889,I would say in this case they could not be used against him for the purposes of revoking probation--
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.889,2665.38,Why not?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2665.38,2669.421,--Because she told him he could not call a lawyer and any amount--
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2669.421,2676.367,"Well, I know but that all flows from... You say it is not a Miranda case at all."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2676.367,2686.522,"--Well, when a government official who has power to compel an answer to a question tell individual that they cannot call a lawyer--"
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.522,2691.096,So this is a counsel case not a Fifth Amendment case?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2691.096,2695.848,--Counsel is related to the Fifth Amendment as this Court has said in Maness v. Meyers.
1983.82-827,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2702.343,2711.329,"Mr. Wernick, is there not another factor that you may not have thought about but as a matter of Minnesota law is a parole revocation a criminal proceeding or is it not?"
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2711.329,2712.55,I think--
1983.82-827,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2712.55,2716.752,Because if it is not a criminal proceeding the Fifth Amendment by its terms does not apply.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2716.752,2718.034,--It is a--
1983.82-827,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.034,2721.955,Would not apply that is to use for parole revocation purposes.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2721.955,2727.14,--It is not an adversary proceeding such as a criminal trial.
1983.82-827,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2730.292,2732.052,"I understand that, but it is a criminal proceeding?"
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2742.889,2757.799,"Your Honor, you are setting up categories for me which I am not sure how to describe the ultimate label of whether a revocation proceeding is a criminal proceeding or perhaps the best word to use is a ""quasi"" criminal proceeding."
1983.82-827,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.799,2761.662,"Well the Constitution does not use the word ""quasi""."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2762.874,2766.136,"Well, perhaps then it is best said that--"
1983.82-827,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2766.136,2781.206,But the point that you have to keep in mind is that the use that might be made of his answer what might be one thing in a subsequent trial and might be something else in a parole revocation hearing if that is not a criminal proceeding.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2781.206,2782.175,--I fully agree with the Court.
1983.82-827,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2826.564,2827.726,"Well, what difference does it make?"
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2842.954,2861.887,"--Well, Your Honor, the Court raises good points and I guess my position is that once she cuts off his total ability to assert the privilege by saying he cannot call a lawyer that if he comes so involuntary at that point that it should not be used for any purpose whatsoever."
1983.82-827,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2861.887,2873.826,I got the impression earlier you had more or less conceded that in light of Murphy's remarks about a lawyer that he did not need a warning.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2878.44,2911.789,My position is that after he said I feel like calling a lawyer and was told that he could not because he had to talk about treatment that the probation officer completely confused Murphy as to what was going on in that conversation so at that point to the extent he might have been worried about a criminal prosecution before he talked once the probation officer told him no you cannot call a lawyer because this is about treatment then at that point he was confused and he thought he was talking about--
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2911.789,2917.493,"Well, you do not usually have lawyers at probation talks with prisoners do you?"
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2917.493,2920.035,"--No, you do not."
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2920.035,2923.537,I do not understand the importance about a lawyer there.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2923.537,2924.549,The importance--
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2924.549,2928.791,Asking for a lawyer at the probation talk.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2928.791,2931.611,--The importance of a lawyer is this.
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2941.289,2942.611,And should have a lawyer?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2942.611,2945.674,"Well, he felt like he needed on and he certainly did."
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2945.674,2954.419,"Well, I am asking what constitutional provision requires him to have a lawyer at a talk with a probation officer?"
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2954.419,2965.978,The Fifth Amendment says that the privilege against self-incrimination can be asserted... the amendment as this Court has interpreted that the privilege can be asserted in any language.
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2969.39,2973.552,"Well, do you have a Fifth Amendment if a man stops you in the street?"
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2976.914,2978.234,--But this was court.
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2979.897,2981.246,It was not a court.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2981.246,2981.957,He was under--
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2981.957,2984.759,This was in the probation officer's office.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2984.759,2985.41,--Your Honor--
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2985.41,2987.531,That is not a court.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2987.531,2990.022,--But this Court has said--
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2990.022,2991.765,Is that not a court?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2992.934,2993.645,--It is not a courtroom.
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2995.458,2996.387,Is it a court?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2996.387,2999.051,It is not a court room.
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2999.051,2999.769,It is not a court.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,2999.769,3000.13,All right.
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3000.821,3001.68,All right.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3001.68,3003.773,By court I mean court room because--
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3003.773,3008.374,If it is not a court where do you get the right to a lawyer?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3008.374,3022.105,--He was under compulsion to speak via the court order and when he said I feel like calling a lawyer I am not saying that the probation officer had to go appoint him a lawyer at that time.
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3031.901,3035.814,Why did he not ask may I go and see a lawyer?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3035.814,3040.906,--Murphy's testimony was that he said I feel like I should have a lawyer present.
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3040.906,3043.166,Did he ask for a lawyer?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3043.166,3045.309,"Well, he said I feel--"
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3045.309,3047.14,He said I feel like a lawyer.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3047.14,3047.891,--Or--
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3047.891,3049.751,I feel like I am King Midas.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3051.942,3057.387,"--Your Honor, take a look at the probation officer's response and then work backwards."
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3060.688,3063.251,I would rather... I usually read forward.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3063.251,3071.076,"--Well, the probation officer said to him you will have to deal with a lawyer outside the office."
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3072.037,3074.528,Did he not eventually do it?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3074.528,3075.448,--My point is that--
1983.82-827,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3075.448,3077.14,Did he not eventually do it?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3077.14,3078.41,--Yes he did.
1983.82-827,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3095.142,3104.997,I would like to know if the probation officer said all right I will get you the lawyer and he got you and you came into the room and he said to you do I have to answer this question.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3105.979,3107.12,Absolutely not.
1983.82-827,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.12,3109.932,No obligation to answer the question?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3109.932,3118.167,"No because the probation officer has the power to compel Murphy to talk about it, but like any other compulsory process of the court or probation officer--"
1983.82-827,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.167,3123.77,Would you have given the same answer if the question had pertained to an alleged criminal act after the beginning of the probationary period?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3123.77,3124.561,--Yes.
1983.82-827,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.925,3141.091,But what if he then said well I want the information solely for the purpose and I represent to you it will be used only for that purpose of determining whether or not to revoke your probation.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3144.253,3164.086,"I would say he would not have a duty to answer that question, but that the probation officer at that point under the authority of Baxter v. Palmigiano and the Court has not decided this issue in the context of probation but that the probation officer could at that point probably make an adverse inference."
1983.82-827,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3169.999,3176.865,"Well, if that is true then he might as well answer if the consequence is going to be parole revocation if that is the maximum consequence."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3176.865,3180.748,That is true if he has been assured that what he says is not going to be used against him at a criminal trial.
1983.82-827,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3180.748,3192.907,"Well, if the rule of the employee discharge cases applies it follows automatically that the testimony would be immunized from use at a criminal prosecution but not from use for discharge purposes."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3192.907,3193.898,I agree.
1983.82-827,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3206.364,3221.373,"Well, as a practical matter when a person asserts the privilege really the only option that the person sitting there or a court is to draw an adverse inference if they refuse to testify."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3233.823,3237.994,"Yes, I am not sure I follow the Court's point, though, on that."
1983.82-827,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3248.001,3261.96,"I thought you were suggesting in your response to Justice Stevens that there was something peculiar about the fact that the remedy would have been to draw an adverse inference, and really I think that is what the remedy is in most cases."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3261.96,3268.775,"Yes, except in a criminal trial where the Fifth Amendment prohibits the finder of fact from drawing an adverse inference."
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3357.233,3362.787,You still have to show some compulsion.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3362.787,3363.928,--Yes.
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3363.928,3372.533,Your compulsion in this case was just asking the questions along with refusing him a lawyer?
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3372.533,3391.494,"Asking the questions pursuant to a court order, refusing the lawyer, telling him that this is just about treatment and I would add, Your Honor, that another significant fact in that regard is that at the time Murphy talked about this he was already in violation of his probation for having failed--"
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3391.494,3410.367,I take it then consistent with your answers to me before and to Justice Stevens if the probation officer says to him I just want to check up on your treatment now have you been taking your treatment as you were supposed to do and the gentleman says I refuse to answer.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3435.365,3437.646,--I do not believe that answering--
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3437.646,3439.226,Just for the refusal.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3452.916,3462.441,--In that hypothetical the judge may be able to revoke probation on that ground because it is not a crime to refuse to go to treatment.
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3462.441,3468.695,I know but we are talking about compulsion and an answer being used to revoke probation.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3468.695,3478.332,But you can only assert... When you are under court order to talk you can only assert the privilege as to those matters which would implicate you in a criminal prosecution.
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3480.352,3488.129,"Well, you told me a while ago that you could not revoke the probation if he asked him have you been drinking at bars."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3488.129,3488.948,--I was going to... The reason that--
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3488.948,3493.872,You said no you could not revoke probation if he then said it is none of your business.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3493.872,3502.247,"--The issue there would be, Your Honor, whether you can assert the privilege when you are being asked about something which is not a crime but yet is a violation of your probation."
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3502.998,3505.85,That is the drinking one and that is the treatment one.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3505.85,3509.431,"--Well, no because she is asking him tell me about this murder."
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3509.431,3510.192,"No, no."
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3522.03,3529.547,If the Fifth Amendment only protects against further criminal prosecutions then the answer to your question is he could be revoked because--
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3529.547,3530.346,And similarly about drinking at bars.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3530.346,3535.92,--Similarly about drinking at bars but differently about being asked if he has committed other crimes.
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3535.92,3541.506,Then in neither case I would think would there be compulsion.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3541.506,3546.409,In both cases there may be some compulsion but--
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3546.409,3547.2,"Well, there must--"
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3547.2,3548.539,--The government--
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3548.539,3549.37,--You have to say there is enough--
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3549.37,3550.562,"--Your Honor, the government compel--"
1983.82-827,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3550.562,3554.345,--You have to say there is enough compulsion to keep it out of a criminal trial.
1983.82-827,4,36918,mark_s_wernick,,3554.345,3558.358,--There is nothing illegal about the government compelling information.
1983.82-827,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3603.196,3610.031,"Mr. Lynn, do you have something further?"
1983.82-827,5,39806,robert_h_lynn,,3610.031,3611.85,"A few points if I may, Your Honor."
1983.82-827,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3685.78,3694.234,"Mr. Lynn, what if Minnesota's parole conditions were a little less ambiguous because apparently there is some argument about what they really mean."
1983.82-827,5,39806,robert_h_lynn,,3717.392,3718.982,"I do not believe so, Your Honor."
1983.82-827,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3718.982,3728.048,But you do not construe these parole conditions to require any such broad duty to respond as I understand your argument.
1983.82-827,5,39806,robert_h_lynn,,3739.395,3741.067,I would generally agree with the Court.
1983.82-827,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3744.197,3751.904,"There is a problem because it relates to antecedent criminal conduct, but if it were not for that... Well, I guess we understand each other."
1983.82-827,5,39806,robert_h_lynn,,3751.904,3754.485,--Thank you.
1983.82-827,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3754.485,3756.257,"Thank you, gentlemen."
