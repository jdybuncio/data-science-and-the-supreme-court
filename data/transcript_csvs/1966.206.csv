1966.206,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,2.25,Let's get to the cases.
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,25.352,28.978,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,636.19,637.588,But then he stayed in the third didn't he?
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,641.803,643.924,"No sir, he didn't go back and changed his views."
1966.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,659.468,663.927,"Well, you're asking us to upset the findings of the Board."
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,663.927,666.147,"Yes, sir on that."
1966.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,688.463,692.231,"Well, was there any other evidence that denied that evidence?"
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,692.231,698.242,"Some other -- no sir, there never was.Some other witnesses said it was work preservation."
1966.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,698.957,700.679,Did he say it was not the other?
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,700.679,702.415,"No sir, they never did deny this."
1966.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,703.443,709.885,What you are saying is that you have undisputed statements by all the witnesses --
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,709.885,710.358,By one wit --
1966.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,710.358,712.362,This is one of the motives?
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,712.362,715.379,"Sir, by one witness, the principal witness, that --"
1966.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,715.379,717.004,Now what did the other witnesses said?
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,717.004,729.944,"The other said, once -- one man told the Johns-Arm -- Johns -- I mean the Armstrong man that the union wouldn't apply mitered fittings because they had no union labor."
1966.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,732.957,736.763,"Well, now that was a dispute in effect of what the first man said, wasn't it?"
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,736.763,738.057,A dispute?
1966.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,738.057,741.908,Wasn't that -- didn't that dispute his statement if there's a motive?
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,741.908,761.135,"Well, no, the other testimony Your Honor shows that I think that the union label was used for a purpose of boycotting nonunion goods because this first witness published a matter which was Exhibit 2 concerning these labors."
1966.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,832.457,835.888,"Do you concede if you have to go far enough just to show, do you not?"
1966.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,835.888,836.535,Sir?
1966.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,836.535,843.095,You can concede do you not that you have to go far enough to show that this evidence was not refuted.
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,843.095,845.059,"I don't think it was refuted, Your Honor."
1966.206,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,845.059,849.053,And so it's up to them you say to show that it was refuted.
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,849.053,849.405,No sir.
1966.206,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,952.644,953.832,"Mr. Deakins, does the record --"
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,953.832,954.257,Yes sir?
1966.206,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,954.257,959.796,-- show whether it is customary for those metal bands to be cut on the jobsite?
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,959.796,962.675,"They are sometimes, You're Honor, sometimes not."
1966.206,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1006.836,1017.534,Did the Board make any findings as to whether the metal bands and the asbestos were both customarily cut on the job?
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1017.534,1030.339,"I think the examiner did, Your Honor, that the Board did not itself adopt the examiner's provision to his decision."
1966.206,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1030.893,1034.395,What did the examiner find in that regard?
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1034.395,1079.032,"Just a second Your Honor, let --"
1966.206,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1079.032,1081.688,"Well, if you -- don't take too much on that (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1081.688,1083.215,"Alright, I can't find it right (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.206,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1083.215,1084.65,-- with your argument.
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1084.78,1085.395,Yes sir.
1966.206,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1085.395,1086.43,(Inaudible)
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1086.43,1110.371,But we contend that this testimony of Mr. Baker was the death wound as the Court said in the Pittsburg case and that this truth is an (Voice Overlap) was not refuted and that shows clearly to us that one of the objects of this strike was to prevent the use of these materials.
1966.206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1508.604,1521.952,"Well, isn't -- aren't those really -- used to be inconsistent -- I mean you would be -- that construction site proviso you say or somebody said, it refers to the work of -- that could be done or is to be done at the site --"
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1521.952,1521.977,No.
1966.206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.977,1524.29,-- but not as to products shipped in?
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1524.29,1525.569,That's right.
1966.206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.569,1535.516,"Well, what if there's an agreement that a certain work will be done at the site, likes -- like doors will be put together at the site, period."
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1535.516,1536.599,Alright.
1966.206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1536.599,1542.657,And which means that there is not going to be door -- finished doors shipped in.
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1544.629,1551.915,I think that that's -- the contract is illegal because -- the question is what was Congress attempting to prevent here?
1966.206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.008,1561.22,"I know but I just say that one statement of the legislative history isn't very informative because it wouldn't for example, tell us how to solve that question I just asked you."
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1561.22,1568.561,"No, I think probably Mr. Kennedy made the most enlightening statement on that -- on -- to all of those points."
1966.206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.362,1597.138,"Well, you say that they can protect them on work that is be -- that is being performed."
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1597.138,1598.444,On the jobsite are to (Voice Overlap) --
1966.206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1598.444,1610.922,Or it isn't much protection if the employer at the jobsite says we're going to quit doing this work that is now being done on the jobsite and have it done some place else.
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1610.922,1614.748,"Some of this work, Your Honor can't be done some place else.Of course, you appreciate --"
1966.206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1614.748,1623.87,"Alright, let's take some of it that can't -- that is being done at the site that can be done some place else like doors can be put together at some place else."
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1623.87,1624.916,"Well, in the --"
1966.206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.916,1631.119,"Now, does that now -- does the proviso protect an agreement between the union and the employer?"
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1631.119,1632.416,"I don't think it does, no sir."
1966.206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1632.416,1636.988,Which says that this work that's now being done here will continue to be done here.
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1636.988,1639.878,I don't think that would be long.
1966.206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.878,1646.099,Even though there's a -- an expressed exemption for (Voice Overlap) --
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1646.099,1648.8,"Work to be done at the jobsite, that's right."
1966.206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.725,1656.568,"Well, I know but here's some work that is being done at the jobsite."
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1667.291,1674.941,"Well, we -- well, it is our position that the statute would make that an unlawful provision."
1966.206,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1674.941,1696.88,"Your position as I understand it is that the only kind of exclusionary provision that would be lawful would be when it says to the employer, you may not have work done on the jobsite by anybody other than this union."
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1696.88,1697.551,That's right.
1966.206,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1697.551,1704.509,And if that -- that is the total scope of permissible activity of that type under the statute.
1966.206,0,44418,w_d_deakins_jr,,1704.509,1705.21,I think that's right.
1966.206,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1790.433,1796.895,Mr. Come
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1796.895,1803.044,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.206,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1906.318,1910.705,Do you mind fitting exactly what the product was?
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1910.705,1916.05,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.206,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2183.296,2190.747,So this was work that was not customarily done on the site but was done by members of the same union.
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2192.41,2198.021,"It was done by members of the same union and by employees of the same employer, --"
1966.206,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2198.021,2198.19,But not --
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2198.19,2198.886,-- John --
1966.206,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2198.886,2200.277,But not on the site?
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2200.277,2203.425,"At the present time, it was not done at the site."
1966.206,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2245.14,2254.019,"And what happened in these cases was that in both instances that is to say the miter, asbestos and the metal bands --"
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2254.019,2254.674,Yes.
1966.206,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2254.674,2266.155,-- the contractor wanted to have the material prepared on mitered and cut.
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2266.155,2266.713,The union --
1966.206,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2266.713,2268.895,supplied to manufacture?
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2268.895,2272.265,Well in the two instances and there were only two.
1966.206,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2335.346,2362.34,"So that this really does represent a sort of a different situation or variation on the theme that is to say that here, the union's objective is to protect not on the site work but work by members of the same union employed by the same employer but done in the employer's plant rather than on the site."
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2363.459,2364.377,That is correct.
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.318,2458.518,"But what the -- Mr. Come, what is the --"
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2458.518,2459.224,Yes.
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.224,2464.693,Let's assume that there was a dual purpose.
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2480.652,2486.373,"Well, it depends, Your Honor as to how we define a dual object."
1966.206,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2602.15,2608.863,"Well, is that consistent Mr. Come with the statutory language “an object”?"
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2608.863,2611.399,Well I think that if --
1966.206,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2611.399,2625.493,"If -- I gather, your -- this argument's on the premise that concededly there is among objects and unlawful objects whether it predominates or not unimportant."
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2630.663,2636.828,"Well I would say that if it were a primary, it would not be an unlawful object."
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2636.828,2645.831,"But Mr. Come, in your case, you say the picket line where the product deliveries or supplies were interrupted."
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2690.19,2692.178,"Well, that kind of situation --"
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2692.178,2694.679,"That's an incident, maybe you'd call that an incident."
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2694.679,2696.7,I think I would call that an incident.
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.565,2741.627,"Well, why would you then --"
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2741.627,2742.839,-- business relations.
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2742.839,2762.525,"How would you exclude from the reach of 8 (b) (4) then or how is -- wouldn't you give the same answer if the union came to the employer and said, “By the way, you've been using A's products all these years but we just happen to have bought B."
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2776.479,2780.239,"Well, I don't know."
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2794.023,2795.08,"Well, that (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2795.08,2803.091,-- the working conditions of the employees of the employer --
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2803.091,2806.48,"Well, isn't that -- well then let me -- you would say that was probably a violation there."
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2806.48,2807.139,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2807.139,2810.703,Let me give you a different one then.
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2839.444,2845.355,I would probably say that that was primary because there was --
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2845.355,2847.607,"So you have to with your argument, don't you?"
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2847.607,2849.665,Yes.
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2892.164,2913.201,But the Board didn't -- the Board would recognize I suppose like you seemed to that the consequence of the successful strike is the permanent stoppage of the -- of this product from being bought by these employers.Do you say that wasn't fair object but it certainly is a consequence.
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2913.201,2918.797,That maybe a consequence but that is a consequence that flows from a lot of primary activity.
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2930.813,2935.994,There's a lot of primary activity results in interruptions of products but it's only temporary.
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2946.537,2955.615,"Well, I suppose that that would apply though even in where you had purely a service involved in your band subcontracting."
1966.206,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3148.602,3151.54,"Teams -- they're just the -- they were just after the Teamsters Union, is that what you're saying?"
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3151.54,3157.627,"No, they were not just after the Teamsters Union although the Teamsters Union was the impetus for it."
1966.206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3169.635,3170.96,We're now in 1959?
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3170.96,3172.25,"In 1959, I'm talking about 1959."
1966.206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3172.25,3174.261,Yes.
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3174.261,3183.494,Senator Gore on the floor added on 8 (e) limited to the trucking industry.
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3265.315,3268.806,The who in your example means the Union.
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3268.806,3269.386,The Union.
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3269.386,3269.772,Yes.
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3269.772,3270.248,Yes.
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3270.248,3270.709,Or -- and the Union --
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3270.709,3271.018,Yes.
1966.206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3271.018,3283.811,"-- is compelling other employees not to handle products with which the Union has -- where the Union has a dispute of that other employer, isn't that it?"
1966.206,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3283.811,3295.221,And I might say that that was the case in the Sixth Circuit General Millwork case which I believe I argued.
