2011.11-159,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.654,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 11-159, Astrue v. Capato."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,7.537,10.106,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-159,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,111.987,125.064,Suppose a State legislature got the crazy idea that children born to married people during the time of the marriage shouldn't inherit under State intestacy law.
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,129.016,142.276,"Not necessarily, because if somebody doesn't qualify under -- and I should say at the outset that that is unlike the law of any State either in 1939 or today--"
2011.11-159,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,142.276,145.144,But what if they did -- what if they did that?
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,145.144,156.25,--There -- there are two alternative mechanisms that Congress added to the statute in the 1960s to allow children who lack intestacy rights to establish their eligibility.
2011.11-159,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,187.471,193.208,Those are -- those are obviously meant to deal with -- with children whose parents are not married.
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,193.208,194.708,--That -- that's right.
2011.11-159,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,224.228,225.012,Maybe it means something else.
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,259.568,266.606,"Well, I mean -- I think -- I think those -- those are probably accurate factual claims about what Congress was thinking."
2011.11-159,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,282.199,311.452,"But isn't there something sort of bizarre about your reading, because Congress in the (e) section sets up very specific definitions about stepchildren and grandchildren and even step-grandchildren in which State intestacy law is not referenced, but you are that saying that as to the largest category, the category in which 90 percent of people are going to get benefits, there Congress sent us all off to State law."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,311.452,315.404,"Well, it -- that -- that is what section 416(h) says."
2011.11-159,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,318.974,325.795,"Well, suppose I'm not so convinced that (h) is as clear as you think it is because there are two sentences of -- of section (h)."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,342.924,364.52,"--Well, I think -- I think it's because with respect to the main category of people at issue the question Congress was asking is, what is the class of people who are likely to have a sufficiently close relationship to the insured person such that it would be appropriate to provide benefits to replace the loss of support that they would likely be getting during the person's life."
2011.11-159,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,382.049,383.265,"Well, they don't always do--"
2011.11-159,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,383.265,390.32,There's one provision in (h) that is puzzling and maybe you can tell me what it means.
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,416.601,417.303,That -- that's right.
2011.11-159,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,460.13,462.682,Anyone else or just that category?
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,462.682,467.486,--I think -- I think that is the -- the most likely category that it would apply to.
2011.11-159,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,467.486,468.353,--Counsel--
2011.11-159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.353,469.336,I'm sorry.
2011.11-159,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,469.336,479.792,"--You said earlier that the State intestacy law provides clear rules, but I assume that's not always the case, particularly with all this new technological advancement."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,489.631,494.284,The Social Security Administration tries to apply State law.
2011.11-159,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,495.084,495.903,"No, no."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,515.031,524.304,"--Well, the SSA does the best that it can to figure out what the State law is, and then on review in the district court, you know, the district court is able to review that."
2011.11-159,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,556.358,586.394,"There was in my memory, and it's been a while, that some States, if not all -- and that's what I was going to ask you, basically deem any child born during the marriage to be a child of the marriage, whether it's a biological child or not, so that if a mother has had a relationship outside of marriage the married parent is still responsible for that child."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,600.971,602.523,That -- that's right.
2011.11-159,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,609.71,609.96,Yes.
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,635.244,642.798,"I -- I can't speak with certainty to all the States, but I believe that that is the -- the general rule."
2011.11-159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,652.772,666.263,"My impression is that, I'm not sure it's by statute, but just by judicial decision, a child born in the marriage is a child of the marriage unless -- unless the child is repudiated by -- by the father."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,666.263,669.281,I believe that is -- that is the general rule.
2011.11-159,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,726.32,740.377,"Would -- would you tell me if -- if the Capato twins are both found to be -- be children within the meaning of the act, will they meet the dependency or the deemed dependency requirements?"
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,742.813,747.067,We -- that -- that would be a question for the agency to address in the first instance.
2011.11-159,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,751.935,756.339,"It -- it was addressed in the Ninth -- in the Ninth Circuit decision, wasn't it?"
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,756.339,757.173,--That's right.
2011.11-159,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,773.183,774.401,--You don't have a position on that here?
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,779.371,780.204,That -- that's right.
2011.11-159,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,807.455,809.724,Rebuttable presumption or irrebuttable?
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,809.724,814.359,--The presumption in favor of dependency for anyone who qualifies is irrebuttable.
2011.11-159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,814.359,820.412,You rely only on that -- on that definition?
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,864.108,871.595,"I don't -- it doesn't appear in any of the -- the operative definitional provisions, but I would certainly agree with you that it is--"
2011.11-159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,871.595,877.082,"We use titles to determine the meaning of ambiguous provisions later, don't we?"
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,877.082,887.057,"--Yes, and I certainly would agree with the -- the idea that it is difficult to describe someone as a survivor who was not alive at the time that person--"
2011.11-159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,887.057,890.342,"Nor would he meet the requirements of (c), would he?"
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,898.531,915.374,"--The dependency requirement is defined in 402(d)(3) and -- which unfortunately is not reproduced in the appendix, but which had the effect of making anyone who qualifies under 416(h) be deemed dependent."
2011.11-159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.813,929.217,Then what does (d)(1)(C) do if it's all washed out by--
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,929.217,943.893,"Well, the dependency requirement is something that people who don't qualify under 416(h), people who are adopted, children or stepchildren or grandchildren may in some cases have to make an individualized determination of actual dependence."
2011.11-159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.893,949.047,"--Well, it says every child as defined in 416(e) has to meet that requirement."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,953.099,968.759,"Right, but then -- but then 402(d)(3) says a child shall be deemed dependent under certain circumstances that effectively track the 416(h) analysis."
2011.11-159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.255,988.921,Okay.
2011.11-159,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,988.921,990.055,May I ask?
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1020.81,1033.117,"I think that when the statute was initially enacted in 1939 with more or less the same structure of these provisions as we have now, it might at that time have been ambiguous."
2011.11-159,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1069.123,1072.509,"Mr. Miller, could I take you back to 416(e)."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1086.833,1091.137,"Yes, because those terms do not appear in 416(h)."
2011.11-159,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1097.875,1101.827,"You know, I'm looking at some of these, the grandchildren one for example."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1128.227,1133.298,"Well, I should say two things about that, then."
2011.11-159,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1148.573,1149.925,"I'm sorry, the child of a child."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1152.009,1160.198,Somebody who would qualify under 416(h) as a child.
2011.11-159,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1160.198,1163.917,"Oh, so for grandchildren the agency is also looking to State law?"
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1163.917,1165.302,Indirectly.
2011.11-159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1301.474,1305.426,"Can you -- go ahead, finish."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1305.426,1312.215,"If you were to take Respondent's approach, you would just stop there and apply some Federal standard of figuring out whether people are married or not."
2011.11-159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.537,1348.872,"Counsel, I now have in front of me (h)(3)."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1360.596,1361.012,I'm sorry.
2011.11-159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1399.721,1414.847,"Well, unless such individual was not living with or contributing to the support of such child, which is certainly the case here -- the child had not yet been born -- and other qualifications."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1443.916,1461.395,"Because the child is deemed dependent unless he was -- again, since -- to be clear, we think that the children in this case do not -- are not eligible for child status because they don't meet the requirements of 416(h)."
2011.11-159,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1461.395,1462.664,"Well, that may well be."
2011.11-159,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1486.445,1488.814,That -- that might well be the case.
2011.11-159,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1556.389,1557.375,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1563.445,1575.337,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I can, I will start with a question that Justice Sotomayor asked about ambiguity or not of the statute, and we think that in fact the statute is not ambiguous at all."
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1633.174,1633.874,Excuse me.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1639.661,1640.78,--We think--
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1640.78,1647.934,--given that you believe that 416(e) is self-sufficient unto itself.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1647.934,1654.437,--We think section 416(e) is sufficient as to the children defined to be a child within that statute.
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1654.437,1656.222,As the child who should receive.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1657.605,1667.847,"And our understanding of who falls within section 416(e), (e)(1), definition of child, is the natural child, the biological child of married parents."
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1668.68,1674.584,So the -- a child who was born during marriage but is not a biological child wouldn't qualify?
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1674.584,1675.501,--Well--
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1675.501,1678.286,Even though they qualify under State law as a child?
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1678.286,1681.405,"--That's the question, what (h) is designed to accomplish."
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1692.128,1703.936,So what this -- let's assume Ms. Capato remarried but used her deceased husband's sperm to birth two children.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1711.876,1717.078,"--Well, I think that's an interesting and more difficult question than what we have here."
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1729.67,1738.276,"Well, you see, a situation like that is what is making me uncomfortable, because I don't see the words ""biological"" in the statute."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1748.849,1750.517,"Well, let me answer both of those questions."
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1769.496,1772.747,--But that would be true under State intestate law.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1772.747,1777.199,"--Well, it's simply as to what Congress had in mind when it said a child is a child."
2011.11-159,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1789.09,1791.375,But the words -- you say this is plain meaning.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1820.728,1836.088,"--Let me say two things about that, and first, to continue the question of where marriage comes from, there is a textual reference to marriage which appears in section 416(h)(2)(b), the companion to the intestacy provision upon which the government relies."
2011.11-159,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1836.088,1838.94,But I thought we weren't supposed to look to (h) at all.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1843.308,1847.629,But I think (h) reflects what Congress had in mind in the statutory definition.
2011.11-159,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1867.792,1869.109,"I don't, I don't -- look."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1895.86,1896.326,--But--
2011.11-159,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.326,1905.415,"You want us to probe their mind and say, well, since 90 percent of all children were children of married people, that's what they must have meant by child."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1908.869,1921.677,"--If I may, Congress wrote a Federal definition of Mr. Miller acknowledged in his opening argument, when Congress defined ""child"" it defined ""child"" to include a number of things."
2011.11-159,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1937.102,1946.125,"But, Mr. Rothfeld, I guess the question is, when it says a child is a child does it mean a child is a child born in wedlock or a child is just a child."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1961.618,1967.539,"--I think the reason it did that, again as Mr. Miller said, child used the ""child"" in two senses."
2011.11-159,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1994.606,2005.164,"Are there any other statutes that you can point to around this time which support the notion that when people said ""child"" they meant child within a legal marriage?"
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2005.164,2012.735,"I can't point to specifically that, because I think it was clear when Congress used the word ""child"" that that's what they had in mind as a generic matter."
2011.11-159,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2016.471,2019.256,"I'm sorry, you can't point to anything because it's so clear?"
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2019.256,2020.89,"--In a sense, that's right."
2011.11-159,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2029.862,2063.535,"Mr. Rothfeld, don't you run into a problem, perhaps not in 1939; but since then this Court has had a number of decisions that deal with the distinction between children born in and out of wedlock, and in some of those cases it has held that the distinction between the two is unconstitutional, that there are no illegitimate children, all children are legitimate, whatever their parents may be."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2063.535,2065.552,That is true.
2011.11-159,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2070.289,2074.225,"Yes, but if we are going to apply those equal protection decisions to this statute--"
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2074.225,2084.616,"Well, that -- that to me suggests that an unfavorable application of the statute to children born out of wedlock would be unconstitutional."
2011.11-159,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2088.068,2095.639,"Well, I suppose the question that is argued at the very least is getting us into a situation where we should interpret the statute the government's way because of constitutional avoidance concerns."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2095.639,2113.064,"I think that -- contrary to that I think you should interpret it our way because the government's application disfavors children who are born through, you know, artificial -- through assisted means by its incorporation of State law."
2011.11-159,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.064,2117.552,It disfavors children who are born after the father has died.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2134.847,2151.039,"But I think -- I suspect the reason that Mr. Miller was resisting your questions on that point is there is no question that children who are born, who are pro-conceived naturally in the marriage and are born after the father's death are deemed to be dependents and receive benefits."
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2161.931,2166.133,I am interested as to what your definition of child is.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2208.062,2209.478,"--No, we think not."
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2234.11,2238.997,"So the mother who is unmarried who bears a child, this child is not automatically covered."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2238.997,2248.953,"--We think that as Congress wrote the statute in 1939, that's correct, and that child would then have been referred to the intestacy provision on which the government relies, and--"
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2248.953,2254.091,"Oh, so there are situations in which you think those provisions should govern."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2254.091,2254.541,--Yes.
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2264.564,2265.898,This is what was not clear to me.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2272.402,2275.504,"We -- we argue that Congress used the word ""child""--"
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2275.504,2278.356,In whatever meaning you could give it.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2278.356,2280.758,--We -- I wouldn't say that.
2011.11-159,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2354.62,2371.482,"Mr. Rothfeld, I'm curious why you didn't argue a different theory which is that (e) refers to all biological children whether in marriage or outside of marriage and the (h) is set up for cases in which biological status is contested."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2373.184,2376.386,"Well, I -- we would certainly embrace it if the Court were--"
2011.11-159,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2376.386,2377.919,"Well, why didn't you argue it?"
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2377.919,2382.623,"--I think -- we think that we are arguing essentially a, sort of a subset of that theory."
2011.11-159,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2435.091,2443.595,"What if -- What if the children -- well, I don't want -- the Capato twins were conceived four years after of the death in this case?"
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2444.83,2452.886,"I think that our argument would be the same, but as a practical matter, almost all of these cases involve who were born relatively soon after--"
2011.11-159,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2452.886,2453.953,Why is that?
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2460.54,2472.78,"--They don't necessarily have to, but I think the practical reason why they do is that it's often the case that the surviving mother has children to produce a family sibling for an already existing child as was--"
2011.11-159,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2472.78,2475.316,But there is no reason it couldn't take place four years after.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2475.316,2476.351,"--There is no reason, that's correct."
2011.11-159,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2476.351,2483.422,So what happens if the biological mother remarries or something and then goes through this process?
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2495.38,2498.415,"Potentially, that's correct."
2011.11-159,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2506.354,2513.441,"--Mr. Rothfeld, these children were born 18 months after the insured wage earner died."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2559.755,2565.892,"Well, I think that the question that the Court has to confront is, Congress wrote a Federal definition of the word ""child""."
2011.11-159,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2605.101,2611.588,"The question is, what you haven't mentioned the text that suggests you are not right, which is right in (h) which says,"
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2627.217,2628.867,"--No, no that's no what the--"
2011.11-159,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2628.867,2630.752,You are saying that that doesn't apply.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2642.726,2643.526,--Because--
2011.11-159,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2643.526,2652.498,"--Suppose that two parents have lived together for six years and four months in State X, and they have a child."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2723.262,2742.389,"--Well, the answer to the first sentence of section (h), if that were the only thing in the statute, I think that you would be right, but there's a second sentence to (h), which says in -- in applying State intestacy law, the -- the Commissioner is supposed to look at the status of an applicant and determine whether or not the status of the applicant is the same as that of a child."
2011.11-159,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2744.591,2745.391,Where is that sentence?
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2745.391,2746.71,--That appears in--
2011.11-159,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2746.71,2749.579,Is it the bottom of the paragraph?
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2749.579,2750.295,--The bottom of the paragraph.
2011.11-159,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2750.295,2751.195,It says
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2760.551,2761.201,But as a child.
2011.11-159,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2774.127,2776.762,I haven't found the sentence you're talking about.
2011.11-159,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2777.429,2778.545,At the bottom.
2011.11-159,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2778.545,2779.329,Bottom of what?
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2779.329,2783.483,It is at page 9A of the government -- the appendix to the government's brief.
2011.11-159,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2783.483,2786.435,It's sort of like a -- you say there is no board of taxes.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2791.17,2794.707,"Well, that -- that's our explanation of what Congress is up to in the statute."
2011.11-159,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2795.241,2796.224,All right.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2796.574,2804.23,"--It was an additive provision that says that if you are the same -- and I think this is an important point, Justice Breyer -- if you are the same as a child, you are deemed to have child status."
2011.11-159,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2805.03,2809.651,"But, Mr. Rothfeld, why can't one just say, well, first sentence, whose child?"
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2829.362,2834.814,--But I -- I think that is not a plausible reading of -- of the text of the case.
2011.11-159,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2834.814,2835.98,The obvious practical thing is--
2011.11-159,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2835.98,2836.364,"Well, why not?"
2011.11-159,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2836.364,2856.077,"--is that -- that, you know, once you get beyond this and the child wasn't even -- if he's conceived -- or what the father could do, couldn't he just write a note and say this is my child even if it's conceived later, and then wouldn't he fall within one of these other exceptions, the exception for being acknowledged?"
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2856.077,2859.012,He -- he would not.
2011.11-159,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2861.631,2865.749,He has acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his son or daughter.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2866.699,2870.135,--I -- I think that the problem is that that has to be during the life of the father.
2011.11-159,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2870.135,2870.637,Does it?
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2887.763,2889.982,"Well, I don't want to argue against my -- my position."
2011.11-159,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2889.982,2890.482,"--No, no, I know."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2931.559,2942.166,"Well, Congress wrote a Federal definition of ""child"", and it's not an extraordinary thing for Congress to write a statute that has language that applies in certain circumstances and then the world changes."
2011.11-159,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2971.519,2974.488,"Well, that would be fine if the statute said what you claim it said."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3008.026,3021.035,"--But -- and I think actually that is a helpful point for us, Justice Ginsburg, because in determining whether an applicant is a child for purposes of the subchapter, it's referring to the use of the word ""child"" in the generic sense."
2011.11-159,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3030.157,3032.759,"But how could it do that when the rest of the sentence says,"
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3043.549,3048.103,--But I -- I think that -- that these two sentences have to be read together as accomplishing the same thing.
2011.11-159,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3078.638,3080.824,"Well, that's exactly right, Mr. Rothfeld."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3111.509,3130.173,"--No, and I -- I think though what it's telling the Commissioner to do is to determine whether or not, when an applicant who does not fall within one of the defined categories of section (e) applies for benefits, the Commissioner is to determine whether or not that child has the same status relative to State law as the child as defined in the definitional section."
2011.11-159,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3150.484,3155.622,"Counsel, under Chevron, you lose if the statute is ambiguous."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3161.876,3164.228,It's a mess.
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3203.536,3209.007,How -- do you think that Congress thought of either of these situations as real possibilities?
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3229.436,3230.372,Well--
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3230.372,3231.488,They weren't thinking of either.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3246.965,3252.786,"--Well, if we have to convince you not to give the statute its plain reading, then -- then we will not -- going to prevail."
2011.11-159,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3273.632,3277.267,That's because every State law recognized them as such as well.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3278.269,3287.792,"--And every State law -- I would put it the other way: Every State law has recognized them as such because that was the way in which children were understood -- the meaning of the term ""child"" was understood at the time."
2011.11-159,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3287.792,3295.898,"Going back to 1939 understanding, wasn't it also understood that the marriage ends when a parent dies?"
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3295.898,3296.898,Well--
2011.11-159,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3296.898,3306.086,"So there wouldn't be -- a child that is born 18 months after the father died wouldn't be considered a child of the marriage, because the marriage would have ended."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3306.086,3325.917,"--Well, I think that one has to look at what the Congress at the time -- I guess I'll put it this way: If -- if the Court were to accept our view that Congress had in mind the children of married parents, the question is whether any particular child falls in the box Congress would have regarded as the marital box or the non-married box."
2011.11-159,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3338.308,3354.001,"Mr. Rothfeld, I know that the government didn't rely on it, but just to satisfy my curiosity, how -- how can this child satisfy the requirements of (d)(1)(C), with regard to dependency upon the father?"
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3354.001,3357.305,I guess two responses to that.
2011.11-159,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3361.923,3362.49,I understand.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3363.04,3364.192,--But the answer--
2011.11-159,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3364.192,3366.161,--that is connected with this other issue.
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3366.477,3393.478,"--The answer -- the answer why we think -- and if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, answer it, the reason that we think we would prevail on that question is because as Mr. Miller said, Congress created a -- an irrebuttable presumption that the child of -- the legitimate child of -- of a parent is deemed to have been dependent upon that parent at the time of the parent's death."
2011.11-159,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3394.328,3395.011,"Thank you, Counsel."
2011.11-159,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3395.011,3396.263,"--Thank you very much, Your Honor."
2011.11-159,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3396.263,3399.648,"Mr. Miller, you have 4 minutes."
2011.11-159,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,3399.648,3402.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.11-159,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3419.879,3439.357,"Mr. Miller, what do you think is wrong with the alternative theory that -- that I suggested, that (e) is all biological children in a marriage, not in a marriage, doesn't matter; and that (h) is designed to deal with situations in which biological status is contested?"
2011.11-159,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,3439.357,3448.713,"Well, I -- the principal problem with that, I think, is that it lacks -- it's not supported by the text of what 416(h) says."
2011.11-159,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3448.713,3450.115,But why do you think that?
2011.11-159,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,3456.402,3474.78,"I would point to (h)(2)(B) and (h)(3), both of which are -- are the exceptions to allow people to qualify when they can't establish State intestacy rights, and both of which refer to someone who is the son or daughter of the insured person but is not, and is not deemed to be, the child."
2011.11-159,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3544.943,3560.802,Why doesn't the last sentence of -- what is it -- (h)(2)(A) show that Congress had in mind a certain idea of a category of people who were indisputably children?
2011.11-159,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,3571.76,3582.902,"--I -- I think the answer to that is the one suggested by Justice Kagan a few minutes ago, and that is that you have to read the first and second sentences together."
2011.11-159,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3598.577,3625.812,"So if the person is a child, you have applicants who according to State law had the same status as a child, a person has that status because the person is a child, and the person is deemed to be a child -- it seems very clear that that shows that (h), that this provision is directed to people that Congress in 1939 did not think fell within this paradigm of a child."
2011.11-159,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,3625.812,3653.081,"The -- well, the second -- maybe, I may be misunderstanding you, but our view of what the second sentence does is that it covers people who are not treated as children, who are not children under State law, but nonetheless have the inheritance right of children so principally the -- in the case of equitable adoption, those people would have the status of children."
2011.11-159,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3653.081,3654.664,"Thank you Mr. Miller, Rothfeld."
