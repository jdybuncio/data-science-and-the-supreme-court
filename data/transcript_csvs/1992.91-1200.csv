1992.91-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We'll hear argument next in Number 91-1200, City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc.--"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,59.872,62.805,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,164.772,178.449,"Well, Mr. Yurick, you suggest an analogy to the Metromedia case, but isn't the city's position here perhaps stronger, because Metromedia was a regulation of billboards on private property?"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,184.001,202.795,"I think that since public property is involved the city's interest in preserving that public property for all of the citizens of Cincinnati is perhaps stronger, and I believe that in the Metromedia case the prohibition was on offsite advertising, both public and private."
1992.91-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.972,222.924,"But no one was claiming a right to put a billboard on property owned by the State there, were they?"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,222.924,227.309,"No, Your Honor, but that is precisely what Discovery Network--"
1992.91-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.309,228.828,"Well, that's why I suggest--"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,228.828,229.378,--And Harmon Homes are doing here.
1992.91-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,229.378,234.613,"--Your case may be stronger than those of the billboard people, Metromedia."
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,234.613,248.587,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would agree with you there, and I think that the point is... well, it's a very good point."
1992.91-1200,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.837,283.26,"Mr. Yurick, the city here is trying to draw a distinction, or does draw a distinction, between ordinary newspapers and the papers that were desired to be put out on the street by these Respondents, and yet I suppose ordinary newspapers contain a lot of advertisements as well, don't they?"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,283.26,283.677,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1200,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.677,297.353,"Now, we take this case on some kind of concession that this is commercial speech at issue and that ordinary newspapers are not."
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,297.353,309.677,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that the parties agreed that the speech in question, the Respondent's publications, do constitute commercial speech."
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,341.298,346.433,"But in point of fact, you're not making a commercial... or your ordinance doesn't make a commercial-noncommercial speech distinction, does it?"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,348.035,360.51,"Your Honor, my witness said that the same problems are posed by boxes that contain commercial speech and boxes that contain noncommercial speech."
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,360.51,365.996,"Well, that may be, but that is not the way you have drafted your ordinance."
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,365.996,367.046,I'm sorry.
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,367.046,389.362,"Well, your... as I understand it, your ordinance turns on the predominant dedication of the so-called newspapers to the dissemination of what, news of current events, I guess is the way it's described, isn't it, and yet everything which is excluded by that is not necessarily commercial speech, isn't that true?"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,389.362,410.858,"I'm sorry, I think the distinctions made by the ordinances themselves are merely commercial versus noncommercial, and I think that the language used in the ordinances, which distinguish between commercial and noncommercial, use language that's been approved by the court."
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,413.31,431.855,"In any case, you take the position that the definition of what we are for shorthand purposes calling newspapers is in fact a definition which divides the world into two categories, newspapers and noncommercial speech, is that correct?"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,431.855,439.795,--I think that there are newspapers which are specifically allowed to be distributed from newsracks on the public streets of Cincinnati.
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,453.352,472.599,"But you are taking the... if I understand you, you are taking the position that if it does not qualify as a newspaper, and hence does not qualify for the right to be displayed and sold from these boxes, it is... the publication is noncommercial speech within the meaning of our cases, is that correct?"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,475.551,477.784,I'm not sure that it is.
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,495.528,502.968,"And there would be some nonmixed publications which are not newspapers but which are just as clearly not commercial speech, too."
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,502.968,511.138,"--That's correct, and I think that the ordinance also allows for the distribution in the public way of noncommercial handbills as defined in the code."
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,511.138,511.538,How does it do that?
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,520.763,527.249,Noncommercial handbills are specifically in the exact section of the code.
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,532.867,535.003,They are expressly exempted from the--
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,535.003,535.236,Yes.
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,535.236,535.636,--From the ban.
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,547.627,548.578,Newspapers--
1992.91-1200,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,548.578,552.714,"No, I'm not talking about newspapers, I'm talking about the other sides to the publications."
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,552.714,554.149,"--Yes, they do, and--"
1992.91-1200,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,554.149,560.486,"Does that mean that they may not only not use these stationary devices, but they can't be distributed at all on the streets?"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,560.486,564.021,"--That would be correct, not on the public streets in the city."
1992.91-1200,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,564.021,565.871,They can't be handed out either.
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,565.871,569.342,"According to the code, no, they wouldn't."
1992.91-1200,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,576.829,590.338,"I just asked you a factual question, whether, under the ordinance, as I understand it, your opponent's publications could not be either distributed through the stationary boxes or by having people hand them out to passers-by."
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,590.338,592.838,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,611.167,624.409,"Mr. Yurick, I understand that the real estate brochure involved here sometimes contained matter other than the mere listing of homes."
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,631.915,632.815,That's correct.
1992.91-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,632.815,637.85,Why... but that isn't enough to make it qualify as a newspaper?
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,637.85,639.302,I think that under this--
1992.91-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.302,643.337,How many ads do you have to have to be not a newspaper anymore?
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,643.337,673.706,"--Well, I don't think that the code makes any sort of percentage, or has any sort of percentage requirement, and I'm not certain that there is... there should be any percentage requirement, because to the extent that even a small proportion of noncommercial speech is inextricably intertwined with commercial speech, that would render the enter publication noncommercial and the City of Cincinnati would permit that publication to occupy sidewalk space."
1992.91-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,687.414,689.966,I don't under... they were not inextricably intertwined.
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,692.818,694.103,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.103,701.024,"--As opposed to the advertising in newspapers, which is inextricably intertwined?"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,701.024,712.397,"Your Honor, the district court didn't make a finding on that and it wasn't really an issue in this case because neither of the Respondents claimed that they published newspapers."
1992.91-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,715.683,719.718,"Never mind the argument, does the city apply that test to newspapers--"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,719.718,720.085,"--No, they don't."
1992.91-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,720.085,725.122,"--That only advertising... if the advertising can be separated... no, it doesn't."
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,725.122,725.405,No.
1992.91-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.374,736.778,"Even if they put all their advertising in one section at the end, you know, advertising section, and all the rest is news, it would still qualify, right?"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,736.778,737.661,--That's correct.
1992.91-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,737.661,742.431,But this real estate brochure was not allowed to qualify on that basis.
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,742.431,746.566,The district court made a finding that they didn't qualify--
1992.91-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.566,749.002,"And you support... and the city supports that finding, correct?"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,763.095,764.628,--That's correct.
1992.91-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,764.628,766.397,But it won't exclude newspapers on that basis.
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,766.397,775.003,"No, it won't, Your Honor, and Your Honor, might I say the ordinance is, or it could be considered underinclusive on that point."
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,798.851,829.656,"Well, assuming that to be true, isn't your real problem here as you're describing it not that the audience is perhaps underinclusive but that the ordinance is inarticulate, and we have no way of knowing what the city might decide to do next either in drawing the kind of distinction that Justice... or applying the kind of distinction that Justice Scalia was discussing to what we would call regular newspapers, or in deciding what the percentage mix between advertising and news ought to be."
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,834.941,837.893,"No, Your Honor, I don't think it is left with a standardless discretion."
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,846.999,850.986,"Well, let's just get down to the definition of what we're calling newspapers."
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,865.329,869.864,"--There was a memorandum sent from the city manager, who is the chief executive officer--"
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,869.864,871.399,"Well, first, how about just the text?"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,872.366,875.201,--The text of the ordinance doesn't say anything about--
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,875.201,876.451,It says nothing whatsoever.
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,879.253,885.993,"--It was in a memorandum from the city manager, who is the chief executive officer of the city, to the city engineer."
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,942.329,956.22,"Did he later testify that, roughly speaking, he would suppose that predominantly applied... predominantly implied that there would be something better than 50 percent of the space devoted to the current events?"
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,956.22,964.326,"I think what the city engineer, Tom Young, testified to was that that would present a very close case."
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,964.326,970.33,"Okay, but in... and in point of fact I gather it's in the record that most newspapers are 70 percent advertising."
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,970.33,973.865,I don't think that there... that is in the record.
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,973.865,975.217,There was no testimony to that effect?
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,975.217,976.301,I don't think there is any testimony.
1992.91-1200,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,976.301,979.353,They just put that in the brief.
1992.91-1200,0,36964,mark_s_yurick,,979.353,979.836,I don't think--
1992.91-1200,1,36296,marc_d_mezibov,,1792.14,1795.092,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1200,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1821.373,1832.948,"Now, Mr. Mezibov, you want us to consider the case on the assumption that your clients engage only in commercial speech, is that right?"
1992.91-1200,1,36296,marc_d_mezibov,,1832.948,1837.352,"Justice O'Connor, we did not take up the matter of whether we are or are not commercial speakers."
1992.91-1200,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1837.352,1845.441,So you want us to decide it on the basis that your clients engage only in commercial speech.
1992.91-1200,1,36296,marc_d_mezibov,,1845.441,1847.541,"Your Honor, we feel that this case can be decided--"
1992.91-1200,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1847.541,1848.124,"Yes, or no?"
1992.91-1200,1,36296,marc_d_mezibov,,1848.124,1849.226,--As if we are commercial speakers--
