1982.81-1891,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,2.328,"Thank you gentlemen, the case is submitted."
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,63.209,67.442,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1891,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.446,221.568,"Mr. Larson, would you tell us what happened to the legislation that had been introduced in the Congress, I guess, to overrule the decision below?"
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,221.568,222.115,Yes.
1982.81-1891,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.873,240.795,Did the House take any action on the bill?
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,240.795,242.669,So far this year I don't think anything has happened.
1982.81-1891,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.669,245.294,And last year the House took no action?
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,245.294,246.106,"No, they took no action last year."
1982.81-1891,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,295.93,309.689,"Assuming you are correct, what happens to things like medical insurance premiums that might be paid to a fund by the employer in the future?"
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,309.689,323.512,"There are, of course, all kinds of benefits under this plan and the various others that occur and under some plans the medical payments go on during disability and others they don't."
1982.81-1891,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.758,370.961,"Of course, that is the problem."
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,383.551,390.922,--The principal distinction... This is the one that has always controlled these cases of so-called similar advantage.
1982.81-1891,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,435.389,447.899,"Mr. Larson, I suppose that some payments by an employer of board or lodging might not be paid directly to the employee at all."
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,447.899,460.598,"--Well, I think in almost every case it is either furnished directly or the money is furnished directly, but it has a present cash value and this is a traditional thing and it is written, of course,... It is written right into the statute so it can't be controversial."
1982.81-1891,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,460.598,464.315,Would certain medical benefits have a present cash value then?
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,464.315,468.688,"They might, yes, but they are not paid by the employer to the employee."
1982.81-1891,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,673.325,674.043,Mr. Larson?
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,674.043,674.418,Yes.
1982.81-1891,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,674.418,676.715,When was the Davis-Bacon Act amended to include--
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,676.715,677.355,'64.
1982.81-1891,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,677.355,678.338,--'64?
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,678.338,678.619,Yes.
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.236,775.532,"May I ask you a question, Mr. Larson?"
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,781.234,781.467,--Take-home pay.
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,781.467,783.233,But not above gross pay?
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,783.233,787.356,"Well, they would even do that in some cases, but I am making the mildest--"
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,787.356,792.292,And clearly they wouldn't go above gross pay if you included the fringe benefits as part of gross pay?
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,792.292,794.932,--In many cases they would go above gross pay.
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,797.181,802.413,Even if you include in gross pay the payments to the pension funds and the like?
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,802.413,802.866,Yes.
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,817.377,832.385,"If that is true, if it is higher than gross pay even including fringe benefits, I suppose it is possible, even under your view, that benefits may... If you define wages the way you argue, benefits may in some cases exceed wages."
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,832.385,833.791,"--They do now, yes."
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,833.791,834.526,They do now?
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,834.526,835.276,"They do now, yes."
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.276,836.368,So there would be no difference under--
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,836.368,838.664,There would be a great difference in the amount by which they exceeded.
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,838.664,842.022,"--But, the mere fact that they exceed is not a critical difference."
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,842.022,856.376,"Well, the Comptroller General pointed this out in his report a couple of years ago and I am simply quoting him when he says that in some cases it is at least theoretically possible to show that the present thing could go above."
1982.81-1891,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,886.582,888.207,Under the decision of the Court of Appeals?
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,888.207,889.534,Under the decision of the court below.
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,892.97,896.578,"Well, in that example, $20,200 is the take-home pay and--"
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,896.578,898.781,--Twenty thousand two hundred is the take-home pay.
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,898.781,904.421,--What would the comparable figure be if you included the amounts paid to the pension funds on behalf of that employee?
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,904.421,908.776,That... I can give you the exact figures.
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,916.633,920.147,"Well, what is the figure comparable to the $20,200 figure?"
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,927.347,928.753,"Well, the--"
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,928.753,937.984,You are really comparing oranges with apples when you include the payments for one purpose but not for the other.
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,937.984,943.31,"--I am including them all, of course."
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,943.31,947.387,"The $20,200 figures, does that include the amounts paid into the pension fund?"
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,947.387,949.041,"No, no, it doesn't."
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.041,951.463,"Whereas the $24,000 does?"
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,951.463,979.998,"But, you see, what we are concerned with is in the last amounts of this incentive to the worker and what he sees obviously is if he works he gets $20,200 and if he doesn't work he gets $24,100 and no amount of talk about the employee's value of what goes into the fund will make much difference to him, because, you see, there is not a direct pipeline of that fund contribution from the employer into the pockets of the employee."
1982.81-1891,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,983.466,990.649,"You could have made a similar argument in 1927 if the employee had a very low take-home pay, but got free room and board and a lot of tips."
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,990.649,998.24,"Well, they wrote this into the Act definitely because room and board... And, of course, they had to write tips in."
1982.81-1891,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,998.24,1008.596,"Of course, the employee in 1927 saw a right with his monthly paycheck the benefit of a rent payment or a food payment."
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,1013.22,1015.578,He doesn't see it as in many cases he never will see it.
1982.81-1891,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1033.321,1046.127,"Of course, it is hard to compare, Professor Larson, this man because he will not be working any more, he is dead, he is killed."
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,1046.127,1046.768,That is right.
1982.81-1891,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1053.203,1063.916,"You speak of massive... I think that was the word you used... on the one side, but imposed death is also rather massive."
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,1063.916,1065.713,--I didn't hear that.
1982.81-1891,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1065.713,1070.211,"I say imposed death, being killed on the job is also massive."
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,1070.211,1085.33,I want to say with all my heart that nothing in the world can compensate people for the loss of a husband and the Compensation Act never has pretended to do anything like that.
1982.81-1891,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1262.886,1266.183,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Larson."
1982.81-1891,0,16442,arthur_larson,,1266.183,1267.23,Thank you.
1982.81-1891,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1267.23,1279.74,Mr. Horowitz?
1982.81-1891,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1279.74,1288.893,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1891,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1634.085,1638.302,"Mr. Horowitz, the Director has switched sides in this case, hasn't he?"
1982.81-1891,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1638.302,1640.38,"Well, the Director--"
1982.81-1891,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1640.38,1641.614,Do you have any comment on that?
1982.81-1891,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1641.614,1644.16,"--The Director... Well, we mention that in our brief."
1982.81-1891,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1663.903,1665.48,He just got out of line?
1982.81-1891,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1665.48,1666.668,Pardon me?
1982.81-1891,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1666.668,1668.557,He just got out of line in the Court of Appeals?
1982.81-1891,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1668.557,1674.93,"Well, the decision was made to take this position in the Court of Appeals."
1982.81-1891,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.179,1680.959,Who represented him in the Court of Appeals?
1982.81-1891,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1680.959,1683.475,--Who represented the Director?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1889.875,1892.358,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2011.449,2019.259,"Mr. Leonard, I didn't read the Court of Appeals' opinion to suggest that it would treat the computations differently in the case of death benefits than in the case of--"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2019.259,2032.473,"--No, they don't make the distinction in the Court of Appeals, but as far as the record is concerned, there is such a distinction; namely, it is a death benefit under Section 9 of the Act."
1982.81-1891,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2032.473,2033.519,--The principle is exactly the same.
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2040.813,2042.672,"Well, let me put it this way."
1982.81-1891,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2080.845,2098.478,"But, I suppose the question under the statute... you are dealing with a statute... is whether these contributions to the funds constitute a ""similar advantage"" under the statutory language."
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2098.478,2099.322,No.
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2135.369,2152.159,"Mr. Leonard, what if the contract in this case had provided, in addition to the things it does provide for, that the employer would contribute five cents an hour for each worker to a fund to build a gymnasium for the workers on his property?"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2155.079,2174.62,"The answer is, yes, they could because, number one, in the case that you decided in January of this year, the Bowen case, you held that a negotiated contract such as this one was considerably superior to the old employment contract."
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.257,2183.726,--What case was that?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2183.726,2187.675,"That is the Bowen case which you decided on January 11, I believe."
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.675,2189.956,Who is the other party?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2189.956,2191.018,"Well, I can look--"
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2191.018,2192.487,"No, don't bother."
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2192.487,2199.031,--The point was... You pointed out at that time--
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2199.031,2205.294,That was a case involving whether or not a union was liable for damages resulting from failure to properly represent.
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2206.888,2220.007,--In Alessi and one other case you have already held that the union has an absolute right as a trustee to come into court and see to it that the employer does pay into the fund as he is required to do by the contract.
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2220.007,2234.485,"But, that to me does not stand for the proposition that an employee who has a contract with the... a collective bargaining contract with the employer is necessarily on the same footing as the union would be."
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2236.094,2243.154,"No, I don't think the employer is, but the employee is because that is what Congress said."
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2243.154,2244.45,--Do you think the employee could come into court--
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2244.45,2246.074,The employee can come--
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2246.074,2248.745,"--Would you wait and let me finish my question, please?"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2248.745,2248.949,--I am sorry.
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2248.949,2257.555,Do you think that the employee would have the same standing to come into court in a situation such as that raised in the Alessi case?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2257.555,2258.507,"Yes, I do."
1982.81-1891,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2278.669,2280.607,Mr. Leonard?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2280.607,2284.34,This comes back to a fact--
1982.81-1891,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2284.34,2287.697,"Mr. Leonard, Justice Powell is addressing you."
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2287.697,2288.057,--I am sorry.
1982.81-1891,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2288.057,2289.65,Have you finished responding to Justice Rehnquist?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2289.65,2291.445,Mr. Justice.
1982.81-1891,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2291.445,2297.334,I wanted to ask whether or not the benefits are fully vested.
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2297.334,2299.941,"No, Your Honor, and never will be."
1982.81-1891,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2299.941,2305.611,Is there any other benefit received--
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2305.611,2308.189,"Well, he didn't have the life... I am sorry."
1982.81-1891,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2311.016,2317.497,"--Are there any other benefits to which the term ""wages"" applies that are not vested?"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2317.497,2327.572,"I would not be surprised if the time he took off for coffee breaks constituted part of his wages, but we have not sued for it."
1982.81-1891,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2327.572,2329.305,What is the answer to my question?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2329.305,2332.601,"The answer, I think, is probably so."
1982.81-1891,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2346.579,2359.589,"If this employee had left the employment to take an entirely different job, a non-union job, would he have any interest whatever in the funds?"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2359.589,2366.977,That would depend on the terms of ERISA.
1982.81-1891,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2366.977,2367.962,Terms of what?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2367.962,2370.805,The Employee Retirement--
1982.81-1891,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2370.805,2380.439,"Well, under the terms, whatever are applicable, would this employee, had he walked away rather than died--"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2380.439,2381.752,--No.
1982.81-1891,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2389.67,2391.733,--Are they only insurance benefits?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2391.733,2395.872,"Well, the insurance benefits, of course, are applicable immediately."
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2516.401,2517.807,You say he gets them.
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2519.961,2523.179,"That is, of course, this case."
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2529.786,2531.457,His widow.
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2531.457,2554.698,"--The widow and her two sons as the Court of Appeals put it, he would get a total addition of $27 a week, 68 cents and hour, constituting approximately 9 % increase, 9-1/2 % increase in his wages."
1982.81-1891,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2653.752,2662.577,"With these men, Mr. Leonard, when they calculate the social security, what is included for--"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2662.577,2668.698,Social security is offset by the benefits you receive from workmen's compensation.
1982.81-1891,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2668.698,2678.615,"--When they send every month or every three months, at some period the employer must send something in and the employee has a deduction, does he not?"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2683.255,2684.615,That I do not know.
1982.81-1891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2724.552,2728.456,"Mr. Leonard, there really isn't any dispute about the fact that the fringe benefits are benefits."
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2743.824,2757.553,"If these are recompense, and I believe they are, what we are talking about today is an entirely different labor picture than we had more than half a century ago when this case... when this was first passed."
1982.81-1891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.553,2760.208,I wonder if you heard my question.
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2760.208,2765.786,"I heard your question and your question is does it apply to disability and I said, yes."
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2897.668,2901.136,"Mr. Leonard, is that true of the training fund too?"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2902.668,2902.98,No.
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2903.853,2909.009,"--I would think if an employee gets restraining he doesn't then realize income, does he?"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2909.009,2914.381,This happens to be one case in which I going to join with the Petitioners.
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2960.237,2964.016,"So, you don't think the training fund payment should be included in the wage?"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2964.016,2975.637,"Yes, I think it definitely should be included in wages, because the question we have here on wages is really a very simply one."
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3062.462,3069.521,You say these are more attractive to the employer than straight wage raises because the employer doesn't have to pay tax?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3075.753,3082.672,I believe we... We come... Let me put that... Let me answer that this way if I may.
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3113.941,3119.687,Why is that more attractive to the employer than paying $10 in wages?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3119.687,3122.373,Because the union asked them to.
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3131.323,3133.042,It is a matter of no consequence--
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3133.042,3135.369,It is a matter of no consequence to the union.
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3137.461,3140.601,"--Well, if it is of no consequence to the union, why do they ask for it?"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3143.101,3150.614,"Well, I suppose that the answer is that they probably read the decisions of this Court to the effect that unions are supposed to represent their workers."
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3150.614,3153.191,You are suggesting that the workers want it?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3153.191,3154.253,What?
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3154.253,3157.47,You are suggesting that really the workers prefer the 7-3 cafeteria--
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3157.47,3163.06,The workers get tax deferment for all of the benefits that apply to the wages.
1982.81-1891,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3163.06,3164.42,--And the employer deducts it?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3164.42,3165.326,What?
1982.81-1891,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.326,3166.606,And the employer deducts it?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3166.606,3169.122,The employer deducts it immediately as part of his payroll.
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3196.079,3202.31,"Of course, Congress recognized that in the case of the Davis-Bacon Act and amended the statute accordingly."
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3202.31,3214.024,"Davis-Bacon, Federal Employees, Miller Act, National Labor Relations Act, the Social Security Act, ERISA, the LMRA and the tax... Internal Revenue."
1982.81-1891,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3214.024,3216.461,"Well, why do you recite all those seriatim?"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3216.461,3222.115,Because I can take each one as being tied in to workmen's compensation directly.
1982.81-1891,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3245.2,3248.105,Does it say that in this Act?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3248.105,3254.774,I don't have quotations marks around it so I cannot say that is so.
1982.81-1891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3254.774,3261.318,"But, isn't it true that that is for a rather different purpose to be sure that the total compensation package meets the local area standard for--"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3261.318,3265.411,"I know that... I am sorry, I--"
1982.81-1891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3265.411,3269.736,--Isn't the purpose of the Davis-Bacon Act quite different?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3279.609,3288.4,--Are you suggesting that they would pay a higher compensation on the basis of... for a laborer on a public building than one on another building?
1982.81-1891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3291.353,3294.383,"--The statute requires that they pay at least as high, wages at least as high as the prevailing--"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3294.383,3296.928,"Well, at least as high then would include the fringe benefits."
1982.81-1891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3296.928,3298.069,"--Correct, for that purpose."
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3298.069,3299.303,Correct.
1982.81-1891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3299.303,3300.099,Yes.
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3300.099,3310.766,"Now, I am clear that the employer payments to unions is part of the statutory language."
1982.81-1891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3394.562,3398.045,Was that in a dissenting opinion if I remember correctly?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3398.045,3398.357,What?
1982.81-1891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3398.357,3400.451,Are you talking about the Miller Act case?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3400.451,3401.685,That was the Miller Act case.
1982.81-1891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3401.685,3403.715,"And, wasn't I in dissent in that case?"
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3403.715,3404.543,It was what?
1982.81-1891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3404.543,3406.87,Wasn't I... Was I not in dissent in that case?
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3406.87,3408.323,I am not sure.
1982.81-1891,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3408.323,3409.275,I think I was.
1982.81-1891,2,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,3409.275,3414.976,Let me go back for a moment to Davis-Bacon as a matter of fact.
1982.81-1891,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3640.118,3640.477,"Thank you, gentlemen."
