2019.17-1712,0,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,0.0,1.84,On behalf of the Respondents 34
2019.17-1712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1.84,8.2,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 17-1712, Thole versus United States Bank. Mr. Stris."
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,8.2,14.52,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: My clients are beneficiaries of a pension trust."
2019.17-1712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,157.64,199.8,"Does your argument depend upon a forward-looking theory of injury? In other words, it's -- if -- it's one thing to have a -- a conflict of interest or all the other things you allege that lead to a situation that causes you no direct financial harm, but is your theory that, well, because they did that in this situation, and even if that didn't hurt us, somebody like that is likely to do it again and that might hurt us? Or is it purely the fact of -- retrospective, this person did something that under common trust law would be regarded as a bad thing, and under the no inquiry rule, that's enough, so you shouldn't worry about the fact that it didn't harm us at all?"
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,199.8,204.12,So the answer to that question is we have multiple concrete injuries here.
2019.17-1712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,226.4,232.8,"But what did your clients lose? I mean, your friend on the other side says they get nothing."
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,236.64,238.76,"Well, so I mean I -- I couldn't disagree with that more."
2019.17-1712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,246.04,247.76,"Well, those are other situations."
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,271.28,276.88,"Well, if -- if the assets of the trust are -- are lost and there's been a breach, yes."
2019.17-1712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,302.44,324.68,"But I understood -- I meant my hypothetical to suppose that the -- your property is -- is secure, your -- your -- your client's property, the beneficiaries' property is completely secure. In the Gates hypothetical, I thought you were suggesting -- you seem to be suggesting the security that -- that protected the -- the interest of your -- your loan was -- was destroyed."
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,324.68,324.88,"Oh, but --"
2019.17-1712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,324.88,339.6,"But in my hypothetical -- it may not be your case -- but -- but in the abstract, what's alleged to have been wrongfully done doesn't affect the financial security of your defined-benefit plan. You can still sue --"
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,339.6,339.76,So --
2019.17-1712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,339.76,342.16,-- because the person's a bad guy?
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,342.16,342.32,No.
2019.17-1712,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,374.16,374.52,But would they --
2019.17-1712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,374.52,375.24,But what's the --
2019.17-1712,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,375.24,375.4,-- say --
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,375.4,376.36,-- cases.
2019.17-1712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,376.36,383.8,But what's the lesson from Article III? There has to be a tangible injury to the plaintiff.
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,396.88,407.4,"In the same way that if I own property and you come and you put your toe on it, even though I never saw you, you didn't step on my tulips, you didn't upset me in any way, you impaired my property right."
2019.17-1712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,407.4,420.48,"What if -- what if, counsel -- I mean, just to put the Chief's point in a -- in a finer light even than he has, which I think he has done an admirable job of, let's say this were a defined benefits plan rather than a defined contribution plan."
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,437.36,438.04,Sure.
2019.17-1712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,438.04,438.96,Would you -- could you still sue?
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,438.96,440.32,I don't think -- I don't think --
2019.17-1712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,440.32,445.96,"I mean, even in the law of trusts way back to the 15th century, there was a remoteness limitation --"
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,445.96,446.04,Well --
2019.17-1712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,446.04,447.44,"-- on how far someone could sue, wasn't there?"
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,447.44,452.08,"Well, so, Justice Gorsuch, I think there wouldn't be standing but it would have nothing to do with -- with remoteness."
2019.17-1712,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,477.36,477.44,Okay.
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,484.28,488.64,"Well, there are many limits, just to be clear about the modesty of our position."
2019.17-1712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,513.24,519.6,"If we do that -- I don't remember the 15th century, surprisingly, but, nonetheless -- (Laughter.)"
2019.17-1712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,519.6,521.32,We did look up some things.
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,587.32,592.04,"So a few responses, Justice Breyer. So loyalty is our second injury."
2019.17-1712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,596.0,598.72,"And there the remainderman could not sue, it says."
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,598.72,601.04,We're -- absolutely. We're not a remainderman.
2019.17-1712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,601.04,620.04,"Oh, you aren't? What is your interest in the money -- in the trust that is any greater since it's fully funded and everything and has many, many sources, that was greater than the remainderman's interest in the income that's being paid out of a body -- a corpus, which you will eventually get, which isn't hurt?"
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,620.04,628.68,"The answer is, we have an interest in a promise of future payments secured by the entirety of the trust corpus. And let me tell you about history."
2019.17-1712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,659.6,663.08,"Yes, that's -- you're talking about a contingent interest."
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,673.16,673.68,That's right.
2019.17-1712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,674.04,678.96,But he would receive not a contingent interest.
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,683.76,684.44,Where the --
2019.17-1712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,684.44,690.48,-- and -- and what -- it's hard to see a difference between that remainderman and the interest of a beneficiary.
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,690.48,691.64,Here's the difference.
2019.17-1712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,691.64,692.12,Go ahead.
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,692.12,700.72,The difference comes both from the plan document in this case and ERISA. Let's start with the plan document. It's pages 60 to 61 of the Joint Appendix. Here's what it says.
2019.17-1712,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,751.76,753.92,But you -- you have some strong arguments.
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,801.4,806.6,"So that -- that's a -- a -- a totally fair question, and let me answer it in the context of this case."
2019.17-1712,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,821.52,822.72,But you pled --
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,822.72,823.32,In answering the --
2019.17-1712,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,823.32,837.36,"You pled that, but compliance with Article III has to be reassessed at different stages of the -- of the proceeding. Is there any -- is the risk greater than the risk of being hit by a meteorite?"
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,837.36,840.56,"This is my core point, Justice Alito."
2019.17-1712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,863.44,863.84,"Well, that --"
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,863.84,864.2,Because of --
2019.17-1712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,864.2,864.84,"I'm sorry, go ahead."
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,864.84,878.08,"Because of that, the -- the -- Congress exercised their judgment to say we are going to confer a property interest in the entirety of the trust corpus so we don't have to do a case-by-case assessment."
2019.17-1712,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,878.56,890.48,"But Congress made clear that not only the plan but the employer and then the PBGC, which you haven't mentioned at all, is in play here."
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,899.56,901.52,"Well, I don't think -- that's a fair point."
2019.17-1712,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,904.72,907.52,"It does, but it's backed by the United States Government."
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,907.52,909.44,Not the full faith and credit of the government.
2019.17-1712,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,921.36,924.12,But they exceed the benefits of your clients in this case.
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,924.12,926.32,There -- there are two things going on here right now.
2019.17-1712,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,926.6,927.52,Is that -- MR. STRIS -- clear --
2019.17-1712,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,927.52,928.12,Is that yes?
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,928.12,937.44,"Yes, my two clients, yes. But there's two things going on here, Justice Kavanaugh, and it's really important to separate them out: What matters for standing and what -- why we care practically."
2019.17-1712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,991.96,1001.28,"Before you -- you finish, can you clarify the precise actions of the fiduciary that you are assailing in this case?"
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1001.28,1001.52,Yes.
2019.17-1712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1001.52,1012.32,First the district court said that to challenge to the 100 percent equity investment is off the table because it's time-barred.
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1014.8,1016.48,I -- I don't agree.
2019.17-1712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1016.48,1016.88,All right.
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1027.28,1032.08,"So here's what happened, Justice Ginsburg, and this is critical of the procedural posture. May I answer, Your Honor?"
2019.17-1712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1032.08,1032.72,Briefly.
2019.17-1712,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1032.72,1040.12,"I'll be -- I'll be brief. The -- the first claim, the equities, was dismissed on statute of limitations grounds prior to this Court's decision in Tibble."
2019.17-1712,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1059.44,1065.92,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Joshi."
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1065.92,1090.64,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: When a trustee breaches his fiduciary duties and causes losses to the trust, real money losses, the beneficiary always has been able to sue the trustee for the breach of trust. It's been the law for hundreds of years of trust law and it's expressly in ERISA's text as well. And that rule makes really good sense. The beneficiaries are the ones who are getting paid out of the trust."
2019.17-1712,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1138.84,1144.72,Let me propose a hypothetical then about the defined contribution plans.
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1172.52,1208.04,"I -- I think that might follow, and I think it might -- I -- I -- I do think it might and I think that comes from not only our -- our -- you know, the positions we've laid out in the case in trust law and the undifferentiated assets but also from this Court's decision in LaRue. In LaRue, of course, this Court held that the plaintiff, who was suing over harms to his own account, nevertheless could maintain a suit under 502(a)(2) for harm to the entire trust because the trust included the account, the account was part of the trust. So I think on that theory, then, if you just extend it, that would have to be the logic."
2019.17-1712,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1209.44,1210.68,Everybody could sue for everything.
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1210.68,1222.24,"-- I want to hasten to add that, as a practical matter, these cases, especially in the posture you just mentioned, are -- are going to arise in the class context, and I think it would be perfectly reasonable for a court to look at that and --"
2019.17-1712,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1222.24,1240.4,"What about -- what about Justice Alito's meteor, the likelihood of getting a discretionary benefit from the trustee might be less than the chance of being hit by a meteor? Would Article III have something to say there? Or are you saying -- suggesting now, everybody can sue for everything anyway?"
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1240.4,1270.28,"So, historically, trust law has allowed the beneficiary to sue the trustee, a discretionary beneficiary to do so. And one might imagine when you sue the trustee, he's probably not likely to exercise his discretion in your favor; but, nevertheless, you were allowed to sue. What Article III has to say about it -- and -- and I know there's a lot of doctrine around Article III, but I think the key point, and -- and Spokeo reiterated it and 50 years of case law has reiterated it, it comes from the words ""cases and controversies"" in the text of the Constitution."
2019.17-1712,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1278.48,1279.32,But isn't that --
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1279.32,1279.68,-- time of the founding.
2019.17-1712,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1279.68,1280.28,-- the -- I'm sorry.
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1314.48,1321.48,"Yeah, I -- I -- I think the answer really is the history, but to the extent, you know, there's a chance, I guess I have two answers to that."
2019.17-1712,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1382.24,1393.96,"What is -- what is the role -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but the PBGC, how should we think about that, if we get away from the history at all, its role and how it guarantees a back stop?"
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1393.96,1395.24,I -- I don't think it matters at all.
2019.17-1712,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1400.92,1401.16,It's the --
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1401.16,1401.76,-- they've caused.
2019.17-1712,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1401.76,1406.44,It's the combination of the plan plus the employer plus the PBGC would all have to --
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1406.44,1414.24,"You -- the fact that there may be many layers of insurance, if you will, doesn't change the fact that when a trustee breaches his fiduciary duties, you can sue."
2019.17-1712,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1414.6,1435.28,And how -- how far with you push the analogy to trust law in this? Since -- it -- was there a trust where the settlor of the trust had an obligation to step in and increase the amount of money in the trust in order to -- to ensure that beneficiaries would be paid?
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1435.28,1437.2,Not -- not to my knowledge.
2019.17-1712,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1437.36,1441.68,"I mean, that's the big difference between the situation here and trust law, right?"
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1441.68,1443.76,I -- I don't think it's different.
2019.17-1712,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1501.2,1501.52,All right.
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1503.8,1504.08,Yeah.
2019.17-1712,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1504.32,1504.8,All right.
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1541.8,1545.04,"Well, I -- I'm not certain what context you're talking about."
2019.17-1712,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1545.04,1553.04,"I'm just saying the standing thing might be one of the things that prevents that because -- I mean, I -- and you can say, well, they have to have a good case, dah-dah-dah."
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1562.84,1566.0,"If you have suffered an injury of a peppercorn, you have standing to sue."
2019.17-1712,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1567.0,1567.44,But that's --
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1567.44,1568.24,But the other thing is that --
2019.17-1712,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1568.24,1572.04,"-- of course, I want to say, okay, your answer is nothing protects in the law."
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1572.04,1581.24,"Well, again, it -- it's hard to answer that question in the abstract. What I do know is that, in this particular context, there are trust duties that are set forth in the law --"
2019.17-1712,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1581.24,1581.28,I know --
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1581.28,1581.44,-- of trust --
2019.17-1712,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1581.44,1591.04,"-- there's some, but this is a duty of prudence, which means you made a bad investment that -- and you do make bad investments and you say, well, the trustees say dah-dah-dah."
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1608.48,1608.8,Well --
2019.17-1712,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1608.8,1609.4,Aren't you saying --
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1609.4,1609.76,What I'm --
2019.17-1712,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1609.76,1613.92,"I'm sorry, aren't you saying the deference afforded to the plan administrators on the merits is --"
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1613.92,1614.28,That -- that's --
2019.17-1712,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1614.28,1615.4,That's one.
2019.17-1712,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1615.4,1616.24,If properly applied?
2019.17-1712,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1616.24,1616.68,That's one.
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1616.68,1617.76,That's exactly right.
2019.17-1712,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1622.04,1622.16,Yeah.
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1622.16,1626.88,"-- and the fiduciary rules in 404 and 406, Congress did not make these --"
2019.17-1712,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1626.88,1627.72,"Okay, all on the merits --"
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1627.72,1627.88,-- to be exclusive. They --
2019.17-1712,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1627.88,1628.64,I -- I -- I --
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1628.64,1629.8,-- they all apply at all times.
2019.17-1712,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1630.08,1630.64,-- I see.
2019.17-1712,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1630.64,1646.88,"I'm not sure you're giving adequate weight to the -- when you're looking at the history, the significance of Article III to our role in the separation of powers. The requirement to decide an actual case or controversy is the only thing that gives us authority to do what we do."
2019.17-1712,2,63131,sopan_joshi,,1657.6,1663.6,"That may be right, but as I said, the Magruder case and many others that we've cited in the briefs do recognize this principle of trust law."
2019.17-1712,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1688.92,1695.6,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Palmore."
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1695.6,1702.76,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is no ERISA exception to Article III."
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1887.56,1900.96,Can you imagine a -- a situation in which a participant in a defined-benefit plan would have standing? And can you describe the particular line that would separate that from this case?
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1900.96,1901.52,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1911.68,1914.84,And how would they show that? How would they show that?
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1914.84,1918.52,"Well, they could show, A, I'm not getting paid what I was promised."
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1918.52,1918.84,Okay.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1921.48,1921.64,Right.
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1921.64,1925.56,-- how would they show what are the particulars that you think would be necessary?
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1925.56,1930.4,"Well, I think -- you know, I don't think -- first of all, I would just preface my remarks by saying I don't think this case calls for --"
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1930.4,1930.96,I understand that.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1930.96,1942.76,-- the Court to opine on that because they've said that there's no risk at all that's required. But I think this Court -- I think it would be simple factual application of Clapper where the Court talked about imminent risk or a substantial risk.
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1942.76,1942.96,Right.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1945.32,1945.52,"Well, I think --"
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1945.52,1945.8,-- to assess --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1945.8,1960.08,"-- and I think those terms are flexible enough to take into account the long-term time horizon of a pension plan. So I don't think you'd have to show that the plan was going to fail tomorrow, but I think it's not -- wouldn't be enough to show that the plan was simply underfunded."
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1961.92,1964.2,"Well, let me pause there."
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1969.6,1971.12,"Well, I think you have to look --"
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1971.12,1971.96,-- and underfunded.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1981.76,1996.28,"Well, I think you would have to plead not only was the plan at risk but that the employer either could not or would not fulfill its legal obligation to make up any deficit in the plan. So the Fifth Circuit's case in Lee versus Verizon is instructive here."
2019.17-1712,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2017.08,2017.88,"Well, we've had --"
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2017.88,2019.48,-- make good on their payments.
2019.17-1712,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2019.48,2052.04,"In the not too far off past, there have been situations where people were surprised of some of the companies that turned out not to have enough money to go forward. And it -- let's say that the -- a person running the trust or the, you know, running the company loses $100 million in the first month and 100 in the second and 100 in the third, and although there is no significant harm to the beneficiaries in the terms that you've discussed it, they look and say: Well, this guy is going to continue to lose a lot of money and can you -- can they bring a suit in that case?"
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2052.04,2065.44,"If they could show he's going to continue to lose a lot of money and it will result in an impairment of their only interest, which is the stream of payments from the pension plan, then yes, they can bring a suit and they can get an injunction to have him removed."
2019.17-1712,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2065.44,2066.4,"So, I've --"
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2066.4,2066.48,"Here, they've --"
2019.17-1712,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2066.48,2066.56,I've --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2066.56,2069.48,-- never -- they've never established that or claimed that here.
2019.17-1712,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2069.48,2069.88,I'm sorry.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2215.0,2218.92,"Your Honor, first of all, they don't have a property interest for the reasons I stated --"
2019.17-1712,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2218.92,2219.12,"So, why?"
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2219.12,2222.36,"-- and as the reasons this Court stated in Hughes Aircraft, they don't have a property interest."
2019.17-1712,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2222.36,2225.52,Let's remember the following in Hughes.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2233.92,2234.8,And the reason --
2019.17-1712,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2234.8,2235.0,But here --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2235.0,2235.24,Yes.
2019.17-1712,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2235.24,2240.4,-- they're not asking for a distribution to themselves of a surplus.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2244.44,2245.12,Right.
2019.17-1712,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2327.52,2346.6,"Counsel, on that, what if Congress had in its statute -- I know you would disagree that it did this -- what if it had said that every beneficiary has a property interest or a private right to a completely clean trustee."
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2348.6,2350.96,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2019.17-1712,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2364.4,2366.04,This isn't creating a cause of action.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2373.08,2373.24,Yeah.
2019.17-1712,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2373.24,2379.4,"-- but we think it's important, because whatever -- whatever good policy reasons, some of which we have heard articulated here."
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2379.4,2381.72,"Well, I think this Court would look to the substance of it."
2019.17-1712,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2416.2,2425.92,"Mr. Palmore, regardless of whether it's zero or 50, if I understand your argument, you are acknowledging that if they have an equitable interest, then they have standing; is that correct?"
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2425.92,2427.68,If they had a property interest in --
2019.17-1712,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2427.68,2428.16,An equitable interest --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2428.16,2428.8,-- the trust corpus --
2019.17-1712,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2428.8,2429.76,-- in the trust corpus.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2429.76,2437.2,"An equitable -- an equitable property interest, then, yes, a -- a loss of a dollar from the trust corpus is loss of a dollar to them, but they don't."
2019.17-1712,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2438.0,2440.52,So -- but that's what everything depends on in your view.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2456.68,2461.12,"And I don't want to quibble over terminology, but I would say an equitable property interest, if -- if they did --"
2019.17-1712,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2461.12,2461.44,That's what I --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2461.44,2461.92,-- in the real.
2019.17-1712,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2462.52,2463.56,We're not talking about --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2463.56,2465.24,"-- then perhaps, but they didn't."
2019.17-1712,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2471.76,2472.48,And where do you --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2472.48,2473.0,-- what they are entitled --
2019.17-1712,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2473.0,2479.76,"-- get that from? What does that mean, that the plan has the equitable interest? I mean, the plan is the thing that there's an interest in, isn't there?"
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2479.76,2480.52,"No, Your Honor."
2019.17-1712,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2550.76,2554.84,Do you think that -- I didn't quite understand your answer.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2564.12,2566.48,"No, Your Honor, I didn't -- didn't mean to suggest that."
2019.17-1712,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2572.92,2575.16,What does that mean for it to be substantively a property interest?
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2575.16,2580.92,"I think if their benefits were tried to the value of the trust corpus, then they would have standing."
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2595.04,2595.48,It's a little --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2595.48,2595.92,-- didn't have standing.
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2595.92,2596.04,-- different though.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2651.44,2655.36,"Well, Your Honor, first just to put a footnote on it, I disagree that the history is on their side."
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2655.36,2655.64,Right.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2655.64,2663.64,"But I think it is worth the candle because Article III requires it, right? So Article III and Iqbal and Twombly would require proper pleadings."
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2664.48,2665.76,I obviously agree with that --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2665.76,2665.84,Yeah.
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2665.84,2670.48,"-- but you've been referring to these old cases, which kind of said you're out."
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2695.44,2704.04,"Yeah, I think if it -- if it was significantly underfunded and the company was struggling or was distressed and didn't have adequate assets --"
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2704.04,2706.48,"That's just going to be a whole mess, isn't it?"
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2706.48,2708.08,But that's required in order to show --
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2708.08,2708.2,Okay.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2708.2,2709.04,-- that you have a injury.
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2719.44,2719.64,Right.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2719.64,2726.32,"-- surveilled. Here pension plans file annual reports with the Department of Labor, that's the Form 5500."
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2738.88,2739.44,But -- but --
2019.17-1712,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2739.44,2745.64,"There's a standard -- Article III, there's a lot of case law about what standard the injury has to satisfy."
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2760.24,2771.56,"No, that's absolutely right, so I think it really would be a fact-bound application of -- of -- of Clapper, of the imminent harm standard in Clapper or the substantial risk standard in Clapper, which -- which the Court talked about, but what's --"
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2771.56,2775.24,"But, but -- sorry to prolong it, but it's bothering me."
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2790.12,2791.64,That wouldn't be enough.
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2791.64,2792.32,Okay.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2793.84,2797.8,"I think -- and this, again, would be the Fifth Circuit's decision in Lee, which I would commend to the Court."
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2797.8,2801.2,"So you agree with -- I just want to make sure, you agree with the Fifth Circuit's formulation?"
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2801.2,2801.88,We do.
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2816.96,2817.48,That's -- that's --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2817.48,2818.64,-- to remedy the problem.
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2818.64,2823.6,-- that's in a -- I agree with the Chief Justice that I've seen numerous cases.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2860.52,2862.0,I respectfully disagree with that but let's --
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2862.0,2862.36,All right.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2862.36,2862.8,-- continue.
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2862.8,2863.44,I want to know that.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2863.44,2863.72,Okay.
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2863.72,2870.0,But the other is this: There are exceptions to this harm business quantitatively.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2916.48,2917.04,"No, Your Honor."
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2917.04,2918.12,So I am interested in both of those.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2918.12,2918.4,Sure.
2019.17-1712,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2937.12,2945.0,"At the very least, though, Mr. Palmore, that suggests who Congress thought the fiduciary obligations ran to."
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2975.72,2980.56,"Your Honor, I -- I read this Court's decision in Russell to -- to be -- say exactly the opposite."
2019.17-1712,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2994.4,2994.96,But even Russell --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2994.96,2995.56,-- beneficiaries.
2019.17-1712,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2995.56,3010.48,"-- said that beneficiaries have a stake in the financial integrity of the plan and then you have Harris Trust, which says that ERISA gives a fiduciary -- it makes clear that the fiduciary duty goes to the beneficiaries."
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3010.48,3032.8,"Your Honor, what this Court said -- has -- has said in subsequent cases after Russell was that there are -- there are other kinds of fiduciary duties which may run directly to a beneficiary, so, for instance, the right to receive truthful information, but the Court reiterated in verity that the -- that the fiduciary duty with respect to plan asset management runs to the trust. But even if you don't --"
2019.17-1712,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3032.8,3043.36,"I mean, isn't that a fairly odd thing to say the that fiduciary obligations runs to an abstract plan rather than the beneficiaries and the participants who are supposed to benefit from it?"
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3043.36,3060.48,"No, Your Honor, because ERISA was an innovation in that it created the plan as an actual legal entity with -- and a heavily regulated one, at trust -- at common law, the trust itself wasn't the legal entity. It was just a series of relationships between individuals. So -- so ERISA was an innovation."
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3112.2,3124.92,"But if you don't -- if you don't have to assess injury to the trust where there is no injury to the trust, how could there be any injury to a beneficiary of the trust?"
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3124.92,3129.88,"Because there was presumed under the no further inquiry rule, there was presumed injury to the trust."
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3129.88,3134.8,It means sometimes you presume that there is injury to the trust --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3134.8,3135.08,Yes.
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3135.08,3137.8,"-- when there isn't. All right, focus on those."
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3137.8,3138.28,Correct.
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3138.28,3142.08,"In that set of cases, there is no injury to the trust."
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3145.96,3148.08,I would -- I would change your wording slightly.
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3150.64,3150.8,Well -- I know --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3150.8,3152.04,There is a conclusive --
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3152.04,3152.92,-- we're saying the same thing.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3152.92,3153.76,-- presumption of harm --
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3153.76,3154.2,On the duty of --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3154.2,3155.12,-- to the trust.
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3155.12,3156.52,On the duty of loyalty --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3156.52,3156.76,Yes.
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3156.76,3159.04,-- there is a presumed injury to the beneficiary.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3159.04,3160.04,To the -- to the trust.
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3160.04,3160.72,"Oh, there's a --"
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3160.72,3161.44,To the trust.
2019.17-1712,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3171.8,3172.36,I see your point.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3172.36,3197.76,"-- and that that interest was fully protected, that plaintiff couldn't sue, right? So there -- it's critical to keep those two separate questions in mind, how is harm established, is it either proved or conclusively presumed under the ""no further inquiry"" rule but there was always the second question, and this is Bogert 871, restatement 214, comment B, there was always a second question of who can sue to remedy that harm to the trust."
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3204.76,3208.44,Can I go back to the particulars of your theory of what would be sufficient?
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3208.44,3208.68,Yes.
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3208.68,3218.28,"You said if the plan -- if you allege that the plan is underfunded and you allege that the employer is unwilling or unable to meet the obligations, I think you said."
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3218.28,3218.72,Yes.
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3218.72,3222.28,Let's put aside unwilling for a second.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3229.16,3248.24,"I think you would have to look at their -- you know, their publicly disclosed financial information and show that they -- that this was a seriously underfunded plan and that this was a distressed company and it was going to be unable to -- to put in adequate money or unable to comply with the minimum funding requirements that ERISA places --"
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3248.24,3248.8,And if that's --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3248.8,3249.28,-- on them.

2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3259.6,3266.64,"Well, I don't -- I mean, I think if it's -- if it's alleged with sufficient particularity, then -- then they've properly alleged standing and then there would be a factual question --"
2019.17-1712,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3266.64,3267.48,"Yeah, but then you would --"
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3267.48,3268.2,-- down the road.
2019.17-1712,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3268.2,3271.44,Then it's a question of subject matter jurisdiction under Article III.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3286.48,3287.28,"Exactly right, Your Honor."
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3303.96,3305.4,That's what I was getting at.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3305.4,3307.2,"Because the plan was actually overfunded, right?"
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3307.2,3308.36,I think that's right.
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3317.04,3317.76,Exactly.
2019.17-1712,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3336.0,3337.8,And Mr. Palmore --
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3337.8,3338.0,Yes?
2019.17-1712,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3338.0,3355.56,"-- what do you do about the fact that these plans can be underfunded in January and overfunded in February and underfunded in March again? And what do you do about the fact that the health of even, you know, secure companies, if you're in 2008, all of a sudden it turns out they're not so secure after all."
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3355.56,3362.6,"Well, Your Honor, I think that's why the -- the -- I think if a plan is overfunded, I think that's sufficient to defeat standing."

2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3410.96,3411.36,Yeah.
2019.17-1712,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3433.16,3442.4,"Wouldn't -- wouldn't that theory, taken to its logical conclusion, mean that a participant could never sue, a defined-benefit participant or beneficiary could never sue?"
2019.17-1712,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3442.4,3446.84,"No, Your Honor, because the PBGC guarantees benefits only up to a certain level."
