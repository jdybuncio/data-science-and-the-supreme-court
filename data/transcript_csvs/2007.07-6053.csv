2007.07-6053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.934,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-6053, Giles versus California."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,8.135,25.019,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Crawford this Court made clear that in order to determine the scope of the Confrontation Clause we look to the common law and particularly as it existed at the time of the framing."
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,93.429,100.518,"But he got... he got on the stand, and he said some very nasty things about her."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,122.526,128.258,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, the... her statement came in, in the prosecution's case-in-chief."
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,128.258,137.63,"But could it have come in as rebuttal of his testimony, the same testimony by the police?"
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,139.006,139.957,Yes.
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,139.957,141.205,--took her statement?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,160.996,170.662,"Well, the difference is that his statements about her went solely to his state of mind."
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,178.02,183.378,I would think that the difference is that his statements about her were subject to cross-examination.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,183.378,184.345,"Indeed, of course."
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,184.345,186.174,And her statements about him were not.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,186.174,186.579,Exactly.
2007.07-6053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,186.579,190.42,"But we are not... well, but we are talking about the door... the door opening here at trial."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,196.309,202.837,"He did indicate that he was going to present a claim of self-defense, and I believe he indicated that he was going to testify."
2007.07-6053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,202.837,210.118,"That tends to diminish somewhat, but not entirely, your, I think, quite proper response that this came in on direct not... not cross."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,210.118,214.926,"Well, Justice Kennedy, the fact that it was a self-defense claim is irrelevant."
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,239.823,255.442,"Maybe they would be wrong... maybe they would be wrong in another case, but we have this case, and Justice Scalia has suggested, I take it, that this testimony could not come in even by way of rebuttal."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,255.442,257.832,--Right.
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,257.832,259.848,Even by way of cross-examination.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,261.454,262.75,I do.
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,273.417,275.184,It may go to his credibility.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,290.647,306.389,"--Well, the injustice here, Justice Ginsburg, is that he doesn't have a... any meaningful opportunity to contest what the police officer says she said because he never had an opportunity to cross-examine her."
2007.07-6053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,306.389,308.654,"Well, of course... of course, that's true."
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.866,325.835,I'm not following you.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,337.83,339.534,Not to my knowledge.
2007.07-6053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,339.534,350.651,"But we are talking here about the definition or the contours of the equitable rule, the forfeiture rule, for confrontation."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,383.767,397.617,"It goes much further; and, indeed, the State has not cited one single case at common law or after that supports its view that this rule is proper."
2007.07-6053,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,397.617,404.052,"How much are we supposed to follow the common law, in your opinion, as it was in the 18th century or 12th century, or something?"
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,446.178,447.363,Yes.
2007.07-6053,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,447.363,449.972,"Now, let's get more realistic."
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,451.594,454.079,He is thinking about Cambridge and not England.
2007.07-6053,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,455.034,456.095,--Okay.
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,485.177,489.299,Do any of them have anything to do with the Confrontation Clause?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,489.299,490.379,No.
2007.07-6053,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,490.379,497.219,It doesn't have to do with the Confrontation Clause that you couldn't cross-examine person who didn't understand the meaning of the oath?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,497.219,508.025,"Justice Breyer, the Confrontation Clause sets forth a basic policy, which is that we are to have live testimony in court."
2007.07-6053,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,510.384,515.554,So what about a person who... the same facts that he could not... wasn't eligible to testify?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,526.816,529.671,"Well, in Crawford this Court said we do look to--"
2007.07-6053,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,529.671,530.158,All right.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,555.646,561.065,"--Well, that's sort of... that sounds like, say, the situation in Crawford that--"
2007.07-6053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,561.065,564.314,"Well, but I think what Justice Breyer is saying--"
2007.07-6053,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,564.314,565.425,I'm trying to drive at what the contours are.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,567.328,575.201,"--sets forth the proper contours, which is that any exception to the Confrontation Clause must be very, very narrow."
2007.07-6053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,580.306,591.992,"--But I think what Justice Breyer's line of questioning points out is that there were other provisions of the evidence rule followed in England which would not allow the testimony to come in, in the first place."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,615.826,617.215,"Well, Your Honor--"
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,617.215,626.85,"And besides which, the question that Justice Breyer was asking was already answered in Crawford; wasn't it?"
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,626.85,627.929,"--Yes, it was."
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.929,629.411,A case from which he dissented.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,636.693,637.956,That is right.
2007.07-6053,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,637.956,639.189,--I don't think I did--
2007.07-6053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,639.189,642.986,There was a dying declaration rule at the common law; wasn't there?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,642.986,644.999,"Yes, there was."
2007.07-6053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,644.999,654.092,"Well, that didn't require any inquiry into the intent of the person responsible for the death, or the imminent death, right?"
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,654.092,655.028,That's correct.
2007.07-6053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,672.334,679.08,"Well, if the dying declaration rule didn't require intent, why should yours?"
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,679.08,692.261,"--Because the forfeiture rule at... which is a separate... entirely a separate rule of common law, did require intent to prevent testimony."
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.856,701.978,"Instead of intent, the dying declaration rule required knowledge by the declarant that the declarant was about to die."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,701.978,702.493,--Correct.
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,702.493,702.961,Right?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,702.961,704.166,That's right.
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.166,712.315,And the evidence of truthfulness was apparently that the person was about to enter the next world.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,712.315,712.939,That's right.
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,712.939,715.922,And most of us don't lie at that particular moment.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,721.156,721.955,Correct.
2007.07-6053,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,721.955,729.481,"--I joined Crawford, and Justice Scalia would like to kick me off the boat, which I'm rapidly leaving in any event, but the...--"
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.027,733.01,"You jumped off in Crawford, I thought."
2007.07-6053,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,733.01,733.463,Right.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,757.44,758.688,"Yes, as a spouse."
2007.07-6053,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,758.688,760.186,"Yes, as a spouse."
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,772.248,778.713,I think your answer was that in Crawford that was the situation.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,780.273,781.084,I'm sorry?
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,781.084,781.759,In Crawford.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,781.759,783.163,In Crawford it was a spouse.
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,783.163,786.52,And it was the defendant who said he didn't want her to testify.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,786.52,787.085,That's right.
2007.07-6053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,787.085,795.016,"Under the... the testimony of someone who heard her say something, was that admissible?"
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,795.016,797.828,Under... under Crawford?
2007.07-6053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,797.828,798.643,No.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,799.641,801.797,I don't think it was.
2007.07-6053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,808.747,810.638,Like in the case of an unavailable witness?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,810.638,811.23,Of course.
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,818.04,821.397,There are some things that are not just testimonial.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,845.059,850.308,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, it depends on whether it was deemed to be testimonial or not."
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,850.308,851.4,"Well, is it?"
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,853.01,854.539,It's not an issue in our case.
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,869.423,875.377,--So what's the line between what... I understand that she is accusing him to a police officer.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,875.377,875.907,--Yes.
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,875.907,877.873,So you say that's testimonial.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,877.873,879.171,The courts--
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,879.171,884.795,If she is talking to a friend and saying that she is scared to death of this man--
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,884.795,886.245,--That is--
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,886.245,887.809,--the friend could testify?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,887.809,890.025,--That's perhaps nontestimonial.
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,890.025,891.416,Why?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,891.416,894.462,Well--
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,894.462,896.209,What's the difference?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,905.864,911.97,"--Well, the Court hasn't fully described all of the parameters of ""testimonial""."
2007.07-6053,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,917.156,921.902,Could I ask you whether there is really anything involved in this case?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,938.273,941.287,"Well, no, not necessarily."
2007.07-6053,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,969.165,969.461,No.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,976.507,976.897,--No.
2007.07-6053,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,976.897,977.459,--No?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,977.459,978.52,No.
2007.07-6053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,978.52,984.989,How do we know in this case that part of his intent was not to prevent her from testifying at trial?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,994.094,1002.716,There was a specific finding of fact by the court of appeals that he did not intend to kill her... he did not kill her to prevent testimony.
2007.07-6053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1002.716,1005.305,How are we ever going to know that in a typical case?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1005.305,1009.384,"Well, by, you know, analyzing the evidence."
2007.07-6053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1012.086,1015.475,"Well, take a case like this, I don't understand how that finding could have been made."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1026.597,1038.544,"Well, that... I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that doesn't make an awful lot of sense because that indicates that he killed her in order to prevent her from--"
2007.07-6053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1038.544,1039.652,"No, I'm sorry it doesn't."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1057.192,1063.736,"--Well, first of all, the court of appeals specifically found that he did not kill her to prevent testimony."
2007.07-6053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1068.158,1069.203,"I understand that, and you've said--"
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1069.203,1070.642,--and the State never challenged it.
2007.07-6053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1070.642,1071.188,"--Excuse me, Counsel."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1088.025,1099.595,"Well, the courts have been... Federal and State courts have been making that factual finding for... for decades under the Federal rule, and under the Carlson line of cases."
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1099.595,1107.578,But the... here it's his own murder trial.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1119.276,1120.087,Correct.
2007.07-6053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1120.087,1133.848,But he might have murdered her because she had good grounds to get him indicted on criminal assault charges.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1141.597,1144.954,"Well, that's highly speculative."
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.544,1169.444,I had thought that the common law rule is that you have to have rendered the... intentionally rendered the witness unavailable with regard to the particular trial that's before the court.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1173.317,1174.534,That was--
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.534,1177.859,Do you know of any case where it was some other litigation that--
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1177.859,1178.28,--No.
2007.07-6053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1178.28,1178.939,--I didn't think so.

2007.07-6053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1180.296,1196.854,"Let's... let's assume that the only case on the books pre-1789 was Morley, in which the defendant did specifically intend to keep the witness away from the trial."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1233.181,1246.175,"Well, the hypothetical assumes something which is... which Your Honor admits is... is simply not the case."
2007.07-6053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1248.191,1250.644,Please... please make the supposition.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1250.644,1259.155,"--that it was there, I suppose the Court could... could rule on the basis of that, but that it's definitely not the case and has never been the case."
2007.07-6053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1259.155,1259.545,All right.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1266.635,1283.645,"Well, I... I think the English authorities do foreclose it, because the dying declaration cases, and there are dozens of them, would not have come out as they did if this expansive forfeiture rule had existed."
2007.07-6053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1285.833,1294.33,I... I find that difficult to understand because the dying declaration rule came up in many instances when the confrontation rule was not involved at all.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1294.33,1295.11,That's right.
2007.07-6053,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1339.935,1342.524,"Your dying declaration cases are not just murders, though."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1342.524,1343.916,--They are just murders.
2007.07-6053,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1343.916,1344.602,Pardon me?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1344.602,1345.931,"They are just murders, Your Honor."
2007.07-6053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1345.931,1347.834,Really?
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1350.599,1357.973,The ones we cite are murders and they are murder cases in criminal cases.
2007.07-6053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1357.973,1361.705,"Well, but I... I agree... I'll check the,... check--"
2007.07-6053,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.705,1366.767,But the rationale for the dying declaration rule has nothing to do with who caused the death.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1366.767,1377.292,"Well, you know, it specifically goes to... the element of the dying declaration is that the statement has to relate to the specific cause of the death."
2007.07-6053,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1378.809,1382.183,"But it has to be imminent, too."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1382.183,1385.587,"Well, the death doesn't have to be imminent specifically."
2007.07-6053,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1385.587,1386.164,He has to think it's imminent.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1386.164,1389.302,But the perception is... the declarant has to believe--
2007.07-6053,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1389.302,1397.783,"But that's an entirely different rationale from the issue we have here, because it applies across the board to civil cases and all sorts of litigation."
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1397.783,1422.854,"--It applies powerfully in many, many instances to criminal cases; and that fact... and that has existed for... for centuries... shows that there was no general rule that all, you know, needed to do was to be accused of murdering the victim; because otherwise if California rule had existed, there would be no need to make this other showing in the dying declaration cases."
2007.07-6053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1443.876,1449.296,--But the forfeiture rule is designed to suspend the operation of the confrontation rule.
2007.07-6053,0,35450,marilyn_g_burkhardt,,1455.263,1457.072,"Well, not under the common law."
2007.07-6053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1528.121,1529.185,"Thank you, Ms. Burkhardt."
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,1535.698,1556.673,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I want to start off by correcting, I think, the impression that the common law ever stated a rule that intent to tamper was a prerequisite for keeping out the evidence of a... of a victim of a murderer."
2007.07-6053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.203,1575.586,"Well, it didn't put it in those very words, but I think a lot of... of the quotations from opinions cited by your friend seemed to me to say that."
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,1643.843,1656.68,"Well, I think, as Justice Kennedy's question suggested, that there are different elements to... that need to be surpassed before the dying declaration would come in."
2007.07-6053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.834,1700.83,I'm not sure you've answered my question.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,1723.369,1724.758,It wouldn't--
2007.07-6053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1724.758,1727.413,Nobody even ever makes those arguments.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,1740.812,1766.194,"--No, because under the rule I'm arguing for, and why the prosecutor wouldn't have succeeded in making that argument, the rule I'm arguing for is simply that in the situation where the defendant kills the witness the common law did not recognize, or there is no strong case authority that would indicate that the common law would recognize, a confrontation right with respect to that defendant against his witness's statement."
2007.07-6053,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1805.926,1812.61,I understand the distinction you're drawing at the present time or at least since the Bill of Rights was adopted.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,1818.701,1819.329,Yes.
2007.07-6053,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1819.329,1828.996,"But with respect to the common law as it stood at the time that the Bill of Rights was adopted, there wasn't such a distinction; was there?"
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,1840.149,1841.335,"I think that's right, Your Honor."
2007.07-6053,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1841.335,1847.471,"And if that is the case, then it seems to me you haven't answered Justice Scalia's question."
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,1881.05,1886.532,"Well, let me... let me take a different tack."
2007.07-6053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1921.285,1923.625,If it was... if it was testimony.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,1928.655,1929.014,Yes.
2007.07-6053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1929.014,1933.826,"There are also declarations that are testimonial, in which case we look to the confrontation concept."
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,1933.826,1956.158,"Yes, but I think... but I think, with respect to testimonial statements, it... I think it gives you an insight into what the common law would have done with respect to the alleged confrontation rights of the murderer against the victim to know that when the defendant murdered the victim, the victim's dying declaration came in without regard to confrontation."
2007.07-6053,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1973.558,1983.116,"I would suppose that there are a lot, a lot of situations in which a dead victim has made statements pertinent to the murder."
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2001.252,2009.324,"Well, I think it would... it... I think it would, it would apply in murder cases with respect to the statements of the victim."
2007.07-6053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2016.776,2022.228,"But to the extent that Crawford is confined simply to testimonial statements, any number of statements--"
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2022.228,2022.649,--Right.
2007.07-6053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2022.649,2030.05,--that will come in under the California evidence rule are simply not controlled by the Confrontation Clause anyway.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2031.909,2032.549,Yes.
2007.07-6053,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2063.71,2076.735,"Does that mean, what you just said, that this is not a problem in States that have adopted the Federal Rules of Evidence?"
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2125.058,2125.498,--Yes.
2007.07-6053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.757,2141.88,Doesn't it have to be interpreted that way?
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2145.616,2154.907,"Well, I don't know exactly whether the Federal rule has uniformly been... been interpreted to require a specific intent."
2007.07-6053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2154.907,2156.967,"Just because it says so, I mean."
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2156.967,2168.619,"Well, there is... I don't think... for example, I don't think there is a Federal case that's been cited where the forfeiture has been denied in a situation where the defendant murdered the witness."
2007.07-6053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.619,2193.298,"Can you give us one case from the common law, just one, in which the procurement of a witness's absence exception to the Confrontation Clause was applied where there was no intent to prevent the witness from testifying?"
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2193.298,2197.545,I don't... I don't think I have the case--
2007.07-6053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2197.545,2198.937,I don't think you do either.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2198.937,2201.795,--that... that applied the rule.
2007.07-6053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2209.041,2215.554,"The reason, I think, is... I think, if I understand Justice Scalia's question, take ordinary hearsay?"
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2215.554,2216.022,Yes.
2007.07-6053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2216.022,2217.164,Okay.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2286.743,2303.378,"Well, I think that... I think that we can certainly take account, for example, of situations that the common law might not have faced or might not have recognized as representing a problem of relevant evidence to a crime."
2007.07-6053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2303.378,2308.113,You wouldn't want us to get caught up in the limitations of the Confrontation Clause?
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2308.113,2310.25,"No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
2007.07-6053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2334.411,2336.114,Do you see what my question was?
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2369.989,2412.678,"Well, again, I think... I think the resort to the... to the maxim and the equitable principles that we know that common law subscribed to and that common law subscribed to those principles in this precise... as a rule to decide how to resolve this particular kind of issue where the defendant's wrongdoing makes the witness unavailable, that the... that because the common law accepted this maxim, that we can... we can look and apply those principles to the situation even though there might not have been the precise common-law case an all fours."
2007.07-6053,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2412.678,2420.457,Does the record show what happened after the police went and received the statements by Ms. Avie?
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2427.469,2428.966,"The record doesn't show, Your Honor."
2007.07-6053,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2430.233,2431.746,"As far as the record shows, nothing happened?"
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2433.263,2438.886,"Yes, yes, in terms of... because that was a description of the event that led to the admissibility of the statement."
2007.07-6053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2438.886,2444.633,Does the record show or did the trial indicate anything that he told the police on the prior occasion?
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2447.944,2448.35,No.
2007.07-6053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2493.55,2502.231,"Well, I think it's an astonishingly broad exception you're asking for."
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2518.834,2524.863,"Prior to trial, there was a discussion about what sort of defense he was going to be putting on, and he clearly indicated--"
2007.07-6053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2524.863,2525.893,California law requires that?
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2525.893,2526.395,--No.
2007.07-6053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2527.44,2528.189,Or it does not require it?
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2528.189,2528.985,--It doesn't require that.
2007.07-6053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2541.483,2541.904,All right.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2541.904,2547.933,And that's why the defendant's lawyer indicated that the client would be testifying and putting on... putting on a defense of self-defense.
2007.07-6053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2619.356,2623.057,Suppose the unavailability is caused by the defendant's negligence.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2625.962,2627.713,--I think if that were--
2007.07-6053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2627.713,2628.852,I mean over the declarant.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2628.852,2629.257,--Yes.
2007.07-6053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2634.21,2636.583,Suppose it's negligence.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2636.583,2637.8,--If it's mere negligence?
2007.07-6053,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.903,2728.078,"Isn't there a problem that was brought out in the briefs with... this man is standing trial before a jury that's going to determine guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but if this testimony is going to come in, the judge has to make some kind of a preliminary finding that he killed her in advance of the jury making that determination."
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2728.078,2730.297,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.07-6053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.534,2765.295,"If that's a fault, it's a fault that also exists with the rule being argued by your opponent, isn't it?"
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2765.295,2766.375,"I think that's true, Your Honor."
2007.07-6053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2785.9,2787.429,Maybe I have to take that back.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2824.369,2826.428,I think it... I think it would be rare.
2007.07-6053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2826.428,2827.617,Okay.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2827.617,2831.193,"But... but it's not... but it's not unheard of, and there is... there is a pedigree for it, and--"
2007.07-6053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2831.193,2833.88,It would be rare on her theory; it wouldn't be rare on yours.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2838.267,2849.481,"--But nevertheless I think the... the idea that you could have the hearing even though it's the same issue that goes before the jury, I think is not an obstacle to applying the rule in this case."
2007.07-6053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2849.481,2853.841,I would think these cases come in... this problem comes in with spousal abuse.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2872.161,2873.128,Yes.
2007.07-6053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2873.128,2873.581,All right.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2880.61,2890.028,"Yes, I think it... I think, again, regardless of what defendant's intent is, the rule and the logic of the rule applies."
2007.07-6053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2890.028,2895.48,"And so that would be true, whether it was intended or whether it isn't intended."
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2895.48,2896.042,Yes.
2007.07-6053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2896.042,2901.603,"Whether it's... I mean, I'm not sure how to even administer even a criminal/civil distinction."
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2901.603,2914.752,"But I think the same, you know, as was said before, the argument that what came in, in this case, was this damaging evidence that... that undermined the defendant's self-defense claim."
2007.07-6053,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2925.093,2929.636,I think you're... it's certainly true that this issue would come up in domestic abuse cases--
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2929.636,2930.073,Yes.
2007.07-6053,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2930.073,2932.759,--but I'm not sure that it would be at all limited.
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2934.947,2935.384,Yes.
2007.07-6053,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2935.384,2945.082,"--any case in which have you familiarity between the victim and the defendant, which, as I understand it, is the most typical case, but it's not simply in any way limited to the domestic abuse cases."
2007.07-6053,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,2945.082,2945.46,No.
2007.07-6053,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2952.644,2953.689,"No, I know your rule wouldn't--"
