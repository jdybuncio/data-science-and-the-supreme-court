1983.82-687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,74.469,"I think you may proceed whenever you're ready, Mr. Levy."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,74.469,76.903,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-687,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,173.49,179.378,"Now, federal law doesn't require that; that's a matter of accounting standards, is that right?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,179.378,186.14,Federal law requires that the financial statement be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
1983.82-687,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,186.14,186.377,Right.
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,192.359,197.433,"That's correct, and then it is incorporated, as it were, into the SEC regulations."
1983.82-687,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,197.433,206.304,"Mr. Levy, would your position be any different if this were a small closely held corporation, not listed?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,206.304,209.319,"Well, I think that would be a different case."
1983.82-687,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,230.469,234.933,"Well, certainly some of your arguments here would be inapplicable in that situation, I would think."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,234.933,240.931,"Well, I think it's really more that the accounting firm's arguments would be inapplicable in that situation."
1983.82-687,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,257.329,262.077,"Wouldn't some of your arguments be inapplicable, to wit, the duty owed to the public?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,262.077,267.514,"Well, it would be inapplicable in the sense that we wouldn't need to respond to that argument."
1983.82-687,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,379.871,385.151,"Mr. Levy, a special agent had shown up before the summons was issued, hadn't he?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,385.151,385.853,That's correct.
1983.82-687,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,388.04,390.992,Would your case be stronger if he hadn't appeared?
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,390.992,394.334,I don't believe our case would be materially different.
1983.82-687,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,456.263,461.121,"Well, certainly the appearance of a special agent has criminal case overtones."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,461.121,464.463,"Yes, a special agent does investigate for criminal purposes."
1983.82-687,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,666.052,676.016,"Mr. Levy, hasn't this Court gone into this about a thousand times by now, the great theory of the IRS?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,676.016,680.468,"I believe so, and I believe everything that's in my presentation--"
1983.82-687,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,680.468,682.594,"Well, do we need it for this case?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,682.594,689.511,--I think it helps to support the Government's position here to realize what is at stake in withholding access to these papers from the IRS.
1983.82-687,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,689.511,692.229,It's up to you.
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,693.289,695.52,"Well, let me move on from that, then."
1983.82-687,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,769.864,773.381,"Well, it's a question basically of Congressional intent, I suppose, isn't it?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,783.032,790.138,"No one, neither the Court of Appeals nor the Respondents, have identified anything in the Congressional intent that would support a privilege on this branch of the case."
1983.82-687,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,793.215,804.445,"Well, what reason, then, do you think that Judge Feinberg thought supported his opinion if it weren't some implicit Congressional intent?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,804.445,820.581,"We think that it was a misconception about the role of the judiciary, that he thought that it was the proper role of the federal judiciary to weigh competing social policies against the statutory access authorized by Congress and conferred on the Service."
1983.82-687,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,874.075,876.464,"Mr. Levy, may I ask you a question here."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,902.498,912.59,"--Well, I think that would certainly be a harder case and raise issues that haven't been addressed here about the role of the attorney-client privilege and waiver of the attorney-client privilege."
1983.82-687,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.571,923.283,"Doesn't... of course, it's an accountant, not a lawyer, and it's kind of a semi-legal judgment that he has to make in interpreting tax laws."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,933.75,938.435,"--Well, we think it is not close to the attorney's role, really, for two fundamental reasons."
1983.82-687,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.604,955.176,"Well, but in the hypothetical statute I've posited he would have a duty of giving an opinion on which the public would rely."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,955.176,967.219,"And that's why it would raise hard questions about whether the privilege applied in the first instance, whether he was giving confidential legal advice on behalf of the client or, even if he were, whether it would be waived in the circumstances of that case."
1983.82-687,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1007.235,1017.011,"Mr. Levy, regarding that part of your answer to Justice Stevens, you're stating now what the accountant's role is, that he doesn't give advice like lawyers do."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1027.009,1029.037,I don't believe it is disputed.
1983.82-687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1033.365,1042.783,"Well, are you suggesting that a lot of accountants, CPA's, do not give legal advice, about tax liability?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1042.783,1052.138,"--I'm saying that when they're acting as an independent public auditor in connection with the securities laws, their obligation is to the public and it is not one of giving confidential advice."
1983.82-687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1052.138,1058.415,And you think that function is wound up in both of these kinds of papers that are involved in this case?
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1058.415,1068.02,"In this case as it comes to the Court there is only one kind of paper that's involved, the tax accrual work papers, and we think it is fundamentally involved in resolving the issue whether the IRS should have access."
1983.82-687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.02,1073.003,Even if for other purposes they give advice about what tax liability is?
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1073.003,1078.752,"That would be a different case, although we think Couch recognizes that there is no general accountant-client privilege."
1983.82-687,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1078.752,1082.733,"Mr. Levy, what would happen if the accountant was in a legal office?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1082.733,1084.157,"I'm sorry, Mr. Justice Marshall?"
1983.82-687,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1084.157,1090.232,What would happen if the accountant was in a legal law office?
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1090.232,1093.886,"If he's performing a role as an independent public auditor, I don't think that would make any--"
1983.82-687,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1093.886,1094.448,It wouldn't?
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1094.448,1094.9,--difference.
1983.82-687,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1097.664,1106.115,"So that the lawyer and the accountant advising the client, the lawyer is privileged but the accountant is not?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1106.115,1115.251,"Well, if it's in connection with a certification of a public financial statement I think there would be questions about whether the lawyer's advice would be privileged."
1983.82-687,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1120.125,1123.108,"Yes, that's what got me on this tangent."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1123.108,1132.137,"But there would be difficult questions about whether the privilege applies and, even if it applies, whether it would be waived by disclosing it to a quasi-public person."
1983.82-687,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1132.137,1135.276,"Well, what would... I know this is way out in left field."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1144.661,1158.016,"As I say, that would raise different questions, and some of those questions are presented in the El Paso case, in which the Fifth Circuit held that there, at a minimum, was a waiver of any attorney privilege by disclosing it to the outside auditor."
1983.82-687,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1166.152,1167.575,They're not in this case?
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1167.575,1168.995,"No, they haven't been raised."
1983.82-687,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1193.892,1206.028,"But if the statute did provide it, I dare say that the corporations involved might not be quite as forthcoming with the SEC as they were with their own, or who they thought were their own accountants."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1206.028,1217.913,"Well, their obligation is to be every bit as forthcoming here, and the whole point of this illustration is that the independent public auditor stands in exactly the same position as the SEC would."
1983.82-687,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1231.156,1240.826,"Mr. Levy, of course lawyers, just as accountants, file opinions with registration statements with the SEC."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1263.818,1270.19,"I regret, Mr. Justice Powell, but I'm not fully familiar with the lawyer's obligations in those circumstances."
1983.82-687,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1288.51,1301.301,"Well, there may be more of an opinion expressed by counsel than perhaps by an accountant, although where you're dealing with a tax accrual estimate that finally comes down to an opinion, I suppose."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1301.301,1310.811,"There is room for judgment, no question, in these papers, although judgment is not the only or even the predominant content of the papers."
1983.82-687,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1426.433,1462.729,"Mr. Levy, supposing that we reverse the Second Circuit in this case and then a new breed of service comes into effect, the lawyer-accountant, which does all the same work that CPA's used to do except that the person to whom the corporation talks is now a lawyer, and they go about... a particular corporation consults one of these entities and does work only with the lawyer, but the firm is functioning in the capacity just as the CPA's are here, preparing reports that are required by the SEC."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1467.339,1471.867,"It would raise different questions, but I think in the end fundamentally not."
1983.82-687,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1471.867,1472.837,It would have to be the same.
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1472.837,1479.194,"I think that's right, because the obligations under the securities laws are not private confidential advice-giving ones, as lawyers--"
1983.82-687,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.194,1484.784,"Well, after all, the accountants do have lawyers in their organizations, don't they?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1484.784,1488.688,"--I expect they do, and I also imagine that many of these CPA's are attorneys as well."
1983.82-687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1490.532,1497.918,"Some law firms have certified public accountants in their establishment, do they not?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1497.918,1500.028,"--I expect that that is true, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1500.028,1506.478,"In response to Justice Rehnquist's question, would it not turn on what the particular actions were?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1518.879,1526.314,"That may be true as to some particular type of information, and that is the discussion I had with Justice Stevens and Justice Marshall, I think."
1983.82-687,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1549.24,1553.444,"Mr. Levy, how big was the reserve in this case?"
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1553.444,1554.992,I don't know the answer to that.
1983.82-687,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.992,1559.472,"I notice a reference in the papers to $7,000 of these foreign payments."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1560.471,1562.097,"No, that is not all we're talking about."
1983.82-687,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1577.839,1588.196,Do you know if in a case of this kind the Government is more interested in finding out what the elements of the contingent liability that are included in the reserve are or the ones that are left out?
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1589.787,1594.756,I am not in a position to be able to answer that.
1983.82-687,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1610.935,1620.605,"I've seen some balance sheets where the contingency actually identifies the area of potential controversy, that there's some fight over inventory or something that's going to recur year after year."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1625.663,1631.177,"Well, if the balance sheet itself disclosed certain things, then that would be of substantial assistance to the IRS."
1983.82-687,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1773.275,1775.931,"Mr. Levy, since '81 you have guidelines."
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1775.931,1777.355,That's correct.
1983.82-687,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1777.355,1782.946,Do you have any idea how frequently requests are made now under those guidelines?
1983.82-687,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1782.946,1784.646,It is not frequently.
1983.82-687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1807.762,1818.165,Mr. Liggio.
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,1818.165,1821.351,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.82-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2121.74,2124.708,You use the term Mr. Liggio.
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2124.708,2125.114,Excuse me?
1983.82-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2125.114,2126.378,"You use the term ""we""."
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2126.378,2128.861,I'm talking about Arthur Young & Company.
1983.82-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2128.861,2130.175,"You meant the client, you meant Amerada?"
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2130.175,2132.063,"The independent auditor, Your Honor."
1983.82-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2132.063,2135.53,"The auditor, not the client?"
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2135.53,2140.825,"Well, the client has the first responsibility for providing that provision in the tax return."
1983.82-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2140.825,2145.871,"In any event, the ""we"" does not include counsel, is that right?"
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2145.871,2146.667,That is correct.
1983.82-687,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2166.254,2168.457,You're not suggesting that it's legal advice?
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2168.457,2173.562,"No, Your Honor, I am not suggesting that it's legal advice, although in the El Paso case it clearly was."
1983.82-687,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.529,2186.965,"And in giving this information, this advice to Amerada, Arthur Young & Company doesn't use lawyers for that purpose?"
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2186.965,2192.572,"There may be lawyers in our tax department, but they are not lawyers acting as lawyers."
1983.82-687,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2195.025,2201.958,"Mr. Liggio, at one place in your brief, on page 25, you say that under these circumstances, and you describe it."
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2218.308,2220.106,"Well, Your Honor, yes."
1983.82-687,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2249.204,2263.667,"Well, but don't you... aren't you stuck by some difference that Mr. Levy refers to, that the Hickman case arose in a context of litigation, where one of the concurring opinions says, even if a lawyer lives by his wits he shouldn't have to live... be able to live by his adversary's wits?"
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2270.726,2280.082,"Well, in part that is here also, Your Honor, although the analogy to the work product doctrine, I think it's an analogue."
1983.82-687,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2346.728,2351.601,Were these papers prepared in your view in anticipation of litigation?
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2351.601,2355.521,"No, Justice O'Connor, there's no claim that they were prepared in anticipation of litigation."
1983.82-687,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2355.521,2369.032,What if the work papers were sought not by IRS but by the SEC or by some private individual in a securities proceeding?
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2371.388,2381.417,"Well, first, Justice O'Connor, depending on the circumstances they may or may not be obtainable by the SEC or by the private litigant."
1983.82-687,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2419.152,2422.494,What would it turn on if it were sought by the SEC?
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2432.021,2440.971,"--Well, whether the SEC would be entitled to it would be whether this was a proper subject matter of SEC investigation."
1983.82-687,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2440.971,2442.547,Let's assume it is.
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2442.547,2454.275,"Then in that case they would be entitled to obtain it, having made the relevancy showing, and we would seek an appropriate protective order limiting the disclosure that the SEC could otherwise make to that."
1983.82-687,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2454.275,2458.214,"Well, why should the outcome be different if it's for the IRS?"
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2458.214,2467.616,"Because, Your Honor, the IRS... the purpose for which these are prepared and the effect that will result from that is materially different."
1983.82-687,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2493.793,2504.852,What if the papers had been given by the accountant to the client and they were in the client's possession and the IRS sought them?
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2506.397,2511.131,"I don't think that should change the result, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-687,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2630.642,2632.908,"Mr. Liggio, I don't quite understand this argument."
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2643.718,2645.044,"--No, Justice Powell."
1983.82-687,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2645.044,2649.637,Are you suggesting that the auditors wouldn't probe for all relevant information?
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2649.637,2650.651,"No, Justice Powell."
1983.82-687,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2656.679,2657.833,The level of candor by whom?
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2657.833,2659.116,--By the corporate client.
1983.82-687,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2659.116,2659.943,By the client.
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2659.943,2671.299,"The willingness to open up and come to us with the problems, to discuss issues, to say: We've got this IRS dispute, we're going to litigate it or we're going to settle it, we're going to settle it for 60 cents on the dollar."
1983.82-687,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2680.28,2690.414,"If you audit a company's books regularly, do you have a relationship with your client that would not permit that sort of pressing type question?"
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2690.414,2692.602,Justice Powell--
1983.82-687,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2692.602,2693.46,I would have thought so.
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2693.46,2709.096,"--the fact is that the onus of the IRS potential access to this is a very debilitating factor in the relationship, no matter how good it's been with our clients over the years."
1983.82-687,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2724.793,2732.228,"But if you didn't have information that you were satisfied was fully adequate, you'd qualify your certificate, wouldn't you?"
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2732.228,2736.49,"That's correct, Your Honor, if we did not have adequate information."
1983.82-687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2747.581,2754.202,But you can always get the information by telling the client you won't certify the audit if they don't give you the information.
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2760.185,2766.806,"Well, with all deference, Justice Stevens, I am not sure we will in fact get all the information."
1983.82-687,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2773.883,2777.131,Mr. Liggio--
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2777.131,2777.646,Yes.
1983.82-687,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2777.646,2793.919,"--Suppose the client asked its tax lawyer to prepare certain information, not in anticipation of litigation, but concerning potential tax problems."
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2799.761,2806.916,"They would in the first instance be subject to the attorney-client privilege, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-687,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2818.536,2825.61,"Even though they're... even if you assume, as I suggested, that they were not prepared in anticipation of litigation?"
1983.82-687,1,19399,carl_d_liggio,,2825.61,2837.137,"--The privilege that I'm talking about is the attorney-client privilege in the first instance, and the fact that they may be shown to the independent auditor we do not believe would lose the quality of that privilege."
1983.82-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2844.652,2854.567,Mr. Jackson.
1983.82-687,2,45158,william_e_jackson,,2854.567,2860.721,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.82-687,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2912.296,2922.478,"Mr. Jackson, if we should decide in our subjective judgment that it was not ""fair"" to do that, ought we to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals?"
1983.82-687,2,45158,william_e_jackson,,2922.478,2923.991,"I think yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-687,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2929.022,2937.065,"What authority in our past cases is there for that sort of a thing, to just evaluate something in terms of ""fairness""?"
1983.82-687,2,45158,william_e_jackson,,2937.065,2958.228,"I think, Your Honor, this Court has held in a series of cases, the Powell case being one, that an IRS summons will be enforced only under certain conditions."
1983.82-687,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3153.695,3160.539,What if the taxpayer had done his own work and prepared work papers that IRS sought?
1983.82-687,2,45158,william_e_jackson,,3164.989,3172.784,"Under this aspect of the Second Circuit's decision, yes, Your Honor, they would be."
1983.82-687,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3211.907,3221.308,"Well, I suppose not many taxpayers have ever thought that the proceedings with IRS were necessarily fair, have they?"
1983.82-687,2,45158,william_e_jackson,,3221.308,3225.887,"I will not disagree with that, Your Honor."
1983.82-687,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.452,3260.592,"Mr. Jackson, may I ask you this question."
1983.82-687,2,45158,william_e_jackson,,3278.643,3297.259,"Well, I think that to the extent that there are figures in the taxpayer's books and records with respect to the composition of the reserve, if it is flagged so much for this, so much for that, certainly the IRS could obtain them."
1983.82-687,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3297.259,3299.727,"No, I'm assuming they're not, they're not flagged."
1983.82-687,2,45158,william_e_jackson,,3315.907,3324.201,"I would say not, Your Honor, because that gets into judgmental private thoughts and not the facts as booked."
1983.82-687,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3324.201,3327.746,"Of course, it wouldn't do you any good if there's only one claim pending."
1983.82-687,2,45158,william_e_jackson,,3327.746,3330.826,"That would make it more difficult, Your Honor, yes."
1983.82-687,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3330.826,3336.102,"Mr. Jackson, you referred to the fundamental fairness argument."
1983.82-687,2,45158,william_e_jackson,,3366.0,3370.324,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I could not differ from that."
1983.82-687,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3787.51,3790.964,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Levy?"
1983.82-687,3,36246,mark_i_levy,,3790.964,3792.727,"No, I have nothing further, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-687,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3792.727,3793.242,"Thank you, gentlemen."
