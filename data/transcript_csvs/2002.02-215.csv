2002.02-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.009,"We'll hear argument now in Number 02-215, Pacific Health Care Systems v. Jeffrey Book."
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,10.692,16.105,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-215,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,64.622,75.098,"Mr. Grauer, on the second point that you made, you said it's unlikely that the arbitrators would find that treble damages are inconsistent with the... with the contract."
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,94.757,95.194,--Yes.
2002.02-215,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,95.194,96.797,Thank you.
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,96.797,98.153,Yes.
2002.02-215,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,98.153,125.672,"On your first point, suppose you have a contract that is very clear that there can be no triple damages under RICO, that's right in the contract, is it your position that that goes to the arbitrator and it's for the arbitrator to say that this violates public policy and I'm going to... well, I mean, what would happen in that case?"
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,125.672,129.594,"Yes, we believe that it's for the arbitrator to decide."
2002.02-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,144.328,154.412,"The arbitrator, I take it, on the face of the contract simply could not award the damages, or are you saying that he might?"
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,154.412,155.624,Yes.
2002.02-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,155.989,158.742,"He'd say, this is against public policy and I'm giving you triple damages?"
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,162.462,172.262,"--Well, the arbitrator is bound first and foremost, under both the law and under the arbitration clauses in this case, to comply with the controlling law."
2002.02-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,199.734,211.825,"What's our best case, or is there one, for the proposition that if the contract says the arbitrator may not do X, and X violates public policy, that the arbitrator goes ahead and does it anyway?"
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,213.133,226.444,"I believe that that would be found in Mitsubishi, in the Vimar y Seguros case at page 541, in the McMahon case at page--"
2002.02-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,226.444,232.595,"Well, but I'm not sure in any of those cases it was clear that the contract in very explicit terms said, you cannot do this."
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,239.245,286.147,"--I think the... one example... there are several examples, but one that comes to mind is that in the Vimar case the COGSA prevented the arbitrator from... the COGSA prevented any reduction in liability in a bill of lading, and... and there was a concern that the law in Japan which had been selected to conduct the arbitration had a different set of rules that could have allowed the stevedores to be... to have liability laid off on the stevedores, and yet the Court said, we will not indulge in the presumption that the arbitrator will not follow the appropriate law and, therefore, even though Japanese law was different, the arbitrator, we assumed, would follow the controlling law."
2002.02-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,318.277,337.426,"Well, but in one of the arbitration clauses, I think, it says the arbitrator shall not vary or ignore the terms of this agreement, shall have no authority to award extracontractual damages at any time, including punitive or exemplary damages."
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,354.305,358.751,"I wouldn't agree with the Court looking at that, and here's why."
2002.02-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,398.371,403.447,Have we ever allowed a prospective waiver of a statutory right--
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,403.447,406.083,--Prospective--
2002.02-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.083,408.485,--in the arbitration context?
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,408.485,427.134,"--The prospective waivers... yes, I believe that that, for example, in our brief we cited a number of cases such as Mezzanatto that create a presumption that a statutory right is waivable unless Congress has said otherwise."
2002.02-215,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,465.933,484.222,"Mr. Grauer, on the question of waiver, you have represented, and I want to make this clear, that waiver would be academic in this situation, since you say you will concede that all of these contracts allow the arbitrator to award treble damages."
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,499.25,500.766,--Absolutely.
2002.02-215,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,523.73,526.3,But suppose the arbitrator gets it wrong.
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,541.174,546.115,"To the extent... yes, I think it could, and here's why."
2002.02-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,588.209,589.908,"In other words, it's quite simple."
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,614.749,620.146,"I would... I would agree with the first part of that, Justice Breyer, and that is--"
2002.02-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,620.146,621.007,"Well, why not the second?"
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,663.605,667.719,--I'm not sure I followed the first part of the hypothetical.
2002.02-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,667.719,668.367,The first part's very simple.
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,729.715,766.221,"Justice Breyer, I agree with the first part, and that is this, that the gateway issue of arbitrability involves the determination of, did the parties make a valid agreement to arbitrate and, if they did, is the dispute within the scope of that agreement, but that should end, in our view, the inquiry, because if you don't end the inquiry at that point, you're... you're opening the door to questions about remedies and legal issues and what are the elements of the cause of action and what have the parties agreed to, and let me give you an example."
2002.02-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,806.704,808.318,I didn't say when you would decide it.
2002.02-215,0,44797,william_e_grauer,,823.598,830.4,"--Vimar y Seguros, and I agree, Justice Breyer, that post arbitration--"
2002.02-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,830.4,831.724,I thought you probably would end up agreeing.
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1635.002,1639.257,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1676.425,1683.355,"We also said that that kind of question that would affect an arbitration is fairly rare, didn't we?"
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1683.355,1699.656,"You did, Your Honor, and in fact I think this case shows that it... that it's rare, and I think the various amicus briefs that have been submitted shows that an effort to put limits on remedies, which this Court has attacked many times, is rare."
2002.02-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1703.549,1708.953,You say... you say this Court has attacked what many times?
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1708.953,1720.989,"--This Court... within the context of arbitration, Justice O'Connor's question, this Court has never allowed the waiver of statutory remedies in the context of an arbitration, enforcing an arbitration provision."
2002.02-215,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1738.076,1750.916,"Mr. Whatley, Mr. Grauer has conceded that there is no waiver here, that treble damages are available, so why are we engaging in this academic exercise?"
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1750.916,1760.082,"Well, the concern I have with that, Your Honor, is if... if you read the question presented in his brief, that's not what it says."
2002.02-215,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1760.082,1762.835,"Well, he's made the concession right now--"
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1762.835,1763.711,He has made the--
2002.02-215,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1763.711,1795.552,"--and he has five arguments for saying, any good lawyer would, that these words that you read punitive damages, extracontractual damages, do not prevent the arbitrator from awarding treble damages, so he has one interpreting the thing, two, if the interpretation fails he concedes it, three, there's nothing in the contract says he can't concede it, and so why don't we send this to the arbitrator to find out what the contract means before we decide that it must mean something that would bar its enforcement?"
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1795.552,1806.706,"--Well, the problem with that... the problem with that is, doing it after the fact has some pretty severe policy implications."
2002.02-215,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1806.706,1811.072,"But didn't we, the Court hold precisely, do it after the fact, in Vimar?"
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1811.072,1812.056,Well--
2002.02-215,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1812.056,1813.771,It's precisely the same circumstance.
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1813.771,1826.41,"--In that case, Your Honor, you were dealing with the international context, where you said, starting in Mitsubishi is a... is a special situation concerning, where you've got to be concerned with international law."
2002.02-215,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1844.39,1846.273,This contract doesn't cover a tort action.
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1846.273,1848.206,--It doesn't cover a tort action.
2002.02-215,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1848.206,1864.387,"In other words, what they wanted to have is an arbitration between doctors and hospitals, and the single most likely, or a very, very likely kind of dispute they call tort disputes, aren't even covered by the arbitration agreement, and it's impossible for an arbitrator to come to a different conclusion."
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1864.387,1868.529,"That is... that is... that is our position, Your Honor."
2002.02-215,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1868.529,1869.223,I know that's your position.
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1873.456,1874.237,Well--
2002.02-215,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.237,1876.331,So what I'd like is an argument for that position.
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1876.331,1900.864,"--Well, the argument for that position is, you start with the language, and you don't only start with the language that says, no extracontractual damages and, in fact, the issue you get in arbitration, and... and... and you go to arbitration, and I know we assume arbitrators are going to follow the law, absolutely, the Court has said that many times, although many arbitrators are not lawyers, but I've handled many arbitrations, and--"
2002.02-215,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1900.864,1904.072,"Well, many judges who are lawyers end up not following the law."
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1906.134,1909.805,"--Your Honor, you can say that, but I don't think I can."
2002.02-215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1950.018,1958.664,"Every one of these contracts says the arbitrator will follow the law, the arbitrator has no power to commit errors of law."
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1970.122,1980.689,"Well, that's good, and now that the issue has been specifically raised, and after the fact, after it's raised they come in and waive it."
2002.02-215,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1988.856,1989.381,That's another case.
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1991.251,1993.146,"--Well, it's not... it's this language, though, Your Honor."
2002.02-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.214,1996.224,But you don't litigate this language.
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,1998.594,2019.982,"But... but Your Honor, they didn't come in and waive that position until it got before Judge Moreno, and Judge Moreno was going to hold it illegal, going to hold this arbitration agreement unenforceable because of the overreaching they engaged in by limiting the remedies that could be awarded."
2002.02-215,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2024.524,2026.825,"Mr. Whatley, they were never before an arbitrator, were they?"
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,2026.825,2029.61,"--Well, they were never before an arbitrator, that's true, Your Honor."
2002.02-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2045.533,2053.166,After the fact... when did he think it should have been waived in order to... to assist the petitioner here?
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,2053.166,2056.949,"Well, in truth, I think he thought it should never... if they're going to take--"
2002.02-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2056.949,2059.974,"Well then, if he thought it should never be, then what does after the fact mean?"
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,2059.974,2063.071,"--It means, after the issue was presented to the trial court."
2002.02-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2063.071,2065.248,"Well, but that happens all the time."
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,2070.592,2076.754,"Well, but the problem with that is, Your Honor, it means that that provision is still there."
2002.02-215,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2078.03,2080.735,"Well, that's true if parties settle a case."
2002.02-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2080.735,2081.364,"Yes, absolutely."
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,2081.364,2091.281,"Well, if parties settle a case, that's a very different question, because this is a prospective provision that applies out into the future, and that's the difference."
2002.02-215,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2108.438,2141.223,"The big question for arbitration is, was there a violation of RICO, and I think one of the questions from the bench suggested that the scope of remedy doesn't rise to the same level as, is there a violation of the act, and if in this case the arbitrator should find that if there is no violation of RICO on the part of care organizations, then there would never be any issue of remedy."
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,2141.223,2142.882,"Well, that--"
2002.02-215,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.882,2154.684,"And, but you want to take that issue, which the parties did agree to arbitrate, and put that in the courts, because you say there's something defective in the remedy provision of the arbitration."
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,2154.684,2178.545,"--That's true, but if... if... if a court or an arbitrator can't grant the remedies that Congress has authorized for a violation, including for a criminal violation, if the court can't grant that relief, then there is a serious public policy problem with putting the parties into that forum to make that decision."
2002.02-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2178.545,2181.014,And just what is that public policy problem?
2002.02-215,1,33544,joe_r_whatley_jr,,2181.014,2185.34,The public policy problem is that... is that the arbitrator then cannot remedy it.
2002.02-215,2,44797,william_e_grauer,,3361.279,3395.897,"Mr. Whatley's argument about $5 here and $10 there is flatly inconsistent with what the district judge found, and you can note at page A25 of our cert petition that the court found that these cases were negotiated by sophisticated groups of doctors, that the claims were not small, that in fact the doctors were enlarging an ongoing pattern... that's about midway through page A25 of our cert petition, that that is an ongoing pattern of instances."
2002.02-215,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3560.904,3566.053,"Thank you, Mr. Grauer."
