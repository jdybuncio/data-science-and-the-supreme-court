1996.96-5658,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.654,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-5658, Cary Michael Lambrix v. Harry K. Singletary."
1996.96-5658,0,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,9.806,15.843,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-5658,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,42.327,50.997,"Another way of appraising it is the way we phrased it in the Butler case, isn't it, Mr. Lawry, that could a reasonable jurist have decided otherwise?"
1996.96-5658,0,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,50.997,54.301,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that is another way of phrasing it."
1996.96-5658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,113.256,125.897,"You... I don't want to interrupt the sequence that you want to follow, but are you going to address also Baldwin in Alabama, because Baldwin held in '85, I think--"
1996.96-5658,0,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,147.477,148.343,"Yes, sir."
1996.96-5658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,212.835,241.419,"Well, that may... you know, that might be the better view, but isn't it also the case that one could reasonably read Baldwin as saying that it's not clear whether the subsequent act of the sentencing judge in the Florida scheme constituted an adequate reweighing even on the assumption... which, of course, we never really know under the Florida scheme... even on the assumption that that factor was found by the jury and was one of the bases for the jury's recommendation."
1996.96-5658,0,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,246.39,252.727,"Well, yes, I don't think that Baldwin... Baldwin itself decided that decision."
1996.96-5658,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,254.079,271.105,"But didn't Baldwin signal that there was a real issue to this effect, and that issue, at least so far as the particular Florida scheme was concerned, did not get resolved until... or at least resolved in part until Espinosa came along?"
1996.96-5658,0,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,271.105,279.694,"--No, I... well, I think that Baldwin itself does not decide the issue."
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1510.833,1516.136,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-5658,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1539.632,1541.801,"Which the Eleventh Circuit didn't address, is that right?"
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1541.801,1542.267,--That's correct.
1996.96-5658,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1552.889,1554.325,"You raised it there, though?"
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1554.325,1554.925,"Yes, sir."
1996.96-5658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.043,1561.662,Was it also raised in the district court?
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1561.662,1562.479,"Yes, it was."
1996.96-5658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1562.479,1563.781,And it was ruled on there?
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1563.781,1564.681,"Yes, it was."
1996.96-5658,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1631.406,1634.691,How does that square with--
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1634.691,1636.841,What the district court found?
1996.96-5658,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1636.841,1647.849,--what the petitioner's counsel has told us that it was specifically included in the grounds that were presented in the collateral... in the appeal from the denial of collateral relief?
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1647.849,1653.652,Based on Florida procedure is how the district court reached that conclusion.
1996.96-5658,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1829.162,1836.899,"But we would have to decide this issue of Florida law here to conclude there is a procedural bar, is that right?"
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1836.899,1838.582,"Well, I think it's a very straightforward issue, though."
1996.96-5658,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1840.017,1842.969,Even though the Eleventh Circuit hasn't addressed it?
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1842.969,1858.812,"--Right, but the... we have the clear statement from the Florida supreme court applying the bar, and we don't have any State court decision ever even addressing the Federal question or addressing the merits of it, or even recognizing or acknowledging that this issue has ever been raised."
1996.96-5658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1858.812,1865.898,"But is it not correct that it could be a procedural bar but still... I mean, at least theoretically not be an independent and adequate State ground?"
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1865.898,1866.998,Theoretically that argument could be made.
1996.96-5658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1866.998,1870.116,"It's unlikely, I understand, but at least it's theoretically possible--"
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1870.116,1870.25,Correct.
1996.96-5658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1870.25,1875.318,"--on the grounds it's not consistently applied, or they waived it by addressing the merits later, or something like that."
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1876.77,1879.103,"Theoretically, but--"
1996.96-5658,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1879.103,1890.511,"It should be an opportunity to show, though, that, if there's an allegation that the Florida court has not consistently applied, although they could have, this as a procedural bar."
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1890.511,1898.848,"--That's true, but I don't think Mr. Lambrix can cite to you any cases where the Florida supreme court has not consistently applied the procedural bar that they applied in this case."
1996.96-5658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1907.271,1911.739,"Why do you suppose the Eleventh Circuit didn't rule on it, if it's this clear?"
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1911.739,1914.239,--I suppose--
1996.96-5658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1914.239,1916.274,Because they know more about Florida law than we do.
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1917.241,1933.851,"--Well, I think they were just satisfied with the Teague ruling, and they just didn't address the State's procedural bar argument at all, and I think that there are cases that say the threshold issue is retroactivity, and I think they felt like once that was resolved and they could thoroughly analyze that issue--"
1996.96-5658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.851,1938.57,"Of course, if we agreed with you on the Teague issue you'd probably be happier with that disposition."
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1938.57,1941.856,"--Well, either way I'd be happy, but the--"
1996.96-5658,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1946.391,1958.616,Do you know how many Florida convictions or sentences would have to be set aside if we were to agree with the petitioner on the merits?
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,1958.616,1959.299,"Yes, ma'am."
1996.96-5658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.496,2010.231,Relief under Espinosa?
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2010.231,2010.765,"--Yes, sir."
1996.96-5658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.765,2014.767,For cases that were tried before Espinosa was decided?
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2014.767,2015.7,Right.
1996.96-5658,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2029.527,2036.18,"Well, that indicates maybe the procedural bar might be the best thing for this Court to consider first--"
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2036.18,2036.18,In this case.
1996.96-5658,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2036.18,2037.696,--as a preliminary matter.
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2037.696,2041.564,I think the procedural bar is an important threshold issue in this case.
1996.96-5658,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2042.898,2043.6,When the lower--
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2054.206,2056.658,--I don't have any statistics to that effect.
1996.96-5658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2067.215,2074.952,"But I dare say there are more than a dozen case in Florida of people on death row who were tried before 1992, are there not?"
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2074.952,2075.452,Certainly.
1996.96-5658,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2077.004,2083.824,"I think you want to get to the Teague issue and should, but one more question on the procedural bar... one more question from me."
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2096.197,2099.686,"Well, actually, this Court has said it's a threshold issue."
1996.96-5658,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2099.686,2100.936,Even to a procedural bar?
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2100.936,2104.721,I don't believe that specific circumstance has been addressed.
1996.96-5658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.721,2106.423,I thought it was threshold to the merits.
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2108.542,2121.682,"I think that that is how it is, but the cases... I think the cases where this Court has said that have not been cases where there was a procedural bar to consider or to decide whether a procedural bar takes priority over a Teague issue."
1996.96-5658,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2130.371,2139.394,"But it would be extraordinary for this Court to take it up in the first instance, when it hasn't been taken up in the lower Federal courts."
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2139.394,2142.763,"Well, I don't think it would be that extraordinary."
1996.96-5658,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2170.615,2173.282,What's the advantage to you as a prosecutor from that?
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2198.35,2201.968,"Well, I think this Court can address both issues in this case."
1996.96-5658,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2220.179,2229.619,"On the Teague issue, it... if... is the reading of Proffitt dispositive of the case?"
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2238.408,2254.77,"I think that is... a great deal of the case is Proffitt, but also the other sentencing opinions out of Florida that has come from this Court, including Spaziano, where you were looking at the constitutionality of the judge imposing a death sentence when the judge had recommended a life sentence."
1996.96-5658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2274.398,2276.266,"But Ms. Dittmar, may I just ask this question?"
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2279.818,2280.135,Right.
1996.96-5658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.135,2288.991,"--or a jury State and so forth, and we use those labels, but is it not correct that as a matter of Florida law the verdict of the jury is a significant part of the procedure?"
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2288.991,2291.526,It is an important part of the procedure.
1996.96-5658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.526,2295.578,And it will have an impact presumptively on what the judge does?
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2295.578,2303.267,I think necessarily a life recommendation will have a graver impact on what the judge does than a death recommendation.
1996.96-5658,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2315.359,2327.032,"Therefore we should assume that if the jury had come in with a life recommendation here, if it... presumably a properly instructed jury might have done so, that would have an impact on the judge, some impact?"
1996.96-5658,1,18790,carol_m_dittmar,,2327.032,2329.532,--I think it would have had some impact on the judge.
1996.96-5658,2,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2956.827,2965.766,I'd like to briefly address the procedural bar issue.
1996.96-5658,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2999.237,3004.724,"Well, but the procedural bar is not just failure to raise it at the trial level, is it?"
1996.96-5658,2,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3010.712,3018.966,"Right, but when a State court rules on the merits... the 3850 proceedings are after the trial."
1996.96-5658,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3030.773,3038.446,"But that's a question of Florida law, I take it, requires interpretation of what the Florida law is in that regard."
1996.96-5658,2,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3038.446,3039.963,"Yes, that's right."
1996.96-5658,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3039.963,3043.331,And the Eleventh Circuit is more familiar with that than we.
1996.96-5658,2,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3043.331,3049.318,"That's correct, and that's why we think the appropriate disposition is to remand after ruling in our favor on the Teague issue."
1996.96-5658,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3049.318,3056.638,The part about Espinosa which opposing counsel said was the least obvious was the part about what Florida State law is really like.
1996.96-5658,2,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3068.196,3083.872,"Well, I would read Sochar and the cases cited in Sochar, because there are numerous kinds of jury error that the Florida supreme court has reviewed in death penalty cases... jury instruction error, improper evidence, improper argument."
1996.96-5658,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3105.405,3108.44,"Mr. Lawry, can I come back to your response to Justice O'Connor?"
1996.96-5658,2,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3151.682,3159.371,"--Yes, and a second opportunity, and then the question is whether that's adequate, independent, and whether there's cause and prejudice for any default."
1996.96-5658,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3160.905,3162.255,"Thank you, Mr. Lawry."
