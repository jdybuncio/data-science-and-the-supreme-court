1991.91-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,16.202,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-763, Republic of Argentina and Banco Central v. Weltover, Inc., et al. Spectators are admonished to refrain from talking while you're in the courtroom."
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,48.084,51.547,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-763,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,123.094,126.186,"Mr. Davis, what is a Bonod?"
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,127.518,132.302,"It is the actual name that was given to the instrument, Bonod as opposed to bond."
1991.91-763,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.205,137.997,They just made up a whole new word?
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,139.97,141.773,It does not.
1991.91-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,309.41,322.247,"If we're going to look that far behind the surface of the Bonod, don't... that its ultimate objective was to finance foreign commercial exchange in trading relationships between Argentina and other parts of the world?"
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,322.247,331.032,"But it was doing it not as... you know, sometimes some of the legislative history talks to in terms of entering the commercial marketplace."
1991.91-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,331.933,335.527,It was doing it so somebody else could stay in the commercial marketplace.
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,335.527,341.531,"--Yes, but it was doing it in implementing a basic sovereign function, that is exchange rate policy."
1991.91-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,351.599,357.633,Is anything that would fall within that broad base therefore non-commercial in your view?
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,357.633,384.78,"Not, not anything, but I do think that a kind of program that goes to where the courts have, in looking at foreign exchange have recognized that the regulation of foreign exchange markets are one of the core official responsibilities that... and if you look at this transaction, what it was doing is it was obligated to, as one of its responsibilities, to provide foreign exchange."
1991.91-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,411.461,436.728,"But it had issued the Bonod because in effect it was trying to find a means, or it had originally been trying to find a means of standing behind, as it were, the private trading entities of the country, and therefore it was, it had a rather more specific purpose in a more specific temporal period of the market than merely creating a foreign exchange structure in the general sense."
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,436.728,441.112,"Well, no, I think it was, Justice Souter, creating a foreign exchange structure."
1991.91-763,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,465.441,471.806,"Mr. Davis, it seems to me that all you're saying is that its purpose was a governmental purpose."
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,488.858,506.05,"Well, we think that the reason we think we are looking at the nature is because what we're saying is that when the statute, as you point out, says you should look at the nature of the activity, it's not saying that you should look at the nature of some abstract activity."
1991.91-763,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.461,547.151,"The question is whether it's a commercial act, and you don't think it's a commercial act to in effect guarantee to someone else the payment by someone who is purchasing goods?"
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,557.259,560.861,I think it could be considered a commercial act if it was guaranteeing.
1991.91-763,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.258,585.906,Making the pesos worth something.
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,585.906,587.909,"Well, in terms--"
1991.91-763,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.909,589.049,I consider that guaranteeing.
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,589.049,594.612,--I consider it fulfilling the foreign exchange responsibility.
1991.91-763,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.523,602.63,"You can call it that, but in fact they are guaranteeing that these pesos are going to be worth something in the international exchange."
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,602.63,606.219,--Through doing what the Central Bank does.
1991.91-763,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,714.701,734.216,"Well, Mr. Davis, if we were to disagree with you and conclude that jurisdiction was appropriate here, do you suppose Argentina can still assert on the merits an act of state defense in the litigation?"
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,734.216,744.691,"There would be an issue, and I think there is some learning in the Second Circuit which we do not necessarily subscribe to which would make it difficult in the Allied Bank case."
1991.91-763,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,944.03,957.357,"Well, Mr. Davis, I take it you take the position that a foreign corporation can never sue under the direct effects provision in the U.S.--"
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,957.357,959.44,"Well, I think that it would require--"
1991.91-763,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,959.44,959.711,--Is that right?
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,959.711,970.369,"--I think it would require that the transaction have many more connections with the United States than mere place of payment, perhaps if--"
1991.91-763,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,970.369,974.402,"Well, place of payment can be vitally important, can it not?"
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,974.402,980.847,"--I think the place of payment an be vitally important, but place of payment really is a characteristic of the transaction."
1991.91-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1025.037,1056.259,"Mr. Davis, doesn't your argument sort of make light of the fact that when there are transactions between parties with governments whose currency is not accepted as foreign exchange that the very fact of the transactions taking place requires in effect an enforceable term, such as the place of payment term, and a means of enforcing that place of payment term where the parties designate?"
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1084.6,1089.165,"Well, I think that, Justice Souter, you refer to two aspects of the place of payment."
1991.91-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1154.211,1162.827,"Well, I'll grant you that up to a point, but you're not claiming that the terms of the Bonod are governed somehow by the terms of the note, are you?"
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1162.827,1164.659,"No, I'm just using that--"
1991.91-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1164.659,1164.819,All right.
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1198.691,1228.18,"--I don't necessarily think that's correct, because if you look at the Bonod, I mean, it references, you know, Argentine decrees and Argentine law, and while the promissory note does not, you don't use it to interpret the language of the Bonod, the fact of the matter is that the instruments were made available at the same time and that therefore parties could know that there was another instrument which contained explicit submissions."
1991.91-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1245.303,1248.776,"If they can't sue in New York, where do they have to go to sue?"
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1248.776,1249.997,Well--
1991.91-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1249.997,1251.928,"They go to Argentina, don't they?"
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1251.928,1254.43,--One possibility is Argentina.
1991.91-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1270.782,1278.399,"Well you, in that case I take it you would agree that there wouldn't be a very bustling market in Bonods if everybody understood that you had to go to Argentina to collect."
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1278.399,1292.477,"--Well, I think that in terms of the market in Bonods it was, you know, an instrument that at the time it was issued it was issued as, to go back to the first point, really in substitute for foreign exchange."
1991.91-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1292.827,1305.526,"Well, if we, if... assume for the sake of argument that we do not accept that point, so that we are going to treat this essentially as a commercial transaction."
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1320.216,1336.498,"--Well, I think that whether there would or would not be a commercial market in fact for an instrument that doesn't contain submissions to jurisdiction, I think doesn't determine the expectations of the party."
1991.91-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1336.498,1338.669,"It's a pretty good pointer, isn't it?"
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1338.669,1353.211,"Well, it's in terms of yes, I think it makes it a less attractive instrument and which it is the reason why there was much, a smaller percentage of people took the Bonods than took the promissory notes."
1991.91-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1375.336,1376.455,"Oh, well, I grant you that."
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1394.268,1410.708,"--And we think, with respect, that the commercial reality is that the parties seeking to secure the protection of assured places to bring a lawsuit in fact demand that as part of a transaction."
1991.91-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1415.463,1415.783,They took their chances.
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1415.783,1421.116,"They took, they took their chances when the Bonod was accepted."
1991.91-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1440.46,1444.684,"Mr. Davis, let me ask you a provision, about a provision of the Bonods."
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1449.866,1452.848,--The Bonods?
1991.91-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1452.848,1453.789,Yes.
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1453.789,1455.562,They were payable in--
1991.91-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1455.562,1458.223,Payable in dollars.
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1458.223,1458.994,--Payable in dollars.
1991.91-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1458.994,1463.208,"Through transfer on the New York, Frankfurt, London, or Zurich markets."
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1464.71,1464.991,Yes.
1991.91-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1466.834,1470.256,Does that amount to saying they are payable in New York?
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1470.256,1473.308,"--I think for practical purposes, Mr. Chief Justice, it does."
1991.91-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1495.303,1499.607,And that was at the option of the bond holder where the funds would be received?
1991.91-763,0,39067,richard_j_davis,,1499.607,1500.959,"Yes, it was an option of the bond holder."
1991.91-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1503.701,1505.874,"Very well, Mr. Davis."
1991.91-763,1,39032,richard_w_cutler,,1506.975,1515.051,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1626.479,1628.732,Every certificate of debt?
1991.91-763,1,39032,richard_w_cutler,,1643.234,1644.864,"Your Honor, the answer to that is--"
1991.91-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1644.864,1646.514,That a commercial act?
1991.91-763,1,39032,richard_w_cutler,,1646.514,1649.518,"--No, I would say that that is a sovereign transaction."
1991.91-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1661.405,1666.43,So you do look just beyond the face of it to see whether it's a negotiable instrument or an instrument of debt.
1991.91-763,1,39032,richard_w_cutler,,1669.482,1670.153,"--Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.32,1914.554,"You know, that provision of the act that refers to it being based upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial act... and that act causes a direct effect in the United States, that's what you're relying on there?"
1991.91-763,1,39032,richard_w_cutler,,1928.144,1929.474,"--I don't know, Your Honor."
1991.91-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1974.216,1985.773,"--I wonder why you don't rely upon the middle of the three bases for jurisdiction, that is upon an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere."
1991.91-763,1,39032,richard_w_cutler,,1989.366,1990.077,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.077,1993.86,Isn't the word act there broad enough to include the act of default?
1991.91-763,1,39032,richard_w_cutler,,1993.86,1994.742,I think it may be.
1991.91-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1995.342,1999.576,"You don't ordinarily speak of a default as having been performed, do you?"
1991.91-763,1,39032,richard_w_cutler,,2001.219,2013.546,"--I think, if I may answer Justice Scalia's question first, I think, Your Honor, as an advocate I may not be able to make that argument, although we have thought of it."
1991.91-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2032.3,2034.283,"Well, my question becomes moot if you--"
1991.91-763,1,39032,richard_w_cutler,,2035.762,2057.577,"--But I would say, Your Honor, in terms of an act, because it does regard an act outside the United States with a direct effect in the United States, I think if you require a breach of contract to be some kind of positive act that pretty much takes away all breaches of contract."
1991.91-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.967,2084.806,"Very well, Mr. Cutler."
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2086.558,2103.679,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-763,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2173.069,2192.152,"Mr. Minear, do you agree with, accept the answer that Justice Scalia got that, to his question, that if a Bonod or any instrument had been issued for purposes of foreign aid that that could be considered when we decide whether the act applies or not?"
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2192.152,2201.95,"We think that might well be a commercial activity if it was, if the payment was made in the form of a commercial debt instrument that obligated the United States to pay money to a private creditor."
1991.91-763,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2201.95,2206.494,In other words you're saying that that would be looking behind the instrument to the purpose.
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2206.494,2207.666,"No, I--"
1991.91-763,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2207.666,2208.024,I'm sorry.
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2208.024,2217.491,"--I think I was saying that we look to, instead to whether the United States issued a debt instrument that is payable to a private party and that requires payment of money."
1991.91-763,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2219.013,2220.083,But if it was payable--
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2220.083,2224.215,"--acting in the same manner as a business corporation in issuing the debt instrument, we think that we would be liable to suit."
1991.91-763,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2224.215,2230.29,"--So that you, in effect you don't look to the purpose because you're answering the question based on the identity of the payee."
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2230.29,2234.233,"No, we're looking to the character of the instrument in which the transaction takes place."
1991.91-763,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2235.735,2240.477,"Well, if I go out on the market and I decide I want to buy a foreign debt instrument, do I know that?"
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2243.211,2245.382,"Well, you can look to the instrument itself."
1991.91-763,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2260.793,2277.225,"So you're saying if the government of Argentina or any government wants to take advantage of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act all it has got to do really is to indicate on the face of the instrument the context, if you will, in which the instrument is issued and that will suffice."
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2281.906,2283.458,Essentially that's... I agree with that.
1991.91-763,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2283.458,2284.279,Okay.
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2297.231,2307.209,"Oh, in the case of a foreign government, in that situation I should be clear that if it's a, a sovereign to sovereign transaction, and I am thinking in particular of currency swaps between--"
1991.91-763,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2307.209,2310.059,Suppose I'm buying potatoes from the Russian government and I pay them with a debt instrument.
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2311.902,2313.321,--That's likely to be a commercial transaction there.
1991.91-763,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.321,2316.664,So it doesn't depend on whether it's the government--
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2316.664,2327.133,"No, I would say that we would draw an exception, however, in a case... for instance, the central banks of various countries will engage in currency swaps to maintain liquidity between their two central banks."
1991.91-763,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.203,2338.417,--I'm not sure we all aren't getting into purpose to some extent.
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2345.683,2346.964,In some situations--
1991.91-763,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2346.964,2347.914,"The purpose here is commercial, but--"
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2347.914,2357.891,"--With all respect, Justice Scalia, I think that in some cases it's true that it's difficult to determine the nature and activity without some resort to purpose, but I don't think that that is this case here."
1991.91-763,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2359.19,2369.488,"--You're... if I may interrupt you, you're saying that the way to solve this problem that Justice Scalia and I both seem to have is to say at least don't look beyond the instrument itself."
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2369.488,2370.42,--That's correct.
1991.91-763,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2371.081,2373.501,"If it says this is a potato note, that's one thing."
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2379.708,2384.56,With respect to debt instruments I think that provides a very workable rule and it also provides certainty in the marketplace.
1991.91-763,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2408.837,2410.967,Do you think nexus is the same as a direct effect?
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2410.967,2415.15,"No, I am using the word nexus in a more general term of connection."
1991.91-763,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2475.595,2476.817,I promise you I didn't get it from there.
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2479.297,2486.673,"But in any event it's true that these three clauses do overlap to some extent, and that's true."
1991.91-763,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2630.051,2637.746,"But that too is kind of a nexus argument that we might expect in another context, I think, rather than its strictly an interpretation of this statute, isn't it?"
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2637.746,2649.473,"Your Honor, I think that in terms of the point that I am making here, that the, that this is the policy that underlies the direct effects test and underlies its application in this case."
1991.91-763,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2649.473,2650.615,"Well, how do we know that?"
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2650.615,2663.784,"I think that we have to rely at some level on what Congress was trying to achieve here, which was to make sure that when a foreign nation enters the commercial market it's subject to the same rules as other parties would be."
1991.91-763,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2669.208,2680.267,Do you agree with the court of appeals' observation that one of the purposes of Congress in enacting this act was to make sure that New York City kept its importance in the financial world?
1991.91-763,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2680.267,2682.077,"I would... no, Your Honor."
1991.91-763,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2773.841,2775.704,"Very well, Mr. Minear."
1991.91-763,3,39067,richard_j_davis,,2778.108,2779.1,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-763,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2807.627,2811.64,"Well, I think the Government's point is sort of an a fortiori point."
1991.91-763,3,39067,richard_j_davis,,2823.741,2851.29,"Well, I think that, Justice Scalia, if you look though at the way the courts have dealt with place of payment cases, the general jurisdictional rule under the long arm statutes and that Congress did reference that it intended essentially to be treating sovereigns similar to the way they would be treated under long arm statutes under this provision, would be the place of payment would not be sufficient to reach somebody under a long arm statute for jurisdictional purposes."
1991.91-763,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2875.075,2879.25,You say that place of payment is usually not enough under long arm statutes?
1991.91-763,3,39067,richard_j_davis,,2879.25,2879.43,Yes.
1991.91-763,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2879.43,2884.014,If I make a contract that's payable in a certain state I couldn't sue in that state?
1991.91-763,3,39067,richard_j_davis,,2885.734,2888.655,"If that is the, if that's the only connection."
1991.91-763,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2915.695,2919.579,"--Mr. Davis, your cases were all domestic cases, were they not?"
1991.91-763,3,39067,richard_j_davis,,2919.579,2920.129,Yes.
1991.91-763,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2920.129,2933.826,"Do you think the analogy between domestic cases and, domestic cases dealing with domestic states and cases dealing with states and the international foreign states in the international community really are a good authority, because--"
1991.91-763,3,39067,richard_j_davis,,2933.826,2934.798,Well... excuse me.
1991.91-763,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2934.798,2936.719,--Let me just tell you what I have in the back of my mind.
1991.91-763,3,39067,richard_j_davis,,2969.19,2975.575,"Well, I think that in the international context I would think it actually, Justice Souter, would go the other way."
1991.91-763,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3005.135,3011.278,I guess it's safe to say you certainly don't agree with the Second Circuit's reasoning that the point of all of this is to keep New York in the driver's seat?
1991.91-763,3,39067,richard_j_davis,,3011.278,3013.682,--I certainly do not agree with that reasoning.
1991.91-763,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3056.053,3057.045,"Thank you, Mr. Davis."
1991.91-763,3,39067,richard_j_davis,,3057.045,3058.234,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-763,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3058.234,3059.325,The case is submitted.
