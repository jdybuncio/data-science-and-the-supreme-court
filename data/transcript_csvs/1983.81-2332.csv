1983.81-2332,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.799,We'll hear arguments next in Norfolk Redevelopment against Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company.
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,80.302,86.036,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.81-2332,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,360.198,369.913,"Mr. Crenshaw, I suppose the Fourth Circuit has determined that as a matter of state law these things were personal property."
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,371.134,384.201,"--Justice O'Connor, I think that the Fourth Circuit must have been persuaded by the telephone company's interpretation of Transcontinental which is--"
1983.81-2332,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,384.201,388.225,"Well, in any event that was the Fourth Circuit's determination, was it not?"
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,388.225,390.746,--I think that is a reasonably fair statement.
1983.81-2332,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,393.658,394.75,All right.
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,405.166,431.853,"I would think so, but the difficulty here is I think you had a flat out decision by the Virginia Supreme Court which is contrary to the Fourth Circuit, and the Fourth Circuit in my judgment was a not too exhaustively reasoned opinion with respect to that so that I think that it is not facetious for me to assert in this Court that these facilities were in effect real property and not personal property."
1983.81-2332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,464.794,471.62,Is it essential to your argument that we disagree with the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit about what kind of property?
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,471.62,477.383,There are three bases on which I would contend that the claim would be denied.
1983.81-2332,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,541.714,543.595,Why do you suppose that is?
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,548.329,560.578,--The only reason that I can say is that the Congress was satisfied with the solution given by the Highway Act because that solution which was in Section 123 was retained.
1983.81-2332,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,561.968,582.201,"But, of course, in the language of the Relocation Act in defining a person it did not admit of any exception, and I think it is just strange that there would not be some reference in the legislative history to the utility problem."
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,582.201,596.172,I think it is strange that in all of those hearings with the hundreds really of representatives that there was no movement by utilities to have had their particular problem addressed.
1983.81-2332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,796.004,799.534,Does the Uniform Act apply to all federal condemnations?
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,799.534,800.806,"Yes, it does."
1983.81-2332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,800.806,802.185,Including highways?
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,802.185,803.377,"Yes, it does."
1983.81-2332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,939.008,944.331,What relocation expenses so-called are they claiming?
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,946.993,951.436,"Justice White, it is a little hard for me honestly to answer that because we have not got into damages."
1983.81-2332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,962.774,963.975,A new manhole.
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,963.975,965.706,"--the new facility, right."
1983.81-2332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,983.518,998.187,"You do not think that if the City just closed the street, for example, and there was not any so-called move at all there would not be any claim here?"
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,998.187,1000.117,"--Well, I will say this."
1983.81-2332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1006.712,1017.278,"Well, assume that Washington, D.C. builds a convention center that covers two or three blocks and you cannot go up and down Tenth Street any more."
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,1031.378,1033.83,--I think they would have claimed and the reason I say that--
1983.81-2332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1033.83,1034.859,For just filling up the holes?
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,1034.859,1037.453,"--No, the claim is far more than filling up the holes."
1983.81-2332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.63,1068.313,Unless you have already got a utility line in some other street that would serve the purpose.
1983.81-2332,0,23764,francis_n_crenshaw,,1068.313,1068.944,Right.
1983.81-2332,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1094.218,1097.721,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.81-2332,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1128.412,1136.267,"Mr. Schwartz, the Solicitor General has changed his mind in this case from the time of petition for certiorari."
1983.81-2332,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1137.238,1140.551,"There has been some change, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1983.81-2332,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1152.198,1155.979,I am not insisting that you do not have a right to change your mind.
1983.81-2332,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1157.521,1163.966,"We have to that degree certainly... Well, the question is no longer presented whether the Court should have granted the petition."
1983.81-2332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1165.415,1172.491,I know but that is not the extent of your prior position.
1983.81-2332,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1172.491,1173.102,That is right.
1983.81-2332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1173.102,1175.993,Your prior position was that this was a reasonable construction of the statute.
1983.81-2332,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1175.993,1179.266,"If I may continue, Justice White, that is quite right."
1983.81-2332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.266,1181.057,You have changed your mind on that?
1983.81-2332,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1181.057,1186.159,We have concluded that it is an erroneous construction of the statute.
1983.81-2332,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1383.129,1384.319,I have a little problem.
1983.81-2332,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1390.613,1394.927,Ordinarily we would say that would be true but--
1983.81-2332,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1394.927,1396.908,It is ordinarily any way.
1983.81-2332,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1399.499,1404.264,"--If the federal statute indicated an intent otherwise, but in this case we do not--"
1983.81-2332,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1404.264,1412.639,Could the federal statute say that property in a manhole in Virginia is personal property?
1983.81-2332,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1412.639,1414.709,--The federal statute does not--
1983.81-2332,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1414.709,1416.369,"Can a statute say that, a federal statute?"
1983.81-2332,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1416.369,1426.367,"--A federal statute could say that for the purposes of this statute the term ""personal property"" shall include the following, and the Congress could choose that manner of legislating."
1983.81-2332,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1430.17,1432.922,Then next they can say a man is a woman in Virginia.
1983.81-2332,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1432.922,1442.69,"Congress probably could do that, Your Honor, but again that is not the mode of analysis by which we perceive Congress has used the term 'moving personal property"
1983.81-2332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.748,1693.912,"Mr. Schwartz, did that bill go through the same committee that this bill, the Uniform Relocation Act, would have gone through?"
1983.81-2332,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1693.912,1698.835,"Justice Rehnquist, I do not know the answer to that question, and I am skeptical that--"
1983.81-2332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.835,1708.272,I wonder how relevant it is if you do not really have any knowledge that the same individuals on a committee compared the two and chose to leave them the way they were.
1983.81-2332,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1708.272,1713.965,--I think we have something special because there are three stages to this.
1983.81-2332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1752.571,1759.364,Mr. Kelly.
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,1759.364,1763.758,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.81-2332,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1965.6,1968.712,"Mr. Kelly, you used the word ""moving"" a moment ago in your argument."
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,1972.583,2006.106,"--They were moved in the sense in which that term is most frequently moved in the same sense in which it is used... If the hardware store referred to in Mr. Crenshaw's brief had been the property of the hardware store owner severed from the land by agreement and he had a right to move it or if some structure that was part of it he had a right to move from the land, it did not belong to the owner of the land."
1983.81-2332,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2007.428,2011.258,Are there two manholes out there where there used to be one?
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2011.258,2014.04,"Two manholes, Your Honor?"
1983.81-2332,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2014.04,2014.511,Yes.
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2014.511,2015.192,There used to be one?
1983.81-2332,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2015.192,2015.873,Yes.
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2015.873,2017.032,"No, Your Honor."
1983.81-2332,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2023.137,2030.132,Did they take up the manhole and move the manhole to another place?
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2030.132,2037.655,The manholes were not dug out of the ground and lifted and transferred to another place.
1983.81-2332,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2037.655,2041.629,"So they were not moved, were they?"
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2041.629,2048.785,There was no physical movement of them from one spot to another.
1983.81-2332,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2099.367,2102.818,Is there anything in the legislative history that will help you?
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2102.818,2104.701,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1983.81-2332,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2104.701,2108.424,Is there anything in the legislative history that will help you?
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2108.424,2109.925,"I am so sorry, Your Honor."
1983.81-2332,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2110.796,2120.71,Is there anything in the interpretive history that will help you in saying that this is what you mean by moving?
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2120.71,2122.553,By moving personal property?
1983.81-2332,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2122.553,2123.682,"Yes, sir."
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2127.886,2151.983,"The fact that in common acceptation when one of the tower lines constructed on one man's land in sight of us all is taken down and rebuilt on another man's land, the whole world would say the company has moved its power line."
1983.81-2332,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2151.983,2163.57,"But if you had a power line on one land and built a brand new power line on another man's land that would not be moving it, would it?"
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2163.57,2166.291,"Yes, I think, Your Honor, it would be."
1983.81-2332,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2166.291,2167.501,It would be moving?
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2167.501,2173.415,You would still... We would all still say the company has moved its power line.
1983.81-2332,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2284.278,2294.015,"Mr. Kelly, will you look at Section 202(a) that is quoted in the Appendix to the government's brief."
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2313.407,2315.56,"--It comes under (a)(1), Your Honor."
1983.81-2332,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2315.56,2318.452,You are not claiming actual direct losses of--
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2318.452,2320.984,"That is what, Your Honor?"
1983.81-2332,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2320.984,2327.157,--You are not claiming under (2) then that it is actual direct losses of tangible personal property as a result of moving.
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2327.157,2337.653,"No, the figure representing that loss appears in these claims in only one indirect way."
1983.81-2332,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2363.202,2377.05,"I do not know where you get that measure of damages under (1) which simply talks about actual reasonable expenses in moving himself, his family, business, farm operation or other personal property."
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2380.152,2404.338,"--Because, Your Honor, we would... The same statement... These same claims although we do argue and it is still our position that they are the cost of moving these utility lines the same thing is also--"
1983.81-2332,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.338,2406.249,But the statute does not say cost.
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2407.751,2411.821,"--I beg your pardon, the expense of moving the lines."
1983.81-2332,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2421.879,2433.227,"But if you do not move your line at all, if you do not move the physical personal property out of the ground how can you have any actual reasonable expenses incurred in moving it?"
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2433.227,2461.805,"--If that view of the expense of moving personal property were accepted which we still contest, if that were accepted the same figures still represent the expense of moving a business which is defined in the statute very carefully so as to mean any legitimate activity of business cannot be physically moved."
1983.81-2332,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.058,2471.592,What section of the statute is it that defines carefully the expenses incurred in moving a business?
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2471.592,2475.904,"4601, subparagraph 7."
1983.81-2332,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2475.904,2477.787,Is that in your brief?
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2477.787,2479.417,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1983.81-2332,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2534.681,2557.078,"All I see... I am looking on the Statute Involved Section of your brief, the red brief, at page vii and viii, and all I see set off for (7) is the term ""business"" means any lawful activity, excepting a farm operation conducted primarily for the sale of services to the public."
1983.81-2332,2,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2557.078,2558.267,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.81-2332,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2603.507,2613.965,"Now you have got a proviso in (2), 4622(a)(2) where you say you can also include"
1983.81-2332,3,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2637.22,2638.98,"No, Your Honor."
1983.81-2332,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2730.48,2735.865,"Mr. Kelly, I guess the lower courts have not resolved these questions yet have they?"
1983.81-2332,4,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2745.81,2773.987,They have not considered these questions except to the extent that they are necessarily included in the legal conclusion that a company in moving its facilities has moved or at least has moved its business or has moved its personal property from one place to another.
1983.81-2332,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2845.705,2847.518,"Mr. Kelly, may I ask you a question?"
1983.81-2332,4,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2847.518,2848.267,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.81-2332,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2848.267,2855.662,Am I correct in believing that the Court of Appeals did not rely on the provision that pertains to the moving of a business?
1983.81-2332,4,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2860.174,2862.816,They did not mention--
1983.81-2332,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2862.816,2865.437,They did not mention 4637.
1983.81-2332,4,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2865.437,2876.697,--the removal of personal property although they plainly regarded that the reconstruction of these lines amounted to moving the lines.
1983.81-2332,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.697,2878.647,But moving the lines is a question--
1983.81-2332,4,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2878.647,2879.629,They bear fully understood--
1983.81-2332,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2879.629,2883.9,--But the question of moving a business they did not really face up to?
1983.81-2332,4,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2883.9,2885.523,--It was never discussed.
1983.81-2332,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2885.523,2892.987,"Yes, because one might argue... I do not know if it is right or not... that that thinks in terms of moving an entire business or moving a facility or something like that."
1983.81-2332,4,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2892.987,2896.869,That point is indeed argued in the reply briefs.
1983.81-2332,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2946.872,2954.907,Did they agree that the move of the personal property was a move made as a result of the acquisition of real estate?
1983.81-2332,4,31307,joseph_l_kelly,,2954.907,2956.178,--That is the one thing they did not.
