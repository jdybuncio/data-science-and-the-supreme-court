1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,16.132,17.789,Yes Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,17.789,20.649,Mr. Chambers you may proceed whenever you're ready.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,20.649,22.305,Thank you.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,159.811,164.536,Do you have to persuade us Mr. Chambers that they're clearly correct?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,164.536,181.986,I think Your Honor that under the appellate procedural rules for considering cases on appeal that if there is sufficient evidence or -- to support the decision below that the court should sustain the decision of the District Court.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,376.747,383.715,How do you define a racially identifiable school as to use your phrase?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,383.715,396.981,One Your Honor that has a substantial disproportionate number of Black students in the school and consideration of the percentage of Black students in the system.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,396.981,400.674,In the system it's about 71% White and 29% Black?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,400.674,401.081,That's correct Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,401.081,401.955,Am I correct about that?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,401.955,402.925,Yes sir.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,402.925,409.206,"So, that if a school is 50-50, is that racially identifiable?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,409.206,413.857,Your Honor I think it would depend on the circumstances of a case and the facts in the case.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,413.943,417.749,"Well, how about the facts of this case, this school system, what is a racially identifiable school?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,417.749,424.911,I think that excess of 50% Black in a particular school would make that school racially identifiable.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,424.911,430.034,And an excess of how many -- how much percentage white?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,443.247,444.171,I think that is correct Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,444.171,447.844,And how high would it have to get to be racially identifiable?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,447.844,456.699,"In this system Your Honor, I think that 90% White would perhaps or excess of 90% White would perhaps make it racially identifiable."
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,456.699,459.166,"So, a school in this system in defining ourselves to this case."
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,459.166,461.453,"In this system -- that's correct, Your Honor."
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,461.453,473.444,"A school with 90% or more White students would be racially identifiable, and a school with 50% or more Negro students would be racially identifiable?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,473.444,474.528,That's correct Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,474.528,477.955,Would you think --- Was that -- excuse me.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,493.381,538.935,"Your Honor I think that the District Court was basically concerned with the racially identifiable Black schools, but in the November decision of the District Court, which appears on page 655 of the appendix, the court sets out the schools that considers to be racially identifiable White and racially identifiable Black, this appears on page 660A, and here the court says that schools that are 86 to 89% White or higher are considered racially identifiable White."
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,538.935,540.383,"So, the court's figure is 86 rather than 90%."
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,540.383,542.236,"86%, that's correct Your Honor."
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,542.236,544.188,And is the court's figure 50% Black (Voice Overlap) racially --
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,544.188,545.516,50% Black or higher.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,545.516,548.005,-- identifiable Black schools?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,548.005,549.809,That's correct Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,549.809,560.465,Tell me how many schools at all had the (Inaudible)
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,560.465,563.012,That's correct Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,563.012,575.956,"Do you know if there's any and I don't know, I'm asking for information, is there any state in the United States that at one time another historically maybe a hundred years ago, 150 years ago, didn't have segregated schools?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,575.956,577.77,That did not have segregated schools?
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,577.77,578.447,Do you know?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,578.447,582.047,"I'm not familiar with that Your Honor, I don't know."
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,584.098,585.212,It was more recent.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,585.212,586.398,That's correct.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,674.396,682.671,"Counsel, it will be difficult to have your argument fully and accurately recorded if you get too far away from the podium."
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,682.671,686.109,Alright.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,934.284,936.846,"Were those schools located in that northwest quadrant, that you pointed out?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,936.846,949.107,"That's correct Your Honor, we have a diagram here which shows the concentration of these schools and the north-south dividing line that the court mentioned."
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,971.806,975.594,Is that map on the same scale as the ones you used before it?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,975.594,976.294,That's correct Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,988.884,1008.722,"Since we've already interrupted you, may I -- could you answer couple of questions to make it clear to me what -- just what is and what is not in controversy here, as I understand it, the Mecklenburg County outside the city school situation is really not in serious controversy, am I wrong or --?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1008.722,1009.839,That's correct Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1009.839,1010.607,I'm right about that?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1010.607,1012.771,That's correct.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1012.771,1029.733,"And that the further understand that the big argument is about the elementary schools, there is a somewhat more limited in minor argument about the high schools involving the transfer of some 300 students outward."
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1034.795,1035.262,That's correct Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1035.262,1035.891,I'm right.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1035.891,1036.853,Yes Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1036.853,1039.851,Thank you.
1970.281,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1039.851,1066.733,"Mr. Chambers, let me bring you back to Mr. Justice Stewart's inquiry as to your definition of a racially identifiable school, do I understand from your question that under no circumstances in a unitized system, could a school be beyond the prescribed racial balance?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1066.733,1072.051,"Your Honor, I was addressing my answer to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg system."
1970.281,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1072.051,1076.649,I'd like you to answer on a general as a matter of general principle.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1076.649,1098.331,"Your Honor, I think that it would depend again on the circumstances of a case and as we defined racially identifiable school and would be one where the concentration of Black students is substantially disproportioned to the percentage of Black and White students in the system."
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1098.884,1113.488,"Then it follows from that if there is one school beyond the limits that you proposed then it is not unitized, the system is not unitized."
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1113.488,1122.049,I would agree Your Honor provided that there are plans available which can be implemented to eliminate that disproportionate representation.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1122.049,1125.071,This means then that you're arguing for racial balance?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1125.071,1131.704,"No, Your Honor, we are not arguing for racial balance as we understand both the board and the government to be saying."
1970.281,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1155.515,1160.411,"Well, I'd like to get away from the facts of this case into a general area."
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1177.157,1178.582,Yes I do Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1214.984,1217.883,"So, there is a difference between feasibility and reasonableness?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1217.883,1218.897,Yes Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1218.897,1220.557,Alright.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1243.635,1249.747,"No Your Honor, we are not arguing for an absolute ratio or percentage in each school."
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1258.12,1275.665,"Well, obviously or I should think obviously, very likely in a 97:3 ratio, you wouldn't have any all Black schools, all Negro schools would you but -- would you concede that there might be some all White school?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1275.665,1281.694,Your Honor I can't say because it would depend on the facts and circumstances of the case.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1281.694,1287.934,You mean on the location of the 3%?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1287.934,1288.691,That could be a factor.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1288.691,1289.021,(Voice Overlap)
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1289.021,1289.939,Yes Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1289.939,1301.802,"If they were scattered evenly through the total area then the natural consequence even of the neighborhood school concept would take care of it probably, wouldn't it?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1301.802,1311.912,Your Honor I have some difficulty with the neighborhood school but if the students are assigned according to non-racial district lines --
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1311.912,1312.867,I'm assuming that one.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1312.867,1315.154,And all the factors --
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1315.154,1332.587,"A part of my hypothesis that no effort was made to direct them to a particular place, but you do concede that there would inevitably be some all White schools probably in that kind of a system, it could happen."
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1332.587,1345.325,Your Honor it might but again I'm talking about hypothetical that I can't really discuss because it would all depend on what the facts and the situation would be.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1345.325,1363.013,"Now then conversely, if you had a 97 Negro, 3% White, you then might again have unavoidably some all Black isn't that true, all Negro?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1363.013,1367.106,Your Honor that again would depend on the circumstances and facts.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1385.087,1406.013,"But I glean from your answer, since you said depends on the fact that you're suggesting that there is not an absolute constitutional requirement to take this percentage and mechanically put it in effect in each individual school in the system."
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1406.013,1407.274,That's correct Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1528.101,1546.618,"Is there any analysis on this previous busing mileage that you told us about, 1969 and 1970 and before, how much -- what was out the county in connection with consolidated schools of the county and how much goes in the city?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1546.618,1559.067,"Your Honor the majority of the 23,000 students transported were in the county, the 5,000 students being transported by city buses were in the city."
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1559.067,1559.377,Yes.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1560.615,1562.122,"Public transportation, that's correct."
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1562.122,1563.602,I was talking about the school buses.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1563.602,1563.816,Yes.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1563.816,1565.206,The majority of them was out in the county?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1565.206,1565.575,The majority of them were out in the county.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1565.575,1588.089,"They handle the consolidated -- the typical pattern and as we both know has been for the one room school house, rural school house, ten or twelve or more often to be consolidated into a school and involving quite apart from any racial considerations, a great deal of the busing mileage."
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1593.376,1613.497,"That's correct Your Honor but one revealing fact in this record is that the school board had purposely located White schools, so that they would require transportation, they were away from Black neighborhoods and as I indicated among the goal of the 23,000 students transported, only 541 were Black."
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1677.59,1682.789,"Please that one Mr. Chambers, that was the school board's plan as of when?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1682.789,1685.209,As of February 2nd 1970.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1685.209,1695.264,"And that -- again, please correct me if I'm wrong, that as I understand it involves some, what one might call benevolent racial gerrymandering, am I wrong about that?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1695.264,1697.807,"That's correct, yes."
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1755.56,1762.48,And does the satellite -- the satellite involves one way busing or other form of transportation?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1762.48,1763.412,That's correct Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1763.412,1764.273,And only one way?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1764.273,1765.242,And only one way.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1798.878,1799.96,Outwardly.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1799.96,1800.842,Alright.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1849.975,1854.269,Now in the satellite district was there also a school building?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1854.269,1863.925,"In some areas, the students were previously assigned to either Northwest Junior High School, an all Black school or Piedmont Junior High School or JT Williams."
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1863.925,1871.688,"When there is a satellite district and this really – I didn't get the definition of terms, I thought that the --"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1871.688,1872.545,The satellite --
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1872.545,1881.932,"That involved one way busing to -- outwardly to -- usually outwardly in Charlotte to a school, from an area where there was no longer a school."
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1881.932,1887.596,"The way the satellite districts are proposed here, no Junior High School is in the satellite area."
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1887.596,1888.21,"Anymore, at least?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1888.21,1889.246,Anymore.
1970.281,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1903.863,1905.714,Would you mind defining a satellite.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1905.714,1911.839,"Satellite, Your Honor is a non-contiguous zone established to serve a school district."
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1951.101,1957.966,"Was that because the plan, the second plan took the flow of traffic into account more realistically?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1957.966,1959.563,That's correct Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1960.825,1964.063,And did this significantly shorten the travel time?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1964.063,1974.684,It shortened the traffic time and it was also easier to implement because we had the traffic arteries that were considered by the core consultant in proposing the satellite districts.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1974.684,1977.84,But it did shorten the traffic time significantly?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1977.84,1989.201,"Yes Your Honor because the satellite districts used the traffic arteries where the zone lines, the contiguous zones did not."
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2059.571,2069.875,"Could you say in a few words what clustering means, I should interject maybe that I think Bouvier is going to have to get out a new edition of his dictionary, in at least --"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2069.875,2070.302,Your Honor --
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2070.302,2073.795,-- comparing and clustering in satellites and these new terms.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2073.795,2080.004,Comparing has been used to describe the consolidation of two schools.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2080.004,2081.672,"Yes, with two-way movement."
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2081.672,2082.61,With two way movement.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2082.61,2083.371,"And what is clustering, (Voice Overlap)?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2083.371,2089.78,Clustering means the pairing of one might use that were a grouping of three or more schools.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2089.78,2096.335,"But usually what you do is enlarge your zone around three or more -- two or more school buildings, isn't that about it?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2096.335,2105.291,"Well, it's possible Your Honor, or you might use the school district that is not contiguous with the school district that is the -- as used in the question."
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2105.291,2108.629,"I thought that then would be pairing rather than clustering, if they're non-contiguous?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2108.629,2114.937,"No, we're talking about numbers of schools for pairing, and we're talking about an increased number of schools for clustering."
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2136.404,2139.495,And you have three areas in the cluster?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2139.495,2140.997,That's correct Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2145.293,2145.469,Yeah.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2153.93,2155.26,That's correct Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2155.26,2160.755,Are any of these more than three?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2160.755,2167.405,They are all either two White and one Black or three White and one Black school.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2205.378,2209.987,"The pairing involves by definition always only two schools, is that --?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2209.987,2211.468,That's the way we have been using the term.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2211.468,2213.306,And two way movement?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2213.306,2214.27,That's correct Your Honor.
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2214.27,2216.318,And non-contiguous?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2216.318,2217.528,"Well, they can be contiguous."
1970.281,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2217.528,2219.631,"They can be, yeah, I see."
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2219.631,2231.227,Let's go back for a moment to that last clustering that you were describing which is colored in red on your map and approximately it's a triangle.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2242.684,2245.185,"You mean from school to school, or from the outer limits of the perimeter."
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2245.185,2248.356,From the outer perimeter of one to the outer perimeter of the other.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2248.356,2262.987,"Your Honor according to the information supplied by the board, at the February -- at the July 1970 hearing, the longest distance in any of the clusters would be 12 miles."
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2262.987,2268.519,And the schools are not necessarily located at the outer edge of the perimeter?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2268.519,2276.578,That's correct but the board was measuring from the outer edge of the boundary to the outer edge of the boundary of the school that was involved.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2276.578,2283.715,What's the maximum distance between schools in that particular instance of the red cluster?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2283.715,2287.67,I don't have the maximum distance from school to school in that cluster.
1970.281,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2287.67,2289.329,"Of necessity, it's less than 12 miles."
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2289.329,2291.308,It's less than 12 miles.
1970.281,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.702,2312.661,What is the maximum mileage?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2318.093,2320.65,Your Honor the court found that the average mile --
1970.281,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2320.65,2322.936,I'm talking about what is the maximum?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2322.936,2332.696,"I don't have the actual maximum distance, but one of the exhibits that we produce show that some students transported as much as three -and-a-half hours, one way."
1970.281,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2332.696,2333.62,Three-and-a-half what?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2333.62,2334.806,Hours.
1970.281,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2334.806,2335.479,Hours?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2335.479,2336.401,Yes.
1970.281,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2337.432,2338.921,What was the mileage?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2338.921,2343.136,"I don't know the mileage of that Your Honor, as shown on an exhibit that was produced that the --"
1970.281,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2343.136,2345.234,90 miles or something like that?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2345.234,2348.188,I think it would be less than 90 miles.
1970.281,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2348.188,2350.764,Three hours.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2350.764,2354.297,I don't know the exact mileage that was involved in that but --
1970.281,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2354.297,2361.487,What is the maximum mileage under the recent order of the court?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2361.487,2369.985,"Within the schools affected, the maximum mileage according to the information supplied by the board was 12.5 miles."
1970.281,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.985,2371.384,That's the maximum now?
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2371.384,2371.982,Yes sir.
1970.281,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2403.001,2420.581,"I'm not talking about cluster, I'm just talking about under this order, under the operations of a school before this order was entered, do you have the maximum mileage in miles and not in hours?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2420.581,2427.259,"I do not have before me Your Honor, the maximum miles that students were transported previously."
1970.281,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2442.759,2451.243,"What's the difference in the mileage, maximum mileage in the old order and in this order?"
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2451.243,2459.24,Your Honor I can't say the maximum difference between the old and the new because I don't know the maximum distance previously.
1970.281,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2481.041,2491.343,It seemed to me like the point of the most interest would be the maximum mileage rather than the average mileage.
1970.281,0,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2491.343,2505.551,"Well Your Honor as the District Court found, the students involved in the plan directed by the court were being transported less distance and at less time than previously existed in the system."
1970.281,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3794.114,3798.176,May it please the court.
1970.281,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4324.832,4340.868,"Mr. Solicitor General, do you read McMillan's opinion, Judge McMillan's opinion as having proceeded on the premise that the constitution required or disestablishment required racial balance in the proportional sense?"
1970.281,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4340.868,4378.764,"Mr. Justice, I think he may have although again it is expressly disclaimed in the opinion but it seems to me that looking to what he did and the way he did it, and I certainly have a great understanding and sympathy for the problem with which he was confronted, that he may well have acted on the assumption that he was required to produce what I have called racial balance or what is the defined as no student may be assigned to a racially identifiable school."
1970.281,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4406.232,4410.797,And what is the definition that you use for a racially identifiable school?
1970.281,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4426.229,4444.407,I think that Mr. Chambers said more than 51% made it identifiable as a Black school.
1970.281,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4445.23,4449.313,But somewhere perhaps it was in one of the opinions.
1970.281,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4462.406,4473.244,"I think really the issue here is, if whether there can be any all Black Schools in the -- on the facts of these particular cases."
1970.281,2,46581,william_j_wagonner,,6500.835,6507.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.281,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6554.164,6556.743,Now what do you mean when you use the phrase racial balance?
1970.281,2,46581,william_j_wagonner,,6560.107,6568.516,"Pure racial balance, if you went to the limit of it, I would say would be that you would have 7129."
1970.281,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6568.516,6569.749,In each school building?
1970.281,2,46581,william_j_wagonner,,6569.749,6570.914,In each school building.
1970.281,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6573.74,6575.272,In what area?
1970.281,2,46581,william_j_wagonner,,6575.272,6575.911,In all of the school.
1970.281,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6575.911,6576.099,In a school district?
1970.281,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,6576.099,6577.111,In the county?
1970.281,2,46581,william_j_wagonner,,6577.111,6578.71,Yes sir.
1970.281,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6580.834,6582.462,"Now, is that what you --?"
1970.281,2,46581,william_j_wagonner,,6582.462,6583.368,I do not --
1970.281,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6583.368,6584.751,-- mean when you use that phrase?
1970.281,2,46581,william_j_wagonner,,6584.751,6587.839,"I do not mean, no sir."
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9035.303,9036.509,Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.281,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,9036.509,9041.079,Mr. Horack.
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9045.202,9050.291,Yes.
1970.281,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9107.522,9117.381,May I ask you what the record shows with reference to whether they are black people in that -- white people live in that area?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9119.244,9120.596,There be no black school.
1970.281,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9161.934,9170.19,Do you say he ordered that there should be no all black school in that area where there were 17% colored people?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9170.19,9171.553,He did.
1970.281,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9171.553,9173.023,Are you defending that?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9173.023,9173.946,No sir.
1970.281,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9250.843,9254.914,Would that February 5 order also defined order?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9254.914,9255.001,Yes sir.
1970.281,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9255.001,9256.125,Do you state that?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9256.125,9269.651,"If Your Honor, please, the final order if you're referring to the August 3rd order, I remind the court that there were those July hearings that were undertaken as result of remand."
1970.281,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9278.726,9280.377,And he reinstated it?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9280.377,9281.888,"Yes sir, he reinstated it."
1970.281,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9281.888,9295.954,"Paragraph six also says that pupils of all grade shall be assigned in such a way that is nearly is practicable of various schools at various grade levels, have about the same proportion of black and white students."
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9295.954,9297.083,Yes sir that's correct.
1970.281,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9329.637,9341.096,"It seems to me that the difference (Inaudible) so what is balance, what do you mean by balance?"
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9341.096,9358.258,"Mr. Justice Black, it's hard to define where the twilight zone but you've got the whole hog arrangement where every school in a system, for instance Charlotte-Mecklenburg has 70:30."
1970.281,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9367.883,9371.047,What do you mean by racial balancing?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9371.047,9385.069,"Racial balancing is a device that has as its objective, the proportionizing of the student bodies."
1970.281,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9385.069,9386.555,Whether they live there or not?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9386.555,9392.42,Whether they live there or not among the individual schools.
1970.281,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,9392.42,9394.318,"Here indeed every school, is that."
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9394.318,9402.214,"Well, every school, Mr. Chief Justice, but I believe the concept of racial balancing can be short."
1970.281,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9425.871,9427.646,What do you mean by that?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9427.646,9429.565,"Mr. Justice Black, I don't know."
1970.281,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9434.532,9440.701,"Well didn't he say Mr. Horack, I don't have his opinion right in front of me but I've read it more than once recently."
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9460.428,9460.884,That's correct.
1970.281,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9460.884,9473.472,"But he said, what we're going to do is but it can using the Court of Appeal's language, what can recently be done to make a maximum approach to that objective."
1970.281,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,9476.878,9489.804,"I would agree Mr. Justice for your interpretation that analysis where Judge McMillan said, but we can't get it would do it all the way."
1970.281,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,9492.844,9495.751,If we possibly can under the test of reasonableness.
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9495.751,9511.522,"But what I do suggest is that the District Court did not give real, sincere application to the Court of Appeals test of reasonableness."
1970.281,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9511.522,9514.386,"Well, perhaps not but at least --."
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9514.386,9521.251,In only that degree would I put a proscriptive Your Honors own (Voice Overlap) --
1970.281,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9521.251,9547.459,"But the ultimate question here I suppose the ultimate basic whereabouts question is, whether the United States constitution requires an effort, whether it be the maximum reasonable effort, or a maximum feasible effort, or the stricter test proposed by the petitioners of this in Mobile case, the maximum humanly possible effort."
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9557.879,9559.911,"And if Your Honor, is asking me."
1970.281,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9559.911,9560.986,That is not the ultimate issue.
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9560.986,9562.957,Do I think that is the ultimate issue?
1970.281,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9572.696,9577.195,"Question, that is just -- that is the issue."
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9577.195,9578.256,I intended to address --
1970.281,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9578.256,9580.111,"The area of the whole county, is that right?"
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9580.111,9581.345,Sir?
1970.281,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9581.345,9586.888,The percentage to be based on the respective populations of white and colored.
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9586.888,9591.033,Throughout the session Your Honor.
1970.281,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,9591.033,9618.794,"Would you think, can you tell me whether under not the North Carolina law, the school board would be permitted to establish a plan that went beyond the constitutional requirements but would be a plan which because of their plenary authority over schools would be one which the public or the citizens and the students had to accept."
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9618.794,9624.506,"Your Honor, that is a tough one and that's why you asked it."
1970.281,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,9809.145,9814.271,Let's me test that with this question.
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9839.382,9854.734,"If Your Honor please, I think that it gets down with a reason why the differential was made, if it were made strictly if you would presume with me for a racial balancing reason."
1970.281,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,9854.734,9857.417,"No, irrespective of race."
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9858.454,9859.446,Yes sir.
1970.281,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,9860.522,9862.359,"No constitutional question there, is there?"
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9862.359,9863.912,No.
1970.281,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9882.051,9894.172,"Thar's because you think as I gather, that's the state has complete control of its school except so far as forbidden by the constitutional."
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9894.172,9895.679,Yes sir.
1970.281,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9952.827,9954.078,On a count of race.
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9954.078,9956.085,On a count of race.
1970.281,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9987.551,9990.009,May be then I have misunderstood it.
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,9996.038,9999.272,"Excuse me, I concede that."
1970.281,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10013.128,10015.664,But the plan in fact did have a benign racial --
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10015.664,10016.528,It did.
1970.281,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10058.902,10098.746,"Your point I guess is that this is not perhaps the individual constitutional right of an individual public school student but rather it's the constitutional duty of every school board to operate a non discriminatory system in some what of an analogy to the jury cases -- that's the duty of a state to have a non discriminatory jury system, but it's not the right of any particular defendant to be tried by a jury which is racially representative of the racial make up of the community."
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10100.282,10109.829,"Not quite, I say your last namely that duty of a school board who established a non discriminatory system."
1970.281,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10109.829,10110.986,That's the constitutional duty.
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10110.986,10114.597,So I'm with you on that phase of it.
1970.281,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10129.976,10131.775,Well that's right and why do you say it is?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10131.775,10148.984,"I say it is to go to school in a system that where as far as pupil assignment is concerned, the areas however devised, however arranged are --"
1970.281,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10148.984,10150.048,Racially non discriminated.
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10150.048,10151.458,Without any racial balance.
1970.281,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10154.46,10171.864,And I did -- I think I understand.
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10171.864,10205.436,"As far as back to this racial balancing business, the time is running short but I would commend to Your Honor's consideration, the following portions of the District Court order if there's any lingering doubt that in fact Judge McMillan did prescribe racial balancing. Appendix 710-A to December 1 order, the appendix 822-A of the February 5 order."
1970.281,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,10205.436,10206.641,You're going a little fast for me.
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10206.641,10207.248,Well I'm sorry.
1970.281,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,10207.248,10208.943,What's the first one now?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10208.943,10221.84,"Appendix 710-A, that's the December 1 order and that's where he said that the court will start with the goal or that there should be idea of the 71:29 ratio."
1970.281,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,10226.09,10233.729,"Now, would you stop a moment -- what's the paragraph 710-A that you refer?"
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10243.957,10245.525,This was the portion --
1970.281,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,10245.525,10253.575,"This is the December 1 order, 710-A."
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10253.575,10255.563,Yes it's at paragraph 12 Your Honor.
1970.281,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,10255.563,10257.788,And that's why I'm looking at fixed racial --
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10257.788,10269.329,"Well it starts down there and default of any such plan, the court will start with authority that it advanced the order April 23, that effort should be made to ratio to 71:29 ratio."
1970.281,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,10279.656,10280.783,Well that's the one I guess.
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10280.783,10285.744,That's the one Mr. Justice White referred to.
1970.281,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,10339.648,10350.551,Are you arguing with that demands of the continuing surveillance to maintain substantially the 71:29 racial balance?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10350.551,10351.968,Forever you mean?
1970.281,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,10352.703,10355.5,I'm asking you.
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10361.684,10367.023,"Mr. Chief Justice, your idea about this is good as mine, and I have none."
1970.281,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,10367.023,10369.692,But what would continuing control mean?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10376.791,10398.883,"I think very definitely that is what he is saying to us and I think it portends rather grave problems as a constitutional matter and as a practical matter, from here now."
1970.281,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,10407.068,10409.938,How long is this case been in court already?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10409.938,10417.472,"This Court was instituted back in 63, 64, 65."
1970.281,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,10417.472,10419.485,It's not 70?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10419.485,10420.323,"No sir, we --"
1970.281,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,10420.323,10423.721,Why worry about impingement?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10423.721,10428.113,"Mr. Justice Marshall, we're deeply concerned about the future."
1970.281,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,10466.075,10467.206,Can I ask you a question?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10467.206,10467.534,Yes sir.
1970.281,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,10467.534,10475.67,You say the school board went beyond what do you think the constitution required?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10475.67,10479.081,That's correct.
1970.281,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,10479.081,10483.889,"Would you say it went there on its own initiative, or was it told to do so?"
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10483.889,10499.031,"I think that, Mr. Justice, I think the school board went to this school board plan that we say it went beyond the constitution “voluntarily” under the pressure of the District Judge."
1970.281,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,10499.031,10505.55,How about the Department of Health education welfare?
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10505.55,10508.08,There was no problem on that school.
1970.281,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,10508.08,10508.752,No problem.
1970.281,3,17682,benjamin_s_horack,,10508.752,10509.627,No sir.
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,11310.446,11310.937,Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.281,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,11310.937,11345.056,"Somewhere during the course of your discourse, it would help me, if you would suggest something about your view on the continuing surveillance nature of this order and what does the court do if in rather say three years they find that pattern of population has substantially altered so that the 7131 is no longer a remedial measure, under the standards laid down by that court."
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,11345.056,11349.387,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1970.281,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,11687.59,11706.974,"You're talking, now that branch of what you just said is talking, is directed to an appropriate or at least permissible exercise of a District Court's discretion, equitable discretion to correct a conceded previous constitutional violation. Do I understand that correctly?"
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,11706.974,11707.697,Exactly right.
1970.281,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,11707.697,11716.188,"You're not talking, -- we've not been talking about what a board's constitutional duty substantively is --"
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,11716.188,11717.328,That is absolutely right.
1970.281,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,11717.328,11717.929,Okay.
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,11717.929,11730.182,"And now I'm at the point where I have Chief Justice's question about the duty in such a situation to try to plan an assignment system, that will work in terms of Green."
1970.281,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,11887.227,11912.902,But would you agree Mr. Nabrit that the school boards like other bodies can make honest mistakes of error in the size of the school that they plan and the location of it and honest errors in the sense that the future development of the community proves that their original judgment was not very good.
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,11914.162,11917.764,I think I'm not addressing in any of those areas.
1970.281,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,11917.764,11966.138,"But suppose that happens with respect let's say to anyone of those two paired or three, or four of those paired groups so that at the end of three years, something that was substantially 71:29 now, under Judge McMillan's order, turns out to be 80:20 or 90:10, does the court have something like a reapportionment function to order the school board to redraw its lines and be gerrymandered so as to restore the 71:29 again?"
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,11966.138,11968.001,My time is really struggling.
1970.281,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,12118.929,12139.268,Let me interrupt you for a moment to say that we allow the other side of the table about four minutes extra and so we'll allow you to run till three o'clock which will give you a little bit more time in view of our balancing of time problem anyway.
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,12139.268,12140.765,I appreciate that.
1970.281,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,12144.596,12149.555,You've suggested this is a continuing duty of the school board.
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,12164.177,12187.185,"Well, the real problem is that unless we have a test based on results, we are left with a test based on good faith."
1970.281,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,12245.945,12257.813,"You say proper test is a result oriented test and that that test should be as I understand it that there be no racially identifiable school, individual schools."
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,12269.547,12285.989,"Though racially identifiable are minority schools and we do focused on that because it -- the segregation system had two characteristics, I think that it had at least two that are relevant to this analysis."
1970.281,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,12350.021,12353.321,It's either all black or racially identifiable.
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,12357.131,12358.633,I do not speak precisely.
1970.281,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,12363.908,12368.453,-- minority in that particular school district.
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,12368.453,12371.634,"And by that -- now, it's the black minority."
1970.281,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,12371.634,12376.374,Well what if they are the majority at a particular school district.
1970.281,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,12376.374,12383.43,"What about (Inaudible) high schools, you would say that you couldn't have a minority white school?"
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,12383.43,12384.999,"Well, I don't say that."
1970.281,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,12422.882,12423.422,But you're not --
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,12423.422,12425.241,But that's not our submission.
1970.281,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,12425.241,12429.189,But that is the senior high school situation in this particular plan.
1970.281,4,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,12429.189,12432.264,No it's not.
1970.281,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,12479.154,12482.499,I think your time is up Mr. Nabrit.
