1990.89-1158,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.448,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-1158, Mercedel W. Miles v. Apex Marine Corporation."
1990.89-1158,0,16230,allain_f_hardin,,11.849,14.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1301.248,1304.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1158,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1352.194,1361.123,"Before you leave Moragne, when you say it painted with a broad brush, I take it you are saying that nothing in the opinion made it seem to turn on the fact the man was a longshoreman."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1361.123,1376.46,"--I think there is some language in Moragne that has been seized upon... seized upon is too strong a word, Mr. Justice Brennan... Stevens, is too strong a word which has been interpreted by the lower courts to say that Moragne applied to seamen."
1990.89-1158,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1385.496,1385.747,Right.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1385.747,1386.138,--to a seaman.
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.731,1432.614,By the circuit justice of the Fifth Circuit.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1432.614,1433.165,Sir?
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.165,1437.607,The dissent was by the circuit justice for the Fifth Circuit.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1437.607,1438.408,Is that right?
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.408,1439.039,Yes.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1439.039,1445.602,"But even if you apply Gaudet to seamen, I don't think we can extend it that far."
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.573,1459.9,"Wouldn't you have been surprised, be surprised though that the majority in Gaudet, five, or whatever it was, would have come out differently if a seaman had been injured?"
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1459.9,1465.616,"--I think Congress enters the field for the seaman, and I think the answer is yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.757,1471.899,You mean because of the Jones Act?
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1471.899,1472.109,"--Yes, sir."
1990.89-1158,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1474.422,1480.377,"did you make this point in your brief, that there's no wrongful death action at all for the seaman?"
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1480.377,1481.376,"--Yes, sir."
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.882,1504.172,"But except for the Jones Act, I would suppose that the majority would have come out the same way if it had been for a seaman, because the Jones Act was cited right in their face."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1504.172,1506.363,The Jones Act didn't find Gaudet--
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1506.363,1507.165,"I know, I know."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1512.55,1513.091,--Because the Jones--
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.091,1514.213,That was the argument of the dissent.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1514.213,1514.6,"--Yes, sir."
1990.89-1158,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1534.205,1536.216,But how about in Moragne?
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1544.394,1547.516,Moragne did not deal with the Jones Act.
1990.89-1158,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1552.16,1558.875,"Sure, but the same type of argument could have been made there, and the Court recognized a cause of action."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1558.875,1561.326,There would have been... I don't know that that argument was in fact made.
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.85,1608.29,He doesn't need it.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1608.29,1608.641,--Sir?
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1608.641,1609.392,Doesn't need it.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1609.392,1613.656,"Well, whether he does or doesn't, he's got a compensation act."
1990.89-1158,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1656.546,1663.852,"Well, I guess all the lower courts have recognized a survival action, haven't they?"
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1667.856,1672.579,"I don't think they have recognized it, except for Evich, in the case of the Jones Act seaman."
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1738.81,1742.149,Are you arguing that there should be no survival action in this case at all?
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1742.149,1746.344,No general maritime law survival action available to the beneficiaries of the seaman.
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1746.344,1750.027,"Well, the Fifth Circuit recognizes such though, doesn't it?"
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1750.027,1752.878,"Not... not in a seaman's case, I don't think."
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.929,1756.291,What... what's involved in this case?
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1757.95,1758.721,"--This case, the seaman--"
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.721,1765.516,"I know, but the Fifth Circuit held that in a survival action you can't recover wages."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1765.516,1767.257,--Future lost wages.
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1768.827,1772.119,"Well, I know, but why did they get to that if there wasn't a survival action at all?"
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1772.119,1778.144,"--Because they said the position of the petitioner in citing Evich v. Morris, they didn't agree with Evich v. Morris."
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.924,1790.075,Exactly.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1793.557,1796.078,"I don't think there is in the case of a true seaman, Your Honor."
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.078,1799.06,"Well, isn't there a true seaman here?"
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1799.06,1799.781,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1799.781,1804.663,"Well, but the Fifth Circuit didn't hold that there is no survival action at all."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1804.663,1805.334,It didn't give him one.
1990.89-1158,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.334,1820.835,And he sued under the Jones Act.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1820.835,1821.246,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1158,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1823.526,1825.977,And what was the verdict for?
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1825.977,1828.079,"Conscious pain and suffering, and loss of support."
1990.89-1158,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.079,1828.79,During his lifetime?
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1828.79,1829.591,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1158,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1829.591,1833.795,But you are going farther than the Fifth Circuit.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1841.142,1850.208,"There is certainly, Mr. Justice Stevens, there is certainly a survival action as provided by the Jones Act, and that is what the Fifth Circuit approved, and that is what we paid."
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.364,1858.673,"--Well, that's right, that's right."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1865.047,1865.618,General maritime law.
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1865.618,1866.519,--general maritime law.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1880.672,1880.962,That's correct.
1990.89-1158,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1882.342,1893.761,"And then, and Justice O'Connor was correct earlier when she said all of the circuits have agreed, that have addressed this point, that there is a such a survival cause of action for other kinds of damages, not these damages."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1893.761,1894.479,That is correct.
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1894.479,1894.639,All right.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1896.161,1898.843,"There is one as for a seaman, Your Honor."
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1898.843,1901.357,"I know, but you're saying under the general maritime law there is none."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1901.357,1904.747,"Not to a seaman, because his rights are set forth in the Jones Act."
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1904.747,1904.888,All right.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1909.592,1910.751,I think that is a correct reading.
1990.89-1158,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1910.751,1923.76,"Then you are really asking for a greater relief than the Fifth Circuit gave you, and I'd guess you didn't cross-petition, did you?"
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1923.76,1926.873,On another issue on this.
1990.89-1158,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1930.415,1945.005,"If we held that there was... there was no survival action under general maritime law in this case, would we do anything other than affirm the judgment of the court of appeals?"
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,1945.005,1952.639,"I think you would hold what Higginbotham suggested should be held, and what I think Tallentire did."
1990.89-1158,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2083.087,2096.485,"But we're talking about unseaworthiness generally, and it's recognized in the law of torts that compensation is in part to... in large part to ensure proper conduct on the part of employers."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,2097.888,2107.064,"--I'm glad Your Honor mentioned the word unseaworthiness, because unseaworthiness in this specific case was found to be liability without fault."
1990.89-1158,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2237.737,2246.002,"Again on this point, I just want to be sure I haven't lost track of the case, the Fifth Circuit in this case assumed that the cause of action was available to seamen?"
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,2246.002,2246.462,"--Yes, sir, it did."
1990.89-1158,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2246.462,2248.355,Assumed that both causes of action were available--
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,2248.355,2248.565,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1158,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2248.565,2250.919,--but did not allow the recovery in both of them.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,2250.919,2251.249,"Yes, it did."
1990.89-1158,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2251.249,2253.71,May I just ask... ask you your own view?
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,2264.335,2274.794,"It did for a longshoreman, because the Florida Supreme Court gave its opinion that the State death act did not provide a remedy based on unseaworthiness."
1990.89-1158,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2304.953,2308.106,"Does the Florida case that you mentioned... I don't know, it's probably not cited in the briefs."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,2316.894,2317.432,"--No, sir."
1990.89-1158,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2322.828,2322.939,--Right.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,2322.939,2336.499,"And the district court or the court of appeals, and I don't remember which, but it is discussed in the Moragne opinion, certified to the Florida State Supreme Court the question of whether its wrongful death statute encompassed an unseaworthiness remedy."
1990.89-1158,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.611,2339.995,"The answer was no, but that was a matter of State law."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,2346.75,2347.932,A lot of people don't understand this whole field.
1990.89-1158,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2349.043,2351.023,"--Well, but it's a simple proposition."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,2371.429,2376.043,"I would think it did for longshoremen, because that's the class of claim that it dealt with."
1990.89-1158,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2376.043,2382.168,"You think it did, but it really hasn't been... has it been decided, do you know?"
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,2382.168,2383.179,I am not aware of anything.
1990.89-1158,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2383.179,2383.558,Okay.
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,2383.558,2390.874,"And there is no court saying that Moragne applies to a seaman, no supreme court saying that."
1990.89-1158,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2421.574,2433.312,But haven't all the lower courts for 20 years read Moragne as indicating there is a general maritime wrongful death act for seamen?
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,2433.312,2436.364,"I wouldn't agree all, but a lot of them have."
1990.89-1158,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2436.364,2440.816,"Oh, I think pretty... you'd be very hard pressed to find any that haven't."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,2440.816,2441.828,The ones in the Fifth Circuit have.
1990.89-1158,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2473.818,2485.985,"But you know, it's entirely consistent with that... of course, they should... they are intended to take care of seamen wherever they are, but they do not necessarily foreclose other remedies that may be provided to seamen by either other statutes, maritime law, State law, whatever it is."
1990.89-1158,1,25402,gerard_t_gelpi,,2494.921,2496.072,"--Yes, sir, it is."
1990.89-1158,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2558.083,2560.017,"Thank you, Mr. Gelpi."
1990.89-1158,2,16230,allain_f_hardin,,2561.729,2575.557,"Justice Stevens, I would only point you to a case, Fifth Circuit, matter of S.S. Helena, 529 F. 2d 744, where it specifically held that a State wrongful death statute was preempted by the Moragne cause of action."
1990.89-1158,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2662.683,2674.101,"Well, now, Mr. Hardin, that statement appears in some cases, that seamen are wards of the court, but that dates from centuries ago, when seamen really were in a tough position."
1990.89-1158,2,16230,allain_f_hardin,,2681.216,2683.157,"--Your Honor, I disagree."
1990.89-1158,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2707.495,2710.056,"Well, certainly, but that doesn't necessarily mean hardship."
1990.89-1158,2,16230,allain_f_hardin,,2714.34,2716.483,"Well, they can't walk away from the vessel, Your Honor."
1990.89-1158,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.818,2724.46,Maybe they are wards of the captain.
1990.89-1158,2,16230,allain_f_hardin,,2724.46,2734.305,"Well, they are wards... in that sense they are, because I think that is what the court is trying to do by saying that, is to impose a burden upon the captain to watch these men."
1990.89-1158,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2737.888,2743.273,"Do you ever consider the union, the union and the captain?"
1990.89-1158,2,16230,allain_f_hardin,,2745.564,2746.113,"The captain runs it, Your Honor."
1990.89-1158,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2746.113,2746.803,You want to bet?
1990.89-1158,2,16230,allain_f_hardin,,2749.384,2755.979,"Well, when that vessel out there... when that vessel is out there it is the captain that operates the vessel, Your Honor."
1990.89-1158,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2755.979,2756.48,xxx.
1990.89-1158,2,16230,allain_f_hardin,,2756.48,2772.091,"Well, actually it is interesting because they are saying there is no general maritime cause of action, yet Justice... Judge Rubin recognized that they had a cause of action under general maritime law against the union, despite all of the congressional acts dealing with unions."
1990.89-1158,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2834.168,2835.81,"Thank you, Mr. Hardin."
