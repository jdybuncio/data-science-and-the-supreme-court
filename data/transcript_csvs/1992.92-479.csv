1992.92-479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.559,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-479, TXO Production Corporation v. Alliance Resources Corporation."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,11.855,14.152,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-479,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.47,201.028,"Mr. Phillips, the respondent has come back with a proposal that suggests that the evidence in this case meets all those standards."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,204.683,212.618,"Meets all... well, actually what they argue is that it meets the standards that the Court sort of noted in Haslip as the Green, Alabama factors."
1992.92-479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,244.59,258.067,"Well, the Supreme Court of West Virginia gave the impression I thought in its opinion not that there was any physical... but that your client acted with malice in the really nasty sense of the word."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,258.067,268.361,"The West Virginia Supreme Court certainly seemed to indicate that, although it is a little difficult to understand on this record on what basis you would reach that conclusion in light of the slander of title claim."
1992.92-479,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,272.359,281.934,"Yes, but if the case comes to us, we should... I suppose we would not quarrel with that judgment of the... that there was malice."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,281.934,290.649,"--Well, there is no basis in the jury's verdict necessarily to find malice because the jury was told that it could award punitive damages simply for reckless disregard and without malice."
1992.92-479,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,298.957,302.331,"Yes, but do you lose the case if we assume there's malice?"
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,302.331,303.034,"Oh, no, of course not."
1992.92-479,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,304.454,305.017,"Well, that's what I thought."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,305.47,306.189,My basic point--
1992.92-479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,321.324,321.934,--Well--
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,321.934,328.789,"And even if you accept that it gets you over the threshold of some punitive award, it certainly doesn't take you into the $10 million range for this kind of tort."
1992.92-479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,328.789,338.364,"--But certainly if you're looking for reasons why the jury might have found $10 million, it's more likely that they found malice than that they simply found reckless disregard."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,339.722,341.815,"I would agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,368.43,409.429,"Mr. Phillips, on that point, if the State of West Virginia had had, prior to your client's conduct here, a clear rule, whether it be a rule of statute or previously announced common law, to the effect that punitive damages may be awarded by reference not merely to the verdict in the tort action, but by reference to the extent... the economic extent of the harm either intended or potentially threatened by the tort, even though not realized, would you say that there was either a procedural or a substantive due process violation in applying that rule?"
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,409.429,416.441,"The... if that rule, which is obviously the rule that respondents in a sense urge the Court to adopt--"
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,416.441,419.051,"That's how you get a basis for $10 million, if there is one, yes."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,419.051,424.813,"--Right, and their... and that is part of their quest to come up with a number of $5 to $8 million because that is the potential gain."
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,436.559,442.899,"Well, but let me start just with the general proposition, which is what I was trying to get at with my question."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,451.256,452.677,--It is hard to evaluate it in the abstract.
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,523.601,532.27,"Well, if you had complete... if you had adequate knowledge of the rule in advance, why would it make any difference even if it were a common law rule?"
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,532.27,535.987,"Oh, I don't think it would make any difference if it were a common law rule."
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,540.471,559.043,"So, your quarrel here is not with the general proposition that the other side advances, that in fact, it's the risk of harm threatened that should be the basis for engaging in a proportionality analysis, if that's what we're going to call it, but your objection is to its application here."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,564.181,568.899,"Well, we clearly wouldn't have had any notice of it because this is an argument that didn't arise until the briefs in this Court."
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,572.163,580.379,"Of course, did you have any... were you on notice that there was, in fact, a different and more favorable theory of punitive damages in West Virginia?"
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,580.379,582.236,At the time of the trial?
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,582.236,582.611,Yes.
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,582.611,584.361,Or at the time of the conduct at issue?
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,584.361,586.828,"Well, actually I suppose it ought to be at the time of the conduct."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,586.828,610.507,"It's sort of difficult... at that stage in the process, to be sure, the procedures were less well formulated than they have since become, but to the extent that Garnes, the decision of the West Virginia Supreme Court subsequent to this Court's decision in Haslip, reflects basically the West Virginia Supreme Court's analysis of the appropriate inquiry that ought to be undertaken, the rules presumably would have been quite favorable as they ultimately played out."
1992.92-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.881,622.221,"Of course, on that theory, you can never develop a common law of punitive damages because the first case would be unconstitutional, there being no notice of it."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,624.315,630.312,"Well, you could clearly have... there's no quarrel about whether or not a punitive award could be imposed in a particular circumstance."
1992.92-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.296,632.546,--Without notice.
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,643.839,645.386,--I think that would be fine.
1992.92-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.321,697.63,Why is the new adoption of a theory any worse than the new adoption of the whole doctrine?
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,710.358,712.03,But what you don't do--
1992.92-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,712.03,716.762,Why is it... why is adopting a theory of punitive damages any worse than adopting the whole thing?
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,716.762,719.418,--It's the timing of adopting the theory of punitive damages.
1992.92-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.618,764.697,It's not a notice problem.
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,767.743,771.241,"Yes, and a procedural trial problem."
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,771.241,793.497,"Does the case boil down then to the fact that you really do not dispute the position as a general matter put forward by the other side that the expected or anticipated harm, even though not realized, can be the base for... the baseline, as it will, for the award, that we are really here to review the question whether, in fact, there was adequate evidence to support the instructions as given?"
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,793.497,794.933,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,794.933,795.402,That's it.
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,795.402,796.215,Yes.
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,796.215,797.449,It's a fairly narrow case then.
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,797.449,810.818,"Well, we brought this case on the theory that the West Virginia courts imposed the verdict on us, and we defended it and presented it to the Court under those terms because it may be a narrow theory, but it's an important one."
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,819.251,820.017,"Yes, but that isn't what you would have us decide."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,829.873,830.154,--Right.
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,839.135,847.601,"Well, I think you're telling us that we're supposed to decide whether there is an evidentiary instruction-verdict fit, which is a different concept of fit."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,847.601,848.007,Well--
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,848.007,855.925,"And it may well be a... for $10 million, it may well be a very worthy exercise, but I think it's a little bit narrower than what you were saying a minute ago."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,855.925,869.216,"--But see, I think the reason for the way we view this I suppose in somewhat different terms is we came to the case with what was in front of us in West Virginia and brought that to the Court's attention as an important issue on its own terms."
1992.92-479,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,911.167,914.916,"Mr. Phillips, why do you say no potential harm?"
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,924.679,926.115,To other victims.
1992.92-479,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,926.115,928.817,"Well, but is that part of the calculus or not?"
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,928.817,948.575,"Well, I think that... to my mind that reflects more the passion and prejudice problem that's inherent in the bad acts evidence that was put into this case because if you read that language carefully, it cannot possibly be that he reaches that conclusion based on the slander of title claim in West Virginia alone because he's talking about a pattern of fraud."
1992.92-479,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,972.004,972.363,You don't--
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,972.363,974.049,--and could not have been the basis for the jury's verdict.
1992.92-479,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,974.049,981.639,--You don't think there's any basis in this record for figuring out how much harm might have been caused to this particular litigant if the program had been successful.
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,981.639,988.995,I think it would be perfectly acceptable for that inquiry to be undertaken on remand after this verdict is set aside.
1992.92-479,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1036.023,1038.271,What do you think the expected gain might have been?
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1039.991,1044.926,This record doesn't indicate anything about what the expected gain would have been because it wasn't an issue in the case.
1992.92-479,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1046.705,1049.94,They couldn't tell how valuable the property was.
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1049.94,1056.235,"--We couldn't even begin to know whether or not those are wild projections, whether they really went into anybody's calculations on any of this stuff."
1992.92-479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1056.235,1080.459,"Mr. Phillips, did I gather from a remark you made a moment ago that you think that West Virginia could not punish a... in the sense of inflict punitive damages on a defendant who had committed one bad act in West Virginia and had committed a series of similar bad acts in other States?"
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1080.459,1086.035,I don't think you could punish them for the potential injury to the others in other States.
1992.92-479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1100.498,1107.589,What if it were shown that no lawsuits had ever been brought against the defendant for these bad... similar bad acts in other States?
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1112.571,1116.1,"Well, but I mean, it's clearly not the only opportunity."
1992.92-479,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.017,1133.859,You don't think a career offender could be punished for a career of crime in another State?
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1133.859,1140.233,"--Well, the difference in that is that when you get in the criminal sentencing process, you have some set guidelines and you have--"
1992.92-479,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.233,1143.76,"Well, I know, but you're arguing it's not a permissible factor, as I understand you."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1146.884,1147.899,--In a civil proceeding.
1992.92-479,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1147.899,1149.087,--is not a permissible factor in the calculation--
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1149.087,1150.493,I think in civil proceeding--
1992.92-479,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1150.493,1153.132,"--in this proceeding, but it would be in a criminal proceeding, obviously."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1153.132,1157.568,"--It would be in a criminal proceeding, but in a civil proceeding, what you're talking about... and remember what he says."
1992.92-479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1164.565,1169.408,"In a civil proceeding, usually the standards are more lax than in a criminal proceeding."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1169.408,1198.535,"But see, my problem with this is that when you're in a situation where we are orders of magnitude beyond anything that anyone else has ever permitted with a particular punitive award... and as we explain in the... in our brief, we've already demonstrated that we are orders of magnitude outside... one of the genuine fears you have to have is this a product of passion and prejudice, and that bad acts evidence, as used in this context does create passion and prejudice."
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1201.378,1203.237,Then it never can be used again.
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1207.767,1208.766,No.
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1211.297,1214.17,"Well, how do we... how would you articulate the permissible role?"
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1214.17,1216.483,"--Well, because you can demonstrate the malice."
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1237.692,1239.363,May I interrupt you just with one question?
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1239.363,1239.566,"--Oh, of course."
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1239.566,1258.919,"Can that additional amount, in effect, be the... be calculated as the additional amount to deter the additional or the further economic harm, let's say, outside of the State itself if this conduct were to continue?"
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1295.793,1310.756,"I don't think it probably would be impermissible under those circumstances, but the... you know, of course, the problem is, is that what you're talking about there is an undertaking that we clearly embrace, which is that you initially have to examine sort of what the nature of the award is."
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1318.643,1321.126,But my example wouldn't be off the charts.
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1321.126,1322.47,"Well, it would be if I--"
1992.92-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1322.47,1323.032,This one you say... pardon me?
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1323.032,1324.125,--It would be probably.
1992.92-479,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1360.845,1371.044,"Is it permissible, Mr. Phillips, to enter a punitive damages award not only to deter this actor, but other actors similarly situated?"
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1371.044,1373.107,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, it is permissible."
1992.92-479,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1373.107,1390.52,"Well, it seems to me that if it's the marginal cost of wrongdoing that's the limit on the award, that that might not have sufficient notoriety or publicity to accomplish that effect."
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1390.52,1407.216,"Well, I think you've still got to be limited by the nature of what is it that you're trying to deter here, and what we're trying to deter here is the reckless recordation of quitclaim deeds, which is hardly something that requires a huge amount of notoriety for the purpose of trying to get others not to do it."
1992.92-479,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1427.364,1428.16,"Well, I suppose that's--"
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1428.16,1428.785,--in terms of oil and gas development.
1992.92-479,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1428.785,1430.051,"--That's for the jury, isn't it?"
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1430.051,1433.94,"At some point, I think it isn't for the jury."
1992.92-479,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1451.636,1462.898,"Mr. Phillips, are you going to suggest some kind of a test that courts could employ in knowing when there is a likelihood of bias or arbitrariness in these cases?"
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1462.898,1463.913,I think what you--
1992.92-479,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1463.913,1466.38,Or do we... is it just we know it when we see it?
1992.92-479,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1467.942,1470.566,"--Well, I knew it when I saw it here, but I don't think that's the right test, Justice O'Connor."
1992.92-479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1526.341,1527.808,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1529.292,1532.62,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-479,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1631.377,1646.058,"Mr. Tribe, where in this record do you find that the jury was told there was some $5 to $8 million gain at stake, and where in the record does it show the courts below had those figures?"
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1646.058,1646.996,Justice O'Connor--
1992.92-479,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1646.996,1648.636,I haven't been able to find it.
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1648.636,1654.945,"--Justice O'Connor, there is no reference below in the courts to the $5 to $8 million figure."
1992.92-479,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1658.396,1662.567,It just doesn't seem to be the basis on which this was tried or--
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1662.567,1663.302,That I... let--
1992.92-479,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1663.302,1664.113,--presented to the jury.
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1664.113,1664.895,--Let me address--
1992.92-479,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1664.895,1671.376,"It looks to me like you're trying to concoct something that might have served, if it had all been presented, but I don't find it."
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1671.376,1671.939,--Let me address that directly.
1992.92-479,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1733.461,1733.883,"Now, wait."
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1737.663,1738.069,--No.
1992.92-479,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1751.547,1765.073,"Well, and it was never... I didn't find anything in the record demonstrating dollar amounts of projected loss to your client."
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1765.073,1790.61,"Well, Justice O'Connor, as Mr. Phillips' brief says, in this case, the expected gain to TXO, if they had gotten away with it... that is, if they had successfully gotten Mr. Signaigo to sign the false affidavit, and if they had managed to get their declaratory judgment so that they made it look as though they didn't have to pay the 22 percent to the respondents, the expected gain to them was exactly equal to the expected loss."
1992.92-479,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1794.358,1810.335,"But as I understand the way you have calculated the $8.3 million that you want us to focus upon at the high end, it assumes 25 wells, all of which are successful, 0 failure rate."
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1825.377,1826.159,"--Justice Kennedy, let me address those points."
1992.92-479,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1826.159,1830.281,"Plus the fact, as Justice O'Connor put it, it was never pointed out to the jury or the Supreme Court anyway."
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1830.281,1841.276,"Justice Kennedy, with respect to the discount rate, we were projecting figures using the $3 that was the price in 1985."
1992.92-479,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1968.085,1974.114,"Well, Mr. Tribe, is there... where in the instructions is this theory expounded?"
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1974.114,1975.067,--If you--
1992.92-479,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1975.067,1984.734,"And were they told anything except consider the actual damages, which here were $19,000, and the wealth of TXO?"
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1984.734,1985.718,"--Yes, they were, Justice O'Connor."
1992.92-479,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1991.965,1993.87,Joint appendix where?
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1993.87,2005.585,"--Joint appendix, page 34, an instruction which is, of course, considerably more detailed than the one this Court held sufficient in the Haslip case."
1992.92-479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.678,2009.006,"Well, could you read it?"
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2009.35,2009.646,--Yes.
1992.92-479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.342,2065.154,A high multiple of what did they say?
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2065.154,2069.949,"They don't address what the denominator is, but the theory--"
1992.92-479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.949,2076.384,"Well, I would think it would be very difficult to put anybody on notice if they don't even discuss what the denominator is."
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2076.384,2093.846,"--Well, I would suggest if we were in an arithmetic class, that might be true, but common sense out in West Virginia I think tells people when the law was that we're going to punish you in terms of the outrageousness of what you tried to do, that you're not supposed to be doing arithmetic."
1992.92-479,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2106.419,2109.527,"Well, I suppose that's why I have trouble with the extrapolations in your brief."
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2116.447,2118.29,Not quite.
1992.92-479,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2146.09,2147.824,But that was a gross production figure.
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2147.824,2150.088,--That was a total revenue figure.
1992.92-479,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2150.541,2153.087,"We're talking here about lost royalties, and--"
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2153.087,2153.43,"Well, no."
1992.92-479,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2155.118,2156.758,--There are other issues here you want to discuss.
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2156.758,2157.039,--Yes.
1992.92-479,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2157.039,2172.049,But it would seem to me that those persons who have been punished for being overzealous on the behalf of their clients would find it rather difficult to understand why there's some puffing in the figures before this Court which is used to justify that punishment.
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2172.049,2182.778,"Justice Kennedy, I had thought that the relevant standard in substantive due process attack on a judgment such as this is whether there is any rational basis that can be offered."
1992.92-479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2555.205,2558.235,Did the Supreme Court of West Virginia pass on that point?
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2558.235,2559.829,"I think not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-479,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.447,2964.415,"Don't tempt us, Mr. Tribe."
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2966.742,2966.976,"--Well, I hope not."
1992.92-479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2980.237,2982.752,"Thank you, Mr. Tribe."
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3029.592,3050.989,"Well, one of their own experts suggested that in those circumstances, the standard practice would be to unify the title and deed it back to Alliance, but I think it might be harder to show, under the body of West Virginia law that was in place at the time, that it would have been a violation of any duty if they had acted in a more self-interested way."
1992.92-479,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3069.779,3073.387,"Well, but aren't they supposed to do that in order to investigate their title?"
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3073.387,3083.741,"Well, there's no question that in general you're supposed to ask questions, but when the answer is no, then paying somebody $6,000 to say yes, which is what they did to Virginia Crews, that's not my understanding of ordinary business practice."
1992.92-479,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3083.741,3101.39,"There's a letter from a title attorney in the last exhibit to the yellow brief, who indicates that this deed... Mr. Wallace's letter... that this deed was ambiguous so far as he's concerned as written to Mr. Skeen."
1992.92-479,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3106.029,3107.857,"Well, it was written in December."
1992.92-479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3138.188,3140.234,"Thank you, Mr. Tribe."
1992.92-479,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3142.312,3144.827,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3171.815,3175.172,But he... but he's responding to your substantive due process argument.
1992.92-479,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3191.058,3204.817,"It is a huge difference for courts because the punishment was imposed by the jury, and what trying to sustain the jury's verdict on a ground not in front of the jury does is ignore the potential of passion and prejudice that undergirds the jury's--"
1992.92-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3204.817,3206.63,"Procedural due process it seems to me, not substantive due process."
1992.92-479,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3206.63,3209.675,"--I think procedural and substantive due process merge here, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3265.043,3272.118,"Well, they did refer, didn't they, in the... or the instruction referred to deterring other conduct in other circumstances."
1992.92-479,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3282.488,3296.014,"But even... but that... I don't think you can reincorporate into other... into the deterrence rationale, which is the rationale that you're supposed to follow, these elements which decide the amount of the award."
1992.92-479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3298.951,3311.525,"Well, it may assume a degree of analytical sophistication on the part of the jury, which is a little bit generous, but when you start talking about deterrence, what you're really talking about is deterrence in relation to the temptation."
1992.92-479,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3315.726,3324.347,"If you defined it in those terms for the jury, that might be, but there is simply nothing in what the jury was asked to do to look at potential gain."
1992.92-479,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3337.857,3343.729,"What was the purpose, Mr. Phillips, of all this evidence about potential gain?"
1992.92-479,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3343.729,3357.632,"It was originally put into the case because there was at one stage a claim that they were going to make that there was a bad faith dealing here in that when we capped the well, we actually deprived them of a significant amount of money."
1992.92-479,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3366.97,3368.595,This would be relevant to actual damages.
1992.92-479,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3368.595,3369.578,"Right, and it was abandoned."
1992.92-479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3372.797,3373.592,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
