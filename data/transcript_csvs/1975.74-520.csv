1975.74-520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,55.17,"We will hear arguments next in 74-520, Montanye and others against Haymes."
1975.74-520,0,31468,joel_lewittes,,57.834,61.468,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1259.489,1263.425,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1388.607,1406.727,"Mr. Bronstein, would it make any difference whether he was moved from a maximum security prison 400 miles from his home base to one 10 miles from his home base or the reverse of that proposition?"
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1406.727,1413.223,It might only make a difference in terms of the injury not in terms of the liberty interest which we claim.
1975.74-520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1413.223,1415.72,The right would be the same in your submission?
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1415.72,1416.206,That is right.
1975.74-520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1445.234,1452.472,"But that is not a denial of life, liberty, or property without procedural due process, is it?"
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1456.686,1457.72,That is right.
1975.74-520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1495.359,1497.926,Do you think that is what the Second Circuit relied on?
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1497.926,1513.251,"I think the Second Circuit was concerned about punishment for conduct which at least on the basis of a Pro Se Complaint or a complaint liberally construed, suggest that he was engaged in constitutionally protected activity."
1975.74-520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.251,1519.118,"Your making was not expressed in the Court of Appeals, was it?"
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1519.118,1523.755,Not expressly because they were dealing with a case --
1975.74-520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1523.755,1528.513,So you think they reached a right result but for a reason what you like to explain?
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1528.513,1537.279,"Well, I think they reached the right result and I think there is the suggestion, although it may not have been clearly articulated in the Court of Appeals' decision."
1975.74-520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1537.279,1541.02,"Well, let me then -- I will ask you."
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1547.235,1549.869,"Well, that depends on the definition of what it is."
1975.74-520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1554.698,1557.933,"Yes, is that enough?"
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1557.933,1560.329,Enough for what Mr. Justice White?
1975.74-520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.329,1564.172,"To get relief, just to prove that you suffered a grievous loss?"
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1564.172,1566.767,"Well, I think, that is not in this case."
1975.74-520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1570.329,1571.448,How about the Court of Appeals?
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1574.135,1577.691,"No, I think the Court of Appeals talked about the --"
1975.74-520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.691,1581.576,And you agree that it would not be enough?
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1581.576,1583.391,"No, not in another case."
1975.74-520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1587.359,1591.134,"Well, you go ahead then, what do you think the Court of Appeals held?"
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1591.134,1612.042,"I think the Court of Appeals held that based on the posture of the case that Haymes had an opportunity to prove that he was engaged in lawful conduct or protected conduct, that he was not violating any regulation of the prison and in fact was engaged in constitutionally protected activity."
1975.74-520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1612.042,1621.377,"But now those that who were quite different, are they not, to say simply he was engaged in lawful conduct and to say he was engaged in constitutionally protected conduct, well, those are quite different?"
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1621.377,1622.983,They are indeed Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1975.74-520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1622.983,1624.683,And which do the Court of Appeals hold?
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1624.683,1627.033,I think they discussed both or imply both.
1975.74-520,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1653.958,1669.238,Do you not think that the program on which the Court of Appeals' decision in their opinion was based on denial of procedural due process?
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1669.238,1673.839,"Only yes, but only after he was being punished for some conduct."
1975.74-520,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1673.839,1686.439,"He is not being given sufficient notice and hearing and then wherever else might be required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and its procedural aspects, is that not what the Court of Appeals --"
1975.74-520,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1686.439,1707.637,"I do not think that was alone what they were saying Mr. Justice Stewart because they took, on page 31(a) of the Appendix in their opinion, they specifically expressed concern about the District Court deciding that the alleged punitive nature of the transfer was not material, the alleged punitive nature."
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,2812.816,2819.323,It is clear that the respondent has completely turned course here.
1975.74-520,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2881.298,2916.193,"Mr. Attorney General, in the very last paragraph of his complaint petition on page 6(a) of the, that is before the conclusion of the Appendix, he does alleged that he was removed from his job assignment, that the petition was confiscated, all his direct result of administration reprisals against your petitioner for assisting those inmates contained in Civil Action No. so and so for assisting Attica Inmate Number Martinez in another petition and for also for circulating the petition."
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,2918.71,2920.127,I think that the –-
1975.74-520,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2920.127,2922.831,"It is not just the 82 signatories, he is suing on behalf."
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,2925.017,2966.595,"I think the answer to that is found later in his affidavit which in essence was his amended complaint on page 19(a) of the Appendix, where he says he was finally shifted from Attica to Clinton in obvious conspiracy attempt to separate this plaintiff from the other inmates who were also petitioning the Court for readdress concerning the inmates' legal assistance, all of which were direct facts of reprisal by that -- in respondents against your plaintiff for attempting to exercise his own constitution rights and attempting to assist other inmates for securing their constitutional rights."
1975.74-520,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2966.595,2968.749,It is not what I read?
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,2968.749,3000.583,"It does seem to say that yes sir, but it is clear to me that the petition itself, looking at the petition itself, the body of the petition indicates clearly that it was on behalf of the signatories who were complaining that Mr. Rodney Haymes had been indeed removed from the position of law clerk and not that Rodney Haymes by the way had in any manner had been denied access to the Courts because his complaint would not have been on the District Court in the first place had he been denied access to the Court."
1975.74-520,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3000.583,3003.033,"Well, he does not say he has been denied access to the Courts."
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,3013.016,3016.437,We must not forget that there was a rule involved here.
1975.74-520,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3016.437,3019.537,"Well, but that is a matter of defense, is it not?"
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,3028.325,3029.8,I think that –
1975.74-520,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3029.8,3035.03,(Inaudible) that he does not have any constitutional right to assist other inmates?
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,3035.03,3037.168,Yes.
1975.74-520,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3037.168,3044.101,You are satisfied to say that if a man can be disciplined for assisting other inmates with legal --
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,3044.101,3047.096,I am not admitting there was any discipline here.
1975.74-520,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3047.096,3048.325,He can be transferred for that reason?
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,3048.325,3050.126,He can be transferred for any reason.
1975.74-520,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3050.126,3052.851,That in order –-
1975.74-520,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3052.851,3076.887,"(Inaudible) in the last full paragraph, keeping your plaintiff along with others from submitting this petition to this very Court for the readdress of grievances is there too?"
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,3076.887,3078.471,I do not seem to have.
1975.74-520,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3078.471,3079.706,20(a)
1975.74-520,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3079.706,3087.654,The last part?
1975.74-520,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3087.654,3089.125,Pro Se job?
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,3089.125,3106.903,"Well, it is not really a Pro Se job because seven months before the decision in the District Court this petitioner had counsel, retained counsel who never raised these issues by the way in the District Court."
1975.74-520,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3108.21,3110.178,It was a Pro Se petition?
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,3110.178,3124.326,"It was Pro Se petition Mr. Justice Marshall, but the fact is that he did retain counsel who did submit seven months prior to the decision in the Western District a memorandum on behalf of himself."
1975.74-520,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3124.326,3124.392,Well assume --
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,3124.392,3126.206,I cannot really say it is Pro Se.
1975.74-520,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3126.206,3143.129,"Assuming that this was the best lawyer in the state and dean of all of law schools, is this enough to show that he alleges he was denied the right to petition the Court for readdress of grievance?"
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,3143.129,3145.663,"It is an allegation, but I do not think it is a --"
1975.74-520,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3145.663,3150.459,"Well, do we have anything before us other than allegations?"
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,3150.459,3151.196,"No, we do not."
1975.74-520,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3151.743,3155.886,And do we have to give those allegations a full force?
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,3155.886,3161.458,"We have to give the allegations a fact of full force, but not the conclusions of law necessarily that flow there from."
1975.74-520,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3161.458,3167.597,"Well, what -- there is no conclusion of law here."
1975.74-520,2,31468,joel_lewittes,,3174.304,3186.583,I do not think that he has stated a claim and he has just stated a dismissible claim and there is no reason to go back to the District Court again.
1975.74-520,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3192.468,3193.639,Thank you gentlemen.
