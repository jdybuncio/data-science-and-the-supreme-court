1987.86-1294,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.987,"We will hear argument now in Number 86-1294, William H. Webster v. John Doe."
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,10.856,13.908,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1294,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,404.609,412.596,"Mr. Fried, I am not sure that I know exactly how to interpret the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case."
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,423.17,424.253,I think it certainly did.
1987.86-1294,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,460.844,471.052,Is it open to the Director to protect himself from judicial inquiry by saying in effect that he intends to give no reason?
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,471.052,487.977,"The Court of Appeals, in one of the more mysterious aspects of its decision, said that if the Director intended to terminate the employment without giving a reason, that that would be all right."
1987.86-1294,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,532.356,541.029,"If it is correct that the Director intended to give no reason, do you support that aspect of the Court's opinion?"
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,541.029,549.402,"I would be very happy to rest content with that, except I don't know what it gives me."
1987.86-1294,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,605.572,615.594,Do you think that the Congress intended to preclude litigation of even Constitutional claims with 102?
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,615.594,616.26,"Yes, I do."
1987.86-1294,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,622.164,629.568,Even if were for example a policy not to hire a black or a woman or something of that kind?
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,754.215,758.285,There are a number of very important reasons.
1987.86-1294,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.116,810.051,I thought you were rejecting that possibility.
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,816.888,836.349,"Well, there would be the promotion and perhaps there might be damages paid, but if it was determined that this person no longer is somebody with whom the Agency is comfortable as somebody with access, then they could terminate that employee."
1987.86-1294,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.349,837.784,"No, they have not terminated him."
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,843.205,844.055,It will lie.
1987.86-1294,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,845.371,851.542,And I say I do not see why that doesn't open up the CIA to the same kind of probing that you are objecting to here.
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,851.542,855.344,"Well, it does, but that is Congress' decision."
1987.86-1294,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.766,866.885,It seems to me irrational.
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,872.288,888.981,The person who is interested in pursuing a promotion claim is a person who is interested in working within the Agency and who the Agency it interested in keeping on in some capacity or another.
1987.86-1294,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.818,950.872,"All of that goes, it seems to me, though, not to... you have been objecting to rummaging around."
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,988.711,1011.176,"If the Courts have the power, as the Circuit Court here asserted, to tell the Director, you may not tell someone to be gone, then what follows is the mischievous rummaging which concerns us."
1987.86-1294,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1087.474,1088.64,"Mr. Fried, I am a little puzzled."
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,1096.913,1097.413,--That is correct.
1987.86-1294,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.18,1104.5,But is that question presented in your certiorari petition?
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,1107.119,1109.369,"Yes, that is correct."
1987.86-1294,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1109.369,1114.189,So we don't have a question presented as to whether there can be a Title VII action or a Federal Question action.
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,1114.189,1114.989,No.
1987.86-1294,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1120.093,1131.817,"What you are saying though is your broad position is that even if the Agency had a policy of just hiring born again Christians and for religious reasons they thought they were the only appropriate agents to hire, that could not be reviewed?"
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,1131.817,1133.317,"No, that is not my position."
1987.86-1294,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.571,1140.756,"Well, they terminated everybody who wasn't a born again Christian."
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,1140.756,1142.49,They would have to hire them first.
1987.86-1294,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.49,1143.908,"Sure, they hired them."
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,1143.908,1147.276,That would strike me as very peculiar.
1987.86-1294,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1147.276,1147.96,Suppose they did it?
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,1147.96,1155.882,"If they did it, I think they would be in very hot water of all sorts."
1987.86-1294,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1155.882,1158.066,But would it be judicially reviewable?
1987.86-1294,0,18942,charles_fried,,1158.668,1162.803,It is my position that it would not.
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,1720.655,1730.761,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1294,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1892.617,1898.937,"Was there not some review under the Back Pay Act, over a period of years?"
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,1898.937,1901.889,I do not believe so Your Honor.
1987.86-1294,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1909.226,1918.415,"But that theory, that they just used it to keep it out of the Civil Service Commission review, that would not just apply to Constitutional claims."
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,1926.004,1932.924,There is also the question whether the statute precludes review of Agency regulations.
1987.86-1294,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1932.924,1934.191,--Non-Constitutional claims.
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,1934.191,1934.943,Non-Constitutional claims.
1987.86-1294,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.943,1935.776,What is your position on that?
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,1935.776,1937.026,Our position is that it does not.
1987.86-1294,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.453,2047.049,"Mr. Lynch, as I understand the Government's argument, it is not so much that 102(C) in so many words insulates from judicial review but when you apply it through the APA, by reading the APA in the context of 102(C), you find that there is no judicial review."
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2047.049,2056.139,That is why it is so important to focus on the solitary Constitutional issue that is at stake here.
1987.86-1294,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.566,2114.594,"I thought the question presented here, and maybe it is a broader question, but I thought the question presented was whether judicial review is available under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 701?"
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2114.594,2116.244,I understand that is the question they have written.
1987.86-1294,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2118.296,2120.932,I thought that is the question we accepted certiorari on?
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2120.932,2124.033,"--Yes, but you cannot change the posture of the case, Judge."
1987.86-1294,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.911,2147.899,I thought one of the nice things about being on this Court was we only had to answer the questions we decided to answer.
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2147.899,2154.053,"--That is true, but you still have to deal with the cases as they come up here."
1987.86-1294,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2188.559,2200.95,"Mr. Lynch, let me just read you two sentences from Page 32A of the Government's Appendix to the petition, which is the first two sentences of the conclusion of the Court of Appeals Majority Opinion."
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2228.6,2231.4,"Yes, but you have to go back."
1987.86-1294,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.719,2261.071,What page?
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2261.071,2262.187,27A.
1987.86-1294,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2262.187,2262.821,27A.
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2262.821,2290.304,"So what Judge Edwards did, in writing the Opinion, was say that to satisfy... if there is this policy, based on homosexual orientation, in order for the Director to justify the burden on an arguably protected Constitutional interest, the CIA would have to demonstrate that it was necessary or advisable in the interest of the United States to have that policy."
1987.86-1294,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.244,2301.76,"Mr. Lynch, can I ask you a question."
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2312.735,2315.504,"We do have such an allegation in our complaint, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1294,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2316.72,2317.372,Where is it?
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2317.372,2325.109,--In the section called 12 and 13.
1987.86-1294,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.109,2325.894,Yes.
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2325.894,2339.452,There we say that termination on the basis of homosexuality violates the Constitution.
1987.86-1294,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.67,2348.807,Whether the issue that Judge Edwards says is the only thing you can litigate was ever raised by you in the District Court.
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2350.275,2350.959,We don't know.
1987.86-1294,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.959,2361.231,"In fact, a lot of your allegations, your stipulation of uncontested facts, bring out the fact that your client was never advised that there was any requirement about homosexuality."
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2367.052,2371.521,The record is in conflict and that is why Judge Edwards sent it back for further development of the facts.
1987.86-1294,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.609,2381.328,The Deputy General Counsel said we don't have any such per se rule.
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2381.328,2388.398,--First the security officer said there apparently was a per se rule and then the Deputy General Counsel said no.
1987.86-1294,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2394.302,2398.254,"You say it is in dispute, but I don't really understand how you raise that particular dispute."
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2404.658,2407.46,"There is a lot of merit in what you say, Judge."
1987.86-1294,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2410.478,2413.014,"It would seem to me that on the grounds you were going on, you lost."
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2413.014,2414.247,We did.
1987.86-1294,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2429.206,2439.414,"In fact, if I remember some of the facts you have, you think that about 9 percent of the people employed in the Agency are probably homosexuals."
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2439.414,2444.033,That is a reasonable extrapolation of the statistics on the population at large.
1987.86-1294,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2444.033,2446.501,And you are going to contend that there is a total policy of banning them all.
1987.86-1294,1,36208,mark_h_lynch,,2457.625,2460.244,I would have thought that the Court would have declined certiorari on that ground as well.
1987.86-1294,2,18942,charles_fried,,3092.457,3099.527,"Just very briefly, it is quite clear the Court of Appeals did make this decision under the APA."
1987.86-1294,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3157.565,3164.053,"General Fried, is anything in the record suggesting there is such a policy?"
1987.86-1294,2,18942,charles_fried,,3164.053,3170.207,There is the allegation that a security officer so stated.
1987.86-1294,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3177.527,3180.562,"Thank you, General Fried."
