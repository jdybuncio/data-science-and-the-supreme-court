1994.108_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.856,"We'll hear argument next in Number 108 Original, Nebraska v. Wyoming and Colorado."
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,64.756,69.144,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.108_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,117.791,124.361,So there's been no trial before the... the master hasn't found facts and reached any conclusion.
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,126.73,128.646,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.108_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,346.923,368.669,"Well, you know, I'm a little confused because I thought that in Wyoming's requested amended counterclaim and first cross-claim that Wyoming was seeking to alter the 75 percent-25 percent apportionment approach."
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,368.669,371.288,"--That's not correct, Your Honor."
1994.108_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,371.288,372.554,That is not correct?
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,372.554,374.24,That is not Wyoming's purpose.
1994.108_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,379.394,388.6,Did the master seem to think that that is what the first amended counterclaim and cross-claim was seeking to do?
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,388.6,389.8,I believe that's correct.
1994.108_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,411.129,419.735,"Well, Wyoming does want to seek an amendment, and wants to change the 75-25 percent apportionment?"
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,419.735,420.485,No.
1994.108_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,420.485,422.751,No?
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,430.924,447.099,"Your Honor, we would add to the 75-25 apportionment further definition of Nebraska's water right, and what... and the reason I say that, the basis for the Court granting jurisdiction over the circumvention claim as you've announced--"
1994.108_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,447.099,452.853,"Well, by virtue of imposing some quantitative limitation?"
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,456.372,457.991,"--That's very likely, Your Honor."
1994.108_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,457.991,468.013,"Well, then that is different than the approach taken under the decree of the percentage appointment, so the master may be right."
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,468.013,495.247,"It is an addition to that approach, but let me explain why it's appropriate for the Court to consider that, and it's appropriate because in 1945 the United States brought the proposition to the Court that without a further definition in terms of quantity instantaneous diversion rates imposed on Nebraska's apportionment, that they would indeed circumvent the decree, or the apportionment."
1994.108_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,539.959,548.715,Do I understand you correctly that one possible amendment that might satisfy you would be an amendment so the decree would read something like this:
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,588.626,593.446,"I think that's a clear characterization of where this case could end up, Your Honor."
1994.108_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,593.446,604.269,"But that, as Justice O'Connor says, whether it should be entertained or not, that would be a reconceptualization of the decree."
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,604.269,620.68,"That's correct, Your Honor, and let me suggest to the Court that as we've said in our briefs and throughout this amended pleadings phase that there's something different between the decree and the apportionment."
1994.108_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,659.555,675.398,"Other than this dispute that we've discussed over quantity and percentages, does the first exception also involve a dispute as to the waters that are subject to the reapportionment, or is that not part of the disagreement here?"
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,675.398,678.434,I don't believe that's part of the disagreement on the first counterclaim.
1994.108_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,678.434,684.421,"In other words, what we're concerned with is the pivotal reach area, and there's no question but that the canals are part of that?"
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,684.421,686.837,That's correct.
1994.108_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,706.767,708.869,I'm still slightly mixed up.
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,723.096,723.429,--Correct.
1994.108_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,723.429,725.262,--not a percentage limitation.
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,777.447,779.049,He very well could be thinking that.
1994.108_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,779.049,780.799,"Well then, what's wrong with that thinking?"
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,780.799,789.821,"The what's wrong is that Wyoming has always sought injunctions to prevent the future circumvention, the continued circumvention of the decree."
1994.108_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,808.266,819.807,"Maybe this would get at the... why didn't you make your first amended complaint the following: conceding for the sake of argument that the decree has nothing to do with any absolute limitation in volume, we now make a new complaint, and this is our complaint."
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,831.614,835.149,I don't know.
1994.108_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,885.915,894.687,"Mr. Cook, do I understand correctly that the circumvention claim is not entirely out of the case as the special master sees it?"
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,904.793,905.245,Right.
1994.108_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,951.19,975.471,"I'm interested in Wyoming's fourth cross-claim which the master had recommended allowing to be made, but the United States and Nebraska oppose that, and would you mind addressing that a little bit?"
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,993.6,994.45,Wyoming's--
1994.108_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,994.45,1000.671,And why should that claim be included in this dispute?
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,1000.671,1018.248,--Because the United States has brought the operation of its Federal storage facilities and its ability to deliver water under its contracts into this case when it argued that Deer Creek should not be built because it would in fact impact that operation.
1994.108_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1018.248,1021.934,"Well, is Wyoming a party to any of those contracts?"
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,1021.934,1042.95,"No, Wyoming isn't a party, and that's why this case, there is a private suit going on, but that's why this case and this Court is a more appropriate forum, because the State parties and equitable apportionment underlies or is involved in this whole matter of interpretation of Federal contracts and Federal law."
1994.108_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1042.95,1062.411,"But at this point, the master thought there was no evidence of... that Wyoming was getting less of the natural flows than it otherwise would, so the master didn't see... doesn't demonstrate, at least, any need for the fourth cross-claim."
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,1062.411,1066.315,"The master, we agree with his proposition on the fourth cross-claim."
1994.108_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1066.315,1073.219,"Well, I know he thought it should be allowed, but he also noted that at this juncture there's no evidence."
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,1073.219,1076.921,"Well, there's no evidence at all in this case, Your Honor."
1994.108_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1076.921,1083.408,I presume Wyoming would plan to introduce some evidence if it's allowed to proceed on that counterclaim.
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,1083.408,1091.431,In fact we have... in the process of summary judgment proceedings have affidavits that indicate the type of injury Wyoming will produce.
1994.108_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1091.431,1094.399,Could you just give me a quick summary of that?
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,1099.036,1110.677,"Two types of users, those that are regulated in priority because the Federal reservoirs are unnecessarily depleted more than they should be, priority regulation, and prohibits--"
1994.108_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1110.677,1111.827,They're at the end of the line--
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,1111.827,1112.227,--That's correct.
1994.108_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1112.227,1113.629,--and if the water's gone they get left.
1994.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,1113.629,1119.866,"And second, the Wyoming users in the pivotal reach are subject to more frequent shortages of water."
1994.108_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1134.625,1137.327,"Very well, Mr. Cook."
1994.108_orig,1,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,1143.481,1153.587,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.108_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1194.497,1196.997,"You're joining in which exceptions here, Mr.--"
1994.108_orig,1,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,1196.997,1197.949,"Exception 2, Your Honor."
1994.108_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1197.949,1198.732,--Of which--
1994.108_orig,1,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,1198.732,1199.499,Of Wyoming.
1994.108_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1199.499,1200.817,--Exception 2 of Wyoming.
1994.108_orig,1,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,1202.867,1210.772,"Twice before, this Court has been asked by Nebraska to expand the scope of proceedings to include nonirrigation season flows."
1994.108_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1289.958,1305.568,Is it your concern that the evidence on wildlife as it affects the irrigation season flows just expands the litigation in the same way that the special master disclaims when he refuses to allow the evidence for all other purposes?
1994.108_orig,1,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,1305.568,1306.018,That's correct.
1994.108_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1322.346,1331.618,But underlying your objection seems to be the assumption that the seasonal flows that you're concerned with are requisite for irrigation uses only.
1994.108_orig,1,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,1334.487,1356.751,"Those uses were not evaluated under the 1945 decree, and what the Court's 1993 opinion, what the proceedings to date indicate is, how do you analyze the supply issues, the new development upstream in Wyoming and what their impact is on the pivotal reach of the North Platte River?"
1994.108_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1370.243,1372.778,Why do you say it would let in all the evidence?
1994.108_orig,1,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,1385.02,1397.328,"There's been a suggestion by the United States in their briefs that a limited inquiry would be not improper in this case, and the special master in his report says limited inquiry would be appropriate."
1994.108_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1409.552,1420.343,"Well, it might do that, but you said it would let in all the evidence that was... that would have been kept out under the earlier part of the decree saying we don't get into the nonirrigation season."
1994.108_orig,1,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,1422.545,1447.661,"--Because if the Court goes... permits the case to proceed with an evaluation of effects several hundred miles to the East of the pivotal reach, then you're also going to have to evaluate the effect of Nebraska's conservation and waste practices and many other issues that were specifically excluded previously in the case, so in that way you get to many issues that were... where the Court--"
1994.108_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1447.661,1450.195,"Well, many, but not all, I suppose."
1994.108_orig,1,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,1450.195,1455.48,"--I think it really is the question of ripeness and the scope of the proceedings, because it would be a very expanded proceeding."
1994.108_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.253,1474.893,"How could we say in advance that the master's wrong in saying that the wildlife might relevant, it might turn out to be relevant?"
1994.108_orig,1,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,1499.176,1511.4,"I think there is a matter of relationships, but that's not this case, and the special master himself, in the third interim report and in the oral argument last summer, indicated that those claims were not ripe for these proceedings."
1994.108_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1512.935,1513.851,I might not understand it.
1994.108_orig,1,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,1524.493,1536.884,"I don't think there's a functional distinction between permitting the trial of those issues in this proceeding as opposed to granting or denying Count IV of the claim, which specifically addresses it."
1994.108_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1540.503,1552.226,"Well, I take it he wants to be confident that his judgment is neither too narrow nor too broad, so he wants to have this evidence to inform him as to the effect of the ruling that he's asked to enter."
1994.108_orig,1,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,1552.226,1567.07,"Again, that goes to the scope of the proceedings and whether these claims are now ripe for consideration, even regardless of their relevancy to the proceeding, because the special master has acknowledged that those issues cannot bear on the injury in this case."
1994.108_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1567.07,1570.188,"Yes, but what I was thinking, it's just like a trial judge normally."
1994.108_orig,1,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,1586.881,1604.526,"I think Your Honor is suggesting that it's the equivalent of a motion in limine, and it really goes far beyond that, because really it makes the difference of whether or no Colorado is in this case at trial and whether the special master is then going to look at the entire basin-wide effects of wildlife and endangered species issues."
1994.108_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1719.884,1729.24,"Well, speaking of deference, Mr. Tymkovich, isn't a kind of special deference owed to the master in structuring the trial?"
1994.108_orig,1,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,1744.499,1763.497,"It is, however, up to this Court to define clearly the scope of the proceedings, and the case with this type of evidence, with this claim, will be far broader and more complex than the case without it, which I think is what the Court was doing when it ruled in 1993 in denying those previous claims and excluding the scope of the proceedings to those issues."
1994.108_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1763.947,1764.863,Thank you.
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,1771.401,1777.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.108_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2010.07,2014.741,"Well, how do you see this line that the master proposes?"
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2036.055,2050.23,"--I think you'd have to look at it not as a change in the scope of the case, as Wyoming would like you to see it, but as having everything to do with the scope of the potential injury."
1994.108_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2122.744,2136.086,"Well, it's quite vague, and I still don't understand what would come in, as opposed to what would be admitted if your State were allowed to amend the complaint, as it proposed."
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2136.086,2151.613,"I don't think Master Olpin knows just what would come in, but what he doesn't want to do is put any preordained, arbitrary limits on the scope of the potential injury."
1994.108_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2159.302,2165.856,How is that any different from expanding the geographic scope of the case?
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2166.34,2167.006,In one sense--
1994.108_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.006,2167.908,--anything other than that?
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2167.908,2179.449,"--In one sense it might expand the geographic scope of the case, but it would do so only as a response to the injury being proposed by Wyoming."
1994.108_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2195.725,2196.744,"Well, I don't see--"
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2196.744,2224.661,"I think he... I think the distinction he draws is between the scope of the injury on the one hand, which could be like this, and the scope of the case on the other, and all he's saying is that the two need to be equated in terms of their latitude when you make an initial analysis of the downstream equities and weigh those in the balance with the proposed--"
1994.108_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.661,2239.404,--But normally when you define the scope of a case you try to define it in such a way that all of the injuries that seem to you significant for that case will be within the geographic reach that you've decided to examine.
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2239.404,2240.421,--But the fact of the matter--
1994.108_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2240.421,2255.163,"And to say, well, we've decided to examine only this geographic reach, but of course, if there are injuries beyond that we must take them into account, at least defensively, is simply to say, we didn't draw our geographic scope broadly enough to begin with, and therefore we have to expand it."
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2255.163,2260.734,"--Well, I think the geographic scope, Justice Scalia, is really arbitrary in advance of the evidence."
1994.108_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.911,2276.529,But I thought we--
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2276.529,2284.35,"Those effects could go to Whalen, they could go to Tri-State, they could go to Bridgeport, they could go further downstream."
1994.108_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2298.992,2311.334,"--And how does that differ from the Count IV, Exception IV that was denied?"
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2316.969,2322.373,"Well, I think the same argument should have applied to the fourth cross-claim."
1994.108_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2322.373,2326.61,"I thought there was quite a difference, but don't say I'm right if I'm not right."
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2337.665,2339.084,I think we're confusing two things.
1994.108_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2339.084,2339.584,I'm confusing--
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2339.584,2342.286,I think Justice Scalia's talking about the fourth cross-claim.
1994.108_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2346.538,2347.873,--I'm talking about the cross-claim.
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2348.373,2349.607,--Okay.
1994.108_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2512.579,2515.781,Is this addressed to a particular exception?
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2515.781,2520.233,"--This is addressed to Wyoming's first exception, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.108_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2520.233,2520.599,Wyoming--
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2520.599,2521.233,Yes.
1994.108_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2521.233,2522.601,--Thank you.
1994.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,2522.601,2529.189,The Court found that you had to have some formula that was responsive to changes in supply.
1994.108_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2671.831,2673.349,"Thank you, Mr. Simms."
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2678.137,2690.445,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.108_orig,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2777.301,2784.054,"Mr. Minear, why can't the special master just take that into account when you make your case?"
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2784.054,2793.762,"Well, the problem here is that Wyoming is seeking affirmative relief affecting the allocation of storage water, and that is exactly what the North Platte Decree currently states."
1994.108_orig,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2804.384,2807.67,Does Wyoming agree with this characterization of the case?
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2812.307,2826.833,"Well, Wyoming, it's a bit like hitting a moving target here, because Wyoming has moved back and forth in terms of exactly what its pleading amounts to, but I think the best source of this is Wyoming's pleading itself, and it is framed completely in terms of the allocation of storage water."
1994.108_orig,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2877.966,2902.131,"Can you tell me how specifically you address Mr. Cook's answer to my question, and that is that Wyoming simply cannot... if I understand it Wyoming simply cannot litigate its claim insofar as it relates to Wyoming users with the least priority without, in effect, taking up this very issue of the propriety of the Federal storage water practice."
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2902.131,2903.283,I think that is just incorrect.
1994.108_orig,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2929.217,2954.249,"Well, then you are... are you saying that in fact the extent of availability of water for storage, and hence its effect on the Wyoming users with the least priority, can be determined in this action without bringing in the issue of the practices of the United States in storing and releasing its storage water?"
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2954.249,2954.616,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.108_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2975.813,2997.528,"The point made is that the decree was drawn with a view to what would happen to the storage water and the nonflow water, that the decree assumed certain dispositions, and to distort those dispositions is necessarily, therefore, to distort the decree."
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2997.528,3003.015,"--No, Your Honor, because the decree... and the Court in 1945 knew these contracts were in place."
1994.108_orig,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3014.773,3019.292,But the contracting parties may not have a... may not be hurt in any way here.
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3030.332,3037.653,"--Well, if the contracting parties have nothing to complain about, it's very difficult to see how Wyoming could be a third party beneficiary of the contracts in some respects."
1994.108_orig,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3041.39,3051.746,"Nonthird party beneficiaries, but independent individuals whose interests in effect are being foreclosed by a maladaministration of the contract."
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3051.746,3057.4,"--But the problem here, Your Honor, is that the contract water itself is already allocated in a sense."
1994.108_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3073.911,3077.647,"Mr. Minear, you distinguish between the natural flow and the storage water."
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3081.765,3082.099,--Yes.
1994.108_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3098.393,3099.843,Because it's not needed elsewhere.
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3099.843,3101.429,"It's not needed elsewhere, that's right."
1994.108_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3129.864,3135.768,"And some of those parties who draw on that water are Wyoming parties and some are Nebraska parties, is that it?"
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3135.768,3136.485,"Yes, and there are--"
1994.108_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3136.485,3155.813,"What if the Nebraska parties who normally would draw upon that flow have found that they can get water elsewhere, and perhaps even cheaper, and therefore don't care if the Corps of Engineers is running this thing wrong, and if they are not getting their contractual rights, they don't care about it?"
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3155.813,3158.015,"--Then there is more water for everyone else, because they draw--"
1994.108_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3158.015,3160.217,"Well, for everyone else, but not for Nebraska."
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3176.81,3180.731,--I'm afraid I'm not following your question here with respect to how the water is allocated.
1994.108_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3182.147,3191.152,"I'm saying one of the parties to this contract can be getting water elsewhere, and therefore not give a darn about whether the contract is being implemented properly."
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3191.152,3192.021,"--Yes, that is correct."
1994.108_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3192.021,3196.64,"That would hurt Nebraska, even though it doesn't hurt the contracting party."
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3196.64,3205.329,"Well, it might not hurt... well, I think what happens in that situation, the contractors pay what amounts to a fixed cost for their irrigation water whether they use it or not."
1994.108_orig,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3221.541,3226.76,"As I understood it, Nebraska says to Wyoming, hey, you're not giving us enough water."
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3264.035,3268.169,Wyoming is suing the United States with respect to the allocation of storage water.
1994.108_orig,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3269.021,3270.038,Alloc... that's right--
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3270.038,3275.508,--it says does not govern... shall not affect the storage--
1994.108_orig,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3275.508,3284.864,"--That's... no, that isn't saying you can't make the United States live up to its promises in the contract, where their failure to do so wrecks the whole premise of the decree."
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3284.864,3285.248,--And in--
1994.108_orig,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3285.248,3289.352,What it says is that storage water shall not be affected by this decree.
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3289.352,3289.968,--Yes.
1994.108_orig,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3289.968,3294.07,"As I read that, that means that they don't intend for this decree to govern storage water."
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3297.806,3300.541,"Yes, and the storage water instead is governed by the contracts."
1994.108_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3317.835,3320.304,Is this the district court action in Wyoming?
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3320.304,3321.989,--A district court action would be available.
1994.108_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3321.989,3322.289,Yes.
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3326.608,3328.81,We raised a sovereign immunity defense in that case.
1994.108_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3331.929,3333.714,Consideration of the argument in this case?
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3334.214,3334.614,--What?
1994.108_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3334.614,3337.416,On consideration of the forthcoming argument in this case?
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3337.416,3341.885,On consideration of the issue... on consideration of the issue itself.
1994.108_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3411.064,3411.481,The State as well?
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3412.814,3415.516,The State did not get into the Goshen district court litigation.
1994.108_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3417.035,3417.551,Can they?
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3417.551,3417.985,Could they?
1994.108_orig,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3451.874,3460.647,Is it your view that the parties to those contracts would have a right to intervene in this proceeding?
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3460.647,3464.016,We think it might be difficult for them under this Court's precedents.
1994.108_orig,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3488.481,3498.253,Do you also envision any potential conflict in the adjudication in this original action and in the district court if you--
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3498.253,3499.522,Well... excuse me.
1994.108_orig,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3499.522,3501.641,--if the counterclaim is in--
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3501.641,3503.874,The... actually the conflict--
1994.108_orig,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3503.874,3504.843,--the cross-claim?
1994.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3504.843,3506.009,--Excuse me.
1994.108_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3580.187,3581.621,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
1994.108_orig,4,20684,dennis_c_cook,,3585.073,3590.21,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.108_orig,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3636.274,3646.214,But wouldn't the interest of others who are not in this proceeding now be implicated if that cross-claim is adjudicated?
1994.108_orig,4,20684,dennis_c_cook,,3646.214,3652.633,"--The interests of others, all residents of the State, are implicated in this case any time we are here in the Court's original jurisdiction."
1994.108_orig,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3652.633,3654.902,But I mean the parties to the agreements.
1994.108_orig,4,20684,dennis_c_cook,,3654.902,3662.972,"They are, but in one respect we stand in judgment in parens patriae for the overall operation."
1994.108_orig,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3714.441,3715.607,"Thank you, Mr. Cook."
