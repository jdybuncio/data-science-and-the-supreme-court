2011.10-1472,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.772,"We will hear argument next in Case 10-1472, Kouichi Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Limited."
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,11.539,13.191,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it--"
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,34.454,38.375,Can I make sure that I understand the extent of your argument?
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,44.177,55.468,"--Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think that it's a -- that there is a textual ambiguity in the statute about the extent of covered spoken interpreter services."
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,67.375,79.952,"I -- I have to say that if you read it the way you do, then what you are suggesting is that for appointed experts, they only get recompensed for the time they're testifying, because that's the only time they spend in court."
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,79.952,81.918,"--Court-appointed experts, Your Honor?"
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,81.918,82.268,Yes.
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,82.268,101.449,"I think the legislative history of that seems to indicate that that provision was actually inserted into 1920(6) for a separate housekeeping reason, because it parallels Rule 706 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which was a preexisting rule addressing court-appointed experts, and simply put it into the enumeration."
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,101.449,103.4,But court experts get--
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,106.352,107.852,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,113.523,116.541,Could I -- one further question.
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,116.541,117.191,--Of course.
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,117.191,129.699,"I take all your arguments, but I read the common dictionary and there is no question that the primary meaning of ""interpreter"" is interpretation of oral languages."
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,163.439,163.872,Well--
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,163.872,187.804,"Meaning, if the dictionary term is broad enough and that's what the courts have been doing and the world hasn't crashed, despite one case where a large amount was given -- your adversary points to the fact that most of the translation fees tend to be fairly reasonable -- why should we muck with what works?"
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,187.804,189.689,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that--"
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,189.689,195.243,I think I am drawing -- I am drawing from ways that my colleague next to me usually asks a question.
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,195.66,205.099,"--Your Honor, I think the primary reason why the Court should -- should not adopt that is because it's -- it's inconsistent with the text."
2011.10-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.099,206.099,"It's wrong is your answer, right?"
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,206.099,207.265,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,241.688,248.009,"Just out of curiosity, why do you think that all these courts just took for granted the opposite reading?"
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,248.009,252.811,"Well, Your Honor, I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure that I have a -- a good answer to that."
2011.10-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,259.484,267.988,Perhaps it was Dr. Johnson's answer when a lady pointed out an error in his dictionary and his answer was:
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,271.541,278.211,"I think -- I think, Your Honor, that -- that Kan Pacific disputes very little of -- of our central argument."
2011.10-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,279.897,292.288,"There are -- there are lots of regions of the country, Puerto Rico for example, where there are vast numbers of documents that have to be translated if you go into Federal court, not necessarily in the Commonwealth court."
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,314.968,327.461,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that -- again, the -- the best reason to reject that view is because it doesn't make a coherent whole of this statute."
2011.10-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,378.061,389.201,"--What do you think of the -- I mean, the First Circuit dealt with this, which deals a lot with Puerto Rico, and it felt that this fell within the idea of fees for exemplification, which is certifying the document."
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,411.965,419.904,"Well, Justice Breyer, there was actually a specific provision in this bill, in a prior version of this bill that addressed the context of Puerto Rico."
2011.10-1472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,460.881,478.342,"What of a document that is -- that's read out in open court and the document is a contract in another language, and the interpreter -- the witness presents the document and the interpreter interprets it?"
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,478.342,488.032,"Your Honor, the professional literature addresses this as sight interpretation or sight translation, and it's uniformly recognized to be a species of interpretation."
2011.10-1472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,496.638,526.823,"But what if the -- if the interpreter, being diligent, said, I'm going to have to translate this document in open court, I would like to have it in advance so I can be sure that my translation is going to be accurate, so that in fact the interpreter looks at the document and in in preparation for the trial translates it?"
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,526.823,533.411,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the preparatory work that occurred outside of court would not be compensable interpretation work."
2011.10-1472,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,542.433,544.869,But that -- but she's not interpreting it.
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,552.891,554.258,"That's true, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-1472,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,567.317,569.686,"Oh, I misunderstood the hypothetical, then."
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,570.169,571.736,"--Perhaps I did, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,572.304,591.6,"I thought it was a situation where you have got a -- a -- a document in -- in, say, French and the person translates it, or interprets it -- I don't want to prejudge the issue -- and -- and then in English and then the person reads the English thing in -- in court."
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,594.551,604.507,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the literature does typically class the in-court oral communication of its content as a form of interpretation."
2011.10-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,615.981,642.532,"Well, is it true that as a matter of common usage, when we are talking about oral testimony in court we often use ""interpretation"" and ""translation"" or ""interpreter"" and ""translator"" somewhat interchangeably, but when we're talking about rendering a document into a -- into a different language, we generally talk about that as ""translation""."
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,645.434,648.369,"If I understand Your Honor correctly, yes."
2011.10-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.029,662.596,"Well, you didn't understand the question."
2011.10-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,662.596,663.846,That wasn't quite my point.
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,663.846,664.179,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,664.179,685.675,"My point was that I think we say -- in fact, in a Supreme Court case, we said in the Hernandez case, when we're talking about oral testimony in Court, we tend to use ""translator"" or ""translate"" and ""interpreter"" and ""interpret"" somewhat interchangeably."
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,686.375,687.109,"I apologize, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,720.699,726.502,"Webster's Third, as I recall, is the dictionary that defines ""imply"" to mean ""infer""--"
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,726.502,727.318,"--It does, Your Honor--"
2011.10-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,727.318,728.402,"--and ""infer"" to mean ""imply""."
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,730.954,735.691,"--Well, the Court in the -- in the MCI v. AT&T case did indicate that."
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,762.759,765.711,Could we get back to the issue.
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,778.518,784.505,I can talk -- there's a -- the text does.
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,785.688,787.34,Outside of the text.
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,791.492,792.961,--I'm not -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,808.454,812.089,Those are the other provisions that they passed with respect to--
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,812.089,825.915,"Specifically with respect to costs, the Congress -- the House Report alludes to Rule 43(f), which is now 43(d), as a relevant preexisting rule."
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,860.922,867.159,"--So if a lawyer sits down with an interpreter now in his office and says to the interpreter,"
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,875.848,876.865,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,876.865,877.884,--if we accept your reading?
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,877.884,878.55,"No, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,888.006,889.874,But you would say that might be different in a courtroom.
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,889.874,891.507,Well--
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,891.507,894.909,Because the lawyer is communicating something live.
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,897.911,898.797,"--That -- that's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,898.797,901.515,Is there something logical about this?
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,901.515,909.736,"Yes, Your Honor, because in the courtroom, in the context of a live spoken proceeding, that satisfies all of the ordinary definitional elements of interpreting."
2011.10-1472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,928.75,931.851,What about depositions?
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,937.088,956.717,"Well, I do think there -- one could potentially argue that spoken interpretation at a deposition isn't covered, in light of some of the dictionaries like Black's Law Dictionary, which indicates that the word is restricted to people who work in trial."
2011.10-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,960.371,961.221,"Well, what's -- what's your position?"
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,969.677,974.428,"--I'm not sure we have a definitive -- I think you could argue it either way, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,975.463,980.784,"Well, how do you think it affects the way you read the statute?"
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,982.884,986.169,I think there's a reasonable reading that that should be covered.
2011.10-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,991.057,1003.031,"Let me ask you this question: In the background here, is there some concern that we're going to have minor cases but with huge translation costs, and it would be simply unfair?"
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1015.172,1024.628,"Well, Your Honor, that sort of discretion demonstrably does not prevent the issuance of these large awards, because there have been a number of large awards issued notwithstanding that discretion."
2011.10-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1024.628,1026.23,"Well, isn't that an abuse of discretion?"
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1026.23,1028.598,"Well, not necessarily, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1030.031,1055.498,"Well, I mean, in other words, if the court sees that the -- the cost of preparing documents into an English language is quite substantial in light of what's involved in the case, and it's just not fair to award them, can't that court in its discretion deny them, or is that not the way it works?"
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1055.498,1056.648,"--That's the way it works, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1107.764,1112.668,"I guess I'm -- I'm having a problem with they're ""potentially large""."
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1176.86,1178.377,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1231.56,1250.807,"Well, I haven't -- I was interested here that the amici on your side consists of some professors and the, I guess the trade associations of interpreters or translators, but the people who would have the financial stake in it, the defense bar, the plaintiff's bar in certain circumstances, have not filed any brief."
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1265.649,1269.601,"--Your Honor, I am not at all suggesting that there has been a tremendous financial strain on the system."
2011.10-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1275.172,1276.922,The plain language argument I got.
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1281.492,1284.878,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, I actually, I didn't hear the end of your question."
2011.10-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1284.878,1292.032,"How many years has, would you say, the great bulk of the Federal system been deciding this differently from the way you think it should be?"
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1292.032,1293.784,I'm not sure that it is the great bulk.
2011.10-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1296.752,1297.302,That's the bulk.
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1297.302,1301.655,"--Well, I think it's -- I think that it's increased over time."
2011.10-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1301.655,1306.893,"Well, when did all this rot set in, in your opinion."
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1307.409,1309.443,"I'm not sure that I could pinpoint a date, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1309.443,1310.428,When is the first one?
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1310.428,1314.13,"Your Honor, I'm not sure."
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1317.915,1322.069,As far back as 19 -- It was a district court.
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1327.355,1330.29,"Certainly it wasn't construing 1920(6) at that time, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1330.29,1330.675,"No, no."
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1333.175,1335.227,Your Honor--
2011.10-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1335.227,1337.829,You have a case cited from 1812.
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1339.698,1341.498,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.582,1354.624,"I thought -- I thought we were addressing not whether it's a good idea to give fees, but whether fees are payable under this particular statute, right?"
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1355.94,1357.576,"--1978, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.576,1358.509,1978.
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1360.111,1362.628,"Absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1449.602,1450.336,Do so without--
2011.10-1472,0,35837,michael_s__fried,,1450.336,1451.769,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1537.338,1540.707,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1556.418,1578.182,"Have you ever seen a book, you know, translated from a foreign language, you know, ""War and Peace"", you know, and you are at the mercy of what we call the translator, and it says on the fly page, you know, ""John Smith"", comma, ""Trans"", period."
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1581.784,1588.473,"It is used in the narrower sense in that context, I think, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1639.088,1639.538,"No, it doesn't."
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1644.809,1645.242,Well--
2011.10-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1645.242,1646.776,"I mean, you are begging the question."
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1656.7,1658.8,"--Well, let me be as clear as I possibly can."
2011.10-1472,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1690.421,1692.623,Why does your interpretation make sense?
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1738.938,1748.377,"Well, let me -- let me address the first part of your question first, which is essentially, as I understand it, isn't there a background principle that says costs don't get taxed?"
2011.10-1472,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1757.815,1758.315,Back up.
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1767.571,1790.037,"I think ordinarily that is true, but I don't think that it follows, it follows in any way, that there is some sort of tie-breaking interpretive canon that says when you are interpreting the costs statute, some version of which has been in effect since the middle of the 19th century, if you are unsure about the scope of it, that you err on the side of narrowness rather than breadth."
2011.10-1472,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1792.656,1797.874,"Well, aren't you asking for an interpretive principle that errs on the side of breadth rather than narrowness?"
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1797.874,1798.409,"No, we don't."
2011.10-1472,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1798.409,1803.528,"Why don't we just ask ourselves what's the most common, what's the best reading?"
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1803.528,1815.169,"Well, I think you obviously have to start there in this case, as you do in any statutory case; and our submission is that you have two possible ordinary definitions."
2011.10-1472,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1817.788,1822.592,But the dictionaries themselves tell us that one usage is far more common than the other.
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1822.592,1826.644,"I mean, I guess I just have to dispute that."
2011.10-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.875,1862.483,"Well, I guess Black's Law Dictionary which -- the editor of it is a -- is co-author with me, so I -- I feel obliged to spring to his defense--"
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1875.726,1877.509,--That's true.
2011.10-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1877.509,1878.378,Like Garner.
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1878.378,1893.354,"That's absolutely true, and just as a dictionary, a law dictionary will take those cases into account, I think it's ordinarily presumed that Congress is taking into account the cases, too, and it's taking into account dictionary definitions as well."
2011.10-1472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1893.354,1900.592,One -- one of the things that concerns me is the impact of -- of cost allowance on the normal litigation incentives.
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1934.348,1937.717,I -- I'm not sure that's true.
2011.10-1472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1968.052,1971.121,So what -- so what goes into the exercise of that discretion?
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1971.121,1990.102,"--Well, typically the criteria for -- I should add, the criteria for taxing costs of every sort, not just interpreter costs and not just document translation costs, are essentially thought to be necessity and reasonableness."
2011.10-1472,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2025.073,2039.432,"Mr. Himmelfarb, in section 1920, there are two provisions that specify costs necessarily obtained for use in the case."
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2048.621,2052.175,That -- that's true.
2011.10-1472,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2053.075,2063.198,"You are asking to read interpreter means to mean translator as well, and to import into sub (6)"
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2065.816,2090.967,"--The necessity limitation in subsection (6) as with other subsections that don't specifically use the word 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, essentially make this a discretionary call for the district courts."
2011.10-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2121.652,2147.404,"What do you think on the -- I guess nobody wants to defend this argument, including you, but the First Circuit and several others did look to the provision which permits the taxing of costs with the making of specific exemplifications or official documents, for the costs of making copies of any materials obtained for use in the case."
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2172.785,2179.275,"Well, I mean, I suppose it goes without saying that we would rather win under subsection (4) than lose under subsection (6)."
2011.10-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2180.191,2182.31,--I am sure you would like to win on any subsection.
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2182.877,2183.81,"--That's true, absolutely true."
2011.10-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2216.364,2202.188,All right.
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2232.926,2233.86,--I think that is accurate.
2011.10-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2247.169,2256.525,Is there anything in the history of the '78 statute which suggested that Congress didn't want these taxed?
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2256.525,2258.477,Absolutely not.
2011.10-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.21,2289.762,"So if there is no legislative history -- there's -- legislative history on the other side either, right?"
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2292.447,2293.13,"No, that's right."
2011.10-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2293.664,2298.518,"--So, absent legislative history, I guess we have to rely on the words of the statute, right?"
2011.10-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2298.518,2300.553,That means you don't have to look at this.
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2300.553,2314.729,"--I guess I just go back to where I started, which is that we think under dictionary definitions and under common usage there are two permissible meanings of interpreter."
2011.10-1472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2314.729,2326.787,"Well, there are two -- there may be two permissible, but you don't dispute the fact that it is more natural and common to speak of someone interpreting oral communication and someone translating written, correct?"
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2326.787,2329.905,I don't -- I -- I think I would dispute it.
2011.10-1472,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2355.287,2356.389,"Well, how about in the U.S. Code?"
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2363.793,2365.495,I'm not aware of any.
2011.10-1472,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2398.649,2412.476,"So in every other case where the U.S. Code uses the word ""interpreters"" means only oral translators, and that's the obvious way to use the word, but in this case we are supposed to reach a different conclusion?"
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2412.476,2430.02,"Justice Kagan, I would say this, in every other provision of the United States Code in which the interpreter -- the word ""interpreter"" is used, either it's not clear whether it includes document translation or the context is such that it strongly indicates that it's limited to oral translation."
2011.10-1472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2434.739,2437.691,Let me rephrase your answer a different way.
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2445.78,2449.316,I am not aware of any other provision in the United States Code.
2011.10-1472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2449.316,2450.934,"And you checked every one, so there is none, right?"
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2452.868,2458.172,There is -- there is none where it is clear that it covers document translation.
2011.10-1472,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2467.694,2480.037,"Somebody did a computer search in the database of, let's say, newspaper articles and magazine articles for use of the term ""interpreter"" in relationship to a foreign language."
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2491.659,2498.915,I would not be at all surprised if it was more than 50 percent of the hits that used it in its narrower sense.
2011.10-1472,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2498.915,2502.367,You are like daring Justice Alito to go do this now.
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2503.986,2506.938,However--
2011.10-1472,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2506.938,2508.838,How much would you bet?
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2517.31,2523.114,"--I couldn't venture a guess, and I would rather not bet you."
2011.10-1472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2608.069,2610.069,It's an odd result because nobody's going to do it.
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2618.442,2621.127,"--Well, I don't know that it would increase the costs."
2011.10-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.742,2645.509,Is it -- is it clear?
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2677.963,2685.986,"--Well, I think every court that's ever thought about this has found that deposition -- oral translation at deposition--"
2011.10-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2685.986,2697.044,"At deposition, which I consider part of the -- part of the trial process, but not -- not in the lawyer's office where he asks somebody to sit down and -- and read this document to me."
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2697.044,2706.25,"--Well, there's -- I don't see any basis in the statute or, frankly, in the practice of translators or interpreters of drawing that line in that particular place."
2011.10-1472,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2756.249,2757.065,"I don't know, Mr. Himmelfarb."
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2788.887,2797.743,I think -- I think line drawing is sometimes a necessary exercise because the text of the statute compels you to do it.
2011.10-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2855.579,2873.207,"I accept the following, that there was a history basically giving -- doing what you want before the statute, but the statute, nobody thought, was going to do that history, that statute is capable of being translated but it is a most natural thing."
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2906.612,2910.832,"--Well, I think -- I mean, I think it is an important point."
2011.10-1472,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2955.445,2977.458,"Justice Breyer is asking, can you think of an example where words are not on their face plain, and the court has looked to the practices that have been impugned into that word incentive and we decided that they will be accepted in the way that practice has given them meaning?"
2011.10-1472,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2977.458,2994.403,"--I can't think of any case off the top of my head, and I think it's true that this case is a little bit different, because insofar as courts were taxing document translation costs before 1978, they were relying on something other than the word ""interpreter""."
2011.10-1472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3156.692,3157.692,Where are you reading from?
