2007.06-1509,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.091,"We'll hear argument next in Case 06-1509, Boulware v. United States."
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,8.384,27.395,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress placed the phrase 301(a) of the Internal Revenue Code to make clear that the taxation rules in Section 301(c) do not apply to corporate payments that a shareholder receives in a nonshareholder capacity."
2007.06-1509,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,27.395,31.597,May I ask you a question which is going to come up sooner or later?
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,121.56,123.404,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe you are."
2007.06-1509,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,123.404,124.964,I thought you were going to say that.
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,124.964,125.606,[Laughter]
2007.06-1509,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,152.563,166.48,"Well, it certainly can be, and there's no question about that, but isn't there some point of informality or some point, I guess, of formality or relevance to corporate practice that has to be reached?"
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,195.937,198.967,"With respect, Justice Souter, Justice Souter, I disagree."
2007.06-1509,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,222.114,225.409,"Well, in this case, he's a 50 percent owner, as I understand it."
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,232.328,242.198,"--It is indeed, although it's important to keep in mind that the girlfriend, according to the Government's evidence, received a very large chunk of this money."
2007.06-1509,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,297.38,319.902,"Well, perhaps because... because the Government might very well be on the other side of that question, that is the dominant shareholder takes money from the corporation, gives it to his girlfriend, and the Government is saying that corporation had earnings and profits, we want to tax this as a dividend to you."
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,319.902,323.604,"Well, yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1509,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,329.023,329.242,Yes.
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,329.242,329.898,--to what it's taken here.
2007.06-1509,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,403.149,415.191,"Well, it may be that he cannot embezzle in the sense of committing a separate private act or even a separate, a separate tort that the corporation could object to."
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,443.306,444.805,"I agree with that point, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1509,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,479.901,483.743,That explains why I'm making the argument and the Government wasn't in its brief?
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,483.743,484.29,--I think it does.
2007.06-1509,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,484.29,501.455,"But you did say something about the interception that... your argument is that this corporation had no earnings and profits, so what the shareholder got was a return of capital."
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,537.987,554.619,The way I believe it would work with a properly instructed jury in the district court is as follows: I think Mr. Boulware would have the burden of coming forward with some evidence that the corporation did not have earnings or profits and that his basis exceeded the amount of the diversion.
2007.06-1509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,560.351,562.398,For which purpose you'd include the receipts?
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,562.398,563.241,--I beg your pardon?
2007.06-1509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.241,571.957,For which purpose you would include the receipts that he sent to his girlfriend instead of putting them in the corporate treasury?
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,571.957,574.894,"Your Honor, I believe that is correct, but I'm not certain."
2007.06-1509,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,597.603,602.507,I also wanted to know whether there is in the record the corporation's balance sheet?
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,618.314,620.203,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,632.917,634.868,Was it introduced by the Government or by the defendant?
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,634.868,645.506,"It came in... I must say it came in more or less by happenstance, because neither party was really looking at the question of earnings and profits or basis because the trial court had ruled those out."
2007.06-1509,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,663.982,677.554,"I'm not, I'm not sure if what the Government is maintaining here is so prejudicial to its position in other cases, which was the earlier discussion we were having."
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,706.526,717.709,I think it is entirely possible that under Hawaiian law a minority shareholder or noncontrolling shareholder who was treated unfairly by the controlling shareholder might have a cause of action under State law.
2007.06-1509,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,719.053,723.644,"That was, that was the qualification that the Second Circuit made in its D'Agostino case."
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,727.191,741.512,"--Well, except, Your Honor, that the way these cases have played out is that there are numerous cases, dozens of them, where there are minority shareholders oftentimes unwitting of what the majority shareholder is using."
2007.06-1509,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,759.474,761.427,"Well, but that's the whole point."
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,770.236,781.543,"I think, Your Honor, that where the controlling shareholder of the corporation does something with corporate funds, and in this case transfers them to himself, I think that's a distribution."
2007.06-1509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,788.821,797.349,"I'm less concerned with the word ""distribution"" in the statute than I am with the phrase ""with respect to its stock""..."
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,841.145,845.017,"Well, Your Honor, that gets back to where I... to where I began the argument."
2007.06-1509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,872.772,874.568,Or girlfriends.
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,882.924,887.782,"--Because the issue, Your Honor, is not the recipient of the funds."
2007.06-1509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,907.601,908.539,And the Government would say yes?
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,908.539,909.631,--Absolutely.
2007.06-1509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.444,916.551,"Yes, they're really... they're really between a rock and a hard place on this stuff."
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,916.551,921.206,"Well, because, Your Honor, they want... they want the controlling shareholder, the person in Mr. Boulware's situation, to pay tax."
2007.06-1509,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,983.01,986.117,"We don't... and this may be the point that you just made, but I want to clarify it."
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,993.613,994.894,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,995.176,1003.188,"--I suppose it would be open on remand for the Government to argue it was not with respect to stock for the reasons that have come out, that it was just a diversion?"
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,1003.188,1006.624,"--The Government could argue that, but, Mr. Chief Justice, I have to say I--"
2007.06-1509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1006.624,1007.687,You are pretty sure they won't.
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,1007.687,1013.169,"--I would be astounded if they took that position, because it would be so contrary to the position they take in every other case."
2007.06-1509,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1034.863,1041.063,"What about the... the Government did say that this accountant... what was his name, Monango, or something like that?"
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,1041.063,1041.406,"Monago, yes."
2007.06-1509,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1041.406,1048.342,Testified at the trial that there was no return of capital in the relevant year.
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,1048.342,1053.731,"What Mr. Monago testified to was that there weren't any payments out of the capital account, and that's undisputed."
2007.06-1509,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1063.43,1079.079,"Well, under the Government's intent test, I suppose if you have a calendar year and the distribution is made in June, that the Government could say: What we want to show... we want you to show that there was an intent to make a distribution with respect to stock at that time."
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,1085.998,1087.873,That is what they're arguing.
2007.06-1509,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1120.516,1130.746,You mean to say the Government can't argue that this... the Defendant has to show that it was a distribution with respect to stock and that that was his intent.
2007.06-1509,0,29757,john_d_cline,,1133.433,1141.289,"--I don't think that's the right standard, but even if this Court decides that it is, that's not the standard Mr. Boulware was required to meet in the trial court."
2007.06-1509,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1187.145,1188.456,"Thank you, Mr. Cline."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1196.36,1215.993,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the Government's view, to make a sufficient proffer of a return of capital defense a Defendant must point to some factual evidence to support three elements: First, that there was a distribution with respect to stock."
2007.06-1509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.019,1233.516,The court below didn't give him a chance--
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1233.516,1235.796,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.796,1236.64,--to establish that.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1242.326,1248.088,"And the Government here believes that the correct test is the rule of the Ninth Circuit, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1265.16,1278.639,"But if it turned out that there were earnings and profits and everything else was the same, would the Government be taking the position that the proper test is: Was this a distribution with respect to stock?"
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1278.639,1295.367,"In... in every case, Your Honor, the question about whether or not the Section 301 tax treatment applies, the Government believes that turns on all the facts and circumstances and that there must be some facts and circumstances suggesting that it was a distribution with respect to stock."
2007.06-1509,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1295.367,1298.693,Suppose the government... the corporation is rich with earnings and profits.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1354.67,1357.137,That is half of the understanding of the term.
2007.06-1509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1372.148,1375.209,But that was... we're just not on the same page here.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1395.544,1396.419,"Well, that's--"
2007.06-1509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1396.419,1406.182,"And that's just a wholly different issue, and it seems to me the best you can get out of this case, the way you're arguing it, is a remand for them to apply the proper test."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1406.182,1411.587,"--I think the test that I'm articulating is the Ninth Circuit's test in this circumstance, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1451.008,1453.821,"Well, it depends on what you mean by that."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1514.173,1514.735,--No.
2007.06-1509,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1517.358,1517.576,"All right, fine."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1537.834,1546.925,"--If you... if you... it would be more accurate to say: At the time, was it intended, as objectively manifested from all the facts and circumstances, to be a distribution--"
2007.06-1509,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1546.925,1547.159,No.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1557.232,1557.779,--But if--
2007.06-1509,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1557.779,1560.59,My example was they just made a little mistake.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1570.353,1574.82,--It could be a return of capital depending on the person's stock.
2007.06-1509,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1574.82,1575.537,The basis?
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1580.817,1582.364,But here he... the defendant--
2007.06-1509,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1582.364,1582.739,All right.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1586.066,1595.639,"--It would be a return... but the point, Your Honor, is that the test is whether or not at the time the funds were taken, the corporation intended to be making a distribution with respect to its stock."
2007.06-1509,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1595.639,1610.585,"Well, aren't you... aren't you saying not that the... that the test of intent that the Ninth Circuit used is, in itself, a sufficient test; but that, rather... and correct me if I'm wrong, because I thought this was the basis really of your argument."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1672.717,1674.952,If it were with respect to stock and there were--
2007.06-1509,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1674.952,1675.326,Yes.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1675.326,1676.545,"--earning profits, and it was then income--"
2007.06-1509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1676.545,1677.201,I doubt that.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1700.255,1703.565,"--If at the time the corporation made a distribution, Your Honor--"
2007.06-1509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1703.565,1714.047,At the time... is it important for the tax treatment that at the time of the distribution it be intended to be either a return of capital or dividends?
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1718.044,1733.319,"--It depends in all cases, in both criminal and civil cases... and in that sense the Government doesn't agree with the Ninth Circuit's reasoning... in all cases whether or not something gets the tax treatment set forth in 301(a) depends on whether or not it's a distribution with respect to stock."
2007.06-1509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1733.319,1735.974,"Well, I'm not... we are not talking about distribution."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1735.974,1736.334,"Okay, I'm sorry."
2007.06-1509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1737.224,1740.519,We are talking about the intent that it be a return of capital or not.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1740.519,1749.375,If it... if the Government... if it was intended at the time it was paid out to either be a dividend or return of capital or a capital gain--
2007.06-1509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1749.375,1750.063,Either one.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1750.063,1751.905,--that would be enough to satisfy the... with respect to stock--
2007.06-1509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.905,1752.421,It could be anything at all.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1763.354,1772.336,"--I think if the court chooses to read their test that rigidly, I don't believe that the Petitioner understood it that way."
2007.06-1509,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1772.336,1775.85,Well I... let me... I just want to get clear on how you understand it.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1786.266,1787.876,I must not understand.
2007.06-1509,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1802.042,1803.37,Can I try a third example?
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1856.677,1857.425,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1857.425,1857.878,Okay.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1857.878,1858.253,If--
2007.06-1509,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1858.253,1867.124,"If that... once you say yes, then the Ninth Circuit must be wrong because the Ninth Circuit said we do not look to see what happens."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1867.124,1868.983,--If that's how--
2007.06-1509,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1868.983,1875.871,"A month later, we look just to see how it's characterized by the corporation at the moment of the transfer."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1875.871,1878.62,--If one reads the Ninth Circuit's test that rigidly--
2007.06-1509,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1878.62,1879.182,"Well, that's what they said."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1879.182,1879.839,--perhaps that would be right.
2007.06-1509,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1887.116,1889.427,"Yes, but why talk about that at all?"
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1912.263,1915.277,"Well, there is a threshold requirement to 301 treatment, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1915.277,1916.589,Yes.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1919.572,1919.979,Right.
2007.06-1509,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1920.416,1926.586,And I think he was assuming and I'm assuming that... that that condition is met.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1943.016,1943.656,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1944.391,1944.828,Okay.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1944.828,1953.559,"If he had testified here that he believed he was receiving a dividend at the time he took these funds, we believe that would be sufficient to meet the threshold requirement."
2007.06-1509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1953.559,1954.855,He wants a chance to argue that.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1956.589,1964.008,"I believe you can tell from his proffer, Your Honor, that he understood his test was to show that these were intended to be some sort of constructive distributions."
2007.06-1509,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1964.008,1981.375,Was there anything in the tax court at all that used the words as having any significance for this determination whether there was a tax evasion here with respect to this stock?
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1987.388,1988.435,In the Ninth Circuit?
2007.06-1509,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1988.435,1991.153,In the tax court originally.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1992.636,1993.417,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1993.417,1994.214,This is a criminal case.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1994.214,1995.026,"A criminal case, yes."
2007.06-1509,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1995.026,1995.604,Okay.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1996.823,2008.803,In... in... the rule has been clear in the Ninth Circuit since 1976 that you had to make a showing that there was an intent at the time the moneys were paid to make a constructive distribution.
2007.06-1509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.171,2029.45,"Can I can ask you sort of an elementary, stupid question?"
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2036.323,2043.212,"--The Government's theory of the case, Your Honor... but I'd like to step back and explain it after I tell you what it was."
2007.06-1509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.317,2058.581,"So your theory, just to be sure I understand, it was not salary; it was not a dividend; it was the proceeds of an embezzlement?"
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2058.581,2061.469,"--That was as we argued it to the jury, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2091.38,2093.409,It does not have to prove that it was income.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2093.409,2097.782,It has to prove that it came from a likely source of taxable income.
2007.06-1509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2099.017,2100.97,I just want to be sure I have the right answer.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2102.938,2105.171,--That is a proof... that it's income.
2007.06-1509,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2107.468,2109.81,It's income to him.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2115.355,2118.964,The fact that it's... it's income to him.
2007.06-1509,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2123.241,2123.46,Right.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2135.206,2138.876,"It was income to the corporation, Your Honor, even here."
2007.06-1509,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2138.876,2141.329,But it was not profits; it was not taxable income.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2141.329,2141.532,Yes.
2007.06-1509,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2141.688,2142.375,It was not taxable income.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2142.375,2143.485,"--Yes, it should have been."
2007.06-1509,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2156.885,2177.642,"Under your response to Justice Stevens, once you show that it was from a likely source of income that he received it, it's unreported, then it's the defendant's burden to go ahead and show this was a 301 distribution, that I had a basis that absorbed it, that there were no earnings and profits."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2178.861,2182.485,"The Government retains the ultimate burden of proof at all times, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2182.485,2189.155,"Well, the court didn't let the taxpayer submit evidence."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2205.164,2215.737,"Here he... in order to make the... to make out a case, to be allowed to present a defense to the jury, Your Honor, that the funds are nontaxable, the defense must have some basis in fact."
2007.06-1509,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2222.547,2230.122,"He said in his proffer that he would present expert testimony that this... the corporation didn't have profits and earnings, and therefore it was a return of capital."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2233.262,2240.072,"It is... I think this is, in his proffer, the relevant portion of it, is in the JA on page 97."
2007.06-1509,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2240.072,2240.556,Right.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2240.556,2241.649,And it says:
2007.06-1509,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2280.133,2280.336,No.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2302.062,2318.447,"--That's right, Your Honor, and our position is that in both civil and criminal cases before something can be treated under the tax treatment in 301(c), it must meet 301(a), which requires that, under all the facts and circumstances it in fact be a distribution, either a dividend or return of capital."
2007.06-1509,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2325.943,2361.21,"I think maybe he was simply getting at the fact that under 301, assuming the possibilities of non-301 treatment are excluded, under 301 it will be treated either as a dividend or as a return of capital, depending on the corporate books for that year, and he wasn't making a proffer at that point precisely as to what those corporate books would show, but he was making a proffer that, under 301, it would either be classified as a dividend or as a return of capital."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2367.004,2367.676,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2388.84,2398.289,"Well, but if he is making a profit and it depends upon whether or not there's adequate earnings or not, isn't he plainly saying that that means it's with respect to my stock?"
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2413.767,2420.483,"This proffer also has factual proffers in it, Your Honor, and none of the factual proffers go to the fact that it was with respect to stock."
2007.06-1509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2421.498,2424.856,He said... and it seems to me that this is enough to put you on notice...
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2437.211,2438.305,--He--
2007.06-1509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2438.305,2446.098,"Now, ""for corporate purposes"" would include either a return of capital or a dividend, payment out to shareholders."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2446.098,2446.566,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2498.482,2499.81,Tell me about the civil case?
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2536.139,2543.839,"--Well, in this case the Government's position at bottom is that he stole these funds, but that... but in the criminal case it didn't need to characterize it."
2007.06-1509,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2604.518,2604.971,"Well, let's take this case."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2622.869,2627.961,"--You know, I... to be honest with you, Your Honor, I don't know, but the--"
2007.06-1509,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2627.961,2637.895,"Wouldn't the Government want to take the position that this is a dividend and not something else, if that were the case?"
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2637.895,2638.348,--The Government--
2007.06-1509,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2638.348,2639.441,If there were earnings and profits.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2639.441,2640.815,"--The Government might want to take that position, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.807,2664.321,"Ms. Maynard, may I just go back to your hypothetical for a second?"
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2683.47,2685.063,"Well, in that situation--"
2007.06-1509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2685.063,2692.106,"So there's no attempt on the part of them to satisfy with ""respect to stock"" requirement?"
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2692.106,2696.386,"--Well, the express intent, Your Honor, is belied by all the facts and circumstances."
2007.06-1509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2699.151,2705.118,"No, but the only fact and circumstance in your hypothetical is they paid them a million dollars when they only earned $100,000?"
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2705.118,2705.82,--Right.
2007.06-1509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2705.82,2707.57,And it's clearly with respect to stock--
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2707.57,2708.897,Yes.
2007.06-1509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2708.897,2709.584,--regardless of intent?
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2709.584,2710.787,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2725.765,2729.06,Surely he is entitled to try to prove that.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2778.182,2783.805,"That's the language on which I rely to show that he's proffered nothing in basis in facts, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2785.757,2787.303,This is a criminal case.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2795.473,2801.345,--The Government doesn't... it's clear under Holland... have to refute every hypothetical nontaxable source.
2007.06-1509,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2811.496,2816.089,Let me get something clear.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2825.631,2830.864,"They wish to introduce expert evidence that it could be deemed, as a legal matter--"
2007.06-1509,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2830.864,2831.16,"Oh, I see."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2831.16,2832.176,--They don't have--
2007.06-1509,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2832.176,2837.549,And you say there was no other evidence in the record that the expert could use for that testimony?
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2837.549,2838.392,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2849.574,2850.745,That's not right.
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2868.333,2870.052,But that fact goes to the second element.
2007.06-1509,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2877.547,2884.53,"It's not totally relevant if the question he is trying to submit, whether they are earnings or profits or not, which will affect its treatment."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2886.435,2887.044,"--Right, Your Honor."
2007.06-1509,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2889.84,2896.557,"But we don't... we are not certain on that one, I think, because of the cases he said before would this be a possible holding."
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2937.383,2940.476,"--If you were... if you are going to remand, Your Honor--"
2007.06-1509,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2940.476,2942.881,Does the Government have any objection to what I just said?
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2942.881,2948.317,"--Well, if you're going to remand, Your Honor, all three elements should be opened."
2007.06-1509,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2998.483,3000.108,"Well, please--"
2007.06-1509,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3000.108,3006.98,--There is no way to infer from the way in which he diverted these funds that these funds were with respect to stocks.
2007.06-1509,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3006.98,3008.511,"--Thank you, Ms. Maynard."
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3011.806,3018.037,"Your Honor, I just want to make a few quick points."
2007.06-1509,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3056.74,3057.256,Do you think--
2007.06-1509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3057.256,3071.361,"Even so, no harm no foul, if, in fact, you hadn't proffered any evidence that would enable you to meet the... in respect to stock requirement."
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3074.75,3077.218,"I say several things, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1509,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3091.696,3099.864,"Well, at 97, are you saying that the expert would have brought with him financial records to show earnings and profits and basis?"
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3107.58,3113.344,"--Justice Kennedy, there actually is a fair amount of basis data in the record."
2007.06-1509,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3145.721,3146.626,But those are different.
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3192.984,3194.139,--Justice Breyer--
2007.06-1509,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3194.139,3194.717,Where is it?
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3194.717,3202.04,--That's how I read the portion of the joint appendix at pages 62 through 66 that I referred to where Mr. Boulware invokes that rule.
2007.06-1509,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3237.325,3239.512,Do you recognize that he would have the burden?
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3246.304,3264.0,"I think, Justice Ginsburg, that under the rule in Bok and under the rule that the parties proceeded under in the district court in this case, whether or not it's the correct rule, Mr. Boulware had the burden of producing some evidence, some evidence of the earnings and profits and the basis issues."
2007.06-1509,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3265.407,3268.515,"Coming forward, he had the burden of coming forward?"
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3268.515,3274.228,"--Just the burden of coming forward with some evidence, even if it's weak evidence or not credible evidence, just to put the issue in play."
2007.06-1509,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3277.995,3278.246,Where is that evidence?
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3284.18,3290.006,"The evidence, Your Honor, is in the record where I have previously identified."
2007.06-1509,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3290.006,3294.301,Justice Breyer's point is that that isn't directed to that issue.
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3297.549,3309.545,"Actually, Your Honor, it was... it was... the evidence that came into the record came into the record more or less by happenstance because the district court had prohibited any evidence of return of capital."
2007.06-1509,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3309.545,3312.638,"And that evidence came in after the proffer, didn't it?"
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3312.638,3313.075,No.
2007.06-1509,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3314.871,3319.01,"Well, this is a motion in limine which is before the trial."
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3319.01,3319.463,No.
2007.06-1509,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3333.629,3335.472,So what did happen there?
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3348.529,3352.029,"Justice Breyer, had the issue not been limited to the Miller--"
2007.06-1509,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3352.029,3354.418,They would have raised it.
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3354.418,3365.038,"--I believe that Mr. Boulware would have presented expert testimony that would, in fact, have at least put into play the issue of earnings and profits and basis."
2007.06-1509,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3365.038,3383.281,"Well am I... am I right that all he would have to do in order to satisfy that burden would be this: He would have the option, which I gather he availed himself of, to show that, in fact, the... the funds were loans or non-income to him."
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3457.219,3459.312,"I think that's basically right, Justice Souter, and--"
2007.06-1509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3459.312,3459.531,"Well, wait."
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3464.623,3466.387,"--Yes, but--"
2007.06-1509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3466.387,3476.493,"That one little element: That he has to show the distribution was not because this was his girlfriend, but it was with respect to stock, and the record is... is that the intent?"
2007.06-1509,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3476.493,3484.709,"But doesn't... doesn't he suffice, on a going forward burden, simply to show that he is a stockholder?"
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3484.709,3487.988,"--I think so, Justice Souter, and I think--"
2007.06-1509,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3487.988,3494.298,"I mean I agree with Justice Scalia, but doesn't he make it at least to the point of putting the Government to its proof by showing that he is a stockholder?"
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3494.298,3498.687,"--That he is a stockholder, and that he did not receive this money in any nonstockholder capacity."
2007.06-1509,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3498.687,3499.093,Yes.
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3499.093,3500.201,"For example, for income or something like that."
2007.06-1509,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3507.527,3511.964,"Well, it's kind of hard to say it's with respect to stock when the other stockholder doesn't get any."
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3511.964,3529.736,"Chief Justice Roberts, the cases, again, are uniform... and we cite them, I think, at footnote 8 of our reply brief... that you can have a constructive distribution even if there are no corporate formalities, even if it's a disproportionate distribution, even if other stockholders don't share it."
2007.06-1509,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3532.048,3533.516,What page in your brief did you say?
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3533.516,3540.623,"I believe it is... the cases are cited, I believe, at footnote 8 of our reply brief."
2007.06-1509,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3541.201,3542.06,Of your reply brief?
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3542.06,3551.806,It's footnote 3... I'm sorry.
2007.06-1509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3562.739,3575.703,"The issue is whether the Government wants to convict more... more malfeasors or whether it wants to collect more money, and the latter obviously prevails in the cases, right?"
2007.06-1509,2,29757,john_d_cline,,3575.703,3585.667,"But, Justice Scalia, it seems to prevail only in this case, and I would be astonished if counsel argues that the Government views Mr. Boulware as having stolen this money from the corporation."
2007.06-1509,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3599.194,3600.428,"Thank you, counsel."
