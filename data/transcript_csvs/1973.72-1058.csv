1973.72-1058,0,44600,william_d_eggers,,175.038,177.089,"Your Honor, I believe that they can, under New York law."

1973.72-1058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,275.069,280.604,So some of your class are not registered voters.
1973.72-1058,0,44600,william_d_eggers,,280.604,281.426,That is right Your Honor.
1973.72-1058,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,284.214,288.12,Is there a provision for registering by absentee means for other kinds of voter?
1973.72-1058,0,44600,william_d_eggers,,288.12,289.19,"Yes, there are Your Honor."
1973.72-1058,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,306.266,318.646,"I asked question because the State with which I – the only stated really if I have any basic familiarity, requires registration personnel, though it has very, very liberal absentee voting provisions."
1973.72-1058,0,44600,william_d_eggers,,319.515,322.022,"That is not true, no."
1973.72-1058,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,381.473,383.824,"It's a fundamental right, not a constitutional right?"
1973.72-1058,0,44600,william_d_eggers,,383.824,388.625,"It is both Your Honor, it is a fundamental right that is grounded in the constitution, I think --"
1973.72-1058,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,388.625,394.179,"Well, that might be a constitutional right or something else?"
1973.72-1058,0,44600,william_d_eggers,,394.179,399.767,"Your Honor, I believe it is a constitutional right and it is so important that it is a fundamental right under decisions of this Court."
1973.72-1058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,399.767,405.587,Are some constitutional rights more fundamental than others?
1973.72-1058,0,44600,william_d_eggers,,405.587,408.311,"Well, I would not want to create a hierarchy of constitutional rights."
1973.72-1058,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,461.235,468.157,"There are two sides of this case, one just on those awaiting sentence and those and others who have been sentenced."
1973.72-1058,0,44600,william_d_eggers,,468.157,474.9,"Your Honor, that is correct, except that the ones that are awaiting sentence have been or they have been sentenced, or have been sentenced only for misdemeanors."
1973.72-1058,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,474.9,488.173,"I understand that, but now let us assume that a State had a law that said, the following people disenfranchised, that they may not vote, one; convicted felons, two; convicted misdemeanants."
1973.72-1058,0,44600,william_d_eggers,,488.173,490.855,"Your Honor, that would be quite a different case because the state then would have been --"
1973.72-1058,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,490.855,504.532,"Well, in effect, you are just saying the State here, but as a result of it of the interplay of all these provisions, misdemeanants, convicted misdemeanants just may not vote, if they are serving a sentence."
1973.72-1058,0,44600,william_d_eggers,,504.532,512.368,"If they are serving a sentence because of course, a convicted misdemeanant who was paroled on a work release program can vote the same as any other citizen."
1973.72-1058,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,521.147,523.292,"Well, it is substantive due process."
1973.72-1058,0,44600,william_d_eggers,,523.292,534.776,"Well, I think procedural as well Your Honor because, we have the question of whether the standards, there are any standards, is there a right to hearing this kind of procedural due process would have --"
1973.72-1058,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,534.776,540.538,"We still have remaining in this case, people who are just detained for trail."
1973.72-1058,0,44600,william_d_eggers,,540.538,541.538,That is correct Your Honor.
1973.72-1058,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,559.586,572.555,We will assume that after lunch counsel.[Noon Recess]

1973.72-1058,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,614.501,618.925,"We had the same sort of restraint by the state of McDonald, don't you?"
1973.72-1058,0,44600,william_d_eggers,,618.925,622.497,"Your Honor, the restraint in McDonald was the same."
1973.72-1058,1,35569,michael_k_consedine,,1644.684,1649.723,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-1058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1754.378,1758.228,(Inaudible)
1973.72-1058,1,35569,michael_k_consedine,,1758.228,1773.739,"Well, if Your Honor please, I am not entirely sure of what was in the Court of Appeals mind. Into my mind, I think they were touching on a rational basis tests."
1973.72-1058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1774.321,1790.468,Is there any reason that the man in jail solely because he can not produce bail from the man who can produce bail other than money?
1973.72-1058,1,35569,michael_k_consedine,,1790.468,1795.298,"Well, that would relate only to detainees."
1973.72-1058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1795.298,1796.179,It's all written in that?
1973.72-1058,1,35569,michael_k_consedine,,1796.179,1799.652,"Yeah and Your Honor, you must consider the fact--"
1973.72-1058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1799.652,1803.378,"In fact detainees has contrasted with the misdemeanants, convicted misdemeanants."
1973.72-1058,1,35569,michael_k_consedine,,1803.378,1805.344,Convicted misdemeanants.
1973.72-1058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1818.271,1821.948,Wouldn't that apply to any other person who registers?
1973.72-1058,1,35569,michael_k_consedine,,1821.948,1823.739,"Your Honor, well that's true."
1973.72-1058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1823.739,1824.484,Wasn’t it?
1973.72-1058,1,35569,michael_k_consedine,,1824.484,1825.459,"Yeah, that's true."
1973.72-1058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1835.26,1843.831,"I don't agree with that either, that man is innocent, he is absolutely innocent and the Constitution says he is innocent."
1973.72-1058,1,35569,michael_k_consedine,,1843.831,1845.781,"I agree with you Your Honor, at that point."
1973.72-1058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1868.708,1873.139,"Do you have anybody in New York, lives in jail because he is just didn't want to pull up the money?"
1973.72-1058,1,35569,michael_k_consedine,,1873.139,1873.481,No.
1973.72-1058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1873.481,1874.985,Or he likes jail.
1973.72-1058,1,35569,michael_k_consedine,,1874.985,1884.283,"But Your Honor, there are cases where bails are very high and even a person of moderate wealth cannot make that."
1973.72-1058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1884.283,1885.507,"Well, it's still --"
1973.72-1058,1,35569,michael_k_consedine,,1885.507,1891.465,The reason for bail is to ensure the person's attendance at court.
1973.72-1058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1891.465,1896.294,I understand the reason why this man can't vote?
1973.72-1058,1,35569,michael_k_consedine,,1901.742,1903.761,"That maybe a reason, however."
1973.72-1058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1903.761,1904.539,"Well, what are the reasons?"
1973.72-1058,1,35569,michael_k_consedine,,1904.539,1922.179,"Your Honor, I am saying that the reason he cannot vote because he doesn’t have enough money to bail, doesn’t bring this within the suspect classification based on wealth because there are cases where bails are very high, in serious cases, $100,000, $50,000, that doesn’t..."
1973.72-1058,2,44600,william_d_eggers,,2595.853,2598.908,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1973.72-1058,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2611.398,2618.496,"Well, if we start with that premise of course, then the whole problem becomes easy."
1973.72-1058,2,44600,william_d_eggers,,2618.496,2619.683,"Well I think that is right, Your Honor."
1973.72-1058,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2643.188,2663.919,"In one of the cited just this morning, it was referred to Justice Clarke in an opinion, you may remember the names, it is said that classification made by a legislature need not be perfect, it may be over-inclusive or under-inclusive but that that alone does not make it unconstitutional."
1973.72-1058,2,44600,william_d_eggers,,2663.919,2671.246,"Well, Your honor, I think it depends on the sort of rights that are involved, the sort of class that is affected, and when we have fundamental rights."
1973.72-1058,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2671.246,2677.575,"We have at, this issue that rarely comes up except in a constitutional context."
1973.72-1058,2,44600,william_d_eggers,,2677.575,2702.618,"Well, in a constitutional context, Your Honor, but there are many cases that might involve rights less important than these, and there it might be appropriate to refer to the legislature and say, well, this is reformed legislation and in this particular area, we are going to consider this one, when we are considering whether the statute is reasonable, but not when we are going to apply the strict standard of judicial scrutiny that's required in this case."
1973.72-1058,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2705.961,2707.413,Thank You Mr. Eggers.
