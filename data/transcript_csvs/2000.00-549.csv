2000.00-549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.059,"We'll hear argument now in No. 00-549, Cedric Kushner v. Don King, et al.--"
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,8.339,10.857,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-549,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,45.408,54.696,"Can you tell me something, before you get into this, I would appreciate your correcting the following misapprehension, if it is, or affirming it."
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,56.554,57.297,"--Yes, sir."
2000.00-549,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,57.297,62.292,--Are we talking about only a really odd situation?
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,82.726,82.843,"Your Honor, the problem--"
2000.00-549,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,82.843,83.924,--of what we're talking about?
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,83.924,90.445,--I think the problem with the Second Circuit's decisions is that it does reach the general problem.
2000.00-549,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,119.895,128.811,"But... I just want follow up Justice Breyer's question, in the case of a large corporation, what would the Second Circuit say?"
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,129.399,133.94,I think the problem with the Second Circuit's decision is that it may well say the same thing.
2000.00-549,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,133.94,147.686,"Now, that's what I didn't see because it seemed to me in any real corporation it's not going to be following what the corporation wants to commit a crime, so it's not in the scope of your employment to commit a crime."
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,174.064,183.641,The problem that we have with the Second Circuit's decision is that it is hard to rationalize with the meaning of the statute and with the Court's decision in Reves.
2000.00-549,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,234.622,238.626,"In any case, I was going to ask basically the same question."
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,277.719,277.719,"Your Honor, I--"
2000.00-549,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,277.719,281.246,"I should ask your opponent that question, but just to stir him up--"
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,281.246,287.379,"--If you're missing something, I am too, and I am eager to hear an answer from Mr. Fleming on that question."
2000.00-549,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,339.474,346.533,"--On these facts, could you have alleged that King was the enterprise and the corporation was the person?"
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,346.533,351.734,"On these facts, I think that that... you could allege that, Your Honor."
2000.00-549,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,352.106,357.678,"So you could have count one, where one is the person, and count two, and it's the same?"
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,358.504,360.65,"--No, I don't think that you can do both."
2000.00-549,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,364.077,365.951,But I thought you just indicated you could do that.
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,365.951,367.875,--If you chose just one.
2000.00-549,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,369.899,372.583,"Well, do you flip a coin to decide which way you're going to do the count?"
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,374.374,377.141,"--Unfortunately, you know, you might have to do that in the Second Circuit."
2000.00-549,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,379.575,380.773,"No, but under your theory."
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,396.46,406.963,"--On the facts of this case, Your Honor, certainly the pleading that we have in this case satisfies the standards of the case."
2000.00-549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,443.271,461.187,"But as far as pleading is concerned, the rules allow you to plead in the alternative, and you don't have to pick your theory at the pleading stage, so I guess your answer to Justice Kennedy means that in your complaint you could have alleged it both ways and then waited to pick until later on."
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,461.187,470.475,"I think that that's no doubt technically correct, but I don't think that's what we're trying to do just because you can plead in the alternative."
2000.00-549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,493.304,496.11,Do you need a corporation on your theory?
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,511.343,512.623,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.00-549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.064,621.04,"Any idea what percentage of them really pick up organized crime, which is supposedly the object of RICO?"
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,621.04,623.806,"--I don't, Your Honor."
2000.00-549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,624.549,625.309,Yes.
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,634.414,640.07,"Your Honor, there is no doubt that the statute was targeted at organized crime, but there is also little doubt--"
2000.00-549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,640.07,640.73,That's right.
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,647.955,663.475,"--Your Honor, there is little question that what you're saying is true, except for the fact that this Court has read in Sedima into the statute the fact that it has an extremely broad sweep and it catches precisely this kind of activity."
2000.00-549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,730.886,740.174,"Mr. Edlin, you rely rather heavily on our decision in Reves, and I notice the court of appeals opinion didn't mention it at all."
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,742.486,744.261,--We urged it in the Second Circuit.
2000.00-549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,794.21,800.072,"Well, a visiting judge is expected to follow the precedent in the circuit which he visits."
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,800.072,807.956,"I'm simply observing that I found how the court issued its decision interesting, given the fact that it does not mention Reves."
2000.00-549,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,829.793,839.164,"I suppose that what they're worried about, if I'm trying to imaginatively put myself in their shoes, is that a person could claim the following."
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,885.027,887.09,"Justice Breyer, I agree with that."
2000.00-549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.095,936.131,That's no... that's no protection in the hypothetical that Justice Breyer gave you.
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,947.442,955.616,"Justice Scalia, whether it is or it isn't, it was considered by Congress at the time it was passed, and Congress made a decision that it would--"
2000.00-549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.616,957.473,But don't tell me it's not absurd.
2000.00-549,0,39172,richard_a_edlin,,962.675,972.417,"--I'm trying carefully to say it's not absurd in that example, but apparently it's hard, and I won't continue to try to do it."
2000.00-549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,988.475,989.59,"Very well, Mr. Edlin."
2000.00-549,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,991.819,999.455,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-549,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1149.303,1158.591,Do you see any way to limit the application of RICO to the situations described by Justice Breyer?
2000.00-549,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1162.966,1172.725,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, the concern intuitively about Justice Breyer's hypothetical is the predicate act, which is mail fraud or wire fraud."
2000.00-549,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1182.179,1184.037,But that isn't the problem.
2000.00-549,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1216.564,1224.161,"This case goes to the interpretation of Section 1962, which applies to criminal as well as civil cases."
2000.00-549,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1244.966,1253.799,"Do you agree that this complaint could have been just as easily drafted, switching the enterprise and the participant?"
2000.00-549,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1253.799,1257.226,"Justice Kennedy, it would be possible to frame a complaint either way, but the fact that--"
2000.00-549,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1257.226,1260.198,And I mean prove the case as well.
2000.00-549,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1260.198,1265.566,"--But to do that, you would be alleging two different fact patterns."
2000.00-549,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1288.393,1292.48,"I'm not sure why not, under this fact pattern."
2000.00-549,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1292.48,1318.941,"Under this fact pattern, the allegation is that Mr. King has used not only his personal resources but also other agents, other employees, of DKP Corporation to carry out the racketeering activity, so it would be necessary to allege an enterprise that incorporates those persons or things that are used in the racketeering."
2000.00-549,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1318.941,1323.771,"Thank you, Mr. Schlick."
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1327.32,1333.059,"Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please this Court--"
2000.00-549,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1384.041,1419.623,"Then that's their concern, because if that's right, then the one time when the interest of the employee committing the crime and the interest of the corporation are likely to be congruent is where you have an evil corporation, and that seems to be the one time that clearly the Second Circuit rule would exempt from the statute, and so oddly enough, insofar as it has an impact, its impact is bad in terms of the statutory purpose."
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1420.366,1423.521,"And exempt under (c), but would not exempt under--"
2000.00-549,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1423.521,1435.814,"I know, but insofar as the Second Circuit rule has real has real bite beyond a single person, its bite is biting the person... in other words, bite goes just in the wrong direction."
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1435.814,1456.858,"--Our position would be, Justice Breyer, that (a) covers that situation, and it was Congress's intent that (a) cover that situation, where the same response to Justice Souter's question, and that has to do with whether any criminal act or predicate act or civil fraudulent act can be considered within the scope of employment."
2000.00-549,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1466.063,1506.353,"Well, that... that's an easy conclusion to draw if your sole test of scope of employment is intent to benefit the corporation, but the scope of employment inquiry is broader than that and, even apart from the fact that there's always a policy component to it, you've got to take into consideration in some way corporate purpose, and I take it we at least have common ground that there is no... there is not State corporation law that would charter a corporation to commit within the scope of its corporate authority an act of racketeering."
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1508.211,1509.697,We do agree on that.
2000.00-549,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1509.697,1509.863,Okay.
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1533.64,1538.181,It could be... it could be to further the interests of the corporation.
2000.00-549,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1538.181,1557.789,"Right, but that's true only if that's your sole test of scope of employment, and if that's going to be the case, it would just, it seems to me, make for clearer thinking if we didn't talk about scope of employment and instead said, look, the test is whether it's to further the financial interest of the corporation."
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1557.789,1569.017,And what the court of appeals said... Second Circuit said in Riverwoods was in the course of their employment and on behalf of the corporation... and on behalf of the corporation.
2000.00-549,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1569.017,1571.163,And I'm suggesting that you can't have both.
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1581.938,1594.57,"The Court would... what you're saying, Your Honor, is that if an employee commits a tort... commits a fraudulent act, it simply cannot be considered from the scope of employment."
2000.00-549,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1598.74,1600.597,"Yes, I think you have to disagree with that."
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1610.439,1610.977,That's correct.
2000.00-549,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1610.977,1615.269,"Nonetheless, when a... or willfully negligent, either."
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1620.182,1621.296,And we all know what happens.
2000.00-549,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1621.296,1621.751,But then scope of employment then turns--
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1621.751,1624.268,So long as he's acting for the benefit of the company.
2000.00-549,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1624.268,1636.916,"--Then scope of employment, in effect, is going to be limited in this context to serving a corporate purpose in the sense of trying to bring monetary gain to the corporation."
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1638.114,1639.145,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2000.00-549,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1639.145,1641.829,"No, you wouldn't say that's the sole test, Mr. Fleming."
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1660.487,1662.512,"Yes, I think it does."
2000.00-549,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1662.512,1663.459,Of course it does.
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1663.459,1664.286,I'm sorry... I misunderstood.
2000.00-549,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1682.491,1698.178,"But I think the... I don't want to take more of your time on this than this last question, but it seems to me that the way the circuit was referring to the test, it was confining the test to this one element."
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1713.039,1713.782,I am in agreement with that.
2000.00-549,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1752.97,1776.78,"The thing that strikes me as a little bit odd about the scope of employment test is that the scope of employment in Reves is one we usually make as relevant to whether the employer is liable, and it's not the inquiry we make when we're looking to see if the employee is liable, and I just don't see how the test quite fits."
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1776.78,1779.791,"--If understand what you said, Justice O'Connor."
2000.00-549,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1784.871,1787.183,I wouldn't think so.
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1789.7,1809.185,"The common law provides, as the Court knows, that a corporation is liable certainly civilly and sometimes criminally for the conduct... for the wrongful conduct of its employees."
2000.00-549,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1847.657,1855.996,"Mr. Fleming, a moment ago you referred to the distinctness requirement, and you said all the circuits are in agreement on that."
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1861.032,1871.806,"All the circuits agree that under 1962(c), there must be the RICO person... it could be any person... the RICO person must be distinct from the enterprise."
2000.00-549,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1878.222,1887.371,"You could have a sole proprietorship that has some employees, and that would satisfy the distinctiveness requirement, would it not?"
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1903.346,1908.215,"Not in... not in the... in the seventh circuit, yes."
2000.00-549,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1956.64,1979.963,"The United States is one example where the Second Circuit position would meet, and it says here's a corporation, tells its employees go out and bribe the local police, it will be able to do this, that, or the other thing, and they won't touch us."
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,1995.112,1997.135,Against the employees.
2000.00-549,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2011.996,2033.19,"It would be, I suppose, could make a criminal bribery case, but as far as 1962(c), on your theory, such a pattern would not fit because it was within the scope of their employment to give out these sweeteners."
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,2033.19,2037.094,--And for the purported benefit of the corporation.
2000.00-549,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2037.094,2037.837,Yes.
2000.00-549,2,37905,peter_fleming_jr,,2037.837,2047.951,"But the conduct could be reached under RICO under Section (a), both as to the corpora... certainly as to the corporation, and we believe also as to the persons."
2000.00-549,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.009,2089.931,"I thought that (a) is about... is investing racketeering proceeds in an enterprise, and (b) is about obtaining control, and (c) is about managing the enterprise or participating in its affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity."
2000.00-549,3,39172,richard_a_edlin,,3138.016,3143.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless there are any questions, we are prepared to waive rebuttal."
2000.00-549,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3143.96,3144.869,"Thank you, Mr. Edlin."
