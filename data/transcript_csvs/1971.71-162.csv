1971.71-162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.268,"We'll hear arguments next in number 71-162, Board Of Regents Of State Colleges against Roth."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,28.268,53.859,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honor, the petitioners in this case are the Board Of Regents Of the State Colleges, they are now known as the Board Of Regents Of State University and actually to be absolutely accurate, they are now known as the Board Of Regents Of the University of Wisconsin System."
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,96.321,98.087,"You are calling Doctor, is he a Ph.D?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,98.087,99.016,"Yes, sir, he is."
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,99.016,101.344,And where is he now?
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,101.344,108.68,"Your Honor, I would -- I've heard but I'd -- much rather you ask the other side because I would mind to give you any misinformation."
1971.71-162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,394.199,400.604,This is the Western District or the Eastern District?
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,400.604,406.567,"No, sir, I don't believe it is, but the Board of Regents is in the Western District."
1971.71-162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,406.567,407.319,(Inaudible)
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,407.319,412.446,"Yes, sir it was."
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,446.115,452.828,"Well, in terms of the ultimate outcome of this case, what difference would be -- answer to that question mainly?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,452.828,454.492,"Oh, it makes a tremendous difference."
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,454.492,458.241,"I know that -- it was another case, what about Roth case?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,458.241,468.034,"In Roth case, it wouldn't make any difference, Your Honor."
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,468.034,475.977,What have we got to hear for?
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,475.977,479.595,"Your Honor, we have facing a --"
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,479.595,492.879,"Well, I am trying to understand the significance of the law suit but in the case, you say that Roth has already what reinstatement or --"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,492.879,497.278,"Well, that complaint seeks the declaratory judgment."
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,497.278,506.612,"If he wins in the District Court on that issue, on being prior to the constitutional rights, he will have that all he wants --"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,506.612,525.058,"No, sir, he will not have gotten all he wants because the defect remain that he wants reinstatement -- I assume, I don't know, this is what his complaint asks for."
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.716,535.013,But you say you are not here defending his discharge.
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,535.013,543.489,"I am not here defending his non-renewal, the propriety of the action of the University and non-renewal --"
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,543.489,545.439,You don't mean you concede within that?
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,545.439,547.134,"No, sir, I do not."
1971.71-162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,621.584,625.584,Now you’re saying that should have gone ahead and tried the case from the District Court right away?
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,625.584,628.117,Yes sir.
1971.71-162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,628.117,634.673,Tried the question of whether he should have been hired on the merits.
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,634.673,648.468,"The issue it seems to me, Your Honor, was whether the contract was not renewed for impermissible reasons or for engaging in protected constitutional activity."
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.628,654.605,Mr. Bleck.
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,654.605,655.022,Yes.
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,655.022,666.114,"If this court were to follow the Tenth Circuit decision that Mr. Gottesman commented on in his argument, I take it even that subject wouldn’t be open to litigation in the District Court, would it?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,671.799,677.438,"He did not have tenure, he was a one year probationary teacher on his first year of teaching."
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.031,705.079,"Well, what you’re stating is that it states a good plan of action under Civil Rights Act, he would be entitled to a hearing?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,705.079,709.993,Yes sir.
1971.71-162,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,709.993,717.303,"Are you saying to the court, if you have a right to go to the court, you don’t have to have administrative hearing?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,717.303,720.464,"No sir, I am not saying that."
1971.71-162,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,752.038,759.326,"Well, what happens with the tenure, the professor with tenure -- is he have the hearing?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,759.326,763.082,"Oh yes, we are required to give him a hearing by law."
1971.71-162,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,763.082,768.178,"Well, he is ultimately saying, trying to hear him, would the Chief Justice say it?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,768.178,781.382,"No sir, it wouldn’t because it seems to me that if you gave the probationary teacher a hearing, then you are destroying the very purpose of tenure."
1971.71-162,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,787.423,790.648,I thought you said that he was entitled to a hearing.
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,790.648,792.323,"In court Your Honor, in court."
1971.71-162,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,792.323,805.09,"In court, yeah, the only quarrel with the Court of Appeals is that if there is a hearing before the university administrative group rather than before the court."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,805.09,807.411,"That's our only complaint Your Honor, yes sir."
1971.71-162,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,824.5,837.769,I would like to come back Justice White's inquiry of what difference does it make to you in this or any other case once you've conceded this much?
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,837.769,841.384,Conceded what Your Honor?
1971.71-162,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,841.384,848.221,"Well, it seems to me that you’ve conceded a good litigated ase away."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,863.009,870.071,He is entitled to a hearing in the district court as to whether his fundamental liberties or First Amendment Rights have been violated.
1971.71-162,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,897.445,904.421,"Well I gather, you say that, because the action in the 1983 is predicated on the denial Of Constitutional Rights."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,904.421,905.34,Yes Sir.
1971.71-162,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,905.34,913.82,"And I gather you are also saying, that predicated risk claim, denial of First Amendment."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,913.82,914.337,Yes.
1971.71-162,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,914.337,930.891,"He might lose on that, and that still be open to question, pleaded both here and in the other case, he's entitled to a hearing as a matter of procedural Due Process which says nothing right over to do with it."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,930.891,932.039,"It's right, there is nothing to do --"
1971.71-162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,932.039,935.726,"There is nothing in whatever to do with teachers as in the class, does it?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,940.359,944.635,"Well, that would be true for any governmental employee."
1971.71-162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,945.946,955.214,"State action I'm talking about, let's make it more sharply, a driver for some state official, a truck driver."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,976.27,997.808,"Not a thing, Your Honor, I just wanted to make it clear to the court that the issue here is Due Process the law and does not involve First Amendment Rights of Doctor Roth at this time."
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1000.75,1005.991,"Well, couldn't he have a 1983 action be predicated on the denial of Due Process?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1005.991,1007.014,Yes Sir.
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1007.014,1007.798,With this court?
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1007.798,1008.888,Yes Sir.
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1008.888,1011.961,Both on denial of First Amendment Rights and Denial of due process?
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1011.961,1014.861,Yes.
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1014.861,1017.956,"The one that's here, the only one it's here is the denial of Due Process."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1017.956,1019.253,Yes.
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1019.253,1026.038,"Well, why is that here at this stage if that's still be litigated to the District Court?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1026.038,1040.71,"The Due Process question is not to be litigated in the District Court, Your Honor, the District Court ordered that in every case, that they have already decided it, they ordered that to give him a hearing and that's --"
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1040.71,1044.33,"That's right and then that should affirm in the Seventh Circuit, why to bring it here."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1044.33,1045.746,Yes.
1971.71-162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1045.746,1051.764,"You want to channel in, into just a strictly section 1983 action, nothing more?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1051.764,1093.877,"Yes, it seems to me that the issue really is, is whether the constitution recognizes a state system of statutory opinion or the maintenance of a meaningful system of tenure under State Law by creation of section 37.31 of the statutes, the Wisconsin legislature has recognized the importance of having a probationary period leading up to the acquisition of permanent employee status or tenure."
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1223.257,1244.572,"May I ask you again, let's assume you've had a deal with the part of the District Court order which granted him hearing or you haven't brought the Court of Appeals decision here and then you had one what was left to be litigated in the District Court namely the First Amendment claim."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1248.721,1251.744,Yes.
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1251.744,1258.434,What does that mean in terms of the relationships between the University and law.
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1265.745,1269.501,"It was an alternative order Your Honor, one --"
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1269.501,1273.342,"Alright, so they either reinstate him or give him a hearing."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1273.342,1275.23,Give him a contract or give him a hearing.
1971.71-162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1275.23,1295.974,"So the District Court wouldn't be purporting itself to try out the issues involved in his discharge -- on non renewal, they would on the First Amendment side, but they would not be purporting to try out whether he was fired for incompetence or whether it was incompetent."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1295.974,1319.693,"I don't know Your Honor, the District Court decision said that in recognizing the danger of losing a recognizable system of tenure, the District Court said that the court will recognize minimal grounds for none reappointment."
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1322.255,1328.855,"Anyway, the district court didn't kind of played any further proceedings until and unless the University gave him a hearing."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1328.855,1329.75,That's right.
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1329.75,1333.127,And that meanwhile he had to be reinstated.
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1333.127,1346.388,"No sir, it was not -- What happened, it was an alternative order, one, give him a contract and I assume if we don't gave him a contract we would possibly be liable for damage."
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1346.388,1347.315,Or give him a hearing.
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1347.315,1358.783,Or give him a hearing and we immediately asked for a stay of that decision or order and immediately appealed to the Circuit Court.
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1358.783,1370.879,"The court didn't indicate whether or not after a hearing and a decision against Roth, whether or not the District Court would and to what extent give judicial review to that decision."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1370.879,1378.66,He did not indicate other than to say he would respect minimal grounds for none --
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1378.66,1389.167,Did the District Court indicate what the District Court would do if the university chose not to give him a hearing?
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1389.167,1397.181,"Well, then we would have to give him a contract, we didn't give him a contract, we would be in contempt of court, Your Honor."
1971.71-162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1397.181,1406.808,"Are you here only because you say that on non-renewal of a non-tenure teacher, you don't have to give any hearing at all?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1406.808,1408.984,Yes sir.
1971.71-162,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1408.984,1410.376,Or a reason.
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1410.376,1414.099,Or a reason.
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.998,1450.93,"You say it's simply a matter of Contract Law and as the District Court and the Court of Appeals were in error thinking that the constitution required the courts to add something to the parties with the contract, and the day the contract of the parties was made, is that it?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1450.93,1458.298,"No sir, I don't maintain that, I think it's a great deal more than mere Contract Law."
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1458.298,1460.904,How much more?
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1460.904,1466.24,I think the court has to balance the interest here.
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1466.24,1485.743,"Does the court do that in an ordinary contract case, or just says look you really should have provided and since you didn't provide for a hearing on this, let us say this tenancy, year to year tenancy, we are now going to require one -- the court does --"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1485.743,1488.518,I have never heard of that.
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1488.518,1494.551,Why is there something in -- required here.
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1494.551,1496.633,"Well I don't know, Your Honor, it's --"
1971.71-162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1496.633,1503.237,"Well, what is your -- I don't really understand your position, I guess that's my problem is all about."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1503.237,1519.93,My position is basically this that Due Process of law and the Fourteenth Amendment does not require the procedural protection of a statement of reason or a hearing.
1971.71-162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1522.015,1534.989,"Well then, didn't I state it correctly that you say that there is nothing in the constitution that requires a Court to add anything to the contract that the parties made in this case?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1534.989,1541.84,"Yes Sir, I guess, that's correct."
1971.71-162,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1545.984,1554.11,Does the hearings before the District Court you think should be held is one purely -- where the First Amendment Rights have been violated?
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1554.11,1556.327,"Yes sir, that's all."
1971.71-162,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1566.943,1595.363,"Well, I take it you say that the University, they did not renew it because of its exercise of the First Amendment Rights, that the only remedy he has is 1983 action and the only hearing I guess is the hearing on the 1983 complaint in the Court that even on that circumstance, he is not entitled of any hearing before a University."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1595.363,1617.415,"Yes Sir, for very, very practical reason because he is a probationary employee, and for another thing, these situations are very, very rare Your Honor in my opinion, and if somebody's constitutional rights are in fact infringed, I think in most instances, by inadvertence or ignorance of the constitution."
1971.71-162,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1634.879,1639.255,"Now, what you are saying is he has no resource."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1639.255,1643.326,"No sir, he, if he feels that his --"
1971.71-162,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1643.326,1651.079,"I understood, you say they can have in the institution and whatever he gets in the court is not going to do him any good."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1651.079,1654.242,"No, I never intended to imply that Your Honor."
1971.71-162,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1654.242,1658.782,"Well do you assume that at the District Court, he could find out why he was fired?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1658.782,1659.985,Absolutely.
1971.71-162,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1659.985,1660.511,Why?
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1664.766,1672.037,"But, once you are in litigation you have all the procedural remedies of a trial, you have discovery."
1971.71-162,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1672.037,1674.154,Well let me ask you this.
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1682.551,1687.927,"No sir, it would not because are talking about hundreds of cases of non-renewal.f"
1971.71-162,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1692.332,1695.977,But does anybody say that you have to give a hearing to everyone?
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1695.977,1698.626,"That's what the District Court ordered, that in every case --"
1971.71-162,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1698.626,1701.308,"Not in every case, that's where it is requested."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1701.308,1702.505,"Yes, in every -- oh yes."
1971.71-162,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1702.505,1704.052,Where requested.
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1704.052,1705.528,In every case where requested.
1971.71-162,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1705.528,1709.175,"Right, and how many that wouldn't be many?"
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1709.175,1712.392,"Well there is no way of knowing Your Honor, but there are --"
1971.71-162,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1712.392,1720.671,"Why is it that you -- first, I heard that I want some litigation, but trying to get away from litigation."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1720.671,1731.905,"It would be an unnecessary and time consuming and wasteful procedure to put not only the school truly Your Honor, but it would be wasteful for the professor himself."
1971.71-162,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.905,1735.072,"Well, not if the trial goes on, if he requested hearing, not if the trial goes on to the hearing."
1971.71-162,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1735.072,1747.654,"Mr. Bleck, if he proves something wasn't referred to him, the case is over with."
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1761.005,1812.803,"Well, first of all the statement of reasons -- I don't know what type of case we are talking about, whether we are talking about case that involves First Amendment claim or whether we are talking about such things as scholarship, rapport with the student body and so forth, it it is that type of a situation where these things are very difficult to articulate and these decisions are made up by many, many people, this isn't the decision of one man, but this is the decision of maybe twelve or fifteen people and to have a hearing on whether this particular professor has achieved a certain level of scholarship."
1971.71-162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1839.611,1842.637,I take it you are still standing on your basic position.
1971.71-162,0,18535,charles_a_bleck,,1856.335,1862.401,"That's it precisely, thank you."
1971.71-162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1862.401,1868.564,Mr. Steinglass.
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1868.564,1872.49,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1895.77,1897.642,"A paper hearing, is it up?"
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1897.642,1899.832,"No, I don’t think so, I hope not."
1971.71-162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1919.112,1922.594,"How about, court examined which issue?"
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1922.594,1928.882,Well I think the answer to that question has to be look back at the order of the District Court.
1971.71-162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1941.473,1943.377,Did he give that through witnesses?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1943.377,1944.067,Yes.
1971.71-162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1944.067,1946.959,Could he have the assistant to counsel?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1946.959,1949.873,I would think that he would be able to have representation there.
1971.71-162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1952.326,1953.518,Subpeona power?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1953.518,1955.144,"No, no I think, subpeona power would not have --"
1971.71-162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1955.144,1958.165,Discovery?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1958.165,1959.755,"Discovery, I was --"
1971.71-162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1959.755,1964.702,I was not -- are you talking about a full Due Process here?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1964.702,1967.558,"No, I am not talking about of full panoply of rights."
1971.71-162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1975.5,1997.67,"Is he entitled to as many of the elements of Due Process that we held in Goldberg, the welfare recipient is entitled to it before welfare benefits maybe terminated."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2020.305,2041.94,"I would think so, I think the major exception would be that because the District court recognized that we were dealing with academic questions many of which would -- many of the decisions would rely on very subtle reasons that firstly, he had -- the Court had to report to the university over a very wide discretion."
1971.71-162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2116.761,2121.319,How about any partial decision like there was a dissent --
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2121.319,2148.214,"Yes, I think that would be essential but that still would leave university great deal of discretion in determining who that decision maker would be that doesn't necessarily mean that it has be an independent examiner taking from outside of the university system, although it could be, it does in the context of the present case defending Giles (ph) who only became a defendant after Professor Roth was denied minimal Due Process."
1971.71-162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2165.174,2175.868,How about a written statement of reasons supporting the decisions from the decision maker?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2175.868,2179.163,"I would think that that would be essential Your Honor, that decision maker would want to --"
1971.71-162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2179.163,2185.359,"Well, what did it sound to me that what’s different, Goldberg case."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2185.359,2191.008,I thought the court in Goldberg did recognize that was offering minimal pre-termination evidentiary hearing and if the court --
1971.71-162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2191.008,2202.698,"My question was as to whether or not the type of hearing you’re saying, Due Process requires, in this situation, the same type of hearing, we said in Goldberg, you are acts just seemed to me which are yes."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2202.698,2216.446,But I think the essential difference is that and I indicated it before is that the burdens would be completely different and in Goldberg -- in Welfare type situations there is the equivalent of a four clause requirement.
1971.71-162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2231.767,2245.73,Would you think this minimal Due Process that you are talking about Mr. Steinglass would be limited to the faculty members or would it include the elevator operator who takes the faculty members up to the upper floors of the building.
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2245.73,2247.346,Well I would think that --
1971.71-162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2247.346,2251.056,Assuming they aren't covered by a union contract after all the tenure.
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2251.056,2277.669,"I would think that in each instance, someone would have to undergo the balancing test that this court has underdone in the past and I could well see, how court might come down on a different side of the equation with respect to an elevator operator, than it might with the Professor, I think there are certain differences, when one applies the Fourteenth Amendment, balancing test."
1971.71-162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2339.773,2348.844,"But that's only assumption, that's all like tell a elevator operator to look for a job as a mechanic, and not to tell a teacher to look for a job as mechanic."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2348.844,2365.201,"Well, I think the court has looked at the interests of the individual involved and I think that would probably be the answer."
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.201,2369.249,While we have you interrupted -- where is Dr. Roth now?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2369.249,2383.338,"I thought you would ask Your Honor, first year he was unable to find employment and he had a post doctoral research, post doctoral position at one of the big time Universities."
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2434.075,2456.715,"No back-pay consequences would flow from the hearing out of Judge Doyle's decision below, with a -- University could grant him a hearing upon remand and if it granted the hearing and followed whatever procedure Judge Doyle had described and then decided he was dismissed their would be no back-pay claim?"
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2456.715,2470.762,"At this point, Judge Doyle has not -- I think by implication by delaying -- by not rendering a decision, we would then – one or two months after, it was commenced."
1971.71-162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2524.562,2530.961,"What if he (Voice Overlap) First Amendment claims, reinstatement or damage?"
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2530.961,2544.965,"At the time, the suit was filed, reinstatement at this point if we had -- when we go back because the only issue for the court is a procedural due process issue, we will have to reexamine what we will be seeking."
1971.71-162,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2544.965,2553.963,"But I take it you sustained your First Amendment claim, then that would be limited to say that by then --"
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2553.963,2567.113,"No, damage -- the defendant Giles (ph) was sued in his individual capacity as well as in his official capacity -- so as far as his individual capacity we could pursue that."
1971.71-162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2618.5,2625.71,What do you understand are the procedures a tenured teacher receives?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2644.077,2653.749,"Yes, they would receive a statement of reasons why they were being destroyed in that case and they would have a hearing on that?"
1971.71-162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2653.749,2658.931,Essentially like the hearing that Judge Doyle has ordered here in general outline?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2658.931,2662.199,I have never seen one of those hearings.
1971.71-162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2687.602,2701.868,"Well, we went in to the basis of the decision that the mechanism, the machinery of reaching that decision is at the same for the tenured teacher as for Mr. Roth?"
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2701.868,2709.218,"Well, I would like it to be the same -- Doctor Roth as it would be for the tenured teacher."
1971.71-162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2723.657,2725.59,But he didn't define what minimal was.
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2725.59,2747.069,"Right, I think for good reason Your Honor, these cases will be coming up in the future in districts, both in Wisconsin and then other parts of this country and I think, the determination of what a minimal hearing would consist of, outweighed a case by case determination by the courts."
1971.71-162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2920.86,2934.575,Are suggesting an inconsistency Mr. Steinglass in the position of non-renewal and keeping them for the balance of the year?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2934.575,2960.091,"Well, I am suggesting that through the experience of keeping a teacher to the end of the year and simply saying now we decide not to retain you and so since, Wisconsin statute do not provide any procedures and in fact don’t limit us to the reasons we might choose, we will do it this way, rather than saying, well we better get rid of you right now."
1971.71-162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2961.323,2977.266,"Having made a commitment for the whole year, for nine months, the school year, are you suggesting the University should not keep it if they can possibly do it consistent with the welfare of the University?"
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,2977.266,2995.765,"Well, I wouldn't want the University to violate the contractual rights, but if he was unfit or not a proper teacher, the University could simply offer to pay out his salary, if it became that serious, but I think the real point --"
1971.71-162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2995.765,3003.397,Isn't it reasonable that he might have been in the situation that he wasn't bad enough to fire but not good enough to keep.
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3019.276,3031.391,That's certainly a distinction between the two.
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3080.654,3098.842,"Would you say that -- let’s assume that a nontenured teacher gets notice that his contract will not be renewed and it is stated in the letter, we have no reason other than the fact that we think we could find someone better sometimes than you are."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3100.37,3100.978,And the teacher --
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3100.978,3102.879,We do not claim you have done anything wrong at all.
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3102.879,3108.8,And the teacher doesn't believe that that's pretext here I believe that's an honest reason.
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.588,3144.136,"Well, what if the letter says, we are not terminating your contract or refusing your review because you exercised any First Amendment Rights at all."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3155.091,3162.566,"Well they can see, in other words they can see they have no reason, it's not that they can’t give you, when they don't have one."
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.662,3175.462,Which one are they --
1971.71-162,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3175.462,3177.095,Will the burden shift to him?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3177.095,3179.263,"No Your Honor, the burden would definitely be on the professor."
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3187.386,3191.121,"He has a substantive right, not to be fired without a reason under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3191.121,3192.781,Yes.
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.781,3195.01,Even non-tenured teacher?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3195.01,3211.607,"Without any -- I mean, no, we are not just -- we are just saying that one day the President comes and says, “Today I am going to fire somebody, you are the most likely candidate,” I would think that that might well be arbitrary and capricious --"
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3211.607,3217.967,Does he have the right not to be fired without a good reason.
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3217.967,3219.639,"well, good reason --"
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3219.639,3220.792,"Alright, without any reason."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3220.792,3225.435,Without any reason whatsoever.
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3233.47,3236.63,"But, any reason will do?"
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3245.52,3246.381,"No I think, no."
1971.71-162,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3255.112,3258.513,"I hope, it’s a probably good reason."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3258.513,3270.418,"Whatever, the question of whether or not there are any substantive protection to the Fourteenth Amendment is more a question, a question of where those substantive --"
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3270.418,3284.034,"Were do you draw the line -- – there may be an assessment of reason, constitutional reason, where you differ the situation from a tenancy?"
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3284.034,3293.521,"A tenured teacher could not be terminated and if he, more of the reason, I want to say, that we found somebody better."
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3293.521,3297.166,That's because of the time?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3297.166,3298.218,But at times --
1971.71-162,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3298.218,3301.544,A tenured can’t be terminated without cause.
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3301.544,3305.088,"That's right, I would think cause has been interpreted --"
1971.71-162,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3305.088,3307.331,Cause has to be shown.
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.331,3310.128,Would the length of his hair be a cause?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3310.128,3314.367,For a tenured teacher?
1971.71-162,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3342.05,3354.71,"What happens if the hearing on non-tenure professor, he says why without filing the appointing authority or discharging authority says, I don't have to give you any reason."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3354.71,3356.91,That is essentially what happened here.
1971.71-162,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3356.91,3360.857,That's just what I am talking.
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3362.426,3378.411,"Well, if this court was to accept, the position that advanced by David Roth, the teacher would be able to request to the University, that they provide him with the reasons and their failure to do so would seem to me would violate --"
1971.71-162,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3378.411,3389.818,"But suppose at that stage the University says, you just use your language, somebody's language, you just don’t cut too much."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3389.818,3397.614,"Well, I would think that a professor at that point would be able to request a hearing and at which time he would have --"
1971.71-162,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3397.614,3400.945,"Well, I am talking about just their behavior."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3400.945,3414.464,"Well, he would then have the burden on him to bring in testimony and show that reason was wholly – and he did cut the mustard, however I would think that a reason like that --"
1971.71-162,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3414.464,3419.29,I would hate to see somebody have to prove that he is an efficient professor.
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3419.29,3423.676,"No, I am not -- professor."
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3473.636,3477.133,"Where are the substantive right, the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3477.133,3479.114,"The Fourteenth Amendment, I mean the case --"
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3479.114,3484.539,"Must have been the due process, nothing to do with trial."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3484.539,3485.661,Yes Your Honor.
1971.71-162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3551.491,3573.554,"Would you make the same claim for a person who had not been hired that is who had applied and who was not hired, as you make for a person who is not rehired, the last time I would say parenthetically, the last two-three questions and answers had all talked about firing somebody, you don't claim the man was fired, do you?"
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3573.554,3632.498,"A lot of the lawyers in this area, Your Honor -- and administratively slip in their terminology and facts, perhaps that's indicative of the fact, that even the lawyers and administrators in the area do not see that substantial difference between the two, I mean non-renewed, non-retained, and as far as the specific questions, I can see, specifically different bouncing being made in point of that, with respect to the hearing rights of the person who has denied an initial application, it seemed that his hearing rights would be -- his interests would be quite small and probably would not entitle him to a hearing, again that decision doesn't have to be reached, but certainly no stigma would flow from the failure to get a job and certainly not the same stigma that would flow from being not retained on the relocation problems, would not flow, from not receiving the job, with lots of income and income was never coming in, but certainly not be a direct --"
1971.71-162,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3632.498,3638.487,"You just said something, under the (Inaudible)."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3681.74,3683.428,"That's correct, we will go --"
1971.71-162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3683.428,3688.91,Justice teacher-qua-teacher has served certain First Amendment values.
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3688.91,3697.065,"That's part of that but in addition, in this case the reasons that were discovered did in fact implicate --"
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3697.065,3706.925,"Yeah, but as I gather, you distinguished then the teacher from the college administrator, the college janitor, the college -- and the other kind of, the college football coach for example."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3706.925,3711.836,I would say we don't have to reach that question and the different bouncing would be undertaken in each case.
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3711.836,3714.202,How about the college student?
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3714.202,3740.388,"Well, this court in Goldberg did site approvingly the Dickson case for the Fifth Circuit, I would say, college student probably would if those person not ruled out it would probably be entire -- there is a minimal Due Process for court, he has to leave and pointed back, one of Roth's public statements dealt with the fact that students had been terminated without due process and ironic twist that he is here today asking such rights for himself."
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3740.388,3768.53,"Mr. Steinglass, one last question, during the World War II, student bodies dried up because people were at war, suppose that same kind of thing happened at Oshkosh and the administration terminated 90% of the non-tenure people, retaining 10%, would anyone of the 90% have the right to a hearing on your theory?"
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3768.53,3781.842,"I think they would have the right, I think that reason that you stated would be a perfectly a legitimate reason, I can't see any logic behind a professor asserting his right to a hearing in that situation."
1971.71-162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3781.842,3791.108,"That's because he would have a right to know why he, rather than x was let go."
1971.71-162,1,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3791.108,3794.002,Yes.
1971.71-162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3794.002,3795.09,Thank you Mr. Steinglass.
