1994.105_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.004,"We'll hear argument next in Number 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado."
1994.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,10.689,13.408,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.105_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.692,149.577,Over what period of time is that?
1994.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,149.577,155.648,"--This is over the study period of 1950 through 1985, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.105_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,210.635,214.42,"I'm just curious, when you talk about the courtroom, are you assuming it's full to the ceiling, or just a foot?"
1994.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,216.789,219.074,"I'm assuming it's full right to the ceiling, Your Honor."
1994.105_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,219.074,219.824,I see.
1994.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,224.995,229.012,The State of Kansas has filed three exceptions.
1994.105_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.618,262.52,"Well, on those two claims, Mr. Draper, the special master concluded, as I understand his report and recommendation, that Kansas just failed to demonstrate adequately those depletions, and if that factual finding is valid, why doesn't that end the matter on those claims?"
1994.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,262.52,267.972,"Your Honor, the two claims are quite different with respect to the answer to your question."
1994.105_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.916,324.593,"Well, presumably the parties to that special operating program can sue in district court to enforce any rights under that separate agreement, isn't that so?"
1994.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,324.593,326.576,"We don't believe that's true, Your Honor."
1994.105_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,335.032,344.555,"But the master found that there was no damage in effect to Kansas because there was no proof that the flow at State line was any different, isn't that right?"
1994.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,344.555,361.415,"We believe, Your Honor, that the State of Kansas received some benefits from the adoption of the operating principles that correspond to the allowance of the project in the first place, which was being held up until--"
1994.105_orig,1,21428,david_w_robbins,,1476.94,1479.959,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.105_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1583.792,1601.854,"May I ask you a question about definition, and it didn't occur to me that I had this question before, but when you speak... when you use the term, material depletion, does that term refer solely to volume of water, without any reference to the capacity of the recipient of that water to use it beneficially?"
1994.105_orig,1,21428,david_w_robbins,,1601.854,1607.741,"There are two... there are... if I may, there are two concepts that are important here."
1994.105_orig,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2720.678,2737.857,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.105_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2784.288,2784.621,Do you agree--
1994.105_orig,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2788.69,2794.226,We believe an action could conceivably be brought based on the operating principles in another forum.
1994.105_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2798.511,2799.713,Brought by the State?
1994.105_orig,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2799.713,2801.28,The State has a problem here.
1994.105_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2815.823,2825.346,"The operating principles, were they because of the approval of them by the compact administrators?"
1994.105_orig,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2830.583,2833.018,We agree with the special master it did not.
1994.105_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2906.067,2908.519,What is Kansas' burden of proof here?
1994.105_orig,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2913.153,2913.937,It would be our view--
1994.105_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2913.937,2915.422,--of the compact violation?
1994.105_orig,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2915.422,2921.242,--It is our view that it would make sense to employ the clear and convincing standard in this situation.
1994.105_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2953.33,2962.903,"Although we have suggested that a preponderance standard is appropriate for violations of a decree, is it?"
1994.105_orig,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2962.903,2974.711,"I think that the Court... this... I think you're speaking to the 1993 decision in Nebraska v. Wyoming, and in that case the Court noted that a party does not need to prove injury in order to enforce a decree."
1994.105_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2983.233,2990.804,"Well, do you take the position that the standard of proof would be clear and convincing even when there has been a decree and the issue is whether it's been violated?"
1994.105_orig,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2990.804,2994.856,"We take the position that it should be the same, because otherwise you're going to encounter difficulties in litigating--"
1994.105_orig,3,30017,john_b_draper,,3335.156,3339.191,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.105_orig,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3423.012,3436.188,What's the utility of recognizing a... let's say a proof of vague violation when it's simply going to lead to damages and the vagueness there is going to preclude a reliable damage remedy?
1994.105_orig,3,30017,john_b_draper,,3436.188,3449.579,"Because there are both retrospective and prospective remedies potentially available, and the prospective remedy is very important to the State of Kansas."
1994.105_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3653.176,3655.56,"Thank you, Mr. Draper."
