2011.10-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.57,"We will hear argument next in Case 10-1104, Minneci v. Pollard."
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,8.537,11.456,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,46.545,57.003,"Can we go back to what you said initially, that is if there's no alternative remedy Bivens fills the gap."
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,89.991,92.093,"Well, the rule--"
2011.10-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,92.093,92.676,Is that so?
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,92.676,98.128,"--The the rule -- the Carlson rule still applies, Your Honor, because that involved actual Federal government employees."
2011.10-1104,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,175.58,177.296,"Suppose, Mr. Franklin, that there weren't."
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,205.265,215.038,--In that hypothetical instance -- and we do think it's hypothetical -- we think that would be a different case and the Court could in that circumstance say there were no adequate alternative remedies.
2011.10-1104,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,237.784,238.819,But is your answer--
2011.10-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,238.819,255.329,"Mr. Franklin, there were some references to Mississippi law that seems to be inconsistent with the notion that all States would provide an adequate remedy."
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,255.329,269.271,"I believe that reference, if I am correct, comes from an amicus brief, and that law does not -- would not on its face prohibit an action against a private managed prison holding Federal prisoners."
2011.10-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,290.335,294.554,Is it -- then it might hold State prisoners as well.
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,294.554,296.156,I'm sorry?
2011.10-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,296.156,304.612,It might hold -- some private facilities will take State prisoners as well as Federal prisoners.
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,304.612,312.165,"There has been some representation, that we don't disagree with, that there might be some facilities that have State prisoners and--"
2011.10-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,312.165,320.538,"And if they do have State prisoners, the State prisoner would have recourse to, not Bivens, but 1983."
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,320.538,323.656,"--Most likely, Your Honor, yes, if it's under--"
2011.10-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,323.656,332.829,"So you have two prisoners, identical mistreatment, and one gets a Federal remedy and the other doesn't."
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,332.829,337.316,--The other actually gets what the Court in Malesko described as a superior remedy.
2011.10-1104,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,345.256,348.79,"Can you tell me why it is that you, you care in this suit?"
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,364.55,366.685,"--Well, I have several answers to that."
2011.10-1104,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,376.375,377.727,Just because of the statute of limitations?
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,377.727,383.381,"It's way too late now, 10 years after the incident, for them to now assert a State law claim."
2011.10-1104,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,391.284,394.486,If we are looking -- if we are looking forward beyond this case--
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,394.486,394.836,--Right.
2011.10-1104,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,394.836,401.057,"--and there is no statute of limitation problem, does it really make any difference that he has a second cause of action that's just, A--"
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,401.057,401.974,It makes a--
2011.10-1104,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,401.974,403.859,"--duplicative or, B, arguably narrow, more narrow?"
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,403.859,404.692,"--Well, two points."
2011.10-1104,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,414.598,416.35,But what difference does it make?
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,416.35,421.285,--Let me give you a practical difference that it does matter for individuals in my clients' situation.
2011.10-1104,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,460.093,463.562,"--Mr. Franklin, do you have a theory about why these are brought as Bivens claims?"
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,478.804,480.089,--I can't answer that question.
2011.10-1104,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,525.368,540.461,"To go back to what I asked before when I hypothesized a State that didn't have adequate remedies, and you said -- well, just to pin down what you said, if there were no adequate remedies there would be a Bivens action available?"
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,540.461,541.561,"There might be, Your Honor."
2011.10-1104,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,567.195,572.48,"To get back to the question that Justice Ginsburg asked, is that consistent with Carlson?"
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,589.442,597.63,"Well, as the case came to the Court in Carlson, it was undisputed that there was no adequate State law remedy, the lower courts had held."
2011.10-1104,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,681.05,694.525,Does a prisoner in a State that requires the filing of a certificate of merit in a medical malpractice case have an alternative -- a viable alternative State claim--
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,694.525,696.477,"Yes, again, that's--"
2011.10-1104,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,696.477,697.194,--for malpractice?
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,697.194,697.944,--We say yes.
2011.10-1104,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,712.287,715.622,How is a prisoner supposed to satisfy that requirement?
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,715.622,718.906,--The same way any other plaintiff is supposed to.
2011.10-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,757.881,763.685,Did any of those courts address the problem of how the pro se prisoner is going to get an affidavit?
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,763.685,769.606,"Well, Alba -- the Alba court is -- is the only court that I'm aware of on the circuit level that's considered it."
2011.10-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,777.695,780.645,I don't -- I don't understand your answer to Justice Kagan.
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,793.138,793.538,Right.
2011.10-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,793.538,794.005,So--
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,794.005,809.164,"I'm talking about if the conduct -- we are comparing here between conduct that would violate the Eighth Amendment and conduct that is negligent, and I'm saying if the conduct rises to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation, which is what we're talking about in terms of the adequacy, then it would be easier, one would presume."
2011.10-1104,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,809.164,811.932,"But I think the question, Mr. Franklin, is really just a practical one--"
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,811.932,812.232,Sure.
2011.10-1104,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,812.232,820.888,--which is how a pro se person sitting in prison is supposed to have access to a doctor who will provide this certificate.
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,825.092,829.311,"I would think there would, but I don't want to say -- I don't want to argue someone else's case on that."
2011.10-1104,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,899.674,926.474,"Under the PLRA -- under the PLRA, a district judge has to perform a screening function for -- for these complaints, and is that -- is it going to be an impossible burden for district judges to ascertain the contours of state prison law, in that there apparently is not a lot of prisoner litigation under State law?"
2011.10-1104,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,929.276,932.045,"Well, in this case, the agistrate judge did it."
2011.10-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,965.512,966.662,"--Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1104,1,38316,pratik_shah,,980.355,983.74,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1104,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1028.269,1041.911,"Mr. Shah, go back to what you said about lacking these private -- these employees of the private corporation you said lack qualified immunity."
2011.10-1104,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1062.257,1063.526,"A couple of responses, Your Honor."
2011.10-1104,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1125.683,1140.526,Could you address the question posed earlier of what were to happen if there was a State law that gave absolute immunity to these private correctional officers and that was the case before us.
2011.10-1104,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1150.648,1151.115,Sure.
2011.10-1104,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1176.865,1187.657,"Interesting, because what you are proposing is a sort of State by State, circuit by circuit, presumably existence of a Bivens claim or not."
2011.10-1104,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1190.109,1198.363,"Well, yes, Your Honor, except the fact that there has been no suggestion that any State has such a draconian rule or has ever passed one."
2011.10-1104,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1226.479,1242.324,"Then I guess the question is, yes, when you talk about an overlap of remedies, we have said that it doesn't need to be a matching one to one remedy, but you do need some degree of meaningful overlap, don't you?"
2011.10-1104,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1242.324,1243.758,"I would agree with that, Your Honor."
2011.10-1104,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1244.258,1250.446,So how -- define how much or how do we describe the adequacy of that order?
2011.10-1104,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1250.446,1253.381,--I think it would be difficult to come up with a precise formulation.
2011.10-1104,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1300.862,1310.468,"The Bivens action is unusual in the first place, but it's also unusual to say that you don't have a Federal cause of action because of something a State gives you."
2011.10-1104,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1320.674,1331.632,"--Your Honor, it may not be an exact analog, but I think Federal due process cases often will look at someone's claims of deprivation of property, an unlawful deprivation of property in violation of process."
2011.10-1104,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1368.239,1370.307,"What is the theory behind that, Mr. Shah?"
2011.10-1104,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1381.564,1383.031,"Two responses, Your Honor."
2011.10-1104,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1451.078,1458.648,What would you propose that the Court say about the degree of adequate State remedy that is necessary?
2011.10-1104,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1462.683,1466.837,I think the Court should start with that.
2011.10-1104,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1488.351,1499.575,--Suppose that a State did for claims against private prisons and private prison guards what I understand New York has done with respect to State-run prisons.
2011.10-1104,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1509.597,1511.116,I think that would be a tougher case.
2011.10-1104,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1520.989,1521.841,Not a claim against the State.
2011.10-1104,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1526.209,1537.183,"--Your Honor, again I think that would be a more difficult hypothetical because the rational about individual deterrence of the individual officer may not be as strong in that hypothetical."
2011.10-1104,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1550.824,1554.395,What about the character of the claim?
2011.10-1104,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1569.719,1576.456,"Your Honor, it is true, the labels are different and there's going to be different meaning to those remedies."
2011.10-1104,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1591.265,1591.599,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1104,2,32295,john_f_preis,,1601.888,1604.657,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-1104,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1632.557,1641.663,Why are State remedies -- what of your clients' claims could not be vindicated under State law?
2011.10-1104,2,32295,john_f_preis,,1649.852,1659.225,"Your Honor, with regard to the claims that can't be vindicated under State law, we think its likely that his medical malpractice claims, the claims against the doctors, could be vindicated."
2011.10-1104,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1719.396,1722.448,But the specific case with state remedies is not available is--
2011.10-1104,3,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1722.448,1722.948,Your Honor I'm not aware.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1722.948,1726.233,--Your Honor I'm not aware of any particular case where a state--
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1726.233,1726.916,"--No, no, no."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1735.922,1739.291,--The claims that we say do not have--
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1739.291,1742.076,--I don't understand specifically what they are.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1764.275,1769.929,"--Your Honor, I think that the starkest example, if it was the case that somebody actually starved someone--"
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1769.929,1774.564,"No, don't answer my -- forget my hypothetical."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1785.788,1786.471,"--Oh, excuse me, Your Honor."
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1786.471,1788.573,I heard the answer in general.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1788.573,1789.256,Okay.
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1789.256,1794.877,I want to know specifically what you say they did to your client that doesn't make out a State tort claim.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1794.877,1798.762,He brings four claims that he think alleges an Eighth Amendment violation.
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1807.368,1807.935,I heard you say--
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1807.935,1808.637,And those three are--
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1808.637,1809.32,--that.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1821.778,1823.063,--Your Honor--
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1823.063,1827.098,"Sorry, I don't mind to sound irritated but I just have trouble getting my question across."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1827.098,1827.998,"--Understood, Your Honor."
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1833.802,1834.435,All right.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1838.506,1841.108,"--Well, yes, adequate nutrition."
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1842.475,1854.083,"They gave him -- and if a person in California who has charge of -- of a ward or someone fails adequately to nourish that ward, you are saying California tort law gives no remedy?"
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1854.083,1857.451,"--I'm saying there is no evidence that it does, Your Honor."
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1858.085,1859.753,"--cause like negligence, you give a remedy."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1864.923,1871.227,"--Your Honor, I think -- I would put -- I think the best way to approach that question is to look at the shoes of an attorney."
2011.10-1104,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1880.333,1881.05,You can't--
2011.10-1104,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.05,1884.118,The lawyer would say I can't find a starving case in California.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1888.422,1891.041,"--No, I think the lawyer would say, I can't be certain."
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1892.808,1898.878,--of -- because the Eighth Amendment says cruel and unusual punishment.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1923.262,1924.029,--Yes.
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1924.029,1926.547,"Therefore, I ask for some elaboration of that."
2011.10-1104,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.547,1927.914,What do you have besides starving?
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1929.749,1938.205,The other claims were after he suffered his injuries he was put back on his work detail before his injuries were healed.
2011.10-1104,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1950.996,1953.412,Can I ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Franklin?
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1966.756,1970.458,"Your Honor, I think there is two parts to that, two answers I would give."
2011.10-1104,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1991.054,1994.406,"Well that was just false consciousness that we can correct, right?"
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,1994.406,1996.025,"Excuse me, Your Honor, I missed the beginning."
2011.10-1104,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1996.025,2006.297,"I mean, if the -- if the true appropriate remedy, and the better remedy from your client's point of view, is a State law action, we should just say bring a State law."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2006.297,2013.903,"Well we think that prisoners should have access to the State law action, and when there is cause of action available, it might indeed be a better remedy."
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2060.781,2062.214,"When I went to law school, evidence on in this case."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2071.053,2071.803,--Yes.
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.803,2085.746,"And it seemed to apply to doctors, and then it was medical malpractice, and it applied to others, and -- and is there something here that wouldn't fall in that general kind of rubric, or the general terms of California tort law?"
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2085.746,2086.962,"Your Honor, I guess your--"
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2086.962,2088.514,"And I know, I don't want you just to repeat yourself."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2090.466,2101.922,"--No -- Your Honor, I will say two things that -- first, I think what you are asking me to do and in a sense what the Court will be required to do in this case is predict what State supreme courts will do on a regular basis."
2011.10-1104,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2109.178,2112.797,--limit our inquiry to California?
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2112.797,2113.664,Excuse me?
2011.10-1104,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2113.664,2115.082,Limit it to California.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2116.249,2117.451,I don't--
2011.10-1104,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2117.451,2129.091,"--They're saying don't look at what other courts will do, just look at the State you are in, the place you are going to make your claim and figure out whether your claims are covered or not covered essentially in those -- in that State."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2129.091,2132.127,--They are suggesting this Court look only at California.
2011.10-1104,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2132.127,2132.627,Right.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2132.627,2133.627,We don't think that is appropriate.
2011.10-1104,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.316,2155.576,"So there -- if there is one State that would not have an adequate remedy for any -- any single bad thing that could happen in prison, there is a Bivens action for everybody for everything?"
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2156.676,2158.461,"Yes, Your Honor, we are."
2011.10-1104,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.461,2158.928,Wow.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2158.928,2161.23,I think if the Court were to write an opinion in that case--
2011.10-1104,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2161.23,2162.397,I certainly wouldn't want to hold that.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2163.63,2166.848,"--I'm not surprised that you wouldn't want to hold that, Your Honor."
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2167.966,2171.918,"I would find that rather surprising, too, actually."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2172.518,2172.802,Well--
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2172.802,2176.322,Because I -- I think what they're asking to do is fine.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2198.336,2198.986,--Well--
2011.10-1104,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2198.986,2203.704,"That -- that -- what they are saying is that you are not going to be able to show that, so it doesn't worry them."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2203.704,2213.626,"--Your Honor, I think that the -- the view that there's an ordinary duty of care, a duty to be reasonable, is quite a bit more complex than the Petitioners would make it out to be."
2011.10-1104,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.807,2235.409,Who says that the burden is on the other side?
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2245.015,2246.633,Your Honor--
2011.10-1104,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2246.633,2250.334,"You are the plaintiff here, you are trying to bring the Federal cause of action."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2257.488,2259.274,"--Your Honor, two answers to that."
2011.10-1104,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2294.911,2303.467,"Well, before you do, on page 5 of your brief you say, in the private prison setting, quote,"
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2311.306,2311.839,Yes.
2011.10-1104,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2311.839,2325.566,"What we said in Malesko, where you quote, is that if a Federal prisoner in a BOP facility alleges a constitutional deprivation, he may bring a Bivens claim against the offending individual officer."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2335.271,2340.242,"Yes, Your Honor, and I would seriously disagree with the suggestion it's a distortion."
2011.10-1104,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2340.242,2342.808,"Well, just to be clear."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2351.698,2368.66,"Your Honor, what the Court was speaking of in that section of its opinion was that the remedies between a BOP facility and individuals in a private facility should be similar, that it made no sense to give extra remedies to people in a private facility."
2011.10-1104,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2388.323,2389.989,You would expect the same rule.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2390.675,2391.208,Yes.
2011.10-1104,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2391.208,2392.941,--to apply in the private prison setting.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2401.697,2410.737,"Your Honor, I guess I certainly took part of the quote and didn't use all of the quote, but I did not in any means say--"
2011.10-1104,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.737,2412.755,That's known as misquoting--
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2412.755,2416.39,"--Well, Your Honor, I guess I would respectfully differ."
2011.10-1104,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2416.39,2431.4,"Would you be taking the position that even if there is an alternative State remedy, tort remedy, even so, there ought to be a power of Bivens action?"
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2438.656,2456.617,"I think, Your Honor, if this Court would -- could tell with confidence that States in all States provided sufficient remedies for the entire variety of Eighth Amendment violations, this Court would be certainly wise in allowing State remedies to work."
2011.10-1104,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2460.585,2469.758,Could you give me your best example of a State tort rule that would prevent a prisoner from bringing an Eighth Amendment claim?
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2469.758,2471.993,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
2011.10-1104,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2472.912,2481.399,Your best example of a tort rule from any State that would preclude a -- a valid Eighth Amendment claim.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2481.399,2485.387,"In other words, the prisoner would have an Eighth Amendment claim but not a tort--"
2011.10-1104,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2485.387,2497.444,"You have 50 States' worth of tort law to -- as your playground, and I want to know what tort rule would keep a prisoner with a valid Eighth Amendment claim -- would prevent him from recovering?"
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2497.444,2501.729,"--Your Honor, I would note Maryland, for example."
2011.10-1104,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.826,2523.362,--I don't understand what you are talking about.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2526.88,2528.13,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2011.10-1104,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2528.13,2529.999,"He is not liable unless he is malicious, or what?"
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2529.999,2535.235,"No, it's a suit against the warden for a failure to protect someone against attack by another prisoner."
2011.10-1104,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2535.235,2535.552,I see.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2541.723,2543.925,"The test in Maryland is maliciousness, yes."
2011.10-1104,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2543.925,2549.06,What about medical malpractice caps?
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2559.351,2563.303,"Your Honor, I don't think it's a significant difference in this case."
2011.10-1104,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2564.422,2566.389,"I guess that was a helpful question, in the sense that--"
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2566.389,2567.541,"--Oh, I understand."
2011.10-1104,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2567.541,2571.509,"--The Bivens action, presumably the cap would not apply."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2572.959,2578.662,I think there will be some cases in which the remedies will be curtailed under State law.
2011.10-1104,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2670.756,2676.476,"But in Carlson, it was Bivens or no damage remedy."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2679.512,2681.714,"Excuse me, Your Honor, I missed the first part of the question."
2011.10-1104,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2681.714,2700.091,"In Carlson, the Court was operating on the theory that with respect to the Federal employees, it was a Bivens remedy for damages or no remedy at all."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2700.091,2701.691,No individual remedy.
2011.10-1104,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2701.691,2702.158,Right.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2702.158,2703.043,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1104,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2703.043,2714.518,"And here, it is different from Carlson because there is an -- a remedy against an individual."
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2722.922,2730.128,"Your Honor, I think it's fair to say that in Carlson, the Court expressed a preference for an individual remedy over an entity remedy."
2011.10-1104,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2756.445,2761.499,Do you disagree that the -- I know you have your argument on compensation--
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2761.499,2761.966,Yes.
2011.10-1104,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2761.966,2766.784,"--But with respect to deterrence, is there any significant difference between the two causes of action?"
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2780.393,2789.666,"Your Honor, I think in the end the question asks me to make a 50-State assessment of how State law works, and in that sense, one can only speak in generalizations--"
2011.10-1104,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2789.666,2793.701,"So your answer -- your answer is the same as under compensation, that the State law might be different or not?"
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2793.701,2807.195,"--We think, inasmuch as a cause of action is available, with the exception, as the Court noted, of damages caps, there -- we would expect to have a similar level of deterrence, provided the damages are available."
2011.10-1104,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2807.195,2809.913,Who -- who actually ends up paying in these Bivens actions?
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2816.134,2819.669,"We would expect -- first of all, obviously, the liability is imposed on the individual."
2011.10-1104,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2837.53,2840.499,--I'm just looking in terms of the practical deterrence.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2863.531,2872.387,"--Your Honor, I am not versed in the indemnification rules of private prisons, but I would expect that there will be some instances where there is indemnification."
2011.10-1104,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2874.422,2894.586,"Do you think that the warden of a Maryland prison is aware that if -- if he allows one prisoner to beat up another prisoner, he is only liable for maliciousness and not for deliberate indifference -- if indeed there is a difference between the two?"
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2902.74,2911.428,"--Your Honor, I think it's always been this Court's presumption that actors, legal actors, respond to the standards of law that are imposed."
2011.10-1104,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.88,2916.166,Not -- not at that level of -- of refinement.
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,2943.483,2950.053,"--Your Honor, if it's the case that there's not a dime's worth of difference, that would only be at this point."
2011.10-1104,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3023.601,3029.588,"Well, what was the purpose of making the reference to private contractors in the Westfall Act?"
2011.10-1104,4,32295,john_f_preis,,3029.588,3035.426,"Your Honor, the Court -- excuse me, Congress did not make a reference to private contractors in the Westfall Act."
2011.10-1104,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3147.582,3149.617,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1104,5,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3151.736,3156.371,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-1104,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3226.718,3230.169,Do you want us to hold that there is no Bivens action in California?
2011.10-1104,5,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3232.355,3238.009,"I think the opinion could be as it was in Malesko, there is no Bivens action because there are alternative remedies."
2011.10-1104,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3287.106,3298.664,"Do you know if any of these Bivens claims have been pled in the alternative, that is the Bivens remedy, but alternatively State law?"
2011.10-1104,5,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3298.664,3300.516,"Yes, that does happen, Your Honor."
2011.10-1104,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3321.695,3323.545,Is there diversity in this case?
2011.10-1104,5,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3323.545,3325.881,--There may be.
2011.10-1104,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3346.961,3352.881,So you -- ou said there was a statute of limitations problem with starting new.
2011.10-1104,5,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3352.881,3353.4,Yes.
2011.10-1104,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3353.4,3355.95,What about if there is diversity--
2011.10-1104,5,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3355.95,3359.118,"Well, the case was dismissed."
2011.10-1104,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3359.118,3359.837,--that's allowing an amendment.
2011.10-1104,5,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3359.837,3364.939,"The case was dismissed, Your Honor, and it was appealed only on the ground of a Bivens claim."
2011.10-1104,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3368.826,3371.528,"Thank you, counsel."
