1994.94-631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.667,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-631, Miller v. Johnson, consolidated with United States v. Johnson."
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,23.031,25.718,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.94-631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,39.494,41.324,Wasn't that overruled later?
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,41.324,77.23,"That was... for the last 30 years, Your Honor, this Court has navigated that political thicket through Baker v. Carr and Reynolds, but I would suggest to this Court that we're at a fork in the road where instead of going through a manageable political thicket where one person, one vote decisions are made based on mathematics, we are standing at the edge of a precipice where if Shan is applied like the district court did here, the standards of open-ended review of why the legislature did this, why they did that, the goodness or the badness and the reasonableness of the particular reapportionment decisions, we would respectfully submit on behalf of the State of Georgia that we have a whole new kind and character of political thicket, not like what this Court has ever gone through before."
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,77.23,78.634,"Is there an issue about the ""why"" here?"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,79.866,80.712,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,80.712,84.585,"--as in the other one, there's no doubt that the object was to create a majority minority district."
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,84.585,85.334,The difference--
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,85.334,86.02,Is that contested?
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,86.02,91.363,--That there was a purpose and a goal of drawing a majority minority--
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,91.363,96.783,"If you'd like to say purpose or goal instead of object, that's okay with me, but that was indeed the purpose or goal, to create a majority minority--"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,96.783,101.001,"--The only difference that we have on this, Your Honor, is whether that was the predominant objective."
1994.94-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,126.63,129.457,--There certainly wasn't a consensus to draw a third one.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,129.457,132.206,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,132.206,132.705,Yes.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,132.705,133.953,"As a matter of fact, that is correct."
1994.94-631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,149.964,186.51,"Well, Mr. Walbert, following Brown v. Board of Education there were a number of challenges to school districting in the north where there had never been segregation by law, and those challenges were based on the idea that the school district, the school boards drew racially sensitive district lines tending to keep blacks in one district, and those kind of inquiries were exactly the same sort of inquiry here, what was the predominant purpose of the school board, and apparently those matters were dealt with without any great difficulty."
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,186.51,190.979,I would have to beg to differ with Your Honor's characterization of the relative complexity of the two kinds of cases.
1994.94-631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,203.77,211.0,"Well, I think if you asked a school board what was the most complex matter came before it that the school board would probably say redistricting--"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,211.0,211.518,Well--
1994.94-631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,211.518,213.608,--Drawing attendance zones.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,213.608,221.574,"--Your Honor, I think that the relative complexity of that and the hundreds of issues of the 236 members of the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, the two would pale by comparison."
1994.94-631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,224.948,240.035,"So you say that although the motive inquiry was handled apparently without any undue difficulty in the claims of de facto segregation, the similar motive inquiry can't be handled in a case like this?"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,240.035,246.189,--It is unquestionably at least a whole order of magnitude much more sophisticated and much more complicated on the first hand.
1994.94-631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,260.308,262.605,"Well, why should they manage that?"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,262.605,264.356,"Well, that's what this Court held they can."
1994.94-631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.838,269.055,I don't think the Court... this is a little bit... I don't think the Court held that.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,269.772,275.209,"--In terms of politics, Your Honor, the critical distinction between this case and what Your Honor raises is this."
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.373,307.711,"You're saying if Georgia should deliberately draw a district in order to prevent blacks from electing a representative, there would be nothing we could do about that?"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,307.711,311.79,"--Well, I think that's the Busbee v. Smith case this Court affirmed which we stand behind."
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.79,312.351,We cannot--
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,312.351,313.022,But no--
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,313.022,314.036,--you said we can't do anything about it.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,314.036,314.492,--The Court did something about that.
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,314.492,317.444,"Indeed we did, but you're now telling us we can't."
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,319.565,320.615,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,320.615,321.27,Why not?
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,321.27,326.721,"Those courts... first of all, those cases had the prerequisite that helps you get away from the political complexities of harm."
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,331.592,332.204,This is harm proven.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,339.949,341.212,"--No, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.026,353.46,I don't see how it's any more difficult to figure out whether the legislature drew its lines to put blacks in or to keep blacks out.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,362.393,369.764,"--I would respectfully... there's no question again, Justice Scalia, that there is an element of... and the purpose, there was a purpose, a goal to draw a majority minority district here."
1994.94-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,456.259,469.615,"Suppose you're the Attorney General of the United States, do you have a constitutional obligation to refrain from telling the State, do everything you can to create majority minority districts to the maximum amount possible?"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,469.615,474.657,"--We don't think what Your Honor just stated is part of section 5 or section 2, so I guess--"
1994.94-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,474.657,487.12,I'm asking whether or not it's consistent with the Constitution of the United States and the Equal Protection Clause for the Attorney General of che United States to direct a State to proceed as I've indicated.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,487.12,490.151,"--I think that would not be appropriate, certainly under--"
1994.94-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,490.151,490.541,Why?
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,490.541,490.9,--the statutory framework.
1994.94-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,490.9,491.431,Why?
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,491.789,492.787,The statutes don't require that.
1994.94-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,492.787,493.333,--Pardon me?
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,493.333,494.893,Neither section 2 nor section 5 require it.
1994.94-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,494.893,500.738,"Suppose the statute did permit the Attorney General to do that, would there be a constitutional violation?"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,500.738,505.859,I think it would very much depend on the particular facts of the particular case.
1994.94-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,506.549,509.517,The facts of the case are maximization for maximization's sake.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,509.517,514.09,"--If it was nothing but maximization, without regard to any other considerations, that would be unconstitutional."
1994.94-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,514.09,514.667,Why?
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,514.667,517.025,Because that at some point would get... it would violate Shaw.
1994.94-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,519.105,521.947,And what is the principle of Shaw that would be violated?
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,521.947,538.189,"--What see in Shaw, I suggest, and we don't see it, we don't read it, and we hope it doesn't mean that you cannot have the goal of a majority minority district for the purpose, given the facts of Georgia, and those facts in a nutshell are the reality of having black people elected to office."
1994.94-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,545.735,549.841,But you acknowledge that at some point it's a violation of the Constitution--
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,549.841,550.84,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,550.84,552.373,--to direct racial districting.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,552.373,555.683,Where it is done without regard to anything else whatsoever is what I was going to say.
1994.94-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,568.82,575.192,"But I assume in answering my question that there's a constitutional violation, that the Constitution means something."
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,577.504,578.19,"--Yes, sir."
1994.94-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,578.19,584.001,But you're telling us that it's beyond judicial capacity to protect that significant interest.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,584.001,587.015,"We're saying this, Your Honor, and nothing more than this."
1994.94-631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,607.132,612.865,"Well, why is district shape any more objective as a criteria than discriminatory purpose?"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,615.844,624.045,"--Your Honor, we would certainly urge the Court to stay away from shape as a talisman where it's the eye of the beholder type of shape, does it look good, does it look bad."
1994.94-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,651.096,655.393,"Well, what if the lines in fact are conveniently drawn precisely as you say."
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,682.07,688.052,"That person's out of court, Your Honor, and I think as a matter of law when you're following the existing lines that have been drawn for other purposes, that is by--"
1994.94-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,688.052,694.719,So in effect you're telling us that the old jurisprudence of dilution is in fact to be thrown out.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,694.719,697.313,"--No, not in any way, shape, or form, Your Honor, and for this reason--"
1994.94-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,697.313,708.356,"Well, let's assume that my mythical plaintiff in my hypo comes in and says that was their predominant purpose, and in fact the result and the intent was racial packing."
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,718.958,719.945,"--I think not, Your Honor."
1994.94-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,737.766,745.718,Then are you saying that the... I thought in your brief you thought there was something to the notion that bizarreness would be the threshold.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,745.718,746.326,"Yes, sir."
1994.94-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,746.326,749.574,"You're really saying it's not bizarreness, it's harm?"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,749.574,751.555,For Shaw cases.
1994.94-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,751.555,752.167,I'm sorry?
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,752.167,754.651,"For Shaw cases, bizarreness is the threshold."
1994.94-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,756.679,759.989,"Well, Shaw cases and packing cases are all Fourteenth Amendment cases."
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,759.989,763.912,"They are, but the elements of them and what they constitute are different as we read that jurisprudence."
1994.94-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,770.237,780.622,"Well, what would the harm be in a so-called Shaw case that would not also constitute harm under the old line of packing... the old line of dilution cases?"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,780.622,784.108,"Well, there is no proof of harm in a Shaw case as I understand the Shaw theory."
1994.94-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,784.108,785.871,"No, but I'm just asking your position."
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,801.176,808.815,"Your Honor, I think I must have misspoken myself, because we're not saying that the proof of harm is essential to the Shaw case as that... as we're reading that case."
1994.94-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,819.812,820.374,All right.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,833.273,843.536,"Well, we would say that that is an objective standard where there is... the lines are first of all drawn for a purpose to create a majority minority district, but then in terms of the objective--"
1994.94-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,843.536,847.237,"Well, then what is grotesque is a question of purpose--"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,847.237,848.972,"--No, I think not, Your Honor."
1994.94-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,848.972,852.251,--and I thought a moment ago you were saying that purpose is a thicket we'd better not get into.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,852.251,882.005,"I think the thicket of how much purpose goes into each part of the line, whether it's a good reapportionment decision is a thicket that I... we urge the Court not to get into, and I think that the objective standards we're talking about, the objective standards as to the extent to which the district line in fact follows traditional boundaries, geographical markers and physical features and major highways, that is the kind of objective standard that makes a decision of a district court number 1 predictable so the legislature can know in advance what do we have to do and what can't we do?"
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,912.632,916.349,"Mr. Walbert, let's assume I think strict scrutiny is needed."
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,940.482,940.918,We would--
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,940.918,945.992,"I mean, you know, some people think that's the best way to reduce the influence of black groups."
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,945.992,948.648,"--We had that system of Government in Georgia for some time, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.992,966.406,"The State did a study to see how much the blacks' interests were taken into account by white politicians, even though the politicians elected might be white, did they not have to cater to the interests of the black one in their district?"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,966.406,969.077,"--With all due respect, no one had to commission a study."
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.636,980.152,"If we have to consider whether that's a compelling State interest or not, I don't know we can just sort of say, well--"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,980.152,981.213,--Justice Scalia--
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,981.213,981.962,--the political process made that judgment.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,985.572,989.694,--We have 236 Representative and Senate districts in our General Assembly.
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,996.674,998.066,That may mean nothing.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,998.066,999.645,"--Well, it may be compelling."
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,999.645,1003.845,The point is whether the political desires of black people are being taken into account.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,1019.244,1026.805,I would put a great more judgment and worth in the testimony of the black people who testified in this case than a study one might hire a university professor to do.
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1034.269,1037.315,"Oh, I'm sure the officials elected think it's a grand idea--"
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,1037.315,1038.127,--and their constituents.
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1038.563,1045.278,--but I'm talking about whether it's a grand idea for the racial minority that you assert to protect.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,1045.278,1065.458,"Justice Scalia, I think that if the Equal Protection Clause in this country were construed so that it was prohibited to have majority minority districts, which would empirically mean that the delegation in Georgia would revert to all white like it was in the old days, that would be a construction of the Equal Protection Clause that I think would stand the history and the purpose of that clause and the Civil War itself on its head."
1994.94-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1066.628,1069.973,Don't you think the answer to Justice Scalia's question was provided by the statement of judicial notice?
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,1069.973,1073.252,"--Well, Your Honor, I would... that's part of it."
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1102.129,1106.223,The Constitution has as an objective integrated delegations?
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,1106.223,1106.972,The Constitution--

1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,1140.864,1141.378,We-re saying--
1994.94-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1141.378,1144.08,--I thought you were saying that was a constitutional... desirable.
1994.94-631,0,21708,david_f_walbert,,1146.33,1150.296,"--We're saying to construe the Constitution in the opposite direction to prohibit what the State did, that's our problem."
1994.94-631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1154.121,1154.589,Yes.

1994.94-631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1234.291,1246.52,"But are you stipu... are you assuming that Irish descent, Polish descent is subject to strict scrutiny the same way that race is?"
1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1246.52,1269.605,"No, I'm not arguing that it is subject to strict scrutiny, but the point I'm making is that if the State were not to treat blacks who have a community of interest, and that can be established in the record, as it would treat other groups, then blacks are being denied the equal protection of the laws, because the only reason they're being denied the treatment that others receive is because of the color of their skins."
1994.94-631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1269.605,1275.322,"Well, that just repudiates, though, our equal protection jurisprudence."

1994.94-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1339.094,1339.703,It wasn't recognized on that basis.

1994.94-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1349.042,1350.119,That is racial--
1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1350.119,1350.556,--just read you--
1994.94-631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.556,1352.368,--That is simply racial classification.

1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1395.63,1397.022,"Well, I don't concede that."
1994.94-631,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1399.003,1402.629,"Well, there was certainly an evidentiary basis for the judge to find that, wasn't there?"
1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1402.629,1407.001,--I think that what the Court did here was apply an incorrect legal standard.

1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1430.507,1441.644,I think what the court did was not look at the extent to which the district that was drawn was consistent with principles that Georgia had applied in a variety of other circumstances.
1994.94-631,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1441.644,1455.436,"All right, wasn't the evidence equally clear that Georgia was in fact not applying them here, that Georgia had no intention to apply them to create a third district, and the only reason the third district was created was that the Justice Department was demanding it and time was running out?"

1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1494.529,1494.919,--Yes.
1994.94-631,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1494.919,1497.886,"--that the State legislature put forward with two, not three districts."
1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1501.415,1501.914,Yes.
1994.94-631,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1501.914,1513.114,"What relevance, if any, does that have that Georgia tried for two and only when it was turned down by the Department of Justice did it come up with three?"
1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1513.114,1531.73,"The relevance is that if one looks at the letters from the Department of Justice, what those letters reflect was that Georgia was doing not only with respect to the Congress, congressional delegations, but with respect to the State Senate and the State lower body things that it was not doing with respect to other groups."
1994.94-631,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1543.257,1557.424,"Well, the findings of the court below indicated that the Department of Justice was insisting upon maximization of any possible black voting strength."

1994.94-631,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1584.147,1584.568,--strength?
1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1587.474,1588.176,Well--
1994.94-631,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1588.176,1597.188,--even to the extent that confidential informants were used by the Department of Justice and within the State legislative process.
1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1599.972,1600.97,"--Well, I--"
1994.94-631,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1600.97,1608.465,"And if, in fact, that is what the Department was requiring, can that serve as a justification?"
1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1608.465,1615.682,"--What the... I don't accept the characterization of the Court, but I won't dignify it by going into the details."

1994.94-631,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1644.325,1649.137,That you draw as many majority black districts as you possibly can within the population.
1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1649.137,1649.979,--Absolutely not.
1994.94-631,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1653.103,1655.914,"Would that... if that were the policy, would it raise constitutional concerns?"
1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1655.914,1656.479,"Yes, it would."
1994.94-631,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1656.479,1657.009,Why?
1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1657.009,1669.598,"Well, because the mandate of the Voting Rights Act is to remedy discrimination and to prevent actions that would harm groups that are protected under the act."
1994.94-631,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1681.031,1712.347,"What if the legislature is found by the court to have been so driven by racial considerations that it ignores compactness and contiguity in a way that it would not and has not for any other group, and that it was driven to do it for the purpose of maximizing a particular race in the district."
1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1712.347,1729.323,"If maximization means that the Justice Department was requiring something that was not reflective of the fact that there was reason to believe that there was discriminatory purpose or effect, then that would create constitutional problems, but that is not what happened here."
1994.94-631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1738.271,1738.712,Yes.
1994.94-631,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1738.712,1750.329,"That the Justice Department was looking at what Georgia had done, looking at the fact that there had been prior findings of unconstitutional purpose, and simply saying, you've got to do more, given these facts."
1994.94-631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1751.221,1753.015,"Thank you, General Days."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,1755.016,1762.983,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.94-631,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1872.562,1876.357,"Mr. Parks, let me change the facts just a little."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,1918.779,1929.991,"I think the Court in the first Hays opinion dealt with Your Honor's hypothetical, and the Court made, I think, the appropriate distinction between motive and intent."
1994.94-631,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1942.738,1943.565,That's not my question.
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,1980.579,1990.39,"--I think because it employs racial classifications, whether... now, the State would come in and say... at least you would move to direct scrutiny because it employed the racial classification."
1994.94-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1996.606,1998.134,So then in your... sorry.
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,1998.134,2015.738,"--That... the direct answer is, that's not going to avoid the traditional strict scrutiny analysis, and if you get into that, I think that the political issue is not going to rise to the level of a compelling State interest that would allow that type of districting to succeed."
1994.94-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2015.738,2038.117,"So then, in your view, if people in the legislature take race, or religion, or nationality into account and put lots of members of one group into a district for a host of political reasons, then the court system, the 700 Federal judges, or whatever, will start to reexamine that."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2039.852,2040.616,"No, Justice Breyer."
1994.94-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2050.286,2050.958,And--
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2050.958,2057.657,"If we begin to broaden the spectrum of consideration, then I think that it becomes a more difficult question."
1994.94-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2057.657,2069.261,"--They do the same thing, but a lot of Democrats are also of Group X that isn't black, and they put them in, or in California they put in another group, and in Illinois... you understand the problem."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2069.261,2069.792,Right.
1994.94-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2069.792,2077.525,"The problem is the same problem throughout, that is there... how do you define... throughout... if I put the problem in my mind, it's this way."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2163.146,2173.437,"In looking at that question, I went back to the oral argument that was presented to this Court in Shaw v. Reno to see if the Court engaged in any discussion of that."
1994.94-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2209.172,2209.675,Then--
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2209.675,2211.064,--of racially gerry--
1994.94-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2211.064,2211.704,"--then, fine."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2234.975,2235.646,--Right.
1994.94-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.646,2241.737,"All right, and then you look for tailoring under the five traditional criteria of whether... that this Court has put out."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2254.485,2264.572,"Your Honor, the... there's one additional fact I don't know if Your Honor has included, but when we talk about visual, there are two maps you have to look at."
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2278.287,2289.253,"No, but all you're saying... all you're saying, I think, is that the so-called visual test, the bizarreness test, will not, in fact, smoke out everything that is wrong."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2289.253,2289.861,That's correct.
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2289.861,2294.529,And I think General Days was very clear in answering me that that is not his position.
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2329.156,2348.197,"Well, but then maybe, but if we have just this specific claim, voters contending that there has been intentional racial classifications that has resulted in a gerrymandered district, but we're not allowed to look past the visual to juxtapose the race map to see that these lines are drawn--"
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2348.197,2372.249,"No, you are allowed to look beyond it, but if you want to look beyond it for purposes other than bringing what I will call a bizarreness Shaw claim, you've got to allege those kinds of harms, for example, i.e., those are your thresholds that are identified with dilution, and there may be other reasons, too, but that would be one reason, and that, it seems to me, would be one answer that you could give to Justice Breyer."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2372.249,2376.543,"--And I would agree with that, but I don't think it is the end-all."
1994.94-631,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2400.455,2419.028,"Well, would you say that if the legislature is so driven by race that it ignores compactness and contiguity in a way that it would not and has not for any other group, that that would state an equal protection claim?"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2419.028,2422.245,"Yes, Your Honor, and I think that is the essence of Shaw v. Reno."
1994.94-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2429.724,2444.219,"So if there has been a political gerrymander, as occurred in the case we heard just before this one, then you could do a racial district that more or less matches that political gerrymander, right?"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2444.219,2446.5,"No, Your Honor, I don't think so."
1994.94-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.5,2450.544,"I thought that's what you just said, so long as you conform to past practice."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2450.544,2457.918,"Well, I would assume that if there has been a gerrymander it is not a past practice, it is an aberration from past practices."
1994.94-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.918,2458.371,No.
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2462.601,2463.385,"Well, they haven't in Georgia."
1994.94-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2466.789,2470.645,"No, but I mean, you're lucky, or you're unlucky, depending on whether you want to use racial districting or not."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2480.204,2488.169,"--No, it doesn't, Your Honor, because it then allows racial... it allows racial gerrymanders to escape the strict scrutiny that this Court wants to apply, and I think--"
1994.94-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2488.169,2492.838,"You ought to reconsider your position about whether, you know, the criterion is whether you've done it like this before."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2492.838,2496.383,"--Well, I didn't view that as the end-all of the case."
1994.94-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2500.77,2502.021,You don't need evidence if there's an admission.
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2503.363,2503.909,Exactly.
1994.94-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2504.849,2505.785,--we've done it for this purpose?
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2505.785,2507.079,And we have that in this case.
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2507.079,2526.884,"No, but where does your answer leave you in response to the question, is everything, in fact, going to qualify for attack, because the Shaw bizarreness criterion says look, there is a point at which the consideration of race may indeed become just outrageous."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2526.884,2527.602,Right.
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2527.602,2531.272,We accept the fact that some considerations of race are necessary.
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2578.866,2595.715,"The answer that the district court had to that problem, Your Honor, was elevating the standard, and I think it made an intentional elevation from the Arlington Heights standard to a higher standard in recognition that reapportionment is a legislative act where race is frequently taken into consideration."
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2620.52,2638.371,"Is there any way to comment on... and maybe there isn't, but is there any way to comment on the likelihood that the predominance standard is in fact going to raise a series of claims subject to strict scrutiny in greater numbers than the bizarreness threshold would do?"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2640.621,2646.272,In terms of the potential litigation that either test might generate?
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2646.272,2647.071,Yes.
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2647.071,2651.599,I think that if you're talking about bizarreness in the eye of the beholder--
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2651.599,2653.475,"Well, they're saying bizarreness in the--"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2653.475,2654.083,--that could be any--
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2654.083,2656.177,--Bizarreness in the eye of history is what they're saying.
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2656.177,2658.629,--But that ultimately becomes in the eye of the beholder.
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2670.219,2674.232,"Yes, but you've got to find an animal in the past, too, and that makes it a little harder."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2674.919,2675.309,Right.
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2690.754,2692.396,"No, but that--"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2692.396,2693.488,--that that evidence is so overwhelming--
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2693.488,2696.986,"--That may be, but that... I don't want to interrupt you unduly--"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2696.986,2697.594,--Yes.
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2697.594,2698.956,--but that gets it to a pretty fact-specific point.
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2706.45,2708.295,I'm not--
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2708.295,2711.512,Are we going to get a lot more cases on predominant purpose than there would--
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2711.512,2712.199,--I think not.
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2712.199,2713.387,--be on bizarre district?
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2714.059,2714.839,Because I--
1994.94-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2714.839,2716.386,"If not, why not stick with bizarre district?"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2716.386,2721.381,--First of all... let's back up.
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.492,2761.413,"They didn't know how to manufacture legislative history, is what you're saying."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2763.067,2765.301,"--Your Honor, that is not far off the point."
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2765.301,2765.8,"--Yes, I understand."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2769.489,2770.285,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2770.285,2790.98,"--that grows out of Justice Scalia's suggestion that perhaps community of interest among persons in a group might justify an odd-shaped district, and the district court, as the Solicitor General pointed out, said that the problem with doing that is that such a community of interest is barred from constitutional recognition if it's defined by racial group."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2792.868,2800.272,"I think that if you're talking about, in Your Honor's question, a bizarre shape, yes, I do, because the only thing that I can--"
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2800.272,2813.031,"Well, let's assume we don't have a bizarre shape, if you just have evidence of predominant motive, and then the response is, yes, we had the predominant motive, but we were trying to justify... we tried to justify it on the grounds of a community of interest."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2813.031,2813.799,--Right.
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2813.799,2817.89,"And my question is, is that barred from constitutional recognition, in your view?"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2822.765,2829.933,"If you all continue to believe that UJO is the law, then that is not barred from constitutional permissibility."
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2831.964,2834.167,Do you think it should be barred from constitutional recognition?
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2834.167,2838.787,--I think it depends upon the extent to which there is a community.
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2838.787,2843.973,"I assume you... if it's barred from constitutional recognition, it could be a perfect community."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2851.812,2853.406,"Yes, that's right, Your Honor, and the only reason--"
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2853.406,2854.768,And do you think that's a correct statement of the law?
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2854.768,2869.824,"--The only reason that I hesitate is that the community of interest that was sought to be put forward in our case was pure race, and as I understand in Your Honor's hypothetical you're going beyond that, and if you go beyond that, and it's not race-based--"
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2869.824,2883.628,"And you say as in Justice Thomas' hypo for example, they're all members of the... 90 percent members of the Democratic Party, they're... 90 percent go to the same church, 90 percent share certain athletic interests, or other community interests, would that be permissible justification?"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2884.911,2890.534,"--Yes, because... I think it would, because race has fallen out of the mix in terms of predominant characteristic here."
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2893.345,2900.529,"I envision rather long, factual trials on these cases, on both sides, both on the motive issue and on the justification issue."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2900.529,2909.681,"Well, Your Honor, this is a case that we got done in about a week, and the State never really--"
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.681,2911.478,"But as you say, you didn't have Shaw v. Reno."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2913.896,2926.862,"--Well, I don't know if it will even need to be done then, because what we'd be facing then is a legislature that made a reasoned judgment and made sure that it did not violate those tenets."
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.155,2941.778,"Well, what if you had a legislative finding that all the people in the district shared a community of interest, a legislative finding tracking the language that they tried to put in, the evidence they tried to put in in this case."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2941.778,2942.511,--Right.
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2942.511,2944.356,"Would that be the end of the case, then?"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,2944.356,2988.432,"No, obviously not, but again, I would assume, hearkening back to Justice Scalia's question earlier on, there would be a study or some basis for that, and that we would then, as plaintiffs, evaluate that and determine whether this is pretext or whether... I mean, race cases in employment law, in contracting law, in admissions to colleges, we all... they all deal with these issues, and we don't say that we're going to ignore quotas at a university, or we're going to ignore quotas on public contracting because the give-and-take of a political fight might make uncovering the racial animus that drives those programs difficult."
1994.94-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2996.711,3013.216,"Can I ask you a question about an earlier question that Justice Thomas asked about adopting an odd-shaped district in order to maximize the number of Democratic voters, or Republican voters, whatever."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3043.063,3043.847,You say by precincts?
1994.94-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3043.847,3053.701,"By precincts, about which precincts voted Republican, which voted Democratic, and when you ended up, you had an odd-shaped district that was 60 percent black."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3053.701,3054.278,Right.
1994.94-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3054.278,3055.151,Would that be a violation?
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3055.151,3056.388,No.
1994.94-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3063.993,3080.221,"Which is probably the way parties do political gerrymandering, isn't it, by looking at the returns and including within the gerrymandered district those precincts that have returns going for one party, the other whatever, whether it's blacks or whites that were responsible for the returns."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3080.221,3082.284,"--Your Honor, we are very naive in about political--"
1994.94-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3082.284,3083.08,Oh--
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3083.08,3083.688,--gerrymandering in Georgia.
1994.94-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3083.688,3084.328,--I'm sure.
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3086.999,3091.031,"But I would assume that would be a good way to do it, and the further reason I say that is this."
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3125.748,3128.108,You don't think precinct captains used to do this?
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3129.013,3129.465,--Huh?
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3129.465,3130.919,You don't think precinct captains ever did this?
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3130.919,3136.729,I don't... I can't conceive that they could do it with the surgeon-like precision we can do it now.
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3136.729,3137.915,They did it in Chicago.
1994.94-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3138.807,3141.744,Justice Stevens is from Chicago in the good old days.
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3144.306,3146.271,I stand corrected.
1994.94-631,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3222.351,3223.162,Mr. Parks--
1994.94-631,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3223.162,3224.585,"--But they're here defending it today, aren't they?"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3224.585,3234.034,"They're here defending it today, but I submit to you that the record is overwhelmingly clear that that is out of expedience rather than any compelling State justification."
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3234.034,3240.422,"I thought your footnote described the complaint in another case, that they were describing, the complaint in Jones... is this Jones v. Miller?"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3240.422,3247.78,"Yes, but the State... in that case, they sought through section 2 to have these three minority districts drawn."
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.323,3258.086,And they're describing the complaint in that case.
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3258.086,3264.708,"Yes, but that plan is seeking to have the Department of Justice mandate made the law through section 2."
1994.94-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3296.196,3297.225,Why isn't it a compelling... isn't it--
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3297.225,3298.056,--that opinion very differently.
1994.94-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3298.056,3312.705,"--Couldn't it be a compelling interest that in a particular place for many, many years... many, many, many, many yeas the State was set up in such a way to prevent African Americans from having the same kind of vote, or even having a vote, as other persons had?"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3321.775,3327.59,"Yes, that would become... but then we would go into traditional equal protection analysis."
1994.94-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3335.381,3336.146,"So then, would we then use--"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3336.146,3338.006,It can't just automatically be proportionality.
1994.94-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3338.006,3357.982,"--But then would we then use, if we got past the threshold and then we found such a compelling interest, then would you not use what the Abrams briefs or some of the briefs have, the five, the traditional tests that this Court's developed in order to show narrow tailoring that... limited in duration... you know the five."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3357.982,3358.575,"Yes, sir."
1994.94-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3358.575,3359.402,"Limited in duration, it's roughly--"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3359.402,3360.248,Right.
1994.94-631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3360.248,3360.732,--equivalent to the--
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3360.732,3361.075,Right.
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3400.87,3412.428,"--Well, you would agree, would you not, that if the city, say, was composed of one-third Polish Americans, one-third Swedish Americans, and one-third Irish Americans, they could set out to divide up the city council in thirds for representation of each."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3414.334,3416.409,If that is the only--
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3416.409,3417.74,"That's the only reason, yes."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3417.74,3419.799,"--I would hope not, Justice Stevens."
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3419.799,3422.095,"You'd hope they wouldn't do it, but would it be--"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3422.095,3423.093,"No, I hope that would not be constitutional."
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3426.11,3429.063,--Other than a presumption that may or may not be valid--
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3429.063,3429.671,Right.
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3429.671,3432.295,"--that Swedish Americans tend to share certain interests, they have Swedish clubs and--"
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3432.295,3435.092,And that's why strict scrutiny helps us with this.
1994.94-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3435.544,3438.73,--But you'd say strict scrutiny would be required even though there was no racial basis in that one?
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3438.73,3442.259,--Shaw says racial or ethnic enclaves.
1994.94-631,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3480.15,3481.242,"Thank you, Mr. Parks."
1994.94-631,2,16713,a_lee_parks,,3481.242,3481.757,--Thank you.
1994.94-631,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3481.757,3482.709,The case is submitted.
