1974.74-5140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,21.746,"We'll hear arguments next in Cassius against Arizona, 74-5140."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,21.746,24.321,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-5140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,24.321,26.807,Mr. Klein.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,26.807,29.068,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,165.938,167.511,Do you know why?
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,167.511,168.579,Why it was dismissed?
1974.74-5140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,179.295,195.551,Do you know whether the state had-- would it be fair to say that the state concluded it was satisfied with one guilty plea that would have a substantial sentence even though the man had apparently committed two criminal acts?
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,195.551,197.303,"Well, if I--"
1974.74-5140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,197.303,199.077,"Apparently, with emphasis."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,199.077,214.287,"I realize that the fact that it was disposed of in this way, of course, denies us the opportunity to look at the substance of the first charge, but it was dismissed as part of the a plea bargain, and the--"
1974.74-5140,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,214.287,217.377,"Mr. Klein, is-- there are three crimes, aren't there?"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,217.377,219.241,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,272.626,277.931,"Mr. Klein, just to go back so-- I'm not sure it's quite clear in my mind."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,281.484,281.952,That's correct.
1974.74-5140,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,281.952,287.668,Under which the first burglary charge was dismissed.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,289.786,290.643,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,290.643,295.186,"And what did the bargain have to say, if anything, about the 1580 charge?"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,295.186,314.04,"The-- well, the bargain provided that the defendant was not going to plead guilty to the 1580 charge, and the Trial Court was advised that the reason for this was that the defendant wished to reserve his right to challenge that statute on appeal."
1974.74-5140,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,314.04,318.98,"So there was no-- so, what was done was exactly in accord with the bargain?"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,318.98,321.59,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,321.59,322.439,Thank you.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,322.439,323.566,You're welcome.
1974.74-5140,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,323.566,330.406,"Mr. Klein, do you know is this statute frequently used by the prosecution in Arizona?"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,330.406,333.824,"In the experience of our office, it is frequently used."
1974.74-5140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,368.966,384.291,"What would be your position on this issue if he had entered a guilty plea to the first charge, been sentenced, then a guilty plea to the subsequent charges?"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,414.703,421.355,"Well, let me turn that question around if I may, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.74-5140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,470.037,474.933,"What elements does the state have to prove, Mr. Klein, in 1580?"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,474.933,477.051,"That's a good question, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,528.649,533.758,"Well, what was the proof at the trial of this 1580 charge?"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,533.758,560.011,"The proof was that the Court was asked to take judicial notice of the fact that burglary was a felony and that the defendant had entered a plea of guilty to burglary, and it was stipulated that the defendant had been charged previously and had been released on that charge and had remained released during the period of time in which the second burglary charge was alleged to have occurred."
1974.74-5140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,572.748,587.99,Do you regard your client as having been free and at large by virtue of a constitutional right or by virtue of a statutory provision?
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,587.99,605.529,"We regard him having been at large by virtue of a state constitutional right which also receives federal constitutional protection, although I submit that it's unclear what the parameters of that protection are."
1974.74-5140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,619.875,631.29,"Of course, we'd all agree that the federal constitution doesn't guarantee the right to be released on bail, but merely that they may not be regard to furnish excessive bail."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,632.803,639.31,"Well, that's certainly what the Eighth Amendment protection provides, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,660.132,663.123,"Mr. Klein, we keep peppering you with questions."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,663.123,664.002,"Be my guest, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,664.002,667.378,I think I understand your double jeopardy approach.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,701.109,721.846,"If I understand your question, it is if the statute had been drafted as a punishment enhancement statute rather than as a separate crime, would this violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, and my answer would be no, although there might still be some problems under our equal protection argument."
1974.74-5140,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,721.846,728.301,"And yet, the same result would be accomplished, as the state claim is accomplished here."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,728.301,729.428,"Not exactly, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,775.344,791.255,"But the state legislative could-- legislatively could attach all those consequences to a single crime of committing burglary while on bail just like it attaches a higher penalty, perhaps, and then--"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,791.255,794.205,"Yes, but there are additional consequences, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,812.908,829.343,"Well, I know that that argument is a-- that argument would go to cases where the-- where anyone act is broken up into several crimes, and they're all prosecuted at once."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,829.343,856.435,"But, the difference is that this-- our argument is that this is the same offense, and what I'm saying is that the-- that a punishment enhancement statute, while it would serve the same objectives that the state claims to have, would not have precisely the same consequences on the defendant, and punishment enhancement statute would not--"
1974.74-5140,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,856.435,858.264,That it would tell the double jeopardy argument.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,858.264,859.439,"Yes, it would, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,859.439,864.241,"But, you think you still have an arguable opinion?"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,864.241,877.553,"Well, I think that a punishment enhancement statute could be drafted so as not to come within the equal protection arguments that we raise."
1974.74-5140,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,899.961,907.906,"Mr. Klein, do you think Blockburger is consistent with your double jeopardy argument?"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,907.906,909.703,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1974.74-5140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,927.107,933.144,Was Blockburger's said to rest by the Court on double jeopardy?
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,933.144,935.914,"My recollection is that it was, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,935.914,944.094,You think that the-- Justice Sutherland relied on the Double Jeopardy Clause in Blockburger?
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,946.508,948.329,"Well, then I stand corrected, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,957.941,963.996,Let me ask you one more question about what I guess are basically the facts.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,981.998,985.687,"Well, the defendant pleaded guilty to the second burglary."
1974.74-5140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,985.687,987.225,He pleaded guilty to the second burglary.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,987.225,988.634,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,988.634,996.681,"So, then the-- were there any contested issues of fact tried before the trial judge?"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,996.681,1013.852,"No, and one of the-- one of our objections to the way 1580 is drafted is that it only really requires a determination rather-- whether a defendant falls within a particular class to find by the statute."
1974.74-5140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1013.852,1030.554,"So, the only factual element of the crime is that at least the second burglary or the commission of the crime while on bail that your client plead guilty to."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1030.554,1032.813,Commit-- pleaded guilty to the second burglary.
1974.74-5140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1033.814,1037.315,And it was conceded that he did it while on bail?
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1037.315,1038.06,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1038.06,1043.303,"So, there really weren't any factual issues and dispute in the 1580 proceeding?"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1043.303,1045.263,"I would say that's correct, sir."
1974.74-5140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1045.263,1049.915,But you reserved this issue in-- on your guilty plea?
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1049.915,1050.56,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1050.56,1051.284,I think you said that.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1051.284,1063.584,"Yes, because the-- and it was obvious in the context that the defendant's counsel believed that the statute itself was subject to challenge."
1974.74-5140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1063.584,1093.246,"Some state Supreme Courts and perhaps some Courts of Appeal have held that there is no constitutional problem about defining a certain crimes as more serious and in subject to greater punishment when they're committed, for example, within a prison, an assault on a prison guard, an assault on a fellow prisoner, a killing of a prison guard."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1119.453,1124.271,I'm not sure I quite understand the question.
1974.74-5140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1124.271,1138.134,You concede that a greater punishment could be imposed constitutionally for committing a crime while on bail without regard to whether or not there's even a crime--
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1138.134,1142.433,You're speaking in terms of our double jeopardy argument.
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1153.978,1155.576,Find in your two trials.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1157.288,1170.849,"Well, it's my understanding, Your Honor, that the protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause, which derives from the common law plea of former conviction, does not require two trials."
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1190.577,1194.133,When was the trial?
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1194.133,1210.149,"Well, I think that depends upon whether you interpret the statute as indicating separate elements or whether you consider the Bill of Attainder."
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1210.149,1220.707,You mentioned a minute ago all of the difficulties in this as compared to an enhanced sentence.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1225.125,1233.456,"Well, in terms of the fact that the prosecutor has discretion whether or not to charge 1580 and when to charge it."
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1235.455,1238.287,Command the results after it's done.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1238.287,1246.571,"Well, the Double Jeopardy Clause is designed to protect certain interests."
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1247.519,1249.819,I'm not talking about the double jeopardy now.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1272.025,1279.05,"Well, you have two convictions and the fact that you have two convictions gives rise to a number of collateral consequences."
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1279.05,1281.356,Which the legislature could've stopped.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1281.356,1282.296,"But, in addition to those--"
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1282.296,1293.446,"Didn't the legislature say if you commit a felony while out on bail, you shall not be eligible for parole ever?"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1293.446,1305.15,"That's an issue I would rather not address myself to because we have some cases like that at the present time, but--"
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1305.15,1309.959,But maybe your sentencing is within the power of the state legislature.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1309.959,1312.492,"Within a certain limit, surely."
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1312.492,1314.686,"There's only one limit, cruel and inhuman."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1315.986,1321.594,"Well, there are limitations placed upon it by the Due Process Clause certainly."
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1321.594,1324.71,Is it meant for this sentence?
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1324.71,1326.913,On the matter of imposition of sentence.
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1326.913,1343.723,"Yes, we all thought wide beyond the matter, but if-- I have a bit of difficulty with-- they could enhance it."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1345.574,1347.312,Under the Double Jeopardy Clause.
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1347.312,1360.405,"There's no problem about that, and that the only problem here is that instead of that, you get another “trail” on the same offense and that's it."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1360.405,1381.969,"Yes, but in that, Your Honor, for example, if the prosecutor were dissatisfied with the sentence that Mr. Cassius received on his burglary plea and supposing that he had not, at that time, chosen to prosecute under 1580, he could then prosecute under 1580 in order to bring the punishment more in the line of his view."
1974.74-5140,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1412.466,1421.463,"Mr. Klein, I suppose the only additional element under your statutory crime is being out on bail or an RPR."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1425.197,1428.578,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1438.105,1453.54,"Well, there may be no sense in it, but I guess what I'm asking is whether the difference between burglary and the offense under the special statute is only an element which in itself isn't criminal."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1453.54,1466.138,"That would be my interpretation of it, Your Honor, that it is an element, if you can call it that, which is not what we have traditionally regarded as an element of criminal responsibility."
1974.74-5140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1466.138,1472.235,"And yet, the legislature here has made it an element of criminal responsibility."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1472.235,1480.388,"Well, at least that is, as I read it, the Arizona Supreme Court's interpretation of that statute."
1974.74-5140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1480.388,1486.082,You are subject to kind of addition constraints while on bail.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1496.626,1503.965,"I would agree that you're under additional constraints, but I would not agree that the duty to obey the law is an additional constraint."
1974.74-5140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1509.497,1525.287,"Except your bail can be revoked if you don't obey the law when you're on bail, and an ordinary citizen, if he doesn't obey the law, has to go through a full criminal proceeding because his liberty could be restrained."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1525.287,1557.834,"Well, in the sense that the conditions of his bail can be established in the same way, I'm not sure that I would quite agree, but the reason that a condition of good behavior is put into bail agreements is precisely so that the Court, if it has reason to believe that an individual has not been behaving himself while released, so that it can re-examine the conditions of his release."
1974.74-5140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1557.834,1564.676,"And, to that extent, he's in a different spot than the person who has never been arraigned in the first place."
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1564.676,1569.136,"In a different position, but not with regard to his duty to obey the law."
1974.74-5140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.292,1576.025,Different consequences attached to a breach.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1576.025,1581.875,"Well, a person who commits a crime is subject to the loss of his liberty."
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1583.946,1593.906,"Well, Mr. Klein, in the case like this, does the man have bail-- I mean, is bail revoked to him?"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1593.906,1597.964,"Section 1580 does not provide for that, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1603.177,1612.058,"Is there-- it's not in this case, but do they have a statute on a parolee committing a crime?"
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1612.058,1615.389,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1615.389,1618.858,Just curious.
1974.74-5140,0,24195,frederick_s_klein,,1618.858,1620.7,"If I may, I think I'd like to reserve whatever time I have remaining."
1974.74-5140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1620.7,1621.343,You may.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,1628.411,1631.561,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1695.087,1713.94,It is used in Pima County regularly the way it was here to make two separate offenses and in this case with consecutive sentences or is it just used to make one conviction on an aggravated offense?
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,1713.94,1721.13,"Your Honor, I believe, in Maricopa County, it is not used on any regular basis whatsoever."
1974.74-5140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1791.909,1803.031,"Arizona is a state, isn't it, Mr. Schafer, where the County Attorney of the individual county has the primary discretion to determine prosecution policy?"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,1803.031,1818.989,"Yes, it is, Your Honor, and I have to smile at that because we just argued that issue before the Arizona Supreme Court last week and, unfortunately, the Arizona Supreme Court refused to take that issue but, by refusing to do it, they indicated “yes.”"
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1825.004,1826.387,How many counties?
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,1826.387,1827.963,"Fourteen, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1827.963,1831.43,At least you don't have 80 or 90 different prosecution policies.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,1832.977,1844.164,"No, we do not and, if you go beyond Maricopa and Pima, the occasions for using such a statute probably arise very seldom."
1974.74-5140,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1897.995,1902.049,"Not even anything else, not even the word “constitution” appears, does it?"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,1902.049,1910.595,"I can't say that, Your Honor, but I do remember I think the second or third time reading it that I suddenly found the Fifth Amendment was not in that case."
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1994.952,2014.651,"I suppose you'd agree, perhaps your friend might even agree, that if there'd been a guilty plea to both burglaries but with an agreement that contemplated the aggregate punishment the same as was actually entered here, that that would be eliminated to deal with his argument."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2014.651,2016.616,"The double jeopardy argument, Your Honor?"
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2019.763,2026.844,And the presumption of innocence argument which he separated from his double jeopardy.
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2026.844,2029.246,"Well, it still has the conviction though under 1580."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2030.457,2038.122,"I was going to say if you mean, Your Honor, by the first or the two burglary convictions, I separate the first burglary conviction."
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2066.945,2070.637,"Sorry, it wasn't in the first but I think the first burglary charge was dismissed."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2072.67,2077.355,"No, Your Honor, I'm prefacing my remarks to show I thought the question involved a guilty plea to that first burglary."
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2077.355,2080.4,I thought you referred to the first burglary conviction.
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2082.489,2083.362,There's the first burglary.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2083.362,2083.934,"No, that's right."
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2089.549,2090.233,The charge.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2090.233,2090.389,Charge.
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2090.389,2091.076,That was dismissed afterwards.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2091.076,2091.416,Yes.
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2091.416,2092.366,In the plea bargain.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2092.366,2092.779,Right.
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2092.779,2093.234,Yes.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2093.234,2095.344,"And that, eventually, was eliminated entirely."
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2095.344,2099.25,Yes.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2099.25,2102.241,"As I say, we contend the--"
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2102.241,2111.88,But the-- there was a second burglary conviction and that he was convicted of burglary while on bail on a felony charge.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2111.88,2113.153,"Yes, that is true, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2113.153,2115.156,There were two burglary convictions.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2119.351,2120.13,"No, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2120.13,2121.126,Isn't that right?
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2121.126,2122.516,No.
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2129.493,2130.094,Right.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2130.094,2141.479,"Approximately a month-and-a half after that occurred, he was then caught in a building and he was charged with another burglary."
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2141.479,2142.211,Right.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2142.211,2148.181,"And, at the same time, he was charged with what I'll call 1580."
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2148.181,2153.71,And that was for committing a burglary while he was on bail on a felony charge.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2153.71,2157.78,"Yes, committing the burglary upon which he was found caught in the building."
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2157.78,2159.081,Right.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2159.081,2160.997,"Now, when we get to the plea bargain and to the--"
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2160.997,2164.13,Could he also be charged with the first burglary?He had been.
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2164.13,2165.865,Could it have been three?
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2165.865,2167.547,He had been charged with the first--
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2167.547,2170.178,But could he have been convicted?
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2170.178,2170.89,"He could have been, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2170.89,2172.772,He could have had three convictions.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2172.772,2174.447,He could have.
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2174.447,2181.688,"But whether or not he was convicted on the first charge, from which he was released on his OR, has nothing to do with the issues in this case."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2181.688,2197.893,"That's why I was prefacing my remarks to Mr. Chief Justice that I separate that entirely, and I've attempted sedulously to avoid referring to that in the brief because I think it makes it confusing and I don't think it has anything really to do with the issues here."
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2341.288,2345.309,"Then, I take it, you are arguing that these are separate and distinct crimes."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2345.309,2345.875,"Yes, we are."
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2345.875,2350.511,That this is not an enhancement of punishment statute.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2350.511,2369.092,"Yes, we are, Your Honor, and I draw an analogy to enhancement of punishment statute in the brief, but I have to admit and concede that this creates a separate offense, whereas, the enhancement of punishment statute would not."
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2389.426,2392.411,"Well, is it separate or two?"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2392.411,2394.474,"Well, separate from the under--"
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2394.474,2403.348,"Well the second, at least looking at page 4, the criminal complaint, the first count, he committed a burglary."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2412.951,2414.542,"Excuse me, are you on page 4 of the petition--"
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2414.542,2416.077,Page 4 of the appendix.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2416.077,2417.276,The appendix.
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2417.276,2421.796,He was charged.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2429.693,2429.84,Yes.
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2429.84,2432.349,And it's the same burglary referred to in both.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2432.349,2434.484,It is.
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2434.484,2437.336,"So, he's convicted twice of the same burglary."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2437.336,2439.643,"Well, that's the petitioner's contention, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2440.62,2443.738,"No, as phrased, where the charge reads."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2443.738,2454.809,"Well, I was going to say our answer to that is that the phrasing of the charge really does not indicate the separateness of those two offenses."
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2454.809,2466.921,"In fact, it's quite a bad pleading, isn't it, because, if you look at the language of the statute on page 3 of the petitioner's brief, the offense doesn't occur until after the conviction on the first burglary?"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2466.921,2468.508,"Yes, that's correct."
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2468.508,2475.827,"So, they can't really be charged that way because it would-- I mean, if you think about accurate and not just the pleading."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2475.827,2476.16,Yes.
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2476.16,2483.11,There is no second offense under-- there is no offense under 1580 until there's a conviction of the felony.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2483.11,2484.562,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.278,2490.796,"That's what the statute says very clearly, on page 3 of the petitioner's brief."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2490.796,2491.016,And--
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2491.016,2502.681,"So, this indictment-- this complaint, rather, is-- couldn't be right because they couldn't charge him under count two until he'd been convicted under count one, if you take the statute's literal words to mean what they say."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2502.681,2504.784,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2504.784,2516.163,"Mr. Schafer, when the Supreme Court of Arizona vacated the Court of Appeals opinion did it indicate any doubt as to the construction that had been placed on the statutory language by the Court of Appeals?"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2516.163,2536.809,"No, it did not, Your Honor, and there is no indication in the Supreme Court opinion itself as to what it thought those elements would be. Reading the opinion, however, I assume we can-- or I could at least read it and get from it the same two elements that the Court of Appeals did, but now I'd have to say there is no indication."
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2536.809,2538.3,This is no separate crime.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2542.655,2547.128,"Well, I might say it is an additional crime, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2548.085,2550.773,"But, it's not enhancement."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2550.773,2552.171,"No, it is not enhancement."
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2552.171,2553.468,"Now, I'm in trouble."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2553.468,2554.191,Well--
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2554.191,2558.317,"It's additional crime, but it's not enhancement."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2558.317,2569.314,"When I use the word “enhancement,” as I think as it's been used here so far this afternoon, that really gets back to the ordinary enhancement statute and--"
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2569.314,2571.841,"Well, if it is enhancement, it is."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2582.889,2589.486,"I would assume that that has a great deal of validity to it, Your Honor, yes."
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2589.486,2592.113,"And, indeed, they have to be under the statute."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2592.113,2594.158,"Yes, it's required under the statute."
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2594.158,2596.522,That doesn't give you any difficulty.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2596.522,2598.063,"No, it doesn't give me any difficulty."
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2621.777,2640.081,"Well, I'm not-- I don't know what it means in this case but, it seems to me, I still don't understand why a man is so bad and vicious that you have to give him two sentences and he ends up with five years all together for burglary."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2642.609,2650.02,He could have received up to 15 on the burglary and up to 5 on the 1580 charge.
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2650.02,2657.12,"Why would the same judge who's going to give him a certain number of years, why does he have to split it up?"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2657.12,2657.523,Well--
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2657.523,2659.211,And then give him less.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2659.211,2664.159,The simple answer there would be that the statute simply requires it.
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2713.207,2718.253,"Well, he gave a very long portion of the allowable penalty, did he not?"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2718.253,2719.409,"Well, yes."
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2722.23,2725.851,"Well, the maximum penalty was what all together?"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2725.851,2726.61,Twenty.
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2726.61,2728.314,"Yes, and what did they impose?"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2728.314,2733.514,"One to two and one two three, and the one to three was consecutive."
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2733.514,2740.978,"Well, but he's got a two-year minimum as against a possible 20-year maximum."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2740.978,2748.257,"And, on the surface at least, it would seem that that-- yes, that that is slight, obviously, compared to what he could have done at the time."
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2752.293,2762.029,Do judges in Arizona ordinarily give some explanation about their sentencing process?
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2762.029,2763.424,I think I can answer that.
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2775.503,2789.568,The implication I drew from that when I saw that reference was that this is precisely a mitigating factor in his imposition of the sentence.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2789.568,2789.701,I also--
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2789.701,2801.674,"To comply with the statute which require the separate penalty for each one, I take it, he would have had the power to suspend one of the sentences, wouldn't he, under Arizona law?"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2801.674,2803.672,Yes.
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2817.691,2827.312,"Well, if it's easier for one of us up here to attribute thought process as to a State Court judge than it is for you when you have to continue working with him.[Laughter]"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2827.312,2829.67,I'm sure it is.
1974.74-5140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2913.279,2924.265,"But on your idea that these are different offenses, the state could try the burglary first and the burglary while out on bail later."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2924.265,2925.362,"Yes, that--"
1974.74-5140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2925.362,2929.148,And the same transaction test would say no.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2929.148,2936.694,"That generally is true, and that's one reason why I mentioned the same transaction test in--"
1974.74-5140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2936.694,2955.484,"But, there are some cases in the Court, including perhaps Blockburger or any of it or Gore, that would say that even if that's the same offenses, the fact that you're imposing two punishments does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2955.484,2958.699,I believe what Your Honor is alluding to are--
1974.74-5140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2958.699,2964.34,"Well, assume a single act violates three different statutes."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2964.34,2964.915,Yes.
1974.74-5140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2964.915,2966.221,And you impose punishments.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2973.248,2976.478,"Yes, that is just about Gore."
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2980.727,2982.699,You have a single-sale of narcotics.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2982.699,2983.011,Yes.
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2983.011,2985.527,"But that violates three, four, five statutes."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2985.527,2985.854,Yes.
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2985.854,2988.785,You have separate counts for the violation under each statute.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,2994.611,2994.997,Yes.
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2994.997,2996.109,That's with Gore.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3002.962,3003.056,Well--
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3003.056,3008.446,"They were disposed of in the same proceeding, therefore, no double jeopardy violation."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3008.446,3012.52,"Essentially, except I would add one more thing perhaps to that."
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3021.362,3023.457,With all these-- excuse me.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3023.457,3023.596,But--
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3023.596,3030.015,"With all respect, I don't understand this at all, if we're going to take the statute as it's read."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3035.95,3036.219,Correct.
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3036.219,3037.585,Isn't that correct?
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3037.585,3037.811,Correct.
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3037.811,3041.4,You can't try them all together.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3041.4,3041.499,"Well, you--"
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3041.499,3053.677,"If you take the words of-- if you look at page 3 of the petitioner's brief and see what that statute says, it says a person who is convicted of committing any felony offense while released on bail."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3060.039,3061.238,"I agree, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3063.073,3066.132,"Well, does that make sense?"
1974.74-5140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3066.132,3070.385,Couldn't the conviction occur at his trial for the offense?
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3070.385,3071.998,"That's essentially what happened here, I believe."
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3071.998,3074.344,It's a very odd way to--
1974.74-5140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3074.344,3075.041,"Well, couldn't you charge--"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3075.041,3075.428,Well--
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3075.428,3077.746,Couldn't it be disposed as it had gone to trial?
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3088.677,3089.186,That's a possibility.
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3089.186,3091.128,In a single trial?
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3091.128,3092.633,"Yes, that's a possibility."
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3106.291,3106.856,Yes.
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3106.856,3111.281,But that is the wording of the statute.
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3111.281,3122.614,"But they can't reach count 2 or the second question under 1580until they have crossed the bride on count 1, that is did he perform the act of the burglary."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3122.614,3124.913,Was he convicted of the burglary?
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3126.121,3131.269,If they found that he did the act which points to a conviction.
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3131.269,3134.865,"A component of the offense is a conviction, is it not?"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3134.865,3136.47,Yes.
1974.74-5140,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3136.47,3143.773,"But you draw no distinction between the result of a plea of guilty and any other type of conviction, do you?"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3143.773,3150.075,"No, I do not, Your Honor, and--"
1974.74-5140,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3150.075,3159.984,"Well, I thought Justice Stewart's inquiry of you was that you can't even indict for a 1580 until you have the first conviction."
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3162.774,3163.318,Your Honor.
1974.74-5140,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3163.318,3165.393,"They did in this case, didn't they?"
1974.74-5140,1,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3165.393,3175.272,"They did in this case and that has never been challenged yet, within my knowledge, either in the Arizona Supreme Court or in any other Court that I'm aware of."
1974.74-5140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3197.042,3198.068,"Very well, Mr. Schafer."
1974.74-5140,2,24195,frederick_s_klein,,3202.796,3204.026,"Very briefly, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3204.026,3205.387,You have three minutes.
1974.74-5140,2,24195,frederick_s_klein,,3205.387,3230.419,"The statement to which Mr. Schafer was referring in the Court of Appeals opinion or statements, I believe, appear on pages 34 and 35 of the appendix, and I think that it would be difficult to read this statement as in accord with the decision of Arizona Supreme Court."
1974.74-5140,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3247.091,3247.624,What page?
1974.74-5140,2,24195,frederick_s_klein,,3247.624,3250.554,"This is page 35 of the appendix, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3295.529,3312.125,"But, Mr. Klein, isn't the fact that under this very charge, had this first appellant gone to the jury, could the Court-- trial judge have instructed the jury “you must find him guilty first of the burglary before you address the second count."
1974.74-5140,2,24195,frederick_s_klein,,3317.006,3327.698,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, because if the jury had found the defendant guilty, it would still be within the Court's power to overturn that verdict and, therefore, it would not be a conviction."
1974.74-5140,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3327.698,3331.684,A jury verdict of guilty is not an element conviction.
1974.74-5140,2,24195,frederick_s_klein,,3331.684,3331.881,That would be--
1974.74-5140,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3331.881,3332.604,There's a lot that could happen between--
1974.74-5140,2,24195,frederick_s_klein,,3332.604,3333.486,That would be my feeling.
1974.74-5140,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3333.486,3335.389,That verdict and a judicial conviction.
1974.74-5140,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3335.389,3341.857,"And, yet, the Arizona Court of Appeals is clearly in accord with Justice Brennan's comment, isn't it?"
1974.74-5140,2,24195,frederick_s_klein,,3341.857,3343.622,"I don't believe they are, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3365.795,3366.656,"Very well, Mr. Klein."
1974.74-5140,2,24195,frederick_s_klein,,3370.512,3370.572,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.74-5140,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3370.572,3375.337,"We thank you for your assistance to the Court and, of course, your assistance to your own client."
