1969.830,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,59.83,"We'll hear argument in number 830, Chambers against Maroney."
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,64.59,68.475,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,212.848,215.324,Was that the trial of several co-defendants?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,216.187,222.908,"Yes, Your Honor all the defendants or four defendants were for each of those cases."
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,246.261,256.284,What's the practice in the Pittsburgh when the legal aid group represents the defendant?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,262.256,267.456,"Your Honor, the record isn't clear in that regard whether it was a specific appointment or not."
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,275.691,284.455,"Well then, can you tell us or can't you when this gentleman that he met in the hallway first knew he was going to represent this man?"
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,284.455,287.043,"He first knew at that morning, Your Honor, apparently."
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,287.043,288.261,Apparently?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,288.261,288.76,I say that --
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,288.76,289.845,Does the record show that?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,289.845,290.688,"No, it does not."
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,290.688,292.631,All you know is that he met him in the hallway?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,292.631,296.592,That's all we know and we know that because of the statements made by petitioner at the -- court.
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,296.592,304.659,"Or the Legal Aid Society or whatever the name of it is, know that they are going rep -- somebody from that chapter is going to represent them long ever since the first trial?"
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,304.659,306.881,"Yes, I believe they could say that fairly, Your Honor."
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,306.881,313.302,And does the record show whether anybody have been doing any work on the case until the day of the second trial?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,313.302,315.288,"No, it does not."
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,315.288,320.431,You're just assuming that they were giving at no attention in the meantime?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,320.431,326.003,"Your Honor, the record does disclose that and that's all that we have to deal with at the present time, the --"
1969.830,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,326.003,327.698,"Well, we have another factor don't we?"
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,351.723,358.167,"Your Honor, I don't know whether those assumptions are warranted in the circumstances of this case."
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,358.167,360.761,Do you know that there are no warrant?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,360.761,365.871,"If I may speak outside the record, I believe so."
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.844,398.531,But do you have an evidentiary hearing on this in lieu of the --
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,398.531,403.19,"There was an evidentiary hearing held in the state court, Your Honor, that it was very brief."
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,403.19,404.318,Did you represent him?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,404.318,405.134,"No, I did not."
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,407.918,416.991,"But there's been a habeas corpus petition hearing on the question of advocacy of counsel, right?"
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,416.991,420.917,"Not in the federal system, Your Honor, and also its not a full hearing."
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,473.748,476.459,You do plan to spent some time on the search and seizure?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,476.459,477.474,Yes.
1969.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,773.774,789.61,Does the record show why the officers discontinued the search and went into the station house and then went back out and continued the search?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,789.61,803.125,"They don't say its explicitly, Your Honor, what they do assert is that they went through everything and found nothing and it appears as if what they did then was to go back in and further interrogate or attempt to interrogate to disclose information."
1969.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,803.125,808.186,"The record doesn't show what the subject of that interrogation was, does it?"
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,808.186,809.062,"No, it does not."
1969.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,809.062,811.538,I couldn't find anything in the appendix.
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,811.538,813.267,"No, there's nothing in the appendix to indicate that."
1969.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,813.267,831.424,"But it's your, of course your sister in opposition puts in terms of one continual interrupted search rather than two searches or three searches as you do and that's a matter of how you view the facts I suppose?"
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,831.424,842.368,"The matter of continuity is a little hard to explain, Your Honor, because of the passage of time that must be on inferred from the testimony of the officers as to how the search went on."
1969.830,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,842.368,849.824,Does the record suggest that this was the only matter that the officers where then engaged in or did they have other things to do?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,849.824,859.213,"It appears as if this was the only thing they were engaged in, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.830,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1024.644,1039.644,Do you point anything in the record that would show that there was any affect of assistance where there was any dereliction of duty or failure to do some things that shouldn't have been done by the lawyer?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1039.644,1061.999,"Your Honor, I think -- Mr. Chief Justice, if I can I think the basic proposition which start with the things disclosed by the record and they would be that in the first instance the trial court in overruling the objections to the dumdum bullets on the grounds that there had not been a pretrial motion filed."
1969.830,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1080.566,1086.47,"What does it show about the conduct of the first lawyer in the relations with the client, your client?"
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1086.47,1093.15,It doesn't disclose anything except in this record that I now have before the Court.
1969.830,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1103.556,1107.116,Were the objections which were successfully made the first trial?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1107.116,1108.257,Yes.
1969.830,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1109.014,1110.625,And you think they are material?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1110.625,1116.157,I believe they are material.
1969.830,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1153.518,1172.748,"Mr. Grogan, I understand Third Circuit's opinion was that they applied the same rule as the standards of the Fourth Circuit's opinion had and found that it didn't apply in this case so they did -- would you admit that they applied the right standards?"
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1172.748,1176.698,"No, Your Honor."
1969.830,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1192.413,1209.841,"I have the real problem of second guessing of trial lawyers because I don't know about you but so far as I'm concerned, when I went back over record of the case I tried, I found considerable fault with my proceeding."
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1211.19,1213.041,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe that that's --"
1969.830,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1213.041,1219.374,So that's the problem I see in this case is of second guessing in trial lawyer.
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1219.374,1229.842,What we're really concerned with here though Your Honor is not so much second guessing the techniques of trial but we are talking about those factors that are extrinsic to the trial itself.
1969.830,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1235.742,1240.084,"Well, he was appointed all the way back, wasn't he?"
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1240.084,1242.48,"I don't believe we can say that, Your Honor."
1969.830,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1242.48,1251.891,"Well, isn't that the normal procedure to appoint the law you represents the legal aid for all purposes in these days until by order of court is removed?"
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1251.891,1254.358,It's not necessarily the same lawyers.
1969.830,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1255.622,1263.735,"I didn't say with the same lawyer, you always appoint the head of legal aid group, isn't that the way you do in Pittsburgh?"
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1263.735,1265.064,"Generally speaking, yes, I believe it is, Your Honor."
1969.830,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1265.064,1270.363,And then he assigned it to one of his other lawyers?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1270.363,1271.343,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1969.830,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1271.343,1274.579,And now would you assume that's what was done here?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1274.579,1275.435,Yes.
1969.830,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1275.435,1280.559,And wouldn't you assume that the lawyer was appointed before that day of the argument?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1282.694,1292.948,"The Legal Aid Society, Your Honor, may have been appointed as such but he never met the lawyer that was to represent him, his personal counsel, until the morning of trial."
1969.830,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1294.511,1298.143,"Well, no, I understood you to say you didn't know it."
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1307.177,1308.347,"I think he did, Your Honor."
1969.830,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1315.64,1322.411,What's the (Inaudible) file if it's in there?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1322.411,1340.904,"We submit that under Powell against the Alabama that the components of the effective assistance of counsel should have been provided and those would be the opportunity, prepare the opportunity to develop the defenses, to interview witnesses, to file pretrial motions."
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.714,1361.004,What about pretrial motions before the first trial?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1361.004,1362.693,There were none filed.
1969.830,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.693,1366.132,There would have been plenty of opportunity.
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1366.132,1373.244,There would have been plenty of time to do it.
1969.830,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1399.991,1401.771,We'll suspend for lunch and then continue after lunch.
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1401.771,1404.476,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1969.830,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1404.476,1407.375,Do you want to keep the remaining time for rebuttal or do you want to continue?
1969.830,0,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,1407.375,1411.831,"I would like to continue, if you please."
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,1966.925,1969.687,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2031.398,2034.064,Is that all in the record?
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2034.064,2042.21,"Your Honor, it's in the record by virtue of allegations made in response to the habeas corpus petition filed in the state court."
1969.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2073.186,2076.181,The issue then was presented to the state court?
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2076.181,2077.867,It was presented to the state court --
1969.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2077.867,2078.764,It was withdrawn.
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2078.764,2079.509,-- and withdrawn.
1969.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.366,2092.141,He thought that withdrawing the state?
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2092.141,2093.19,"He did, Your Honor."
1969.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.19,2094.699,Do you think?
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2094.699,2107.118,"I feel that if that is the case, if petitioner was not waiving it at the time that it did not exhaust the state revenues and the question actually should be before the state court."
1969.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.118,2111.853,How did he -- he withdrew it?
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2111.853,2121.407,By virtue of his counsel when the Commonwealth attempted to cross-examine Chambers about the length of time that he had -- had an opportunity to speak with Mr. Tamburo.
1969.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.407,2127.272,"Well, if there wasn't an adequate hearing in the state court because they didn't do that."
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2127.272,2154.453,"Yes, that is our point Your Honor, we are saying that they with -- if there is anything lacking in the record, then it is likely by virtue of counsel for the petitioner at the time withdrawing the allegation and consequently the Commonwealth then stopped its line of questioning with the petitioner on this lines and did not present any affirmative evidence to share the petitioner had had an opportunity to discuss this case with Mr. Tamburo."
1969.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.625,2201.262,Ms. Los.
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2201.262,2201.687,"Yes, sir."
1969.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.687,2203.776,(Inaudible)
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2203.776,2206.364,"Yes, you do, Your Honor."
1969.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.965,2214.424,And that will tell us all the facts of withdrawal of counsel at that point?
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2214.424,2215.371,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2360.742,2360.912,Well --
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2360.912,2361.374,He does --
1969.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2361.374,2371.14,"-- Ms. Loss, the petitioner says that under those circumstances, there's no way under the sun to file a pretrial motion."
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2371.14,2372.953,"Well, that is true Your Honor."
1969.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2395.824,2396.082,Well who made this --
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2396.082,2397.669,-- specifically --
1969.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2397.669,2404.3,-- who made the decision whether or not to file pretrial motions in this case?
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2404.3,2405.695,The record is unclear on that.
1969.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2408.396,2415.324,-- the record is clear that the counsel in this case couldn't have decided because he didn't get it until that morning.
1969.830,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2415.324,2416.327,Not this.
1969.830,2,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,3969.643,3971.073,"Your Honor, we also considered it."
1969.830,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4010.492,4014.195,You have a substantial amount of time left if you wish for a rebuttal.
1969.830,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4014.195,4015.012,"Oh, he's out."
1969.830,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4015.012,4015.686,Oh!
1969.830,2,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,4015.686,4018.84,I'm out of time.
1969.830,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4018.84,4023.977,"Excuse me, I'm looking at the wrong sheet and the wrong case and it showed nine minutes but I was mistaken."
1969.830,2,43593,vincent_j_grogan,,4023.977,4024.783,Thank you very much.
1969.830,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4024.783,4025.239,Thank you.
1969.830,3,19423,carol_mary_los,,4028.677,4030.195,"Thank you, sir."
