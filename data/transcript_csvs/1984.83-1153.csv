1984.83-1153,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,78.933,"Mr. Frankel, I think you may proceed when you're ready."
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,78.933,86.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case has a similar superficial sound to the one preceding it."
1984.83-1153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,694.786,711.662,"Mr. Frankel, the language of the statute itself appears to be addressed just to the single grant situation, author to the person who uses the work."
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,718.817,730.792,"Your Honor, it doesn't say anything about third parties, but it is dealing with a world where grants and subgrants are the order of that universe."
1984.83-1153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,732.209,742.867,"Well, that's our problem, of course, but how to apply this language which may not be all that clear as applied to the third party situation?"
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,742.867,744.819,"--Let me come to that directly, Your Honor."
1984.83-1153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,769.717,774.769,Is Mills Music a utilizer under that subsection?
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,774.769,776.037,--Is Mills Music a--
1984.83-1153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,776.037,777.254,A utilizer.
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,777.254,778.421,"--No, it is not."
1984.83-1153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,778.421,779.771,Does Mills Music utilize the work?
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,779.771,780.387,"It is not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,911.406,926.581,"Except that it appears, when you read it, to be addressed to the purpose of protecting the people who have recorded the works."
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,926.581,927.298,Sure.
1984.83-1153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,928.85,937.706,And that it doesn't appear to address the royalty question or who should receive what royalties.
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,937.706,943.86,"On the latter half, with respect, Justice O'Connor, I think I would say it somewhat differently."
1984.83-1153,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.581,978.614,Could I ask you about that?
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,990.622,992.357,The user promised to pay royalties.
1984.83-1153,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,992.357,992.991,To whom.
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,992.991,994.376,To Mills.
1984.83-1153,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,994.376,996.911,And then Mills passed on half?
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,996.911,1001.462,Mills passed on half of the net royalties to the Snyders.
1984.83-1153,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1001.462,1009.135,"Well, what excuses the user from paying royalties to Mills?"
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1009.135,1018.157,"Well, actually, Your Honor, the mechanics, the user... I'm not sure this is at the heart of your question, but I want to be technically accurate."
1984.83-1153,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1044.372,1055.263,"The statute says that the derivative users can continue to use, but I suppose in accordance with the terms of their undertaking."
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1067.238,1068.94,"Well, to Mills if--"
1984.83-1153,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.94,1070.99,Or Mills's agent.
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1070.99,1088.667,"--Your Honor, if you look at the grant that has been terminated, you will see that there's no way to know that RCA, for example, is a record company authorized to make derivative works."
1984.83-1153,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.603,1125.257,"What kind of a piece of paper passed between Mills and the user, the derivative... the record--"
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1125.257,1132.327,"--Actually, again, I'm being pedantic, but I want to be accurate, the piece of paper passed from Harry Fox to--"
1984.83-1153,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1132.327,1132.611,--All right.
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1133.694,1134.113,--Yes.
1984.83-1153,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.942,1157.026,--Promises to pay royalties to us.
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1157.026,1157.894,Yes.
1984.83-1153,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.211,1161.463,Right.
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1161.463,1163.632,And Harry Fox being an agent of Mills.
1984.83-1153,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1163.632,1164.032,Right.
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1164.032,1167.684,And this being the typical industry arrangement.
1984.83-1153,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.902,1183.027,This promise seems to me to be part of the conditions of the use that the statute says would be continued.
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1183.027,1184.727,--Without a doubt.
1984.83-1153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1363.508,1382.806,"Mr. Frankel, I guess at the time that Snyder made the agreement originally with Mills Music, it was contemplated that, at best, the right would extend for 28 years and a renewal term."
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1384.089,1384.624,"--Yes, Your--"
1984.83-1153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1384.624,1405.687,And we're now in that extended 19... we're talking about the extension of an additional 19 years within which the copyright can be put into effect beyond that contemplated by Snyder and Mills when it was originally made.
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1405.687,1406.154,--That's correct.
1984.83-1153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1406.154,1425.935,"And so I'm wondering whether, under those circumstances, the mechanical licenses issued by Mills would be expected to continue to require payment of royalties beyond the original expiration time."
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1425.935,1431.572,"Your Honor, the extension affected everybody."
1984.83-1153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1503.064,1532.0,"Well, if then Snyder had entered into the agreement with Mills for a fixed lump sum fee, not a continuing royalty of 50 percent, but just you pay me $5,000 now and you may have the right to license during the term of the copyright, would Snyder's heirs now be in a position to share in any of the money?"
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1532.0,1536.618,"Your Honor, with respect to old derivative works, the short answer is no."
1984.83-1153,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1681.913,1683.882,"Can I just ask one question, Mr. Frankel?"
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1683.882,1684.432,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1153,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1684.432,1697.308,"What is the source, as you understand the statute, of the obligation of the 419 licenses to continue to pay anything to Mills or Fox?"
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1697.308,1705.795,They are obliged by the license that they accepted from Mills--
1984.83-1153,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1705.795,1712.984,"Which, at the time they accepted it, as Justice O'Connor has pointed out, anticipated there would be no payments after the 56th year."
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1712.984,1713.684,--It did.
1984.83-1153,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1720.405,1721.94,That's what's running through my mind.
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1721.94,1722.84,I know you're aware of that.
1984.83-1153,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1737.533,1741.837,And what is your understanding of the source of their obligation to continue to pay?
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1741.837,1752.709,I think the source of their obligation is their acceptance of the license which would subsist as long as there was a valid copyright under Gerde.
1984.83-1153,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1752.709,1759.465,"But under your theory, there is no valid copyright insofar as it covers the exclusive right to use the derivative works."
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1759.465,1780.212,"Your Honor, the copyright, the grant which is the main document, has remained effective because Congress said it would remain effective, and that you look to the terms of that terminated grant, continued in force, as the conditions on which these record companies could continue to utilize."
1984.83-1153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1787.382,1802.892,"Well, Mr. Frankel, has any court had occasion yet to decide whether, under one of these Fox-type agreements, the licensees are required to continue to pay any royalty at all?"
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1802.892,1804.578,"Not so far as I know, Your Honor."
1984.83-1153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1805.278,1808.63,And so that is really an open question.
1984.83-1153,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1819.77,1828.443,"--It may be, Your Honor, and I'm sure that both Mr. Tyler and I would be grievously unhappy if the Court found a way to reach that question on this record."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,1898.187,1914.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the Snyders contend that this argument, both in the brief as well as orally, on behalf of Mills, really avoids and evades the principal issue in this case."
1984.83-1153,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2158.788,2164.424,"Judge Tyler, why do you think Judge Weinfeld didn't buy that argument?"
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2164.424,2168.576,"I think the short answer, Justice Blackmum, is this."
1984.83-1153,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2203.382,2206.084,Mr. Tyler... go ahead.
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2206.084,2222.563,"--Second, if you'll bear with me, Justice Rehnquist, the clear purpose of the exception is not to benefit a publisher like Mills, but to benefit the public, to give the public access to clearly copyrightable derivative works."
1984.83-1153,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2242.543,2252.499,"But surely, if an author had assigned away his rights, the statute intended to benefit the assignee as well as the author."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2252.499,2256.784,"Well, no, not in this sense, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-1153,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2272.646,2273.013,Yes.
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2278.983,2279.8,"Well, that is correct."
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.986,2308.786,"But, Mr. Tylcer--"
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2308.786,2309.969,Mills hasn't created anything.
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2309.969,2314.337,"--Mr Tyler, isn't it correct that it's subject to an Exception for the derivative works?"
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2317.223,2318.039,That is correct.
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2318.039,2322.027,So that the copyright owner has no exclusive right to prevent them from--
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2322.027,2322.877,That is correct.
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2322.877,2331.816,"--So I don't understand your... supposing the derivative works people had paid a lump sum for their rights, anticipating that they would run out in 56 years."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2333.866,2335.268,You've got to be a little careful here.
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2343.706,2344.057,No.
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2359.233,2361.585,"--Oh, there's no doubt of that, but that's not going to make it--"
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2361.585,2366.97,And the reason they could do it is because your client has no exclusive privilege with respect to the derivative work.
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2366.97,2368.522,"--We have to accept that, Justice Stevens."
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2368.522,2371.691,Then what is the source of your right to royalties with respect to derivative works?
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2371.691,2372.374,"No, no, no."
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2397.675,2403.162,"Well, my question is, what is the source of your right to get any money at all from RCA?"
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2403.162,2405.329,Let me go back to the two grants here.
1984.83-1153,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2483.647,2484.297,"What page, please?"
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2485.597,2488.432,"--JA-22, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-1153,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2488.432,2491.001,Thank you.
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2491.001,2499.074,"Our opponents like to sort of slither around and say this isn't very clear and it doesn't really indicate an awful lot, but it indicates one thing."
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2530.695,2538.115,"But your answer to my question, then... I asked you what is the source of Snyder's right to receive royalties from RCA."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2548.489,2552.208,"Yes; because Snyder, under the reversion--"
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2552.208,2560.128,"In other words, it's a written undertaking by RCA to pay money to Mills, which is what you claim to be the source of Snyder's right to receive money from RCA."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2560.128,2566.284,--So long as you understand... and I am sure you do... that this wouldn't have ever come up if it weren't for the statute change.
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2566.284,2567.901,"Well, of course not."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2567.901,2571.086,"But otherwise, yes."
1984.83-1153,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2573.122,2581.294,"Judge Tyler, I think I should object that you and Judge Frankel speak of how long ago this took place, in 1923 I think."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2592.199,2595.285,"--Well, I agree, both counts."
1984.83-1153,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2938.772,2945.528,You say then that Mills is not someone who may... who would continue to utilize a derivative work.
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2945.528,2947.162,Mills certainly would not.
1984.83-1153,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2981.534,2985.069,So then it would be a grant from Mills to the record company that would be--
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2985.069,2985.603,"Well, no."
1984.83-1153,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3001.463,3005.066,"You may resume there at one o'clock, Mr. Tyler."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3018.89,3034.317,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the luxury of the lunch hour recess and the reflection it afforded me makes me wish to readdress the point which in part was made at least by Justice Stevens."
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3186.217,3196.006,"May I just ask, does that mean you still rely on the grants from Mills to RCA as the source of RCA's obligation to pay money to--"
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3196.006,3201.744,"Well, those grants, whether it's RCA, which is only an exempt--"
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3201.744,3202.227,--I understand.
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3202.227,3205.797,--Those grant terms are important.
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3217.855,3219.071,"Well, let me just kind of simplify."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3225.009,3226.225,--We're relying on both.
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3229.579,3239.369,"But is it correct that having terminated, that the statute does not give your client any right to exclude RCA from further making the derivative work that was--"
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3239.369,3240.019,That is correct.
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3240.019,3243.987,--What is the source of your right to get money from RCA?
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3243.987,3249.289,"The source is the fact that we now stand in Mills's shoes, plus the fact that--"
1984.83-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3249.289,3251.657,With respect to everything except that derivative grant.
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3251.657,3252.341,--No.
1984.83-1153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.91,3316.349,The statute itself says that the derivative work can only continue to be utilized under the terms of the grant.
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3316.349,3316.766,That is correct.
1984.83-1153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3316.766,3318.285,"Now, what grant is that?"
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3318.285,3326.372,"That is a grant, assumed by Congress to mean the straight one-step grant which we didn't have in this case."
1984.83-1153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.299,3345.701,"And the terms of the grant are that the grantee can license, and he does license."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3345.701,3346.051,No.
1984.83-1153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.747,3368.366,"It has to continue, but only on the terms of the grant."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3368.366,3369.132,That grant.
1984.83-1153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3369.949,3370.282,That's right.
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3373.834,3375.186,That is correct.
1984.83-1153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3404.122,3414.244,"I suppose you could argue that the terms of the license are, by implication, made part of the terms of the original grant, because Mills was authorized to issue these licenses."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3414.244,3416.946,That's the error that the district court fell in to.
1984.83-1153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3416.946,3422.5,"Well, I know, but I would think it would be... I don't know why it would hurt you."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3422.5,3424.6,It hurts us in this way.
1984.83-1153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3452.019,3454.053,In order to get any money.
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3454.053,3454.638,--That's right.
1984.83-1153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3513.343,3515.293,You'd demur to the accusation.
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3515.293,3516.961,Exactly.
1984.83-1153,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3537.625,3556.252,"Mr. Tyler, may I inquire, before you sit down, the Snyders in any event, even if your opponent's view is the correct one, could issue new licenses after the termination and derive income from new licenses."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3556.252,3556.869,Yes.
1984.83-1153,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3560.388,3563.006,At least that I guess you are in agreement on.
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3586.539,3588.558,"Well, are you--"
1984.83-1153,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3588.558,3590.76,How great is the problem?
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3604.667,3605.3,--Yes.
1984.83-1153,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3605.869,3613.356,"You don't anticipate, then, that you'll be issuing... the Snyders would be issuing any new licenses as a practical matter?"
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3613.356,3622.462,"--Well, I think, theoretically, the Snyders could very well issue new grants to derivative works users."
1984.83-1153,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3623.231,3625.447,But your realistic expectation is what?
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3630.499,3630.832,--No.
1984.83-1153,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3656.78,3664.286,"--Well, I know that, but I think that the practical expectations might shed some light on what Congress had in mind."
1984.83-1153,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3664.286,3680.795,"Well, I think it's clear that Congress had in mind that the Snyders, by getting back in the shoes of a copyright owner, should have the right in the 19-year term, as you put it, to realize as much income as the author or his heirs could."
1984.83-1153,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3704.697,3708.749,Mr. Frankel.
1984.83-1153,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,3708.749,3724.174,"If the Court please, starting at the end of Mr. Tyler's presentation, of course we argue that the termination provision and the exception in the statute refers to only one grant, the terminated grant."
1984.83-1153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3839.984,3842.685,"And if they had to renegotiate it, the price might be higher."
1984.83-1153,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,3842.685,3843.501,It might indeed.
1984.83-1153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3847.587,3848.403,"Thank you, gentlemen."
