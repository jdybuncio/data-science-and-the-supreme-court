1965.14,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2032.309,2035.2,Does it appear in the statute Mr. McDonald?
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2035.2,2036.022,Sir?
1965.14,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2036.022,2042.757,Does that distinction appeared with the statute in any way or what's the basis of that?
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2042.757,2063.868,"I'm sorry Mr. Justice Fortas, I can't give you a direct answer now except to say that I don't think it appears in the statute, but it appears in some of the earlier cases of this Court that I can't give you reference to right here and now which dealt with the amount of damages awarded by the Commission in Section 3 cases."
1965.14,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2069.118,2076.399,You are saying that there are decisions of this Court that support the propositions that you just stated?

1965.14,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2077.226,2080.181,And not cited in your brief?
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2080.181,2089.754,"I'm not sure that I've cited in the brief, the cases which support the Section 3 -- authority of the Court to change the amount of damages in a Section Free case."
1965.14,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2093.533,2098.234,"It's nothing in the Section 16 (2) that would indicate that difference there, is there?"
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2098.234,2103.591,"No, sir, not at all."
1965.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.996,2231.524,Was it tried this on the record then?
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2231.524,2232.565,"Yes, sir."
1965.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.979,2240.386,"That's the Second Circuit case, how about it?"
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2240.386,2242.125,That's the new process Deere case.
1965.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2242.125,2242.296,Yes.
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2246.955,2249.228,"That's my understanding of it, yes sir."
1965.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2249.228,2257.036,And I gather that this was a -- this ruling was it the response of the -- this represents the Commission review clearly.
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2257.036,2257.916,"Yes, sir."

1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2261.822,2262.251,Sir?
1965.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2262.251,2263.164,Was the Commission in that case?
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2263.164,2263.473,"No, sir."
1965.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2267.898,2268.386,Now tell me.
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2276.52,2279.484,"Exactly, without the introduction of any -- of any evidence."
1965.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2297.451,2299.705,"Well, that's I don't understand Mr. McDonald."
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2306.928,2307.341,"Yes, sir."
1965.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2307.341,2310.0,– you are limited to review on the record made before the Commission.
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2310.0,2313.2,We were denied that -- we were denied any attempt to put in evidence.
1965.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2313.2,2313.491,Yeah.
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2317.073,2317.977,That's right.
1965.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2317.977,2321.456,Well that is how I think you are worse than you'd be in the 17 (9) proceeding?
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2321.456,2333.421,"Well, I think I can answer that in a hurry maybe I shouldn't stop to my prepared argument instead of being so anxious to answer Mr. Ginnane, indicate that my answer would have been different."
1965.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2426.727,2441.326,"Well, what -- what happen -- I gather, your position is in the 16 (2) of all the things you have told us could be asserted in 17 (9) or 1336 proceedings, would also be asserted by way of defense in 16 (2)."
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2453.393,2454.092,That is right.
1965.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2454.334,2463.138,"Now, what -- well, now what -- what value is an order treated that way of a 16 (2) proceeding, even though it's still on the books, what value is it to any other shipper?"
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2463.138,2484.616,"Well, any other shipper can go into a State Court or another Federal District Court and on the presentation of the same record another Court can decide that it does agree, just as in one of the decisions this morning four the esteemed gentleman on this bench disagreed with their five brothers in a disposition of a particular case."
1965.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2490.501,2490.994,Or the finding of the Court --

1965.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2491.582,2494.752,-- has the facts in any experience.
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2508.845,2512.604,I can't give you a direct answer Mr. Justice Brennan to that.
1965.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2695.24,2710.161,"Well, I guess if you are going to 17 -- under 17 (9) railroad -- again, instead of being put off the 16 (2), you wouldn't have choice -- the railroad will have a choice of venue that would enjoin 16 (2) and it wouldn't have to pay any attorney's fees."
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,2710.161,2727.901,"There's no question -- well, I'm not so sure that that's true because as the court pointed below Mr. Justice White, any complainant before the Commission can as a matter of right to intervene in a suit that is brought by a carrier against the United States and the Interstate Commission."
1965.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3346.935,3347.605,No.

1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,3353.397,3355.646,Thank you.
1965.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3460.196,3463.571,Who made that statement Mr. McDonald?
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,3470.11,3470.929,Senator Bacon.
1965.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3470.929,3472.256,"Yes, go on."
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,3472.256,3494.719,"With reference to this particular pros -- that the Hepburn amendment when I was under consideration on the floor of Congress and the Section that was then being discussed was Section 5 where this particular language occurs where the jurisdiction and venue is conferred with respect to and I quote again, “Any order or requirement” of the Commission."
1965.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3494.719,3497.057,Is he one managers of the Bill?
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,3497.057,3497.432,Sir?
1965.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3497.432,3503.51,"Was he one of the managers of the Bill, Bacon?"
1965.14,1,31964,j_edgar_mcdonald,,3503.51,3504.837,I can't answer that.
