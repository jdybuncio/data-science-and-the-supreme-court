1968.620,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,28.094,"Number 620, James L. Moore, et al., appellants versus Simon Shapiro and so forth."
1968.620,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,29.587,32.75,If the Court please.
1968.620,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,183.254,187.502,"This is the precise statute that was before the Court in MacDougall against Green, is it not?"
1968.620,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,187.502,190.272,"The wording is the same, Your Honor."
1968.620,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,203.617,205.043,The same statutory provision?
1968.620,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,205.043,205.317,That is correct.
1968.620,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,205.317,206.008,Exactly.
1968.620,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,206.008,206.731,"Yes, it is."
1968.620,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,206.731,208.129,Identically.
1968.620,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,208.129,264.58,"Well, I suppose you would agree that the answer to that question might be different depending upon the nature of the geographical distribution required so that we don't have a -- if that's so, we don't have before us merely the bowl of proposition that you have now stated but may we not also or alternatively have before us that proposition in the context of the fact that here you have such a tremendous disparity that is to say that only about 6.6% of the Illinois registered voters reside in 53 of the counties, is that right?"
1968.620,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,264.58,265.877,That's correct.
1968.620,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,265.877,267.301,"So, --"
1968.620,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,267.301,267.709,In answer to that --
1968.620,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,267.709,280.917,I mean I assume that you're not saying that we have to base our decision solely on the abstraction that you put to us a moment ago.
1968.620,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,280.917,282.558,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1968.620,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,324.92,342.434,"Well, I mean to say, what is here though is the fact that this question and the specific context of the demographic facts in the State of Illinois, in the distribution of people among the counties."
1968.620,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,354.786,355.394,That is correct.
1968.620,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,358.947,371.097,And you might have another state in which a statute of this sort might work without that rather startling consequence.
1968.620,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,380.376,381.281,That is correct.
1968.620,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,441.356,442.749,I understand your position.
1968.620,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,472.326,474.053,I would agree with that Your Honor.
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1235.753,1238.215,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.620,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1261.676,1262.302,Very well.
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1262.302,1264.637,On some questions.
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1416.239,1430.554,Couldn't the people of Cook County through the control of the party nominate a candidate for the general election?
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1430.554,1437.66,Could the people of Cook County place someone on the ballot for a statewide election under our present election code?
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.363,1440.023,"Well, through the party."
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1440.023,1442.053,Through the party?
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1452.183,1453.596,Yes and who control.
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1453.596,1455.3,And a party convention.
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.3,1458.814,Don't you have -- do you have some rules in your state which --
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1458.814,1459.804,"Yes, we do."
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1470.202,1483.387,What does it take -- what does it take in a statewide convention of the Democratic Party in Illinois for a man to be nominated as a candidate of that party?
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1483.387,1490.874,In the -- I think I'm correct on this; Mr. Friedman can correct me if I'm wrong.
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.754,1500.515,Just one?
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1503.154,1505.433,One county chairman.
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.433,1507.333,Is that comprise your state convention?
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1507.333,1508.529,That's 101 counties.
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1508.529,1512.811,"Yes, 101 people will be in your state convention?"
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1512.811,1525.58,But the individual delegation from a county and might be more than one here carries weighted voting depending upon the amount of votes that that --
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.58,1540.884,"Let's assume that an issue comes up in the state convention and you have a vote in the state convention and all the Cook County representatives vote the same way, will the Cook County representation carry the state convention?"
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1540.884,1550.177,"I would eventually say, at the present time, yes because I believe more than half of the democratic votes in the last general election were from Cook County."
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1550.177,1557.747,So Cook County obviously can get itself -- can get a candidate on the primary ballot.
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1557.747,1558.787,"A democrat, a republican."
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.787,1563.382,"Yes, I understand that a democrat on the primary ballot."
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1563.382,1564.47,Yes.
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1564.47,1565.362,And --
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1565.362,1568.24,"No, no not on the primary -- on the general."
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1568.24,1569.834,"Well, you mean --"
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1569.834,1573.674,We do not have a primary if there are no contested --
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.674,1582.431,"Well, I know but how many votes does it take to get a person on a primary ballot by -- through the convention."
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1587.582,1590.862,A sure majority.
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1590.862,1596.182,"Well, how can more than one get a sure majority in the convention?"
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1596.182,1598.396,The vote to one has the majority.
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1598.396,1601.101,"Well, I know but then you mean you never have a primary in Illinois?"
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1601.101,1601.22,Oh!
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1614.48,1614.589,I see.
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1614.589,1615.883,But what we're talking about here --
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1615.883,1621.15,So the party -- the party itself then just actually just puts up one candidate.
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1621.15,1625.504,The party itself will support or if --
1968.620,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.504,1633.266,The people of Cook County may operate it through the party put a man on the general election ballot for statewide office.
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1633.266,1638.051,That's right.
1968.620,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1638.051,1648.064,"But one of the -- those who will go into a primary again for the Democratic Party, who are these?"
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1648.064,1662.724,There are provisions in our election code which permit an individual to obtain a place on a party ballot in a primary by obtaining a requisite amount of signatures.
1968.620,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1662.724,1669.409,But the choice of the party convention does not oppose him in any primary?
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1669.409,1669.598,Oh!
1968.620,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1679.338,1687.037,"How does the -- how does the one, who opposes the convention choice, how does he get on the primary ballot?"
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1687.037,1690.352,There's provision that he has to do it by nominating --
1968.620,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1690.352,1693.722,"There's any provision anything like this for an independent 25,000 vote?"
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1693.722,1697.485,"I think that in the independent, I don't think it's quite the same."
1968.620,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1705.997,1706.968,"In other words, what he had --"
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1706.968,1707.284,He --
1968.620,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1707.284,1711.383,Would he get some percentage of those on his nominating petition.
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1711.383,1712.098,"That's right, Your Honor."
1968.620,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1712.098,1715.909,All of whom perhaps might be voters living in Cook County?
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1715.909,1721.203,I don't believe there's any county restriction on this basis.
1968.620,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1740.631,1749.472,And Cook County could select all the 26 electors at the convention?
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1749.472,1759.35,"Let's say that due to practicalities where the Democratic Party is mainly in Cook County, in the State of Illinois and the Republican Party is mainly in downstate."
1968.620,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1759.35,1771.287,"Well, assume that every democrat in Cook County at the convention selects all of the 26 electors."
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1774.651,1783.177,"That's possible, that's right."
1968.620,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1865.774,1874.823,"By the way, the electors involved here who sought unsuccessful to get on this ballot, whom were they supporting here?"
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1874.823,1886.616,If the -- the record doesn't really reflect Your Honor but for a matter of what I was told that there were supporters of Senator Eugene McCarthy.
1968.620,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1977.583,1980.934,Why do you say that would debase the vote of the others?
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,1980.934,2001.481,"Well, basically their argument is this, that people living in 50 counties representing 6.6% of the population can put someone on the ballot who is not acceptable to 93.4% of the people."
1968.620,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2006.253,2023.93,"As I understand it, the argument is that people who live in 50 other counties with 6 point whatever it is, less than 7% of the population can prevent the remaining people in the state from putting somebody on the ballot."
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2023.93,2051.17,"In relation to the argument of the state from that point, I would have to say that while that might be possible, it certainly is not probable that an individual who has a serious candidate could not garner 200 signatures and that we would have such a conspiracy existing in 53 counties that would block anyone from getting on a ballot."
1968.620,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2051.17,2055.681,"Well, that may be but that's our argument, isn't it?"
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2055.681,2059.007,That is part of it but then you got it transversely.
1968.620,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2059.007,2081.28,Why do you say that if you require that the statute be based solely upon numbers that that would -- that might result in debasing the vote of people throughout most of the state?
1968.620,1,32243,john_j_otoole,,2081.28,2103.191,"Basically on his arguments stated on the converse as I originally stated it, that 93.4% could be -- could have someone on the ballot that was not acceptable to them likewise 99.5% could have someone on the ballot that was not acceptable to them if this were removed."
1968.620,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2120.14,2121.556,Very well.
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2127.164,2130.214,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.620,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2314.059,2318.582,Could be a clumsy one to get at this objective in this provision.
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2318.582,2323.688,I don't suggest that that by itself Mr. Justice is the whole answer.
1968.620,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2357.794,2359.066,That is for the presidency?
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2359.066,2361.44,"For the -- well, it was for presidency."
1968.620,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2474.166,2491.377,I wonder Mr. Friedman if you could tell us what the voting strength is in the 50th largest county in Illinois because they have to get two other signatures from each of 50 counties.
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2495.119,2498.999,I made this analysis Your Honor and I don't know if I can quite need it.
1968.620,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2502.035,2502.989,Yes.
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2502.989,2504.41,We have 102 counties.
1968.620,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2533.862,2548.116,"May I ask you, would you break that down into parties as to how in Cook County you are overwhelmingly democratic in counties like that, would they be overwhelming?"
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2548.116,2550.008,I don't have those figures at hand Your Honor.
1968.620,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2552.826,2553.176,Yes.
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2553.176,2558.891,"In terms of voter registration alone, Cook County has slightly more than 50%."
1968.620,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2650.853,2659.458,But this “serious political candidate” would not have to have an organization in every single county in order to win?
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2659.458,2661.105,"No, I'm not suggesting that Your Honor."
1968.620,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2661.105,2664.869,But he does have to have it in order to get on the ballot?
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2664.869,2666.565,"Well, I'm suggesting to you, yes."
1968.620,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2683.613,2688.495,But you don't -- is 50 what you consider a substantial number.
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2690.531,2709.435,"I would think in organizing a campaign, you would have to have a political organization and probably all but the smallest counties, I would say that the number I gave in response to the question of Chief Justice Warren would be that you probably you have to have an ongoing organization in a minimum of at least 54 counties."
1968.620,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2709.435,2711.647,And that's the reason for it.
1968.620,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2711.647,2731.963,"Suppose a candidate on the democratic ticket got all of the -- got the solid democratic vote of Cook County and from all other counties, solid democratic vote, how many counties would have to go for him in order for him to be elected?"
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2731.963,2734.08,I'd have to do some rapid calculating.
1968.620,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2734.08,2736.409,"Well, it wouldn't be many, would it?"
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2736.409,2742.114,"No, I would think that perhaps -- well, let me answer it this way."
1968.620,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2752.253,2787.528,"Well, that's the point for whatever it might mean that is to say that in theory anyway, a candidate can be elected by a party vote, by a vote of like-minded people and let us say neither 10 counties only but in order for an independent to get on the ballot under this statute, he will have to have some people voting -- some people favoring him in 50 other counties."
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2787.528,2788.791,That's true.
1968.620,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2817.056,2845.998,"Well, if he's an independent candidate who represents a splinter, a democratic splinter or a republican splinter, suppose he represented a democratic splinter, it might very well be that his appeal would be confined to a very few counties even though at the time of the election, he might have a formidable vote in the average if he could get on the ballot."
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2845.998,2846.826,"Well, yes --"
1968.620,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2846.826,2855.483,"That's from the pragmatic point of view, it would seem to me that that might be the difficulty."
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2855.483,2865.007,"Your Honor, I would say that that's true but in addition to that, there's one other element of the history of independent parties in the State of Illinois that may be helpful to the Court."
1968.620,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2886.905,2895.628,"What do you mean the requirement doesn't mean much anyway even in serving state interest, if it's your state interest is to keep down too many independent candidates."
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2895.628,2899.19,"Well, 2.6% is the figure that's occurred."
1968.620,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2905.304,2935.776,"What interest does the state have in system that permits the democrats of Cook County, as to democrats from one county operating through their convention to put a presidential elector on the ballot and all of the independents in Cook County no matter how many they are can't get a presidential elector on the ballot?"
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2935.776,2945.75,"Once again, the focus of the case before us is not necessarily related to the internal operation of either the two major political parties."
1968.620,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.75,2977.084,"Well, I'm just suggesting that -- I'm just suggesting that this necessarily is part of the case, isn't it, when an independent claim has been denied equal protection as a law because he has to get 200 signatures on 50 counties and yet maybe 25,000 democrats in Cook County operating through their convention or did all the democrats in Cook County operating through their convention can put a candidate for a presidential elector on the ballot."
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2977.084,2978.657,Well as a matter of practice --
1968.620,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2978.657,2979.687,Isn't that true though?
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,2979.687,2980.392,Yes it is.
1968.620,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3007.134,3017.958,"Do you think this is -- is it a part of your argument really that this requirement doesn't mean much, that any serious candidate can get it anyway and that this is just an afterthought?"
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,3017.958,3019.34,"No, I think not, Your Honor."
1968.620,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3019.34,3024.453,You think it is a substantial obstacle to an independent candidate?
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,3024.453,3031.207,It's an obstacle which must be overcome and it has been overcome in a number of instances.
1968.620,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3040.842,3045.276,Do you think this thing is kept off to good many candidates then?
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,3045.276,3047.344,"Once again, it would be speculative, Your Honor."
1968.620,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.841,3071.098,"Well, I take it we could believe then it's a substantial obstacle in what you say."
1968.620,2,39287,richard_e_friedman,,3072.744,3077.727,"No, I don't."
1968.620,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3077.727,3081.64,Very well.
1968.620,3,40747,richard_f_watt,,3084.613,3091.567,Just one very brief comment if I may.
1968.620,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3208.847,3216.274,How do you suggest it could be met to avoid constitutional objection you entertain?
1968.620,4,39287,richard_e_friedman,,3216.274,3227.159,I would say that the only way that it could be geographic distributive requirements would be if they were proportional either to the population of the county or the registered voters of the county.
1968.620,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3242.495,3244.945,And how would you have the election?
1968.620,5,40747,richard_f_watt,,3247.199,3265.697,"A new party would get in by filing petitions with the required number of signatures of qualified voters who had not voted in one of the party primaries and if the total number of valid signatures was up to the minimum required, then that group of candidates or that individual candidate should go on the ballot."
1968.620,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3265.697,3266.995,From what counties?
1968.620,5,40747,richard_f_watt,,3266.995,3269.423,It would make no difference from what county.
1968.620,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3269.423,3270.443,Just from the state?
1968.620,5,40747,richard_f_watt,,3270.443,3272.717,Just from the state.
1968.620,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3272.717,3277.389,Is that -- could you think of any other way?
1968.620,5,40747,richard_f_watt,,3277.389,3285.599,"Well, I suppose you could have almost any variety of techniques for getting independents or new party candidates on the ballot Mr. Justice Black."
1968.620,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3322.125,3324.121,We'll adjourn.
