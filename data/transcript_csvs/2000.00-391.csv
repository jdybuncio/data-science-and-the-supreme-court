2000.00-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.708,"We'll hear argument next in Number 00-391, Florida v. Thomas."
2000.00-391,0,39672,robert_j_krauss,,16.583,19.384,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-391,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,79.244,83.735,May I ask... I forget the facts a little bit.
2000.00-391,0,39672,robert_j_krauss,,87.579,91.693,Detective Maney had been in the house.
2000.00-391,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,91.693,100.747,"After the man, after the defendant drove into the driveway and got out, did the officer, before he arrested him, go into the house and come back out?"
2000.00-391,0,39672,robert_j_krauss,,100.747,102.309,"I don't... do not believe so, Your Honor."
2000.00-391,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,102.309,102.609,You don't?
2000.00-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,102.609,104.94,He arrested him and then went into the house.
2000.00-391,0,39672,robert_j_krauss,,104.94,105.32,That is correct.
2000.00-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,105.32,107.951,"He arrested him, handcuffed him, took him into the house--"
2000.00-391,0,39672,robert_j_krauss,,107.951,108.332,Absolutely.
2000.00-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,108.332,109.604,--and then came back and examined the car.
2000.00-391,0,39672,robert_j_krauss,,109.604,115.187,"Yes, sir, within 5 minutes of... this whole entire episode took 5 minutes from when--"
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,977.724,992.024,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.574,1024.535,"Let me just ask you about that, taking one at a time."
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1030.888,1034.762,--I'd like to make one thing clear on that at the outset.
2000.00-391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1046.651,1048.353,I'm not sure that responds to my question.
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1048.353,1048.774,Absolutely.
2000.00-391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.554,1065.126,"The danger was totally unrelated to the car, wasn't it, because he was in the house."
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1065.126,1074.663,"--The danger was related to the fact of the arrest, and that's what justifies the search under the Belton doctrine as well under the search incident to arrest doctrine."
2000.00-391,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1083.939,1099.029,"Yes, but after the person has been removed... arrested and handcuffed and removed from the scene, put in a house, what's left of Belton to justify the officer going back to the car and making a search?"
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1099.029,1107.047,"Well, first of all, I think it's important for the Court to recognize that this case is a little bit unusual in that the person was put into a house."
2000.00-391,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1109.297,1112.009,"Well, but do you mind answering the question that I asked?"
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1113.399,1114.13,--Belton--
2000.00-391,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1114.13,1122.228,But what is left of the Belton justification for going back to the car and making a search later?
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1122.228,1125.509,--The justification for the search is provided by the arrest.
2000.00-391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1184.507,1189.57,"Well, I wonder if your view doesn't require new line drawing where we've gotten the line already drawn in Belton."
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1189.57,1191.471,--With respect--
2000.00-391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1191.471,1192.803,"I mean, you say 5 minutes."
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1194.983,1195.384,"--Well, we--"
2000.00-391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1195.384,1196.525,--2 hours?
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1196.525,1197.056,--Sure.
2000.00-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1208.145,1219.391,"Well, so if he's taken off the scene, why isn't the scene where the policeman, the police car, and the car are all there together, but what isn't the scene is a house?"
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1219.391,1220.28,--Well--
2000.00-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1220.28,1222.693,"I mean, that would be like common sense."
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1227.926,1231.298,--We think the scene in this case would include the house.
2000.00-391,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1239.764,1242.686,Would the policemen have gone in under a different circumstance?
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1247.461,1248.789,--No.
2000.00-391,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1251.992,1255.024,"So once you've searched the car, you can't go in the house, but once you're in the house, you can go out and search the car."
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1255.464,1258.516,"--With respect, no."
2000.00-391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1277.89,1282.231,Is there anything in any of those cases that's comparable to taking him out of the car and putting him in a house?
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1282.231,1290.329,"Well, every case is comparable in that the officer typically puts the suspect in the squad car."
2000.00-391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1290.329,1290.809,In the squad car.
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1290.809,1291.047,Which--
2000.00-391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1291.047,1291.998,I gave you the squad car.
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1296.613,1319.777,"--No, and we think that that case is unusual in that respect, but we would urge the Court to keep very much in mind the much... very typical case in which the suspect is in the squad car, and in that situation it's clear that we think that the search would be contemporaneous with the arrest, and again, to remind the Court, that issue we don't believe is before the Court in this case."
2000.00-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1320.297,1335.298,"Is there jurisdiction, then, here, because in fact there is a problem they haven't passed definitively in Florida on the question of whether the evidence should be suppressed, and your side has two more arguments to make, or one, and the other side has one."
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1339.65,1340.762,"--Well, we think that the--"
2000.00-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1340.762,1343.082,We don't have a final judgment either on the suppression point.
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1343.082,1344.913,--We think that there is jurisdiction.
2000.00-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1384.96,1394.287,"Going back to the finality, which you went over very quickly, is that enough that this issue has been to Florida, it's not going to redesign the Belton issue?"
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1398.428,1415.561,"--That may not be enough in itself, but that, coupled with the fact that if the State were to prevail on remand, the Belton issue would be lost, the State of Florida and officers in Florida would be governed by the Florida supreme court's erroneous interpretation of Belton in this case--"
2000.00-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1415.561,1422.897,Do you have a similar Fourth Amendment case where we treated the judgment as final for purposes of our review?
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1422.897,1433.375,"--We've cited cases that are interlocutory in the respect that they come up on a suppression motion, New York v. Quarles in our brief."
2000.00-391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1461.002,1464.645,"And that doesn't depend on any 5-minute interval, I take it?"
2000.00-391,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1464.645,1470.208,"That issue was never raised by the respondent in this case, and we don't believe it's within the question presented."
2000.00-391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1476.884,1477.901,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1481.874,1485.658,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-391,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1557.535,1562.928,"Well, you don't think Belton's limited to an arrest of four people, surely?"
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1562.928,1564.55,"--No, certainly not."
2000.00-391,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1564.55,1575.087,"So what does that have to do with this, and why does the reason for the person arrested leaving the car make a difference for Belton?"
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1585.746,1608.289,"It makes a difference with regard to the fact that Mr. Thomas didn't suspect that the officer wanted to make contact with him, so he did not have an incentive to grab any weapons or destroy evidence, because the officer was merely there, and he hadn't signaled his desire to make contact with Mr. Thomas at the time."
2000.00-391,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1608.289,1613.324,"No, but Belton would apply even if the individual was standing outside the car."
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1643.014,1644.383,Perhaps so.
2000.00-391,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1645.304,1649.938,"Well, if that is so, then the Florida distinction really cannot be sustained."
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1649.938,1667.479,"--The way I see it is that once a person gets out of the car on his own, without the prompting from the officer or without initiating contact, he's outside of the car, and the regular considerations of Chimel control."
2000.00-391,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.14,1699.901,"But Ms. Dodge, one of the virtues of Belton, as stated in its opinion, is that it was a bright line rule, without all these nuances that you're adding to it."
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1710.467,1719.323,"--Yes, I think they are, because when you look at Belton itself, Belton allows the search of an occupant's vehicle pursuant to arrest."
2000.00-391,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1737.134,1737.905,Well--
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1737.905,1739.986,--a contemporaneous search is allowed.
2000.00-391,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.986,1754.158,"--there are always lines to be drawn in Fourth Amendment cases, but in this case, certainly, Mr. Thomas was about as recent an occupant as there could have been, other than someone who simply stayed in the car."
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1754.158,1757.838,"Yes, Your Honor, he was a recent occupant."
2000.00-391,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1758.9,1764.292,In Belton the people were no more than recent occupants.
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1765.924,1766.736,--Correct.
2000.00-391,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1777.322,1780.324,"Well, they probably erred in drawing that line."
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1788.341,1789.451,--No.
2000.00-391,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1817.028,1825.465,"Well, as I understand the Florida rule, correct me if I'm wrong, but the policeman puts the siren on, stops the car, and the man runs out of the car and goes and talks to the policeman."
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1825.465,1826.166,His car--
2000.00-391,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1826.166,1840.695,"In... as I understand the rule, the police have no justification for searching the car under Chimel... maybe under an inventory... but under Chimel, the justification for the search evaporates, correct?"
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1840.695,1841.617,--Correct.
2000.00-391,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1841.617,1848.432,"That's a silly rule, because number 1, it encourages everybody to jump out of their car."
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1848.432,1854.256,"Correct, and the Florida rule eliminates that possibility."
2000.00-391,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1895.015,1895.583,So what?
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1951.629,1953.352,The court--
2000.00-391,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1953.352,1960.836,"--the distinction as to whether the person voluntarily got out of the car, after there was eye contact, before there was eye contact?"
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1963.379,1968.002,--The court believed that Mr. Thomas was no longer an occupant.
2000.00-391,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1968.002,1972.396,The person... they're talking about people who are no longer occupants.
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1979.109,1979.409,Yes.
2000.00-391,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1979.409,1982.931,"And, of course, the person in Belton was no longer in it."
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,1982.931,1983.602,Yes.
2000.00-391,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2032.165,2067.308,"Ms. Dodge, your stress on confrontation, or at least signaling, leaves out the case where the police are tailing someone because they think they will be led to the crack house, and they deliberately do not want to confront or signal, so in your argument, I take it, someone in that situation would not come within the Belton rule, because the police hadn't signaled, is that right?"
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,2067.308,2067.558,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-391,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2111.279,2128.62,"So you are supporting the Florida rule about, is it confrontation or signal, but you're not stressing... you don't put any weight on the absence of a nexus here, that this, unlike the Belton line of cases, did not involve a traffic violation?"
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,2128.62,2129.889,Correct.
2000.00-391,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2221.511,2226.173,"Is there evidence in the case against him, aside from the drugs they received, any significant evidence?"
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,2231.336,2232.268,"Yes, it is."
2000.00-391,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2232.268,2232.819,All right.
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,2232.819,2233.657,There was nothing found on his person.
2000.00-391,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2233.657,2233.837,All right.
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,2235.65,2236.091,"Yes, sir."
2000.00-391,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2236.091,2240.252,"It's either... because you'll win the Chimel issue, I would think."
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,2240.252,2240.513,I--
2000.00-391,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.513,2243.334,"If he was in the house, I don't see he's going to grab the--"
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,2243.334,2244.906,--I would hope so.
2000.00-391,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2244.906,2246.977,--All right.
2000.00-391,2,18826,cynthia_j_dodge,,2246.977,2270.372,"Well, we believe that the contact rule is a reasonable rule, even though it does... it does, admittedly, it expands Belton, but it's reasonable, because the officer starts the person's thought processes, adrenaline going the minute he starts saying, you know, I would like to have contact with you."
2000.00-391,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2331.794,2333.545,"Thank you, Ms. Dodge."
2000.00-391,3,39672,robert_j_krauss,,2336.766,2339.378,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2000.00-391,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2403.801,2405.261,"Thank you, Mr. Krauss."
