1985.84-1726,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,22.428,"Mr. Durkin, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,22.428,25.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,363.509,377.629,"Are you asking us to make some factual determinations in this Court that... don't we take the facts as we find them in the court of appeals opinion, or not?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,377.629,399.135,"Well, on the point that I just mentioned, I thought if the fact would be a fact obtainable from the record and the specific circumstance, in the court of appeals opinion... the court of appeals expressly states that it's making its findings on a hypothesis that that ship never left the pier."
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,411.553,418.237,I don't know that you... I thought we were just going to deal with the questions you raised in the petition for certiorari.
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,418.237,422.283,"--I am, sir, but there are two."
1985.84-1726,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,595.134,597.915,"Well, that's ordinarily a contract measure of damages."
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,601.679,602.101,"--No, sir."
1985.84-1726,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,610.035,617.064,"But you just described something in terms of a failure to perform, I thought, and that is ordinarily a contract concept."
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,617.064,618.47,"--Let me state it again, sir."
1985.84-1726,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,649.301,652.862,You've stated it three times but you haven't made it any clearer to me.
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,652.862,669.322,"At the time that the turbine was originally manufactured, extra to any contract term, the requirement of that manufacturer was to manufacture a product--"
1985.84-1726,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,669.322,672.243,Why was it the requirement on the manufacturer?
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,672.243,673.509,"--Sir, I'm sorry?"
1985.84-1726,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,673.509,678.507,You say there was a requirement on the manufacturer to manufacture in a particular way.
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,681.349,701.936,"Well, the particular turbine was manufactured in New Jersey and the law of new Jersey imposes an obligation upon a manufacturer of a particular commodity, which commodity is thereafter to be introduced into the general course of commerce, a conduct to make that particular turbine reasonably safe."
1985.84-1726,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,701.936,705.637,"So then, the Admiralty borrows New Jersey law in that respect?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,705.637,710.744,"Well, I won't say, sir, that they borrow the New Jersey law."
1985.84-1726,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,710.744,712.805,"Well, then why did you mention New Jersey law?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,712.805,716.445,"Only, sir, because you asked me a specific question."
1985.84-1726,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,718.882,724.082,"But certainly, this case was tried in Admiralty, wasn't it?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,724.082,725.347,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1726,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,725.347,741.341,"Well, then if there is a requirement on the manufacturer to make the turbine this particular way, as you say it is, and you say the source of the requirement is from the New Jersey law, Admiralty must be borrowing New Jersey law, isn't it?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,741.341,743.45,"Well, not only New Jersey law."
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,798.458,799.692,"Mr. Durkin, could I interrupt you."
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,808.876,811.61,"--When you say ""they"", sir, I'm not following."
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,811.61,813.718,"Your client is the charterer, right?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,813.718,816.326,"My client, the charterer--"
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,816.326,818.248,That ordered a ship built by somebody.
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,818.248,818.561,"--No, sir."
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,834.021,836.225,"How did the plaintiff get involved, then?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,836.225,850.469,"The plaintiff in this case thereafter, after a sequence of transfers of title, my clients chartered, bareboat chartered that vessel from the then owner."
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,874.537,878.613,"So, the two million dollars you're talking about is repair cost, not original cost?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,878.613,879.597,"--Oh, yes, sir."
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,879.597,880.879,"I'm sorry, I didn't understand."
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,880.879,888.719,Only part of the repair costs that were encountered by the charterer in getting the work done.
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.044,910.321,"So, you're saying you're a subsequent owner of a ship that was defectively constructed and you say, just like I buy a used car that somebody, when they originally built it, built it improperly, I can sue the person who made the original mistake?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,910.321,913.147,If in your hypothesis you suggest that the new car--
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,913.147,914.553,Used car.
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,914.553,923.83,"--Used car was a day or two old, because at the time my charter commenced, my charter commenced the day that ship left that shipyard."
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.83,927.86,And your only contractual relationship was with your immediate predecessor in title?
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,927.86,928.984,Absolutely.
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,928.984,930.062,Not with the shipyard?
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,930.062,931.078,"No, sir."
1985.84-1726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,931.078,931.857,Was this a barebottom?
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,931.857,932.56,Sir?
1985.84-1726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,932.56,936.591,Barebottom charter?
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,936.591,937.403,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,937.403,943.307,A barebottom charter and a charter of an automobile are two different animals.
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,943.307,945.384,"I'm sorry, sir."
1985.84-1726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,946.461,954.053,The barebottom charter and the leasing of an automobile are two different animals.
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,954.053,955.131,"Oh, absolutely."
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,979.416,986.008,"And the owner's position, the owner would have had a contractual relationship, not with Delaval but with the builder of the boat?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,986.008,986.399,"--Yes, sir."
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.399,988.07,"The boat or the ship, pardon me."
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,988.07,989.226,That is correct.
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1081.377,1087.438,What contractual remedy would you have against the owner from whom you chartered the ship?
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1087.438,1088.56,"--None, sir."
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.56,1091.278,"Because you didn't bargain for it or something, or what?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1091.278,1094.184,"Well, I'll give you the exact fact."
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.301,1117.191,"Well, you just gave up any... you just took the risk that it was, then?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1117.191,1121.97,The risk as between myself and the owner?
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.97,1122.658,Yes.
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1122.658,1139.041,"I would think so, but I'm not so sure, even if I didn't do that, under the facts of this case the owner would assume any of the responsibilities that are imputable to Delaval because that owner bad nothing to do with the particular contract for the acquiring of those turbines."
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1154.909,1158.315,Could you just clarify one other thing for me?
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1158.315,1158.799,"Surely, sir."
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.799,1166.062,Does the charterer in this situation get a contractual protection from anybody that the ship is seaworthy?
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1173.011,1195.83,"No, it isn't that... there is nothing in the charter, and the charter of course is part of the record, that I can invite your attention to, that would permit the charterer to claim against that owner because of any claimed defect."
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1204.358,1209.809,"No, I didn't mean... I'm trying to stay away from legal obligation, just contractual."
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1220.804,1228.693,"--Well, sir, that presupposes that the charterer didn't conduct the usual full inspections prior to the time--"
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.693,1232.832,"But he relies just on the visual inspection of the ship and so forth, and then takes the risk?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1232.832,1233.284,"--No, sir."
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1237.282,1244.076,"But, I mean, he doesn't have any contractual protection, that's what I'm asking, so he has to insure against this risk, is the only thing he can do?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1244.076,1254.932,"Well, it would be almost impossible to even understand what the particular risk that would be the subject of the particular coverage involved."
1985.84-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.837,1261.539,"Did something go wrong with the turbine, might be one risk."
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1269.629,1287.966,"--No, and when you say it's not unforeseeable, I guess that would also include the manufacturer who represented that if the manufacturer could build turbines to the specification of those new tankers being built."
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1345.661,1351.705,It wasn't a safety question and it didn't threaten persons or property?
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1351.705,1375.383,"Yes, sir, and I have yet to ever hear, sir, yet to ever hear one man who's ever been at sea and had the power unit go out on a ship and thereafter indicate that that wasn't safety... or an unusual risk involved."
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1379.975,1389.16,"Even if it were, though, that wouldn't justify collecting economic loss for the delay or loss of profits?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1389.16,1392.049,--I'm sorry.
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1392.892,1400.453,What kind of... the Third Circuit said you couldn't collect economic losses.
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1400.453,1422.723,"The Third Circuit held this, that unless there is damage done other than the damage to the turbine or personal injury, no matter what else is involved, in this circuit you cannot maintain this type of action."
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1473.734,1488.243,"Well, don't you think the Third Circuit thought it was merely following what the general rule was in situations like this, not just in Admiralty but in other actions?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1488.243,1491.101,--I can't really respond--
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.101,1497.943,In manufacturer's liability or product liability cases?
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1497.943,1507.236,"--Well, the Third Circuit did say that they were adopting what they perceived to be the majority rule for on-land cases."
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1507.236,1507.47,Right.
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1507.47,1509.376,But one of the things that's intrinsically--
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1509.376,1512.797,Do you challenge what it thought the general rule was?
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1512.797,1518.56,"--Only in this respect, the general rule as I understood it previously--"
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1518.56,1521.012,In product liability cases on land.
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1521.012,1543.83,"--Only in product liability cases on land, if somebody other than the plaintiff were to be injured as a result of the involved episode or somebody else's property were to be damaged as a result of the particular episode, under those cases I read them to mean that that would satisfy the condition precedent."
1985.84-1726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.242,1571.912,"Well, that narrowing is sort of irrelevant to this case, isn't it?"
1985.84-1726,0,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,1571.912,1604.323,"Well, everything is irrelevant to this case factually because there has never been a contention throughout that if the rule of the Third Circuit that the risk is not the test but the occurring of the actual damage is the test, there has never been a contention in this particular case that even with the steam emissions and so forth that there was in fact anybody who sustained personal injury nor was there any particular property damage."
1985.84-1726,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1621.033,1629.25,Mr. Smith.
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,1629.25,1633.372,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.282,1704.89,For both strict liability and negligence?
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,1704.89,1705.125,"--Yes, sir."
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.125,1711.138,"In this kind of a case, like a design defect in a product?"
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,1711.138,1712.231,"Exactly, Justice White."
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.413,1968.41,"At least on the negligence side of it, what do you do about Ingram River Equipment, in that case?"
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,1971.97,1979.232,"Your Honor, we do disagree with Ingram River and Ingram River has permitted recovery in federal maritime law for negligence."
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.415,1993.931,--How about any other circuits?
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,1993.931,1998.475,"--On negligence, Your Honor, I think that there is no other case in point."
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.475,1999.585,How about strict liability?
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,1999.585,2008.863,"Strict liability, the only case in point is Emerson Diesel in the Ninth Circuit, and Your Honor, I think neither of those cases are ones with which we would agree."
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2013.468,2014.89,"Well, that may be, but they don't agree with you either."
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2014.89,2015.796,--They don't agree with us.
1985.84-1726,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2147.806,2154.146,"Well, Mr. Smith, is the test there one of risk or one of whether the risk materialized?"
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2154.146,2159.114,"Your Honor, I think that the test really is one of risk."
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2281.252,2281.985,At some expense?
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2281.985,2283.719,At some expense.
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.061,2327.889,"You mean, the Bay Ridge?"
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2327.889,2329.592,"Excuse me, the Bay Ridge."
1985.84-1726,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2329.592,2336.464,Was the new ring installed on the Bay Ridge the one that was installed in reverse?
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2336.464,2339.196,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2391.628,2399.781,"But your major issue as you see it, I take it, is whether there is any tort remedy at all in this case or whether there's either a contract remedy or there's nothing?"
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2399.781,2400.078,Yes.
1985.84-1726,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2400.078,2411.261,"Well, it is arguable, I suppose, that on count five there is a valid negligence claim?"
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2411.261,2436.907,"Your Honor, I don't believe so under the majority land-based rule which was applied by the Third Circuit, and that is that once again the damage that we're talking about, the cause of the negligent, or the alleged negligent installation, and in our case supervision of the stern guardian valve involved deterioration and breakdown of that valve, of that part, same as the guide bucket ring that deteriorated."
1985.84-1726,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2445.778,2451.871,"Wouldn't that be foreseeable, that there'd be some down time to replace it and do the work over?"
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2451.871,2461.271,"--Your Honor, as I understand the majority rule, and I think it's really quite clear on this point, it isn't the possibility that the damage could occur."
1985.84-1726,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2464.614,2472.596,"Well, isn't it totally foreseeable that if it's installed in reverse that it will require down time to correct it?"
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2472.596,2475.032,"Your Honor, but that's not the risk that the rule is speaking of."
1985.84-1726,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2498.461,2503.004,"It just seems like count five is just an ordinary, garden variety negligence claim."
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2509.08,2515.562,"Your Honor, I don't think there is any safety implication to the fifth count."
1985.84-1726,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2515.562,2523.684,But why should you import this product liability type of limitation into what Justice O'Connor seems to me to rightly describe just as a straight negligence count?
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2523.684,2527.386,"The reason, Your Honor, would be that that is in fact the majority rule on land."
1985.84-1726,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2527.386,2529.822,"Well, does it have anything better to commend it?"
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2529.822,2532.274,"Your Honor, I think it does."
1985.84-1726,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2614.178,2618.209,Without... I thought you said with prejudice.
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2618.209,2618.803,--With prejudice.
1985.84-1726,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2618.803,2621.442,Is that because of the statute of limitations that run?
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2621.442,2624.331,We had moved on that ground.
1985.84-1726,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.481,2725.306,Would they acquire the right to assert any warranty claims that their predecessors in title could have--
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2725.306,2726.353,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1985.84-1726,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2728.15,2730.414,--May I ask one other question.
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2753.732,2755.388,"Well, I'm glad Your Honor asked that question."
1985.84-1726,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.621,2773.724,"Well, I understand that, but was not there a risk... if we're talking about risk rather than actual events, would not a manufacturing defect of this kind create a substantial risk of a total power failure which in turn might create the risk of a navigation hazard?"
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2773.724,2777.755,"I don't think so, with the immediacy, Your Honor, that tort law implicates."
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2806.961,2816.271,"Let's assume there is this kind of a risk, or there is an actual damage to the person or the property so that this so-called precondition is satisfied."
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2819.159,2824.033,"--Your Honor, if there's a tort claim, we're not arguing against it."
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2832.528,2839.198,Do you think if somebody had been hurt by this defective design--
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2839.198,2839.979,Yes.
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2839.979,2843.773,--then you think all of these damages could have been recovered?
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2843.773,2845.539,"Your Honor, that would be for a trial."
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2846.648,2847.335,"Well, I'm just asking you."
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2847.335,2850.272,--As a kind of damage in tort?
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2858.299,2860.565,"What about loss of profits, and things like that?"
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2860.565,2865.625,"It would be extremely difficult, it seems to me, to recover it in court, certainly debatable."
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.625,2873.511,"So, it may not make any difference what kind of an action this is, with respect to the recoverability of some of these damages?"
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2873.511,2875.027,I beg your pardon.
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2875.027,2877.62,It may not make any difference what kind of action it is.
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2878.963,2880.244,Your Honor is quite right.
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2887.71,2888.677,--You just don't want to have to litigate it?
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2888.677,2889.271,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1726,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2889.271,2891.63,That's a very apt and fair comment.
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2891.63,2900.438,"I did want to mention one fact as well that I think is very important, about the tort aspect and the incorporation into admiralty of the majority rule."
1985.84-1726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.29,2958.462,What case is this?
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2958.462,2959.773,"--Santor, S-a-n-t-o-r."
1985.84-1726,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2959.773,2961.57,How long ago was that?
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2961.57,2962.913,It's a fairly ancient case.
1985.84-1726,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2962.913,2965.63,Ancient as I am?
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,2965.63,2968.927,1965.
1985.84-1726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3167.034,3198.911,"What about the fact a big, over the road truck or any other land vehicle has a defective engine and it just stops, no great risk except the driver or the people on it might get cold, but when you have a vessel at sea and the moving power stops, aren't you exposed to a great deal of different and greater hazard, the ship that's wallowing around with no steerage?"
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,3198.911,3207.205,"Your Honor, I think that every case of a claim of tort, one is going to have to look at the facts very closely."
1985.84-1726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3207.205,3208.236,"No, look at those facts."
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,3211.89,3217.014,"Your Honor, I think it depends upon what... first of all, let me immediately say that that's not our case."
1985.84-1726,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3257.435,3261.793,--You say we apply the same rule for ship engines and automobile and truck engines.
1985.84-1726,1,40380,robert_smith,,3263.447,3265.041,I would say the same with airplane engines.
1985.84-1726,2,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,3394.239,3398.315,"Very briefly, sir."
1985.84-1726,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3544.959,3547.615,It sounds to me like you would not follow the land based rule?
1985.84-1726,2,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,3547.615,3553.393,"Land based rule, as to the question of risk, sir?"
1985.84-1726,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3553.393,3554.25,Yes.
1985.84-1726,2,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,3554.25,3556.438,"No, no--"
1985.84-1726,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3556.438,3560.342,That there's some special risk factor in admiralty?
1985.84-1726,2,42589,thomas_e_durkin_jr,,3560.342,3560.545,--No.
1985.84-1726,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3599.78,3601.03,"Thank you, counsel."
