1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,2.797,Mr. Valder.
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,2.797,3.492,"Thank You, Your Honor."
1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,80.636,94.588,"But the speech on the floor of the House that was libelous per se invading the privacy or some person in a very gross way, is there any remedy for that?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,94.588,96.705,"The cases don’t indicate so, Your Honor."
1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,100.235,112.114,[Voice Overlap] interesting on a right of privacy claim and I am assuming now the grossest kind of libel you could imagine on the floor of the House and the speech by a member.
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,112.114,116.851,I suspect that that case would be taken to Court and this Court would be asked.
1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,116.851,119.854,And having to decide that some of them been taken to Court?
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,119.854,132.766,"I believe so Your Honor and the speeches on the floor have been held to be immune under the Speech or Debate Clause. But here as in Gravel, we’re dealing with activity not on the floor."
1972.71-6356,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,179.572,197.459,Can I ask that -- let’s assume that the group of publications had gone -- been in the congressional context or just a newspaper or an author or a magazine and simply gone around pickup the same information from the same sources and had published?
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,201.889,204.286,Their constitutional right to privacy.
1972.71-6356,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,204.286,210.67,"Now, are you claiming are there anything inaccurate about any of the statements?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,210.67,213.079,"Absolutely, Your Honor that they were inaccurate."
1972.71-6356,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,218.158,220.513,Are you saying they were libelous?
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,220.513,223.171,"They are libelous, they are invasions of privacy."
1972.71-6356,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,228.292,231.134,I know but you talk about privacy.
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,241.344,241.692,Right.
1972.71-6356,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,259.185,260.404,I’ll put it to you this way.
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,267.738,269.012,"No, Your Honor no."
1972.71-6356,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,272.853,279.264,Where do you find any constitutional right of privacy unless the statements are false?
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,279.264,281.195,"Well, I believe we could --"
1972.71-6356,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,281.195,289.705,Where do you find that the statements as long as they are true are not protected?
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,289.705,294.82,The common law right of privacy is a private tort.
1972.71-6356,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,298.005,307.417,What would be your answer though to the defendant who treated the First Amendment and said “I am protected in making these statements unless you can show their faults?”
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,307.417,329.171,"I think we are in the law of privacy where even if true there are areas of our lives as citizens where others cannot disrupt or destroy or breach that privacy, you get into the additional sanction of libel and slander if the statements are false."
1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,329.171,358.479,"As you said, you are relying on all the law that would be available to you if the -- if these defendants were private people such as defamation law, common law, statutory law of defamation plus constitutional claims since these defendants are Government, the Federal Government and surely, I don’t suppose the Fourth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment have anything or whatever to do as truth or falsity, do they?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,358.479,359.795,That’s correct Your Honor.
1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,422.202,449.912,"But who would have the same allegations on the same thrust to your complaint I take it if instead of having the invasion of privacy that you claim made up by written reports of the Committee, one of the members had made a speech on the floor of the House saying using all of the same words revealing all of the same information, would you not."
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,449.912,452.9,I believe we would bring that suit Your Honor.
1972.71-6356,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,473.837,488.596,"I take it in the case Mr. Justice White would appeal where it appears in the newspapers, where you’ll be seen in the newspapers, and then even though it’s based on invasion of privacy in that sense."
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,492.042,492.509,"Yes, I see it."
1972.71-6356,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,492.509,493.894,You can see it against newspaper.
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,504.919,505.963,That’s correct.
1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,535.675,543.374,"Well if it wasn’t authorize, then recap for me how it becomes government action -- governmental action."
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,543.374,544.563,Right.
1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,545.072,547.949,Sometimes you say its ultra vires.
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,547.949,559.116,It -- what was done the manner and method of procuring and compiling this information and putting it in a report was totally outside the house rules and the Committee n the District of Columbia.
1972.71-6356,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.534,624.213,Do you alleged that the investigator engaged in a little conduct in the course of gathering it like he entered any private files broke any lots or violate anybody else’s Fourth Amendment right?
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,624.213,628.662,To the extent that we know Your Honor and of course to spend no discovery.
1972.71-6356,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,650.409,654.953,But you don’t allege he engaged in any specific criminal conduct in the course of his investigation?
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,654.953,662.013,We alleged that he engaged than unconstitutional conduct because he participated in a breach of the privacy.
1972.71-6356,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,662.013,664.444,As I understand that but that’s just pre-stating a position?
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,664.444,669.375,"That’s not a criminal statute, I don’t believe."
1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,669.375,679.207,"Well, if the newspaper or there had done precisely the same thing using the same conduct then what would be your position?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,679.207,690.253,"Our position would be that it was a breach of his right -- constitutional right of privacy and common law tort, breach of teacher-pupil privileged all of which would --"
1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,690.253,693.177,Would you direct that against the reporter or the teacher?
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,693.177,702.52,"Against both, the teacher because the teacher violated the rules and the constitution by disclosing information --"
1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,702.52,708.289,You mean the reporter can violate the Constitution by asking questions?
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,708.289,710.334,I think he certainly can.
1972.71-6356,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,731.985,745.727,"Will they cover the reporters if they have to rely on some common law theory, as I understand the Fourth Amendment, it protects the privacy to the extent it does only against governmental action?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,745.727,765.516,"Well, one of the cases which we’ve cited in our brief as I recall was a case by a private citizen who was in an accident and was photographed evidently in some disarray, a lady and she successfully maintained an action for breach of privacy against the newspaper photographer who took her picture in the newspaper who published it."
1972.71-6356,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,765.516,768.787,"But that’s not constitutional Brandeis warrant type, right?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,768.787,773.217,Positive yes.
1972.71-6356,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,839.537,845.202,"Then you say the Congress publishes report, it could be stopped?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,845.202,846.548,We believe it can be.
1972.71-6356,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,848.043,853.061,"But certainly, you don’t have to go that far do you?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,853.061,855.986,"Well, actually we don’t want to report stuck, Your Honor."
1972.71-6356,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,901.371,906.006,Do you say that everything was except the names served a valid legislative purpose?
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,910.699,913.848,If it may and it may not have served a valid legislative purpose.
1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,922.814,929.649,"But Congress isn’t limited by gathering useful information in the process of legislating, is it?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,929.649,932.577,Probably most of the information that get turns out to be not useful.
1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,932.577,941.356,"Well, isn’t that normal process of inquiry whether you are preparing for trial in a lawsuit or preparing to past legislation?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,947.417,948.088,That’s true.
1972.71-6356,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1120.685,1125.606,"You’re talking about the District of Columbia defendants, and not about the congressional defendants."
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1125.606,1127.195,That’s correct.
1972.71-6356,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1135.383,1143.362,"Well, as far as the congressional group, are you asserting claims only against congressional employees not against the Congressman himself?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1143.362,1147.229,"We are asserting claims against the Congressman himself, Your Honor."
1972.71-6356,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1147.229,1154.45,"Even Judge Wright didn’t consider the case as against except the employees, did he?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1154.45,1167.332,I believe Judge Wright’s opinion makes clear that he was so much more concerned about the sweeping grant of authority to committee aides that he took that question of and dealt with it.
1972.71-6356,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1168.729,1177.69,"Well, except this starts -- your concise opinion without reaching the more difficult question while this cause protects members of Congress."
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1183.377,1197.825,Our position is that certainly as to injunctive relief the federal courts have the power in appropriate cases to enjoin a congressional report that would be relief directed against congressmen.
1972.71-6356,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1229.541,1237.84,"But their immunity wouldn’t depend on what the Court of Appeals with this the District of Columbia said about the District of Columbia law of immunity, would it?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1237.84,1243.315,"It would ask to the official immunity doctrine, Your Honor."
1972.71-6356,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1251.299,1253.734,Can you take the Barr versus Matteo type of immunity.
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1270.269,1288.529,"No, it didn’t but in the District of Columbia the courts have in the past 10 years done a tremendous amount in several cases of expansion, contraction and redefining how the Barr doctrine is applied in the District of Columbia."
1972.71-6356,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1288.529,1300.808,"Well then, buy if you’re going to urge that here is governing the congressional definite, you must it urge it on its merits. It seems to me, I mean we’re not bound by what the Court of Appeals says."
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1300.808,1301.786,"No, you’re not."
1972.71-6356,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1359.387,1362.139,Can we preclude it from getting into?
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1362.139,1365.874,"Well, certainly I don’ think you are precluded if you care to."
1972.71-6356,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1367.958,1374.824,"In that way you take the sizes the wrong direction, wouldn’t it?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1374.824,1384.671,"Well, it is our belief that Barr versus Matteo should be applied perhaps throughout the country as it is in the District of Columbia under that line of cases."
1972.71-6356,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1384.809,1388.057,The Barr against Matteo had nothing to do with the District of Columbia.
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1389.152,1389.707,That’s right.
1972.71-6356,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1394.268,1405.839,"Well, on Matteo is as to immunity of federal officials in Alaska, Hawaii, and the other 48 States and the District of Columbia."
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1405.839,1406.378,That’s right.
1972.71-6356,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1406.378,1407.155,Is that right?
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1407.155,1408.673,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-6356,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1409.393,1417.825,"So, I don’t see how we can be bound by an interpretation of Barr-Matteo by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals."
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1419.525,1420.374,"No, Your Honor it is not --"
1972.71-6356,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1420.374,1422.272,It is not binding on me.
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1422.272,1423.501,"If I may, Your Honor."
1972.71-6356,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1475.81,1480.42,"Well, would it be possible for us to agree with you without considering the Carter case?"
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1480.42,1483.212,It would be possible by simply saying that --
1972.71-6356,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1483.212,1484.284,"Well, that’s my only point."
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1489.804,1491.706,"Your Honors, I flashed on my time."
1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1494.563,1495.935,"Very well, Mr. Valder."
1972.71-6356,0,36833,michael_j_valder,,1495.935,1501.229,Thank You.
1972.71-6356,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1501.229,1505.675,Mr. Vinson.
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,2804.128,2807.9,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-6356,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3069.847,3075.487,What it the further most scope of the congressional order to publish?
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,3084.684,3096.032,"The Congress does not and has not exercise then I don’t say it couldn’t if it’s so fit to do so in its wisdom, has not published and printed documents for the purpose of public sale."
1972.71-6356,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.041,3115.162,I just want to know if in this case are you saying that the Congress ordered not only the printing of this report but the report to be available generally to the public?
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,3115.162,3117.339,It did not however --
1972.71-6356,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3117.339,3119.829,And but was it available to the public?
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,3119.829,3131.065,"It was consistent with the act of Congress that says specific document shall be made available and I would not take it would be improper for them to say, yes, it’s available to the public."
1972.71-6356,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3139.169,3145.408,But I still don’t understand that you say that the authorization in this case was a congressional?
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,3145.408,3152.261,It is the customary congressional numbers that go to largely governmental agencies in the Congress itself by statute.
1972.71-6356,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3152.261,3157.314,But you aren’t saying that there is any authority from the Congress in this case to make a report available to the public?
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,3157.314,3157.933,"No, sir."
1972.71-6356,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3186.553,3204.909,"I suppose this Court decided the question of prior restraints and the rule held that it was irrelevant how the information was acquired and what is called the Pentagon Papers case, did we not?"
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,3204.909,3207.094,I would take that’s correct sir.
1972.71-6356,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3237.863,3242.07,"At page 4 to that, I guess it just starts with non-distribution of documents --"
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,3242.07,3242.696,Yes.
1972.71-6356,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3242.696,3256.219,"-- and reports and I noticed that this seems rather limited to the Senate, 150 copies to the Secretary of the Senate, 10 to the House document, not to exceed 500 to the Office of the Clerk of the House is 20, Library of the Congress 10."
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,3256.219,3256.635,That’s correct.
1972.71-6356,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3256.635,3263.294,"Well now, what authority in that statute is of distributing this to the officials to the District Court?"
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,3263.294,3265.656,The question that was asked was could Congress distribute it?
1972.71-6356,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3266.585,3268.596,No my question was did it?
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,3268.596,3269.49,It did not.
1972.71-6356,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3269.49,3270.111,It did not?
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,3274.12,3276.641,"Well, the report was distributed to the District Court."
1972.71-6356,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3282.893,3283.547,But it didn’t.
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,3285.16,3288.529,"So within the depth of the question is, is it distributed? [Voice Overlap]"
1972.71-6356,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3288.529,3289.027,Can you tell us Mr. Cramer?
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,3289.027,3289.923,Yes.
1972.71-6356,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3289.923,3294.751,Once it’s distributed by the House to the District of Columbia and its officials.
1972.71-6356,2,44266,william_c_cramer,,3294.751,3296.129,Not to my knowledge.
1972.71-6356,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3296.129,3299.032,Thank you.
1972.71-6356,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3299.032,3301.245,Thank you Mr. Cramer.
1972.71-6356,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3308.381,3310.491,Would you mind Mr. Sutton before you begin.
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3314.198,3314.707,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6356,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3322.18,3325.662,"You didn’t go to the Library in Congress and get them, did you?"
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3325.662,3326.546,"I don’t believe so, Your Honor."
1972.71-6356,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3326.546,3327.667,"You didn’t buy them, did you?"
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3327.667,3329.413,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-6356,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3514.872,3519.709,"You don’t know how the -- we’ve gotten, do we?"
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3528.536,3538.278,"I believe we do to some extent Your Honor because the report contains a verbatim interviews conducting with many local school officials, many principals and --"
1972.71-6356,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3538.278,3540.292,"But there was no hearing on it, was it?"
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3540.292,3541.769,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-6356,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3542.837,3544.868,"We don’t actually know, do we?"
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3544.868,3545.965,No.
1972.71-6356,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3550.715,3556.07,"You don’t know that principal has turned it over to his superior, do we?"
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3556.07,3559.332,We do in the sense that we know that Congress is the ultimate superior.
1972.71-6356,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3563.968,3578.178,But I’m just emphasizing what Judge Wright said in the dissenting opinion that things like this should have a hearing to find out whether Barr-Matteo applies a lot and the only way to find that is what actually happened.
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3580.406,3585.891,Because it is clear from the record as to what did actually happen.
1972.71-6356,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3607.098,3613.366,What is then the evidence that showed why the principal turned it over?
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3616.101,3622.15,"Well, the principal turned it over because he was called by investigator of the congressional committee to do so."
1972.71-6356,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3622.15,3629.296,"Was hem, as in a congressional investigator or as a policeman or as an individual?"
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3629.296,3630.781,As investigator.
1972.71-6356,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3630.781,3632.514,Where is that in the record?
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3632.514,3641.207,"It’s alleged in the complaint, Your Honor that I think it’s fairly inferable from the complaint and the record that the investigator was acting in the Committee’s behalf."
1972.71-6356,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3641.207,3646.313,"Even if I granted further, my only point is that the hearing would straighten this all out."
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3646.313,3650.568,The hearing certainly would have been better but our position is it does not legally require it.
1972.71-6356,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3728.781,3734.132,Are the District of Columbia Board of Education Employees of Congress?
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3734.132,3737.777,"No, in the technical sense standout Your Honor but in the general sense they are."
1972.71-6356,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3737.777,3743.274,"Well, if I say if they are and they are covered by Gravel."
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3743.274,3745.482,We don’t urge they are covered by Gravel.
1972.71-6356,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3745.482,3747.918,"Well, I just wondered how far you’re going?"
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3747.918,3749.117,"No, we wouldn’t go that far."
1972.71-6356,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3749.117,3749.469,Oh!
1972.71-6356,3,21554,david_p_sutton,,3752.771,3758.728,We would also have the size and even assuming the Civil Rights Act does apply in this case.
1972.71-6356,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3926.911,3929.737,"Thank you, Mr. Sutton."
1972.71-6356,4,36833,michael_j_valder,,3932.005,3936.328,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1972.71-6356,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3959.215,3962.863,You mean the Act applies to congressional (Inaudible)?
1972.71-6356,4,36833,michael_j_valder,,3962.863,3970.059,"If the Freedom of Information Act were applying to this information, I understood that to be the Court’s question."
1972.71-6356,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3975.592,3985.366,I think Mr. Valder for this -- permits the agency to refuse disclosure where names are involved rather than requiring them to refuse disclosure.
1972.71-6356,4,36833,michael_j_valder,,3985.366,3986.529,"Your may be right, Your Honor."
1972.71-6356,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4016.342,4017.459,Where did you get it?
1972.71-6356,4,36833,michael_j_valder,,4017.459,4019.282,Called the Committee.
1972.71-6356,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4020.886,4024.87,Is this one also in the pleadings in the District Court under your motion to dismiss?
1972.71-6356,4,36833,michael_j_valder,,4024.87,4026.449,On the pleading.
1972.71-6356,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4029.68,4038.437,"When you say in your pleading, I mean I presume that would be the most authoritative source for us is to whether there was or was not distribution."
1972.71-6356,4,36833,michael_j_valder,,4038.437,4040.433,I’m not sure of whether it was in the complaint.
1972.71-6356,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4053.067,4060.024,Do you say anything about distribution in your complaint?
1972.71-6356,4,36833,michael_j_valder,,4060.024,4074.443,"Your Honor, I am referred to paragraph 15 in our complaint on information and belief unless we strained defendants will continue to distribute and publish information concerning plaintiffs, their children, and other students, etcetera."
1972.71-6356,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4101.267,4110.689,"May I interrupt you on the -- in paragraph 5 of your complaint said, defendants also caused the report to be distributed to the members of the public."
1972.71-6356,4,36833,michael_j_valder,,4110.689,4111.473,Okay.

1972.71-6356,4,36833,michael_j_valder,,4114.647,4115.388,Thank you.
1972.71-6356,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4268.126,4269.652,The Civil Rights Act of 1871 --
1972.71-6356,4,36833,michael_j_valder,,4269.652,4269.863,Yes.
1972.71-6356,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4269.863,4272.338,-- in fact you mean May 1983?
1972.71-6356,4,36833,michael_j_valder,,4272.338,4290.959,I am sorry it is Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 which incidentally was passed about two months after a Bill creating a territorial government in the District of Columbia that is the reference to the District of Columbia versus Carter Supplemental Memorandum.
1972.71-6356,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4306.803,4315.435,"Well, if this document was in the Library of Congress, wasn’t it available to every newspaper, the one we got?"
1972.71-6356,4,36833,michael_j_valder,,4315.435,4316.557,"It certainly was, Your Honor."
1972.71-6356,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4316.557,4322.694,"Well, is it illegal for it to be delivered to the Library of Congress?"
1972.71-6356,4,36833,michael_j_valder,,4322.694,4325.089,"Your Honor, it is water over the dam."
1972.71-6356,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4347.684,4348.283,Thank You gentleman.
