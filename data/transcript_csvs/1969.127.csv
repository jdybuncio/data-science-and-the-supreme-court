1969.127,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,38.495,"Next case is number 127, Monks against New Jersey."
1969.127,0,15390,anthony_g_armsterdam,,44.383,50.277,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,1756.021,1761.105,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.127,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1980.517,1983.948,And he was a 15-years and four months old?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,1983.948,1984.452,That's right.
1969.127,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1984.452,1986.758,How big was he?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,1986.758,1987.953,"Well, Justice Stewart, I --"
1969.127,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1987.953,1988.596,Does the record ever show them?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,1988.596,1991.166,"I never saw him, I don't know him."
1969.127,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1991.426,1994.943,And it's -- one of the witnesses referred to -- her assailant as a man?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,1994.943,1995.396,Yes.
1969.127,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1995.396,2000.378,"And the petitioner's brief talks about him as a child, what do you know about it?"
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2000.378,2004.048,"Well, I'm sorry I can -- I cannot help you on that sir."
1969.127,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2004.048,2006.78,You mean the old record doesn't show his size?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2006.78,2007.804,Pardon?
1969.127,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2007.804,2011.037,You mean that no reference to his size in the entire record?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2011.037,2017.334,"No, no, there is none sir."
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2078.206,2081.965,"Mr. Kreiger, were his parents there?"
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2083.746,2084.659,"Yes, indeed."
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2084.659,2086.208,When was she notified?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2086.208,2093.985,She was notified on February the 27th or the 28th after the confession have been obtained.
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2093.985,2095.924,Why not before?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2095.924,2103.721,"Well, she was not notified before for reasons I cannot give you, but I have set out --"
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2103.721,2107.606,Don't you feel any duty to give them reason for it?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2107.606,2117.669,"Well, the only explanation sir I can give is this, that there was an estrangement between the juvenile and his parents."
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2118.319,2120.559,Is that a reason for not telling the parent?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2120.559,2134.289,"The juvenile never requested it, never manifested any interest in his parents, in fact he had run away from home, he was sleeping in the cellar of a friend of his and in abandoned cars."
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2134.289,2138.137,"Oh, you said he waved the right to notify his parents?"
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2138.137,2141.534,"I wouldn't put it in legal terms Justice Marshall, but I'm saying --"
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2141.534,2149.981,But don't you feel that the state had an obligation before they questioned this boy for 10 days to notify his parents what they were doing?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2149.981,2155.345,"Well, I would like to first point out that the state did not question him for 10 days."
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2155.345,2157.336,"Well, the state held him for 10 days."
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2157.336,2163.875,"He had been held -- he had been held for the unrelated purse snatching, that was his original detention."
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2163.875,2173.827,"He was held for 10 days without notifying his parents or anyone that knew anything about him, am I correct?"
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2173.827,2175.017,That is true.
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.017,2177.257,Why?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2177.257,2177.544,Why?
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2177.544,2179.232,"You can't give a reason, can you?"
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2179.232,2181.275,"I can't, no I can't, but the record --"
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2181.275,2184.307,But you want us -- you want us to uphold his conviction?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2184.307,2191.688,The record indicates -- the record indicates that this juvenile never manifested an interest.
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2201.443,2205.206,Did you ever tell him he had the right to have his parents?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2205.206,2205.892,"Well, no."
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2205.892,2208.041,Is it in the record?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2208.041,2208.681,The protection --
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2208.681,2209.201,What --
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2209.201,2218.865,-- that the judge Shamick of the juvenile Court have afforded this juvenile by providing for interrogation only in the presence of the probation officer.
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2218.865,2221.812,Did he know that probation officer was there to protect him?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2221.812,2222.838,"Yes sir, he did."
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2222.838,2223.377,How?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2224.29,2230.538,He was told -- he was told by the probation officer that --
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2230.538,2232.211,What page is it?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2232.211,2243.997,Let me see if I can find it sir.
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2243.997,2245.457,"Let me get it later, go ahead."
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2245.457,2247.907,"Yes, I will get it and I will -- I'll supply it to you."
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2247.907,2250.188,Sure.
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2250.188,2272.514,"On February 18th, prosecutor's office, after noting similarity between the purse snatchings for which he had been arrested on the 16th decided to interrogate this juvenile and being in the shelter they applied to the judge of the juvenile court for permission to interrogate him."
1969.127,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2467.951,2471.229,"And that had taken place about a year earlier, hadn't it?"
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2471.229,2472.726,That's right.
1969.127,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2472.726,2477.226,"When this fellow was 14 years old, would that be correct?"
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2477.226,2492.134,"That's right, that's right sir -- boasted to one of his friends that he had committed that assault and he had received something like $30.00 that she had in her purse."
1969.127,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2492.134,2496.463,Were those the people who frequented the candy store?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2496.463,2499.881,"Yes, yes, yes."
1969.127,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2601.398,2603.632,"Incidentally, was he a police officer?"
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2603.632,2604.05,Pardon?
1969.127,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2604.05,2606.77,Was he a police officer?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2606.77,2607.323,"No, he isn't."
1969.127,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2607.323,2608.67,Employed by the police department?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2608.67,2617.94,"No, he is Mr. Arthur who is associated with the Reid Associates who are lie detector operators."
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2728.861,2730.082,When was Hailey --
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2730.082,2730.8,Pardon?
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2730.8,2732.224,When was Hailey decided?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2732.224,2735.416,"Hailey was 48, 1948."
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2735.416,2737.381,"I thought so, I thought it was before 457?"
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2737.381,2778.019,"Yes, but I see and I have stated, there is the only similarity between Hailey and this case is that they were both 15 years of age, because in this case we claim and the record shows unless you disagree with methods that the methods of the police in the interrogation of this juvenile were fair, reasonable, penetrating, and with an attempt to find out whether this young man was involved in this heinous offense of murder."
1969.127,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2934.224,2940.397,What were the circumstances under which the court appointed this probation officer to accompany the petitioner?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2940.397,2952.367,An application was made by the prosecutor's detectives to interrogate this juvenile because he was in custody at the juvenile -- at the children's shelter.
1969.127,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2952.367,2956.519,So that the prosecutor's detectives had to apply to a judge or to a court --
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2956.519,2956.873,"Yes, sir."
1969.127,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2956.873,2957.992,-- for permission --
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2957.992,2958.266,Permission.
1969.127,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2958.266,2962.511,-- to interrogate this juvenile who is in the juvenile center?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2962.511,2971.076,And the court granted permission providing that the probation officer was present at all times during interrogation.
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2972.539,2985.309,Is it correct that he was there for the purpose only to see that the boy was not brow beaten or exhausted in any way?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2985.309,2987.713,"Well, that's true."
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2987.713,2989.392,"Well, that's what the officer said."
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2989.392,2991.132,That's what the officer said.
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2991.132,2993.707,And he wasn't there to advise him of his rights?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,2993.707,2994.635,Precisely.
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2994.635,2997.646,And he wasn't there to aid and comfort him?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3000.651,3003.852,"Well, they didn't beat his brains out Justice Marshall."
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3007.96,3018.223,"I agree with you fully, but my whole point is, this is his testimony that he was only deceived that he wasn't brow beaten."
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3034.287,3039.549,"And he was a probation officer for 15 years, assigned to the --"
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3039.549,3043.278,A degree in pharmacy to advise this fellow of his legal rights?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3043.278,3047.305,But how about his experience as a probation officer and handling the juveniles for 15 years --
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3047.305,3048.552,Do they have any of the --
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3048.552,3052.977,-- which gave him great competence in the understanding of the probation process.
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3052.977,3059.555,But he had no time to tell this boy that you don't have to take that lie detector test?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3059.555,3064.663,"He didn't advise this boy, he was not there as his counsel."
1969.127,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3064.663,3070.857,"If he take -- but didn't you just say he told him that you be good and get this out of your chest and all, you call that counseling?"
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3070.857,3073.595,Tell him to tell them -- to tell the truth.
1969.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3073.595,3075.822,That is not counseling.
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3075.822,3077.308,I don't call that counseling.
1969.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3077.308,3078.62,[Inaudible]
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3078.62,3080.447,I don't call that counsel.
1969.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3080.447,3081.176,What is it?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3081.176,3118.733,"Because gentlemen, if this young man had a lawyer, this juvenile would never have uttered a word and this would have been and remained an unsolved offense because I don't still think that a juvenile should receive the advise or the same kind of advise that a mature person should receive when it comes and bearing in mind his future development."
1969.127,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3202.624,3205.902,What goes on in New Jersey now when they arrest a juvenile?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3205.902,3206.444,I didn't get that.
1969.127,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3206.444,3210.406,What goes on in New Jersey now when they arrest a juvenile?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3212.791,3217.666,"The Miranda, he gets the Miranda warning, he does sir, he does."
1969.127,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3217.666,3218.733,He gets what?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3218.733,3222.685,He gets the warnings required by Miranda.
1969.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3222.685,3226.634,"And he also doesn't testify in the proceeding unless he wants to, does he?"
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3226.634,3227.993,That's true.
1969.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3227.993,3230.187,And that didn't used to be so?
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3230.187,3231.263,That's true sir.
1969.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3231.263,3236.788,"And so, the Gault decided that, didn't it?"
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3238.438,3241.746,"That's true, that's true."
1969.127,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3267.927,3274.641,"Well, I thought you said it was a matter of interrogation that if you tell him he is entitled of counsel now and he said I want one you have to appoint one, wouldn't you?"
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3274.641,3275.591,That's right.
1969.127,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3277.843,3285.552,I see.
1969.127,1,16321,archibald_kreiger,,3285.552,3323.898,"The fact is in our judgment that most of the argument of the petitioner in this case has been what I would choose to describe an inflation of the significance of what are not such serious matters or as the phrase has once been, there has been an abundant resort to labels in this case."
1969.127,2,15390,anthony_g_armsterdam,,3928.875,3940.297,"If I may just advert briefly into the questions the Court ask in the statements of Mr. Kreiger, I have five very short factual matters and I'll get to Mr. Justice Harlan's question's aspect."
1969.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3957.132,3958.871,But he was arrested for them?
1969.127,2,15390,anthony_g_armsterdam,,3958.871,3960.207,"He was arrested for those, that's right."
1969.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3960.207,3961.432,He was taken and then he was detained at this very period?
1969.127,2,15390,anthony_g_armsterdam,,3961.432,3975.225,"He was taken into custody, correct, but as Mr. Kreiger has stated, New Jersey law would leave unclear whether he should be released under that situation and the clear implication here is that he was held because he was being investigated for the Wise and Giambra matters."
1969.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4083.428,4087.601,"And in response to question, the record shows he was five feet eight inches tall."
1969.127,2,15390,anthony_g_armsterdam,,4087.601,4088.623,Pardon me?
1969.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4088.623,4091.956,In response to my question the record shows he was five feet eight inches tall.
1969.127,2,15390,anthony_g_armsterdam,,4091.956,4093.217,I believe that that's right.
