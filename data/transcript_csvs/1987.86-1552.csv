1987.86-1552,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.027,"We'll hear argument now on Number 86-1552, Department of the Navy versus Egan."
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,11.41,15.06,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1552,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,407.662,421.54,Do you suggest that that reading of the statute should go right across the board to any kind of a removal or just to any adverse action?
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,421.54,426.124,--I think it should go to any adverse action.
1987.86-1552,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,426.124,436.101,"Well, does this construction apply to anything but security clearances?"
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,436.101,456.385,I think that the question of the Board's power to review the merits of collateral determinations that lead to adverse actions is a question that the Board is in the process of working out.
1987.86-1552,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,504.828,511.462,Didn't the Board mention its deference to disbarment proceedings and criminal convictions in its opinion?
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,511.462,513.462,"Yes, it did."
1987.86-1552,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,540.132,549.639,How about removal for some kind of wrongdoing or failure to adequately perform in the employing agency?
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,549.639,569.861,"Well, in the event of wrongdoing, the agency is required to persuade the Board by a preponderance of the evidence that the wrongdoing occurred because that is the cause for the removal."
1987.86-1552,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.099,601.793,"What if an agency establishes as a qualification for a particular job, high skill level."
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,620.585,621.806,No.
1987.86-1552,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,626.389,629.38,So what is the law?
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,645.521,648.402,I'm not just relying on the language of the statute.
1987.86-1552,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.473,678.392,"Well, that's not compelled by statute."
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,684.147,690.032,"Well, my words were, it is the most plausible application of the statute to this case."
1987.86-1552,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,690.032,695.665,Because of the distinctive characteristics of what the determination was in this case.
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,695.665,696.476,"All right, yes."
1987.86-1552,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,756.186,767.435,"Before you get into that, as to the first point which you just went off of, you said prior to the new legislation, the Civil Service Commission hadn't reviewed it."
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,792.283,793.755,I think that's right.
1987.86-1552,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.978,822.483,"There were court decisions that had made this kind of an inquiry before the Civil Service Reform Act was passed, weren't there?"
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,828.718,853.955,"Actually, the D.C. Circuit case, the Hoska case came up after the Civil Service Reform Act was passed, and in that case, after an MSPB presiding official affirmed the agency's determination and there was no petition to the full Board, the D.C. Circuit in the Hoska case reviewed that determination and reversed it on the merits."
1987.86-1552,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.173,871.049,You're aware of no pre-CSRA court decisions that did effectively what the MSPB was doing here?
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,871.049,876.422,"That's right, not in the context of a government employee."
1987.86-1552,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1003.756,1009.359,"Mr. Cohen, can I just ask one kind of general question."
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1020.948,1022.388,I don't think so.
1987.86-1552,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.388,1022.939,Okay.
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1022.939,1034.356,"The security clearance process is not an attempt to judge an individual's past conduct, but to predict his future behavior."
1987.86-1552,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.942,1124.417,"Of course, construing 1712 and 1713 as the Court of Appeals said wouldn't really keep the agency from insulating security cancellations from judicial review."
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1128.44,1134.394,They could proceed under 5 U.S.C. 7532.
1987.86-1552,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.394,1134.594,Right.
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1134.594,1140.239,And the Court of Appeals based its decision here in part on the existence of that section.
1987.86-1552,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.239,1149.895,"But my question is, you'll admit the agency's interests could be protected if they proceeded under that section?"
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1149.895,1151.427,If they did proceed under that section.
1987.86-1552,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1275.489,1287.547,"Why did the agency proceed under 1712 and 13 rather than 1732 in this case, or why would it in other cases like this?"
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1287.547,1291.2,"Well, they could have been invoked."
1987.86-1552,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.547,1349.999,"Or later, when there was."
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1349.999,1352.341,--Yes.
1987.86-1552,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.595,1402.565,What does the employee lose if the government chooses to move under 7532 rather than 7513 or whatever?
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1402.565,1407.84,He loses his job effectively.
1987.86-1552,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1467.361,1474.915,"But apart from that, apart from its affect on the employee, it would preserve the government's concerns, entirely?"
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1482.922,1483.222,It would.
1987.86-1552,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.767,1535.88,"Isn't there another difference, too."
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1545.627,1554.011,--I think the Court assumed in Coal v. Young that there is no judicial review and I think that would be our position.
1987.86-1552,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1556.074,1556.984,On 7532.
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1556.984,1558.036,On 7532.
1987.86-1552,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.705,1568.293,So your position is there's no judicial review of the merits of the security removal under 1713?
1987.86-1552,0,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1568.293,1569.783,That's right.
1987.86-1552,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1585.554,1587.075,"Very well, Mr. Cohen."
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,1588.967,1594.978,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1987.86-1552,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.663,1882.805,It isn't just that.
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,1907.623,1928.398,"Justice Scalia, another explanation of it could mean that the Congress in the legislative history under 7532 recognized that there might be situations where an employee would have to be removed and taken out of the government, not because of any fault of his own whatsoever."
1987.86-1552,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.261,1953.967,Denial of a security clearance is no more misconduct than what you just described.
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,1957.988,1958.519,That's right.
1987.86-1552,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2029.687,2037.431,"Well, he is given it by the agency as the agency's regulations now exist."
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2046.737,2048.63,"Well, the wording's the same."
1987.86-1552,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.63,2053.034,"You're saying the agency isn't compelled to give him a hearing, it's a matter of agency grace?"
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2053.034,2053.245,No.
1987.86-1552,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2090.773,2093.803,"Yes, but there is a hearing before the Department of the Navy."
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2093.803,2096.784,Not under 7513.
1987.86-1552,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2096.784,2100.737,"It doesn't require it, but didn't they offer your client a hearing?"
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2100.737,2101.719,They did.
1987.86-1552,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2101.719,2108.671,"Well, and it was before the Agency which is exactly what 7532 would have given you a right to have."
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2108.671,2117.247,"No, they didn't offer him a hearing in the revocation or the denial process of the security clearance."
1987.86-1552,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.247,2119.65,Didn't they give him a statement of reasons?
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2119.65,2121.231,Statement of reasons.
1987.86-1552,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2121.231,2125.655,An opportunity to question any of the facts that they set forth?
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2125.655,2128.249,You get a written statement of reasons.
1987.86-1552,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2142.698,2144.55,Even if you question the facts?
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2144.55,2151.115,Even... there is no provision that I'm aware of that he could command a hearing.
1987.86-1552,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2156.43,2158.421,And here he didn't ask for one.
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2158.811,2160.634,He did not ask for one.
1987.86-1552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2160.634,2168.518,"Under 7532 after suspension, he can get a hearing?"
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2168.518,2171.35,After suspension and prior to removal.
1987.86-1552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.35,2172.451,"Right, he can get a hearing."
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2172.451,2173.863,A pre-termination hearing.
1987.86-1552,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2251.076,2258.482,"How about a case where the only requirement is that he be admitted to the bar, and they show that he's been disbarred."
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2263.104,2264.166,Absolutely not.
1987.86-1552,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.91,2297.019,"Well, when why should you treat the Navy Department's security clearance system as so totally different from the State requirements for admission and remaining in the Bar?"
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2305.276,2307.297,"Well, I think--"
1987.86-1552,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2307.297,2308.308,He didn't ask for a hearing.
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2308.308,2312.87,"--Let me answer the first question, first."
1987.86-1552,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.433,2367.639,"But supposing that a particular job in the Navy calls for someone of field grade say of Lieutenant Commander, and this fellow was a Lieutenant Commander but he's reduced in rank to a lieutenant, and therefore the civilian side of the Navy says, well, you no longer have the qualification to fill this job."
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2372.384,2373.793,"No, I absolutely do not."
1987.86-1552,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2373.793,2382.849,"Well, there are some kinds of decisions, then... collateral, as you call them... that the Merit System Protection Board shouldn't review?"
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2382.849,2383.35,That's true.
1987.86-1552,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2383.35,2386.312,And why should the denial of a security clearance be one of them?
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2386.312,2389.254,Because it's one and the same person that's doing the removal.
1987.86-1552,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2397.53,2403.054,Why is that different from the fellow who's demoted from Lieutenant Commander to Lieutenant?
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2405.365,2410.598,"Well, because the Navy does have military on one side and civilian on the other."
1987.86-1552,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2411.64,2413.95,The Secretary of the Navy is head of them both.
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2413.95,2419.175,--the security clearance is revoked by the naval civilian personnel command.
1987.86-1552,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2426.349,2433.535,All they have to do is put this security clearance call in another division of the Navy and everything would be fine.
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2435.625,2438.696,"Well, it is in another division at this time."
1987.86-1552,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2440.489,2440.647,"Well, why isn't that enough."
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2445.774,2455.8,"--Well, the interest that's being protected when you're talking about a military decision is the same interest that you want to protect to make sure that everybody in the platoon is marching in the same direction."
1987.86-1552,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.226,2468.97,Let me ask you something about the statutory structure here.
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2506.175,2508.027,"Substantial evidence, right."
1987.86-1552,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2508.027,2508.188,Right.
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2515.061,2518.023,"Well, the Congress wanted to give the ability to fire people."
1987.86-1552,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.023,2522.677,"That's right, and it's hard to prove inadequate performance, so they said substantial evidence will do there."
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2565.947,2574.633,"I think it should be removed even a step further, and under Chapter 7532, because that's the same test."
1987.86-1552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.638,2629.622,"Yes, but that assumes the security decision is subject to review."
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2629.622,2638.068,"Well, Justice Scalia, when he was a Judge, I believe, wrote an opinion about that in the D.C. Circuit."
1987.86-1552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.068,2639.457,He's still a Judge.
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2643.541,2645.602,They tell us we're supposed to call you justices.
1987.86-1552,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2756.876,2766.563,"Mr. Nold, I'm trying to think if what Congress would have done to be sure that the MSPB would handle this thing the way that you're saying they expected it to."
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2813.901,2821.334,"Well, certainly under the FOIA, the courts even now give a great deal of due deference to--"
1987.86-1552,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2821.334,2823.357,That's because the statute was changed.
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2848.046,2853.46,--I want the MSPB to look into the reasons that were advanced for the revocation of that clearance.
1987.86-1552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2873.734,2894.228,"I suppose then you would rather have the Navy proceed under 1713, if it's construed as you would have it, than under 1732, because you would have no judicial review under 1732 but you would have an agency hearing."
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2894.228,2899.1,The Navy takes the position that no judicial review would be available.
1987.86-1552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2905.764,2918.243,"In your mind, why do you think the Navy proceeded under 1713 rather than 1732, to avoid an agency hearing of the kind that he would get in 1732?"
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2918.243,2924.047,"Well, I think the agency was thinking, well, the guy doesn't have a clearance."
1987.86-1552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.698,2942.292,You don't think they made a mistake about what 1713 means?
1987.86-1552,1,45734,william_j_nold,,2942.292,2943.372,"Well, maybe they did."
