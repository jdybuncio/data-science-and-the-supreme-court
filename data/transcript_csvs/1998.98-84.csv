1998.98-84,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.527,"We'll hear argument now in No. 98-84, National Collegiate Athletic Association v. R.M. Smith."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,8.668,11.34,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-84,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,63.563,69.076,But we've also said that it can be... it can indirectly be a recipient.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,69.076,72.158,"In the Grove City case, Your Honor, but the test is the same."
1998.98-84,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,120.34,131.558,"Does Paralyzed Veterans modify the regulation that's involved in this case, 34 C.F.R.... what 106.h?"
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,131.558,133.641,106.2(h).
1998.98-84,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,155.615,157.705,"Well, it said directly or through another recipient."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,157.705,165.232,"Directly or through, a reference to the holding in Grove City that you can be an indirect recipient."
1998.98-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,176.1,177.641,How do you smuggle in intended recipient?
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,184.137,190.011,"--Well, Grove City is the case that I'm... I'm thinking of, and there what the Court... the checks were made out to the students."
1998.98-84,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.468,211.405,"Well, if we didn't have Paralyzed Veterans or Grove... the Grove case, would you read the regulation naturally your way so that there has to be an intent?"
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,211.405,212.985,"Well, I think--"
1998.98-84,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,212.985,216.038,I don't see where you get that from the face of the regulation if we talk just about that.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,218.422,219.03,--Yes.
1998.98-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,236.103,236.513,I don't understand that.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,247.362,248.642,"Well, what the... what the Court--"
1998.98-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,248.642,253.065,Does the word recipient has... have some... some connotation of intent in it?
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,253.065,255.828,"--Well, you have to... you'd be the recipient of the Federal grant."
1998.98-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.155,266.265,Suppose I'm giving... I'm given money.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,283.449,297.737,"The key is whether there is a Spending Clause contract between the recipient and the Federal Government whereby the recipient agrees to accept the conditions, the prohibitions on discrimination, in exchange for accepting the Federal funds."
1998.98-84,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,297.737,299.708,"Well, was there a contract in Grove City?"
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,299.708,301.49,"There was, yes."
1998.98-84,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,301.49,302.359,With the institution?
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,302.359,302.78,With the institution.
1998.98-84,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,304.061,308.114,I thought it was simply the... I thought... I guess I stand corrected.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,321.305,328.548,What the... what was the issue in the case was whether the university had to execute the... the contract that the Government gave it.
1998.98-84,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,341.537,345.2,--It's basically the intent in appropriating the money that's the criterion.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,345.2,360.601,"--In the underlying grant statute, as the Court said in Paralyzed Veterans, and in all of the briefs filed on the respondent's side of this case, you will not find analysis of an underlying grant statute that says, this is to extend financial assistance to the NCAA."
1998.98-84,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,372.648,381.384,"Mr. Roberts, what there is is a significant difference between the relationship of the airport in Paralyzed Veterans."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,407.27,414.997,"--The... the NCAA is an association of its members, and most of its members, as Your Honor points out, do receive Federal financial assistance."
1998.98-84,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,463.31,472.614,"Suppose... suppose you had a Federal program that grants monies to colleges and for... for a specific program, the study of science in a particular area."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,484.421,488.536,"--No, because again that's the... the lesson of Paralyzed Veterans."
1998.98-84,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,512.16,526.971,"Mr. Roberts, there is some argument on the other side that, well, all this doesn't matter anyway because the NCAA gets money from the National Youth Sports Program fund as a direct recipient."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,531.385,531.585,It was--
1998.98-84,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,531.585,537.481,And is that... is that a federally constituted fund?
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,537.481,550.209,"--The issue of the National Youth Sports Program was not addressed either by the district court or by the Third Circuit below, and I don't think that this Court should address it, at least not in the... in the first instance."
1998.98-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.573,558.033,What do you mean it wasn't raised?
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,559.735,561.537,The only evidence--
1998.98-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.537,561.758,--in the record?
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,561.758,571.816,--The only evidence in the record concerning the National Youth Sports Program was an affidavit filed by an NCAA officer that establishes that it's a separate Missouri corporation.
1998.98-84,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,581.433,592.689,"The evidence was also that it was once the NCAA directly and then it was set up as a separate fund, but when the program was new, the money went directly to the NCAA, didn't it?"
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,592.689,606.748,"Yes, and then... then a separate corporation was established to administer the grant, not the NCAA, which makes perfect sense because what the National Youth Sports Program does is not... doesn't concern intercollegiate athletics."
1998.98-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,611.533,615.905,Was there evidence that this organization does receive Federal... Federal funding?
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,615.905,619.668,"The National Youth Sports Program receives Federal funding, yes."
1998.98-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.668,619.878,I know it does.
1998.98-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.93,623.371,Yes.
1998.98-84,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,623.371,625.504,--There was evidence in the record.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,625.504,628.548,"In... yes, I believe in the affidavit they explained that this was a Federal funding recipient."
1998.98-84,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,635.091,638.784,"Anyway, that was not explored below."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,638.784,647.199,"It was never addressed by either court below, and the fact that it wasn't has led to some confusion as to exactly what the claim is."
1998.98-84,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,681.685,690.339,"Well, there's a... more of a question of the separateness of the two when it's just the NCAA and the NYSP than when you have--"
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,690.339,692.732,And those claims--
1998.98-84,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,692.732,693.043,--hundreds of colleges and universities.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,693.043,698.937,"--And those... as I say, those claims have never been tested in either court below because they weren't raised."
1998.98-84,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,698.937,715.117,And the... and the court below didn't test either the theory that there was a joint venture among the colleges and universities to... to confer on the NCAA the authority for operating the schools' intercollegiate programs.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,715.117,722.781,"Well, the Third Circuit referred to the NCAA as something of a surrogate for the schools in... in this regard."
1998.98-84,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,760.768,762.778,"Mr. Roberts, there's one aspect of this case."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,767.082,769.484,"--It is tax exempt, yes."
1998.98-84,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,770.732,787.795,"Well, my question is... is whether, independent of title IX... under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment and the Bob Jones decision, isn't the NCAA under an obligation not to discriminate in order to retain its tax exempt status?"
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,787.795,803.396,"--Oh, well, first of all, it's important to appreciate the NCAA firmly endorses and embraces the principles of title IX, believes it does not violate that in any way, and conducts its activities to promote gender equity."
1998.98-84,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,823.341,826.283,But here it was just title... that title IX was the only--
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,826.283,829.165,--Title IX was the only... the only issue that the Third Circuit addressed--
1998.98-84,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,829.165,839.013,--And the allegation is that somehow the waivers were granted on a... on the basis of gender discrimination?
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,839.013,840.002,"--Well, the--"
1998.98-84,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,840.002,842.485,Is that... is that the nub of the allegation?
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,842.485,854.491,"--The allegation is that waivers were given disproportionately to one gender as opposed to another, which we of course dispute on the merits, but the merits are not before the Court because the NCAA is not a Federal funding recipient."
1998.98-84,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,910.901,912.332,I can understand--
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,928.974,932.717,"Well, first of all, it shouldn't make a difference what the... what type of rule it is."
1998.98-84,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,934.009,938.802,"Well, except there was a rule that on its face said only women... only men can play volleyball or something like that."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,953.791,959.206,"--Well, first of all, whether the NCAA is covered to not shouldn't depend on what type of rule it is."
1998.98-84,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1014.625,1018.137,Was that theory the one relied on by the Third Circuit?
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1018.137,1019.918,"--No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1998.98-84,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1101.74,1116.049,"To specify the case I'm thinking of, imagine a university that has lots of different rules, teaching rules, tenure rules, curriculum rules, dozens of them, many of which they think are important."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1137.023,1138.776,It cannot be sued unless--
1998.98-84,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1138.776,1140.526,But... but how... but there is a remedy nonetheless.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1141.577,1142.319,--Of course.
1998.98-84,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1142.319,1155.976,"And in any case in which you could have sued the university, had the modern languages association not been in existence, but the university would have done that, you still can sue them."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1161.651,1165.074,Just... just what HEW said when it issued its regulations.
1998.98-84,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1172.049,1173.601,All right.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1187.831,1197.697,"Whoever is implementing the... the discrimination and is the recipient, in your hypothetical the colleges and universities, can be sued for that discrimination."
1998.98-84,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1202.449,1203.08,And then policing them.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1203.08,1209.685,"--Unless it is itself a recipient of Federal financial assistance, it's not covered by title IX."
1998.98-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1210.874,1215.149,I don't quite see how the university gets... gets stuck here.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1233.321,1234.884,"--Well, if the university is--"
1998.98-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.884,1244.23,The only thing that makes the waiver... the denial of the waiver bad is that this other organization has granted waivers in other universities in other contexts.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1247.553,1261.169,--Because the university is the entity that is operating the covered program or activity and the fact that it may be... is complying with a discriminatory rule is no defense and the fact that it is complying with... and applying a rule--
1998.98-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.169,1271.808,"But it hasn't done anything except deny a waiver under circumstances that are totally reasonable, and it... it hasn't granted any waivers to any of its students under any of its programs."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1277.983,1281.335,"--Well, and it's just an evidentiary question to know that."
1998.98-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1291.132,1294.225,But the university is not applying the rule in a discriminatory manner.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1298.167,1306.572,"By not... if everyone else is granting waivers and this is something the university knows, its decision not to grant a waiver would be applying the rule in a discriminatory manner."
1998.98-84,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1311.986,1312.517,But... no.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1314.149,1324.255,--I was just going to say the fact that it may be easier to get the information from one entity as opposed to another doesn't mean that title IX coverage extends to an entity that has not accepted Federal funds.
1998.98-84,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1324.255,1338.573,"I was going to say, isn't the theory, though... as Justice Scalia's question points out, the theory is not merely, I guess, that the university has... has sort of voluntarily ceded authority to administer the rule."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1355.008,1368.085,"Well, the university is covered by... if it makes a decision that we're going to apply the rules of the XYZ organization and the XYZ organization is known to always apply discriminatory rules, it can't insulate itself from that."
1998.98-84,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1372.399,1379.533,"Right, but when... when it does that, it's doing something more than saying we will cede the decision to apply our rules to this other body."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1386.66,1391.653,But... but... but the important thing is that the university retains control over the ultimate decision.
1998.98-84,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1396.778,1399.899,It does so because it can always defy the organization.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1399.899,1401.059,Yes.
1998.98-84,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1401.059,1405.383,"But until it defies it, it in effect is placing itself in a different regime."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1405.383,1412.366,"Yes, and... and it's no defense to whatever discrimination is alleged to say, well, we're just following somebody else's rule."
1998.98-84,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1412.366,1417.09,It sounds like it would produce a bigger mess for these organizations than if you sued them directly.
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1422.406,1431.122,"Well, and what tends... tends to happen is exactly what HEW said should happen back in 1975, which is you or the... you're covered."
1998.98-84,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1438.047,1446.502,"Are we supposed to reach this argument in your view in this case, this... this issue of ceding authority and that they're covered because it's the ceding of authority, et cetera?"
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1446.502,1454.838,"Well, I don't think it's necessary to reach it to reverse the Third Circuit's decision because that was based on the payment of dues."
1998.98-84,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1454.838,1455.058,"No, no, no."
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1456.861,1475.881,"But... but if the Court reaches it, it seems to me that it ought to be clear that this is a departure from what has been the unifying thread in this Court's title IX decisions, which is that coverage is limited to a recipient, not to someone who has ceded authority, effective control, something like that, but the recipient itself."
1998.98-84,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1475.881,1484.747,"Mr. Roberts, apart from that... that rather glancing statement that... that you quoted from the Third Circuit opinion, was this issue really explored in front of the Third Circuit?"
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1484.747,1487.549,"No, not the effective control or ceded authority."
1998.98-84,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1487.549,1496.274,"Mr. Roberts, what do you think we should do with the case if we agree with you that the Third Circuit reasoning was wrong, but we're not sure about whether they should have been allowed to file an amended complaint?"
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1496.274,1509.434,"Well, in that case, Your Honor, I think the decision... judgment should be reversed and the case should be remanded for further proceedings, including to allow the Third Circuit in the first instance to decide which arguments have been preserved, which arguments have been waived."
1998.98-84,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1509.434,1513.886,Did you argue before the Third Circuit that the amendment to the pleading was inadequate?
1998.98-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1513.886,1527.586,"Well, the amendment to the pleading was... was really beside the point because the district court, at page 31a of the petition appendix, treated the claim as if it had been made, that the NCAA was an indirect recipient."
1998.98-84,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1545.007,1546.677,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
1998.98-84,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1548.179,1553.214,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-84,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1617.225,1618.487,Was the pro se litigant a lawyer?
1998.98-84,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1618.487,1620.519,"At the time of the complaint, no, Your Honor."
1998.98-84,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1621.11,1622.171,She'd been to law school?
1998.98-84,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1622.171,1623.811,She was in law school at the time.
1998.98-84,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1647.869,1649.699,Did the court of appeals consider it?
1998.98-84,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1649.699,1651.472,I don't know whether it considered it.
1998.98-84,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.273,1692.341,"Yes, but our practice is that we... we simply don't deal with issues that haven't been dealt with by the court of appeals, as you know from recent experience."
1998.98-84,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1692.341,1694.211,"--As I know all too well, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-84,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.859,1736.091,Is it clear--
1998.98-84,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1736.091,1736.501,--it's preserved.
1998.98-84,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1736.501,1753.795,"--Is it clear or is it sort of unclear from the record whether the theory of coverage under the proposed amendment of the complaint is sort of a veil-piercing theory that a subsidiary should be treated like the parent, or on the other hand, that it's a theory similar to the one of the Third Circuit here that they manage the program... or they control the program--"
1998.98-84,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1753.795,1756.086,It is not clear from the complaint--
1998.98-84,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1756.086,1756.266,--It is not.
1998.98-84,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1756.266,1758.977,"--exactly which way, but I think it could be read, frankly, to embrace both--"
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2688.468,2702.928,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-84,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2825.2,2837.377,"But, Mr. Kneedler, it is true, isn't it, I think that the briefs have adequately argued out the question whether the NC... the association's control over the program is sufficient to subject it to liability."
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2837.377,2838.018,--Yes.
1998.98-84,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2847.006,2848.488,"Well, I understand we don't have to."
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2848.488,2848.718,--Right.
1998.98-84,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2848.718,2849.967,But don't you think we should?
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2849.967,2852.488,"Well, I think it might be... the--"
1998.98-84,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2852.488,2854.311,"I mean, that's really the issue in the case right now."
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2854.311,2865.288,"--Well, the... the... the only legal issue in the case would be are... is it... is there a categorical rule that can a non-recipient never be held liable under title IX."
1998.98-84,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2885.472,2888.954,Do we have record... do we have anything in the record that would answer that question?
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2906.118,2909.127,--I... not definitively because--
1998.98-84,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2909.127,2911.451,Then I guess--
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2911.451,2912.182,--the member institutions--
1998.98-84,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2912.182,2914.432,--that would go to the question of what... what degree of control there was.
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2914.432,2914.593,--Right.
1998.98-84,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2941.131,2943.632,"Well, except... may I just ask one?"
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2979.285,2979.495,--Right.
1998.98-84,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2984.258,3002.7,"Before you do that, I don't agree with it, and... and explain to me how knowing the facts which establish the ceding of control will help us decide the question whether the ceding of control violates title IX or not."
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3002.7,3003.962,"--Well, I... I think knowing--"
1998.98-84,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.962,3006.433,"I mean, all of these facts to go to whether in fact control has been ceded."
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3008.466,3013.538,"--Well, I think... I think knowing exactly what that means, that's descriptive, but knowing exactly how that operates--"
1998.98-84,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3013.538,3015.41,What it means is that total control has been ceded.
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3016.782,3019.823,"--Well, it... looked at in that way--"
1998.98-84,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.823,3023.776,I really don't see how we... how we need more facts to decide that... that quite clear question of law.
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3023.776,3024.926,"--Well, there... there are two questions here."
1998.98-84,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3042.75,3045.111,"Well, I mean, it would depend on whether you address it what your answer is."
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3052.037,3052.267,Right.
1998.98-84,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.505,3062.786,Exactly.
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3063.747,3063.937,--Right.
1998.98-84,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3089.924,3095.888,"Well, but that... that produces difficulties of its own, Mr. Kneedler, since this is a Spending Clause program."
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3109.178,3122.405,"--Well, it... I think in this... in this case in particular it does not because what section 901 says is that there shall be no discrimination in a program receiving Federal assistance, not a program operated by a recipient, but a program that receives Federal financial assistance."
1998.98-84,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3159.48,3169.246,"It seems to me, Mr. Kneedler, no... no total answer to the point the Chief Justice was making to the point that the rule you urge will create confusion."
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3183.257,3196.494,"Well, I... our... our position here is solely where the... where, in effect, the board of trustees, which would otherwise have final decision making authority for the recipient, turns that final decision making authority over to what is, in effect, a superior governing authority."
1998.98-84,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3196.494,3203.139,"But if... if you're right that that would impose liability on the superior governing authority, would the school itself still be liable?"
1998.98-84,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3203.139,3207.862,"Yes, and under the title IX regulations, that makes that clear."
1998.98-84,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3285.186,3285.765,Thank you.
1998.98-84,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3288.657,3290.129,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1998.98-84,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3358.474,3380.688,"But, Mr. Roberts, given the pro se litigant, given the large discretion that the district judge has on complaint amendments, should we be the one to decide whether the amendment of the complaint is too late and given cases like Conley against Gibson where this Court has said... instructed lower courts, be generous to pro se litigants as far as amendment is concerned?"
1998.98-84,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3380.688,3382.521,--But they have to allege facts.
1998.98-84,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3386.875,3387.055,"Well, I don't know."
1998.98-84,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3397.243,3405.807,"--And what happened is the district court said on this motion to dismiss, we have to test and see what the standards are to establish that someone is an indirect recipient."
1998.98-84,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3408.179,3410.41,You could ask for a more definite statement.
1998.98-84,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3423.509,3425.611,"--Well, and she was afforded that opportunity."
1998.98-84,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3436.21,3444.153,"Mr. Roberts, may I ask you what your view is on the question whether we should decide the delegation of a control over a program issue?"
1998.98-84,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3444.153,3448.888,I think the reason the Third Circuit is wrong is because the NCAA is not a recipient.
1998.98-84,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3453.991,3458.132,"My... my... the question is whether you think we ought to decide this other theory, you know--"
1998.98-84,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3458.132,3468.069,I think the Court should decide the question whether having so-called effective control or ceded authority is enough to subject you to coverage under title IX when you're not a recipient.
1998.98-84,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3468.069,3469.331,--How do we get that in the question?
1998.98-84,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3483.421,3490.695,"Well, because the reason the dues are not sufficient is because you have to be a recipient which was the argument we raised, and their answer was, no, you don't."
1998.98-84,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3491.306,3491.817,That's the end of that.
1998.98-84,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3496.14,3496.561,--Thank you.
1998.98-84,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3496.561,3497.494,The case is submitted.
