1966.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.202,"Number 13, Edward J. Garrity et al., appellants versus New Jersey."
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,13.216,17.445,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.859,306.532,"That warning that you refer to presumably emphasize there's an accurate statement of the Jersey law, wasn't it in the statute?"
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,306.532,315.329,"It was an accurate statement of the law insofar as it went and as far as the statute was concerned, yes."
1966.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1213.773,1222.657,"Mr. O'Connor, is it all in conflict with previous position, a decision charged a little earlier?"
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1240.783,1244.777,The threat -- the warning referred to the statute.
1966.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1252.287,1262.79,I understand that what your legal point is the result of the -- what point are you submitting to us is the result of that -- and the petitioners were mislead?
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1262.79,1268.93,"Well, I'm saying that the investigating officer attempted to mislead."
1966.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1279.381,1288.644,The first part was that he was intimidating by calling their attention to the warning to the dismissal statute.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1288.644,1290.851,There's no question about the intimidation.
1966.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1295.381,1303.866,You're not making a point that they were -- that the statute we should reverse here because the witnesses were --
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1303.866,1303.927,Mislead?
1966.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1303.927,1304.642,-- incriminating?
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1304.642,1306.092,"No, no I just called that --"
1966.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1306.092,1310.074,Or mislead which is -- that is your point?
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1316.558,1318.71,Because of the threat.
1966.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1340.434,1348.836,There's a fact that the statute existed some statute was mentioned to petitioners like any difference.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1350.282,1353.898,I think that it just embellishes the threat.
1966.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1353.898,1357.511,That is the very -- what you're doing is to attack the very existence of the statute.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1357.511,1358.079,That's right.
1966.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1358.079,1360.182,You're saying that the very existence of the statute --
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1360.182,1361.961,"It's coercive, it's compulsive."
1966.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1361.961,1362.972,Coercion.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1362.972,1367.084,The mere fact that it's on book of every public employee of the State of New Jersey is under this --
1966.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1367.084,1373.252,"Well, what actually happened here is that the petitioners did testify."
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1373.252,1374.17,They did testify.
1966.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1374.17,1376.041,And they were not fired.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1376.041,1377.188,They were not fired.
1966.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1392.579,1399.011,"Well, then you're saying that appears through several layers here, don't we in causation."
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1419.604,1424.234,"Well, the defendants had no choice Your Honor."
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1563.313,1566.992,But do you really care whether the statute is involved here or not?
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1566.992,1567.793,I beg your pardon.
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1567.793,1570.972,Do you really care whether the statute is involved here or not?
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1570.972,1575.225,"Well, I think the statute is very much involved."
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.225,1579.689,I know you think but why do you care whether it is or not?
1966.13,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1579.689,1581.942,Not in here.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1581.942,1584.596,"Well, I think so, yes."
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1588.912,1594.405,I know but the only reason you care about that is you want the case here and you want to decide it.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1598.244,1600.571,"No, I think this Court -- if this Court has treated --"
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1600.571,1605.664,"I mean the statute doesn't add anything to the warning, does it?"
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1605.664,1609.095,"But it's the use of the statute, it's the use of the statute --"
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1609.095,1625.928,"Let's assume there was no statute at all and the same thing happen, assuming no statute, there was no reference to -- assume no New Jersey statute on the question of at all, the district attorney just called the police officer, he'd be fired if he didn't answer."
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1625.928,1627.955,Then you say and go to the voluntariness of state?
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1627.955,1628.046,Yes.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1630.47,1645.635,"In essence, it is but the removal of the statute -- I mean, this statute has been before the Court in enormous occasions and this to our knowledge is a first time it's been used to extract statement and statements were given."
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.635,1652.309,"Yes, I know but it doesn't add anything to what to the district attorney's statement."
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1655.07,1659.528,"Well, that the investigating officer wouldn't have the statute to rely on to compel him to testify."
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.528,1661.511,It relied on it.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1661.511,1665.414,"Well, he didn't call it by name but he referred to it specifically."
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1668.735,1671.053,"Well, a New Jersey Supreme Court can testify."
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1671.053,1674.151,"Well, that's what I say to New Jersey Supreme Court avoided."
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1681.25,1682.006,"Well, I'll put it this way --"
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1682.006,1684.648,But this high duty doesn't -- we don't reach that here.
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.648,1693.604,"I'll put it this way, the reversal in this case doesn't depend on our finding of the New Jersey statute was involved and was upheld."
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1693.604,1698.832,I think it can be argued that way but I do think that statute is very much involved.
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.11,1707.943,I think its (Voice Overlap) if you would be willing to say that if the statute doesn't -- we don't think the statute is involved which you referred.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1707.943,1710.389,"If you don't think the statute is involved should affirm, no."
1966.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1750.995,1783.614,"Well, would you agree within to this extent that your position would be if there was no statute that the fact that this warning was given by the Attorney General to the effect that if he didn't testify there might be a proceeding against him so far as his job is concerned and he gave it because of that threat that you would still be entitled to --"
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1783.614,1799.301,"Well, this -- Mr. Chief Justice, this goes to the long line of cases involving police officers and removal of office by reason of unfitness for duty or disobedience and subordination or something."
1966.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1803.262,1805.21,"Yes, that's fine."
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1805.21,1827.328,"And that's why I say that the statute can't be isolated from the warning because of mere presence of the statute on the statute but was a coercion and compulsion which these police officers were subjected to if the statute wasn't there, sure, they take it to their chance before a trial board maybe."
1966.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1849.674,1850.57,Yes.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1850.57,1856.651,This was the point where they could take their chances for a trial board or something like that.
1966.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1856.651,1875.952,"Well, let me ask you this, do you concede that if there wasn't the statute and this same warning had been given and he had testified and the other things had resulted that you would lose here?"
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1875.952,1883.552,I can only speculate as to what would've happen at the time and my speculation would be that they wouldn't have given the statements.
1966.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1889.395,1889.866,Yes.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,1889.866,1907.515,"And if that statute was not on the books and this threat of the loss of the livelihood hanging over their heads and this attorney general or asking them questions and he gives them their warning and he says, you maybe subject to a trial board proceedings."
1966.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2015.661,2026.506,"Well, wait a minute, that's all pursuant to a system in the judgment and of which the municipal court was subject to the supervision of the supreme courts, that what I think."
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,2026.506,2029.639,I understand that and I've read the brief of --
1966.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2029.639,2042.548,All of these instances of difficulties in the municipal courts where the 500 of them indicate this is just a system by this that are investigated to administrative directors today.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,2042.548,2056.098,"Mr. Justice Brennan, with all due respect to the system that exist in New Jersey and I'm certain that the system exist in others of the 50 states similar to that that this act there has to be found --"
1966.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2056.098,2057.347,I'm not speaking about the act.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,2062.543,2067.949,"This act -- no, this act of the Supreme Court should be reviewed and this Court should consider."
1966.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2073.813,2087.097,"You mean, it is a federal constitution infirmity in a system under which the Supreme Court of New Jersey to which it administers director's office, supervises the fiscal affairs of the municipal courts."
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,2087.097,2092.902,"In matters of involving potential criminal violations, it should be referred to --"
1966.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2092.902,2094.216,That's what I want to say --
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,2094.216,2097.318,"To the executive for investigation, yes."
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.426,2114.3,Why wouldn't to the interest of your client be added to detected if all there's a court rule was any evidence is obtained and this method -- by this method is inadmissible at the trial.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,2116.517,2120.26,That's one solution but I don't think it's the whole solution Mr. Justice White.
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.26,2127.358,"Well, I know but you're complaining that this man has been convicted by the use of evidence that was coerced."
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,2127.358,2128.631,Yes.
1966.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.631,2133.318,"Now, if we take you at your wording say yes there was coercion here."
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,2139.801,2143.014,If you want to give me that (Voice Overlap).
1966.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2143.683,2157.078,"You want us to strike down the statute and you want us also to strike down the whole system of supervision of the judges of Supreme Court power, in addition to relieving your client of the conviction."
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,2157.078,2157.775,That's right.
1966.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2157.775,2158.787,That's asking for a lot.
1966.13,0,21330,daniel_l_oconnor,,2158.787,2160.197,That certainly it is.
1966.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2168.301,2171.995,Mr. Handler.
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2171.995,2176.755,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2203.274,2207.383,"Mr. Handler, why, why waste your time on that clearly if we do?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2211.407,2217.023,"Yes, and I certainly cannot be dogmatic in saying that it's not an important -- an importance of statute."
1966.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2217.023,2219.453,"Well, didn't we postpone jurisdiction on this Court?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2219.453,2220.121,Yes.
1966.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2220.121,2226.067,"Well, really you got more if I may suggest to that I think you have more serious question about it --"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2226.067,2229.3,"Well, this is what I propose to do Mr. Justice Brennan."
1966.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2245.384,2247.126,Do you?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2247.126,2248.746,I don't think it is involved and I think that the --
1966.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.746,2252.547,I know but do you think it's critical for their argument to the state?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2254.388,2258.712,I think it does color their arguments significantly and I think without --
1966.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2258.712,2260.798,"Well, --"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2260.798,2279.29,"Well, without the force and effect of that statute, I think that the Court must then consider whether or not as a factual matter there was coercion and the interrogation such as to vitiate a subsequent testimony."
1966.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2279.29,2281.521,"Now, as much as clear, isn't it?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2297.381,2298.101,That's correct.
1966.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2298.101,2309.749,"So, we have to wait until they came when you had a police officer who relied on the privilege and then you discharge them under the statute before we have the course of question of constitutionality statute."
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2309.749,2310.857,I would agree with that.
1966.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.424,2337.045,"The New Jersey Court ruled the context, is it not?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2337.045,2338.086,The New Jersey Court --
1966.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.086,2340.575,Statute wasn't invoked or involved.
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2340.575,2354.509,That is correct and the New Jersey Court stated in effect that the advice or warning given by the Deputy Attorney General was merely reflective of the intrinsic duty in the laws applicable to police officers.
1966.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.038,2580.412,"Mr. Handler, then I take it you're distinguishing the police officer from the ordinary citizen who might be interrogated by the police or by the district attorney and hold that now come on you better fellas or we will get you fired and we will follow up you boss then we can pretty well make sure that he won't be working tomorrow and that you (Inaudible) information."
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2585.249,2586.924,Not at all.
1966.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.924,2588.895,"So, the policeman is different."
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2588.895,2591.01,I believe a policeman is different and I --
1966.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2591.01,2593.721,"If he isn't, why there's coercion?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2593.721,2595.938,"If he is not, there is coercion."
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2691.893,2708.413,"May I ask you, what you're saying is that policemen can be made -- to give evidence against difficulties of policemen and that would be a reasonable regulation of the Fifth Amendment."
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2708.413,2711.495,I don't go quite that far Mr. Justice Black.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2724.422,2727.111,I guess he's force to give evidence against himself?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2727.111,2729.358,I don't think he can be forced to give such evidence.
1966.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2741.702,2748.185,"Mr. Handler, you really do want to argue the statute here through the course of --"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2748.185,2754.701,"No, because I feel this that the statute is on the books."
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2859.252,2869.071,"Well, you don't claim any isn't that the fact of fitness to be a policeman, the policeman claimed to manifest the Fifth Amendment."
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2869.071,2871.446,I don't say that categorically but I --
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2871.446,2873.008,How do you avoid it?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2873.008,2874.649,I say it may be.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2874.649,2878.56,"Because that's what happened, that's the way it function."
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2878.56,2894.908,"Well, this Court has held that the mere refusal to testify does not in it of itself give rise to a basis for removal and I don't argue with that articulation."
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2895.907,2906.478,"Well, what to be added to it besides the fact that he is a policeman and has refused to convict, to give evidence to convict himself, what's to be added to that?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2906.478,2908.15,"Well, --"
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2908.15,2911.151,Any excuse for it?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2911.151,2917.872,They're could conceivably be in excuse for example even in this very proceeding.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2958.331,2964.809,They would be within their right as I understand it and dismiss him from service those who had claimed their benefit of the Fifth Amendment.
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2964.809,2967.127,"In this circumstance, I think so."
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2967.34,2975.638,"So you get down to the question as to whether the Fifth Amendment means what it says, does it?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2975.638,2987.182,"Not necessarily so, not necessarily so because in the situation which you're hypothesizing they have not been required to testify against themselves."
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2992.087,2996.785,"Well, why should they when they are kind of between the devil and the deep blue sea?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2996.785,3003.011,"Well, if they're not put between the devil and deep blue sea, it means an effect that society is because it would mean --"
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3003.011,3007.07,But the society is handicapped by the Fifth Amendment.
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3007.07,3010.225,But I don't think that's a sweet in effect of the Fifth Amendment.
1966.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3027.996,3056.525,"Mr. Handler, are we -- do we have to find out in this case whether any one was legally discharged or not or do we have to find out merely that evidence taken from him in what they said to be compulsory manner here is properly introduced in the criminal proceeding against him?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3056.525,3060.119,I think that that is basically the only issue.
1966.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3060.119,3061.476,That is the only issue?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3061.476,3062.734,Involved.
1966.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3086.458,3103.203,"The only question is, was there coercion in getting these statements from these police officers and therefore were they voluntary statements that could be introduced in the trial against him."
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3103.203,3106.516,That is the way I see the issue in this case.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3110.576,3114.042,And precisely how were they obtained?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3117.497,3121.058,I think that the appellants volunteered them.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3121.058,3122.521,I'm not talking about conclusion.
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3124.528,3127.112,"Factually, this is what happened."
1966.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3153.567,3156.178,How long we've been doing that?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3156.178,3156.813,I think --
1966.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3156.813,3159.214,Twenty-five years?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3159.214,3167.789,"Many, many years this has been a function long exercise by the New Jersey Supreme Court."
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3235.667,3239.166,Where they doing it?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3239.166,3252.342,He didn't say specifically for their doing it but I think it's reasonably clear that each of them knew he was involved.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3271.158,3281.616,"I'll get down to the point now where he told them under the law that they testified, it could be used against them to convict them."
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3281.616,3282.731,Yes.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3282.731,3284.933,And would be?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3284.933,3295.124,He didn't say it would be but he made a quite clear that their testimony could be used against them or any other person in a subsequent criminal proceeding and this --
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3295.124,3297.78,And that they would lose their job?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3297.78,3304.83,He told them that if they refuse to testify as police officers they may be subject to proceedings --
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3304.83,3308.919,"Testify as police officers, they testified as human being."
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3308.919,3321.009,"Well, that's true but they also were being interrogated in connection with the alleged commission of crime within their jurisdiction and as --"
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3321.009,3326.469,And their alleged conviction of crime?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3326.469,3328.849,Yes.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3341.371,3355.986,"What's the difference in that in saying if -- except in the enormity of the -- of what's done, you can be whipped if you don't do this and that's what to be done."
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3355.986,3357.533,I think there's a great deal of difference.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3357.533,3360.072,A great deal of difference is the degree.
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3362.707,3363.283,"Well, --"
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3363.283,3365.778,His job was at stake?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3365.778,3382.536,"I feel this that the advice given to these appellants was no more no less than what they were subject to them, and what they were obligated to do as policemen and --"
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3382.536,3386.04,To obligate to do it but for the facts of the Fifth Amendment.
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3386.04,3397.887,"Well, of course you assume your conclusion by saying that a priority that Fifth Amendment prevents the discharge of this duty."
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3397.887,3399.974,No.
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3406.436,3406.755,But I don't --
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3406.755,3410.555,By threatening him with something like loss of a job.
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3410.555,3419.002,If the threat has no grounding in law or in policy then the Fifth Amendment does act as a foreign.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3425.827,3431.516,"Again, he's beyond the legal duty of the Fifth Amendment says, he can't be compelled to be a witness against himself."
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3431.516,3432.652,I think he can.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3432.652,3433.527,You think he can?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3433.527,3437.641,I think he can because it is his decision to make.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3442.304,3443.347,How about their job?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3443.347,3445.127,But he may lose his job.
1966.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3456.309,3474.161,"Well, Mr. Handler I think you answered Justice White before that where this individual is not police officer at the time of that interrogation but private citizens, there will be no question that there was that kind of coercion exercise could violated the privilege?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3474.161,3474.395,Yes.
1966.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3474.395,3481.07,"So, your whole case has to depend on a distinction between a police officer and a private citizen, does it?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3481.07,3481.74,Yes.
1966.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3494.748,3528.983,Did you say in response to Mr. Justice Brennan some time ago that you did not make any point out of a procedural posture of this case so there's to say that it does not come here with -- on the dismissal for refusal to testify that the case comes here and posture where the police officers have been discharged upon a calendar conviction?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3528.983,3543.237,I don't think the question of discharges is pertinent Mr. Justice Fortas because in point of fact there's nothing in the record to indicate what the status of these appellants is in each of their municipalities.
1966.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3547.226,3551.514,"Well, anyway the only judgment before us that judgment of criminal conviction."
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3551.514,3552.257,Judgments of conviction.
1966.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3552.257,3572.884,"Well, that's what bothers me because the essential proposition here may be that the mere existence of the statute invalidates the testimony given and makes that testimony of course --"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3572.884,3577.178,"Well, this argument of course has been tendered."
1966.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3663.873,3670.439,"So, there is a direct conflict between your position and that stated by Mr. O'Connor in that respect?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3670.439,3671.226,"Yes, it's --"
1966.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3671.226,3674.592,Conflict with respect to New Jersey law?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3674.592,3676.735,Yes.
1966.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3700.087,3726.094,"So, I suppose you would argue that even if the -- an absolute mandatory statute would be considered as -- might be considered as of course that where the invocation of the statute requires a hearing and the application of other standards that the case may be different?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3726.094,3740.298,I think it would be different and I think that is that this case because each appellant was surprised clearly that he might be subject to removal not that he would be removed.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3740.298,3741.904,What do you mean would be different?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3751.798,3763.038,"No, I think at a hearing he would be forced to in response to questions to disclose the circumstances and the basis upon which he's refusing to testify."
1966.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3783.714,3806.803,"Mr. Handler, I gather that if the police should be required to answer question putting in by the district attorney whereas an ordinary citizen wouldn't, why couldn't policeman be called to testify at his criminal trial although the ordinary citizens would not be held?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3806.803,3841.505,"I think he could be called to testify, I don't think he could be compelled to testify if for example you had a situation where a defendant police officer was called to the stand and he invoked the Fifth Amendment this might raise an interesting point as to whether he would be subject to disciplinary removal for failing to testify in the course of a trial and I think an argument could be made that that result could obtain."
1966.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3849.579,3852.793,"Mr. Handler, may I ask you this?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3899.771,3905.047,Assuming that there would be independent evidence upon which to proceed with his criminal trial.
1966.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3946.662,3954.343,"When you say that wouldn't apply to all kinds of employees, what kind of employees would it not apply to?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3954.343,3966.366,"Well, I gave as an example of possible non-applicability the highway maintenance employee will feels potholes on a public road."
1966.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3985.392,3992.723,But who would determine what employees would come under and what wouldn't?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3992.723,3993.675,"Well, I think that would be --"
1966.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3993.675,3995.479,-- that would be on an ad hoc basis?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,3995.479,4013.238,"Well, it would probably be under statutes and civil service regulations which generally permit dismissal for conduct unbecoming employees, dishonorable conduct and standard such as that which I'm sure most states have."
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4013.238,4018.575,To what kind of employees has it already been applied?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,4018.575,4018.65,I'm --
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4018.65,4020.685,Give us the details of one of them.
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,4020.685,4036.92,"Well, the -- I'm not certain that this statute was specifically applied in the teacher cases in New Jersey, Lava and Lowenstein because there was a statute under Title 18 which is the Education Act which permitted dismissal of teachers for conduct unbecoming."
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4052.888,4056.382,Because they didn't testify against themselves?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,4056.382,4056.875,No.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4071.884,4072.998,Convictions of what?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,4072.998,4083.925,For ticket fixing in the Fram (ph) case cited in our brief and I was held to be dishonorable service and resulted in a loss of a state pension.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4083.925,4086.337,And was the person asked about it?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,4086.337,4087.154,Excuse me.
1966.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4087.154,4090.752,Was the person asked about it?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,4090.752,4097.145,I'm not certain in that case whether there was independent evidence.
1966.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4100.835,4103.531,May I just add one last question if I may?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,4110.408,4115.788,We did not argue the point of independent substantial evidence.
1966.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4115.788,4118.149,But was there other independent issue?
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,4118.149,4118.457,Yes.
1966.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4128.819,4135.611,"Well, in any event it could be a new trial I gather because he would not have to rely on this testimony that fell, is that it?"
1966.13,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,4135.611,4144.046,I frankly have not evaluated the other testimony that would permit me to reach your conclusion.
