1989.87-2066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.509,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-2066, W.S. Kirkpatrick & Company versus Environmental Tectonics Corporation."
1989.87-2066,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,19.544,25.417,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.87-2066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,438.336,447.513,Certainly there is nothing in the act of state doctrine that would require a United States court to refrain from examining Nigerian law--
1989.87-2066,0,21891,edward_brodsky,,447.513,447.943,No.
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,1727.675,1730.496,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.87-2066,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2009.27,2010.031,Mr. Rutter--
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2010.031,2010.282,"Yes, sir."
1989.87-2066,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.282,2017.978,"--it is correct though, isn't it, that they may well have a defense that you wouldn't have had the contract unless you were willing to engage in the same kind of conduct?"
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2017.978,2019.138,"No, sir, I don't agree with that."
1989.87-2066,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2030.167,2031.616,"No, it's not in pari delicto."
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2045.118,2047.189,"--It is, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1989.87-2066,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2050.963,2052.054,That's not the point.
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2053.295,2057.37,"Well, the second answer is that, first of all, how will they prove it."
1989.87-2066,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.313,2078.503,"Well, I'm not trying to predict how the case will come out."
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2091.371,2093.554,"That may be so, but Mr. Justice Stevens--"
1989.87-2066,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.554,2096.947,"And I don't know if that makes any difference, but at least it's certainly something we have to think about."
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2096.947,2105.284,"--I don't think it makes any difference and I would suggest to you, sir, that it really makes no difference when you look at what the Republic of Nigeria has done in response to my request."
1989.87-2066,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.294,2174.39,"Mr. Rutter, can I come back to the suggestion you're making as to how we ought to handle act of state cases."
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2212.777,2216.981,"No, Mr. Justice Scalia, I obviously did not say what I intended to say which is--"
1989.87-2066,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2216.981,2219.111,"Or I didn't hear what you intended me to hear, I'll put it that way."
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2219.111,2225.366,"--Well, if you look at the last few pages of our brief, I think I've said it there at greater length and perhaps with greater persuasion."
1989.87-2066,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.145,2280.647,Because they knew the court wouldn't listen to--
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2285.531,2292.134,"In any event, sir, my proposed procedure, as set forth in the brief and as proposed here is simply this on the over-arching rule."
1989.87-2066,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2319.292,2325.405,"Well, what standards does the State Department follow in deciding whether or not to give such a letter?"
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2325.405,2328.988,I think those are matters remitted to the Executive Branch.
1989.87-2066,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2347.632,2355.947,"Well, I'm assuming that in making that judgment we're saying that the State Department has or has not followed an appropriate policy."
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2366.715,2381.507,"--May I, with deference, Mr. Justice Kennedy, disagree with that because the political issues which would be involved in the State Department's decision in whether or not to write such a letter are not matters that are properly within the purview of the judiciary, even of this Court."
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.824,2424.647,"What if the State Department says, go right ahead?"
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2424.647,2426.19,"Then the court goes ahead, sir."
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.19,2427.208,No matter what?
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2427.208,2428.23,"Yes, sir."
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.23,2434.074,It doesn't... the court then doesn't ask any questions?
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2434.074,2440.529,"No, sir, because, again, as I've said to Mr. Justice Kennedy, the political questions that would be involved in ""embarrassment""--"
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2440.529,2448.896,"Well, you say then in this case the... the case is over because you have a representation from the State Department to go ahead."
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2448.896,2449.105,"--Yes, sir."
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.135,2465.567,"Even if this is... even if this is an act of state, go ahead."
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2465.567,2466.877,"--Even if it's an act of state, yes sir."
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2466.877,2471.23,Which was the case in Citibank.
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2471.23,2472.602,"Yes, sir."
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.602,2477.064,"And what if the State Department says, sorry, no comment?"
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2477.064,2482.728,"There, again, sir, I suggest that given the proper application of the rule that the case goes forward."
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.327,2503.544,"Well, that's a... you do say, then, that that takes a reworking of our past cases?"
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2503.544,2504.183,Absolutely.
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.076,2510.526,"Well, I know, but I was the sole dissent."
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2511.708,2511.938,"Well,--"
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.938,2517.592,"So, I wouldn't mind reworking it, I suppose."
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2526.769,2528.519,"--That's exactly right, Mr. Justice White."
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2529.281,2535.224,And the Court went ahead and held that the act of state doctrine applied.
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2535.224,2541.389,--But let me remind you of the further history because that then suggest to me why the reworking along the lines I have suggested is necessary.
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.959,2590.892,"Yes, but you certainly are making an argument you don't need to make--"
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2590.892,2592.09,"Absolutely, Mr. Justice--"
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.09,2592.751,--to win this case.
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2592.751,2593.152,--Absolutely.
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.152,2595.406,I don't know why you'd want to carry a big load like that.
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2595.406,2600.097,"I'm doing it, sir, because I have said that there are several levels at which this case can be decided."
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.285,2612.046,"Well, just on the Bernstein letter you--"
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2612.046,2613.418,"--Yes, sir."
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.418,2614.717,--just on the State Department's representation.
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2614.717,2614.898,"Yes, sir."
1989.87-2066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.898,2616.811,No matter what else is true.
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2616.811,2618.451,"Absolutely, Mr. Justice White."
1989.87-2066,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2618.451,2620.564,"You don't even have a very good Bernstein letter, though."
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2625.529,2626.668,But as you said--
1989.87-2066,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2626.668,2631.794,"The State Department says, go right ahead because, as we read the law, the act of state doctrine doesn't apply."
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2636.649,2637.069,--Absolutely not.
1989.87-2066,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.069,2642.853,"But what it then goes on to say... although I've got to admit it's going to embarrass the devil out of us, so be very careful--"
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2642.853,2643.634,It may embarrass--
1989.87-2066,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.634,2645.463,--that seems to me to be a reverse Bernstein letter.
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2647.055,2653.5,"--Well, it's good enough for my purposes to satisfy the Bernstein exception, hence I rely upon it, Mr. Justice Scalia."
1989.87-2066,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2681.492,2685.973,"He said, we do mind, but as we read the law, the act of state doctrine doesn't apply."
1989.87-2066,1,43256,thomas_b_rutter,,2688.026,2689.178,"--Well, I... in deference--"
1989.87-2066,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2738.064,2746.279,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.87-2066,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2862.998,2863.158,Excuse me.
1989.87-2066,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2866.811,2871.365,"--I think American Banana at least provides some indirect support for that, Justice Scalia."
1989.87-2066,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2896.851,2897.882,Wouldn't it have had to?
1989.87-2066,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2902.607,2904.517,--No.
1989.87-2066,3,21891,edward_brodsky,,3320.649,3331.328,"Well, if the Court please, first, with regard to the second letter that was received from the State Department, I don't think there is any material difference between the two letters."
1989.87-2066,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3367.837,3370.047,"Thank you, Mr. Brodsky."
