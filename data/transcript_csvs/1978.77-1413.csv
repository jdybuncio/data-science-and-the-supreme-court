1978.77-1413,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.333,We will hear arguments first this morning in Aronson against Quick Point Pencil Company.
1978.77-1413,0,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,17.068,20.157,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1413,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,54.541,57.369,Is there a picture of it or a representation of it anywhere in the --
1978.77-1413,0,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,57.369,61.564,There is not as such in the printed record.
1978.77-1413,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,67.319,70.595,How is that relevant to the contract issue?
1978.77-1413,0,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,70.595,86.745,"It is not Your Honor except that the only reason I mentioned the particular -- that it is different from the design shown in those patents is the argument of the amicus Ercon, that it was in the public domain or known before the invention by the petitioner."
1978.77-1413,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,98.394,100.66,Alright.
1978.77-1413,0,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,100.66,112.071,"Having made this invention and having prepared and filed a patent application which disclosed and described the invention, she took it to a number of potential manufacturers."
1978.77-1413,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,400.874,404.872,"That really just one point, isn't it that this case is governed by Kewanee?"
1978.77-1413,0,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,404.872,411.835,"Yes, it really is and I don't think that there can be any doubt that it is governed by Kewanee."
1978.77-1413,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,510.81,516.168,"In your view Mr. Cook, would the case be any different?"
1978.77-1413,0,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,533.743,542.847,"In my view Mr. Chief Justice, the case would be no different, because in this case, the petitioner took nothing from the public."
1978.77-1413,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,741.262,753.457,"But on some inventions, the copying of it is not easy, because the content is discernible."
1978.77-1413,0,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,762.821,764.386,That is true Your Honor.
1978.77-1413,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,764.386,767.667,-- without any patent so that they don't have to disclose?
1978.77-1413,0,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,767.667,804.44,"And that is really the truly anomalous thing about the Court of Appeals' decision and the position of the respondent in this case, because if this invention had been one which could be kept secret and was not revealed upon its sale to the public, the Court of Appeals and the respondent would say the agreement is enforceable, and yet the objectives of the patent law are furthered much better by an agreement where the invention becomes public and available to the public than they are in a situation where the invention by its nature remain secret."
1978.77-1413,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1210.433,1223.796,"You very well, Mr. Cook."
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,1231.833,1235.644,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1413,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.054,1385.705,"Mr. Grossman, are you suggesting that there are contracts which would be enforceable under state law, which do not violate the antitrust laws, but which would nevertheless be preempted by what you referred to as federal competition policy?"
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,1385.705,1388.58,"No, I do not make that suggestion."
1978.77-1413,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1432.942,1437.457,What are other federal policies such as --?
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,1437.457,1439.719,The patent policy for this case.
1978.77-1413,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.719,1441.208,Which would be the laws --
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,1441.208,1456.488,"In terms of – The patent policy and antitrust policy are complementary here, It is conceivable, of course that one could have a situation in which federal patent policy would be frustrated even though antitrust policy might not be."
1978.77-1413,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1456.488,1464.279,"And one looks to find federal patent policy, I take it in the laws enacted by Congress pursuant to the patents?"
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,1464.279,1464.935,That's right.
1978.77-1413,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1484.952,1490.933,I presume the source of this Court's knowledge on that subject must be the acts of Congress?
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,1490.933,1492.724,I can think of no other source.
1978.77-1413,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.724,1495.659,There cannot--
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,1495.659,1502.256,It is not clear to me what monopoly could be referred to here.
1978.77-1413,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1516.013,1524.88,But isn't the contrary precisely what the opposing parties relying on?
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,1524.88,1532.961,The fact that they are being faced with what they believe to be unfair competition is precisely the opposite or the --
1978.77-1413,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1532.961,1538.483,"Because that is anomalable, because he had no monopoly, if she had not monopoly to sell?"
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,1538.483,1541.011,That's right Your Honor.
1978.77-1413,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1976.467,1978.373,How about the Brulotte case?
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,1981.438,1983.912,I suggest not Your Honor.
1978.77-1413,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2040.824,2044.734,Since everybody could use it from the word go?
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,2044.734,2046.26,That's correct.
1978.77-1413,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2046.26,2049.467,"What was the item involved in Brulotte, I have forgotten?"
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,2053.652,2055.306,That was not clear from the record.
1978.77-1413,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2068.992,2072.621,"Broadly read the Brulotte case, I should suppose does bear on this, doesn't it?"
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,2097.838,2099.292,Your Honor I believe --
1978.77-1413,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2099.292,2104.018,Without violating because the patent preempts it?
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,2104.018,2117.459,"Yeah, I believe that Brulotte stands for the proposition that where one has obtained a patent then one may not obtain any additional compensation related to that patent after the --"
1978.77-1413,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2117.459,2118.69,After the 17 years.
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,2118.69,2121.191,-- the determination of the 17 years.
1978.77-1413,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2128.866,2129.088,Certainly --
1978.77-1413,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2129.088,2131.681,There is one case that's Kewanee.
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,2131.681,2132.452,Excuse me Your Honor.
1978.77-1413,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2132.452,2134.932,"Your side only has one case, that's Kewanee."
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,2143.459,2165.528,"I believe it would be more accurate to say that not only does Kewanee support it and not only does the reasoning of Kewanee support it, but the very basic preemption theory which this Court used to support it, namely that absent a frustration of federal policy, there is no reason to preempt state law."
1978.77-1413,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2182.629,2184.773,May I ask you this --
1978.77-1413,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2184.773,2186.137,"Mr. Grossman, your time is up."
1978.77-1413,1,17677,b_barry_grossman,,2186.137,2191.729,Thank you.
1978.77-1413,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2191.729,2196.212,Mr. Griswold.
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2196.212,2199.163,May it please the Court.
1978.77-1413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2251.444,2262.279,I had assumed Mr. Griswold that the case proceeded on the assumption that all the others were the same or could be the same because there was no monopoly?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2262.279,2264.276,"Yes, Yes indeed Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-1413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2312.08,2316.929,But you suggest that by way of argument that it was never patentable in the first place?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2316.929,2320.789,"No, Mr. Chief Justice that I don't know."
1978.77-1413,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2557.505,2567.971,"Well, Mr. Griswold does the authority of the state to enforce its own contract laws depend on the presence or absence of a trade secret?"
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2567.971,2580.647,"No Mr. Justice, but it does depend on the presence or absence of relation to the patent laws and I will turn to that right now."
1978.77-1413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2715.796,2739.291,"Mr. Griswold, I wonder would it be irrational in your view to treat this transaction between the two parties as being made up of two contracts, one contract if the 5%, if the patent issued another contract to pay two-and-half percent if they didn't get a patent within five years."
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2739.291,2741.773,"Well, I don't think so Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-1413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2747.877,2750.517,"Different days, literally are they not?"
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2750.517,2779.274,One day apart and finally accepted on June 27th by both parties seems to me that it is one contract and it is not as the government says several times in its brief a contract to pay 5% if a patent is granted and two-and-half percent if a patent is not granted.
1978.77-1413,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2813.734,2820.917,But the terms of the contract did require payment of two-and-half percent of the royalties regardless of whether or not a patent is issued?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2820.917,2836.904,Yes it did and that is nothing which was introduced.
1978.77-1413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3014.397,3018.363,Do we really know whether she is in a better position?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3044.023,3044.253,I don't think --
1978.77-1413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3044.253,3051.1,And it would have maintained -- her payments would have remained at 5% throughout the 17 years.
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3051.1,3059.628,If she'd got the patent within 5 years which she did not and under the contract she was entitled to only two-and-half percent even if she got the patent.
1978.77-1413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3059.628,3073.68,But by the same token doesn't this what we were just discussing indicate that the parties contracted with the view to the possibility if not the likelihood that there would be no patent obtained?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3073.68,3078.67,"I don't think that is by any means clear, this is not a contract --"
1978.77-1413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3078.67,3081.358,What was the reduction of two-and-half percent for?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3081.358,3105.621,"It was not and if you don't get a patent, it was if you don't get a patent within five years and this might have continued for patent application she might have taken that to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals or to the US District Court, might have been an appeal that could have gone on for a long time and the contract was not if you don't get a patent, but if you don't get it within five years."
1978.77-1413,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3133.11,3141.668,"That's what I was going to ask you Mr. Griswold, in order to be sure that I understand the scope in entire thrust of your argument."
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3180.373,3183.818,I know of no reason why that would not be valid.
1978.77-1413,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3200.515,3211.33,"No it's endless only insofar as it's not in perpetuity, it's every time I sell these keyrings they pay Mrs. Aronson two-and-half percent."
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3211.33,3216.963,"But that was true in Brulotte against Thys, if they stop picking half, they wouldn't have to pay royalties."
1978.77-1413,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3216.963,3223.248,I know but my question you think that sort of a contract would not at all be preempted by federal patent law?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3223.248,3229.047,That held that -- the key element in this case is that there was a patent application.
1978.77-1413,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3229.047,3229.829,And that's critical?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3229.829,3232.68,And that's the central fact of this case.
1978.77-1413,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3257.093,3263.701,"Well according to how you define the word exclusive, one could easily read that as meaning I won't license to anybody else?"
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3263.701,3279.303,"Yes, but that it was the patent application license is a basic significance because this contract was not made under state law alone."
1978.77-1413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3368.985,3374.663,"Mr. Griswold, could I ask you one question about your basic theory of the case?"
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3411.977,3413.158,No Mr. Justice --
1978.77-1413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3413.158,3415.304,What is the central thrust of your argument then?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3415.304,3426.571,The central point here is that the petitioner operated under the patent law.
1978.77-1413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3459.641,3468.437,"But granting all this, what Federal policy will be frustrated by enforcing this contract?"
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3468.437,3473.591,"In the first place it is not disclosure, disclosure is colorless."
1978.77-1413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3473.591,3474.563,I don't know what color it is?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3474.563,3475.866,Disclosure is colorless.
1978.77-1413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3475.866,3479.347,"Not disclosure, is it invention, the policy favoring invention?"
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3479.347,3505.237,It is the capitalizing on the use of the patent law thereby obtaining leverage which produces a larger royalty than what otherwise be used -- available and which in this case provided for a royalty which I will call indefinite because it has no limit in time.
1978.77-1413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3505.237,3512.36,I respectfully suggest you are not identifying a federal policy that would be frustrated by enforcement of this contract?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3512.36,3549.713,"The federal policy is using the patent laws to obtain a monopoly position that is to have the leverage to obtain larger royalties than what otherwise be available, royalties which must eventually be paid by the public in the charges for the article and which continue indefinitely under this contract, despite the fact that if she had obtained the patent they would have been limited to 17 years."
1978.77-1413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3549.713,3569.417,"Suppose Mr. Griswold that when she came to this company no patent application was pending and they made exactly the same contract that was made, but that she never applied for a patent and assume no obligation to apply was in the contract."
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3571.158,3572.319,While I suggest Mr. Chief Justice --
1978.77-1413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3572.319,3575.003,How would she then be exploiting or making any use of the patent law?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3575.003,3586.902,"I suggest Mr. Chief Justice you said and she made exactly the same contract, she would never have made the same contract without having produced a patent application."
1978.77-1413,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3621.523,3629.767,"But your client in the contract took the risk of the non-patentability, didn't he?"
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3629.767,3633.42,Well I think that's the issue in the case to some extent.
1978.77-1413,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3633.42,3643.373,Perhaps federal law as you say precludes the enforcement of such a contract but certainly the contract by its terms would seem to indicate that?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3643.373,3655.539,"Well, the contract by its terms does not deal with the question of its proper construction in the event that no patent is ever obtained."
1978.77-1413,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4229.01,4232.032,The important public policy objectives of the states?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4232.032,4243.278,Important public policies objectives of the State yes Mr. Justice involving the sanctity of fiduciary relations between employers and employees within the State.
1978.77-1413,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4243.278,4250.672,"Well, can we assume that if the state of Missouri or whatever state this contract was drawn and chose to enforce this contract."
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4254.61,4268.128,"I think Mr. Justice, this Court would have to decide and my suggestion would be that whatever the public policy conceptions objectives may be, they are not nearly as important."
1978.77-1413,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4282.723,4291.125,"Well, isn't the sole issue also whether federal patent law preempts state law enforcing this contract?"
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4291.125,4314.497,"Yes Mr. Justice to that extent and that step has long since been taken perhaps the clearest and most striking case being Brulotte against Thys where the Court held at no matter what the state contract law was, a contract calling for the payment of royalties after a patent had expired was invalid."
1978.77-1413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4479.12,4504.8,"Mr. Griswold, I suppose one could describe the federal policy at stake in Brulotte as a policy against allowing a patent monopoly to have any rewards in addition to the monopoly itself, can be enlarged to that monopoly beyond the terms of patent grant, that you can obtain royalties on unpatented articles sold with the patent or on a period after the monopoly protection is expired."
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4511.518,4521.062,"I think Mr. Justice, the answer is that here there was a preliminary or in court patent monopoly."
1978.77-1413,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4562.093,4573.044,"But the party, the parties also contracted with respect to a payment absolute patent."
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4577.909,4578.855,Yes and --
1978.77-1413,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4578.855,4593.261,Why and would the case be different if they had said in “and this is our valuation of the startup value of this disclosure?”
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4593.261,4612.578,"This is essentially the ground of Mr. Justice Harlan's dissent in the Thys case, not startup value but lump sum payment for the machine and I can imagine a contract calling for royalty payments after the 17-year period."
1978.77-1413,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4628.85,4644.904,But how can you say that they are using that the patent monopoly or the in-court patent monopoly is lending some leverage here when they expressly contract for what the royalties should be if there is no patent?
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4644.904,4652.798,"Well Mr. Justice if she got a patent she couldn't get royalties for more than 17 years, no matter what the contract said."
1978.77-1413,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4652.798,4654.683,Yes.
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4654.683,4672.444,"If she had been a - - if Quick Point had been a patent licensee and a patent had been obtained, Quick Point could attack the validity of the patent and from the time it attacked the validity of the patent it would not have to pay royalties no matter what the contract said."
1978.77-1413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4672.444,4682.649,"But in that case over the 20 years or more the royalties would have been far in excess of $203,000 on this market rate."
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4682.649,4683.668,In the Lear case?
1978.77-1413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4683.668,4686.4,No this case.
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4688.349,4698.464,"I don't know whether they would or not, that's hard to -- after all the contract that was made in 1956 was one which called for an aggregate of $200,000 royalty."
1978.77-1413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4698.464,4715.545,"But it isn't so difficult, you just take the period after the 5 years and double the royalties and add that to the 203 and then add if you could calculate it, so all the people who copied the idea would have to pay license fees."
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4715.545,4763.603,"I don't see how that is applicable here, but particularly with respect to the Lear case where it was held that if the licensee attacks the patent and is successful, no loyalties are due from the time when he states that he will attack the patent and we find it difficult to think that the licensor of a patent application should stand in a better position than a person who has a good enough invention so that he gets a patent or even one like Lear who has a good enough invention so that he gets a patent but it is latter held to be invalid."
1978.77-1413,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4828.252,4835.688,"Mr. Griswold, do you consider Kewanee and Goldstein teaching cases as well as Brulotte and Compco?"
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4835.688,4843.949,Oh yes Mr. Justice of course and Kewanee is an excellent case that I am very much pleased with.
1978.77-1413,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4843.949,4845.061,I should think you would be. [Laughter]
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4845.061,4869.376,But it has no relation to this case because this case did does not involve a trade secret of the sort which caused the concern of the Court in the Kewanee case and the Kewanee case did not involve a licensing situation.
1978.77-1413,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4869.376,4884.593,"Mr. Griswold, the record contains on page 39 a letter written in 1961 from counsel for Quick Point to Ms Leopoldi."
1978.77-1413,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4899.704,4909.011,"Well, Mr. Justice that's what I thought I was commenting on that in the first place he may well have been wrong."
1978.77-1413,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4985.075,4987.87,Do you have anything further counselor?
1978.77-1413,3,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,4987.87,4992.368,"Yes just briefly, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1413,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5085.044,5092.325,Mr. Cook what if a patent had issued?
1978.77-1413,3,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,5096.632,5097.484,Yes.
1978.77-1413,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5097.484,5104.312,"But then 17 years had expired after the issuance of the patent, what the obligation have continued?"
1978.77-1413,3,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,5104.312,5109.155,"In my opinion, it would not under this Court's decision in Brulotte because under those circumstances."
1978.77-1413,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5109.155,5110.611,"It's pretty clear, isn't it under Brulotte?"
1978.77-1413,3,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,5110.611,5115.518,"Yes, because those circumstances the patent owner has taken something from the public."
1978.77-1413,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5170.923,5181.616,"Well, Mr. Griswold has suggested that there is at least a late wind in her sales by virtue of being able to put the statement patent pending normally?"
1978.77-1413,3,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,5181.616,5186.232,"Well, we not -- the record doesn't show for sure that anybody did put patent pending or anything in this case."
1978.77-1413,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5186.232,5187.079,They could have?
1978.77-1413,3,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,5187.079,5189.129,"But they could have, there is no doubt about that."
1978.77-1413,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5235.688,5244.731,Why you are supposed that royalty rate was higher in this contract up until than it was after the patent was denied?
1978.77-1413,3,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,5244.731,5248.431,I think it is clear that the parties hoped there would be a patent.
1978.77-1413,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5249.376,5257.403,They were paying for the right to use a mechanism that on which a patent application was filed?
1978.77-1413,3,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,5257.403,5267.925,"Exactly and I believe Your Honor that if the parties hoped there would be a patent and if there would had been a patent, Quick Point would have been willing to pay 5% royalty."
1978.77-1413,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5267.925,5273.98,Do you think the case would be different to see if there had been no provision for a reduction in the royalty?
1978.77-1413,3,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,5273.98,5276.404,"Yes, I do."
1978.77-1413,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5284.793,5293.169,So if there hadn't been a provision for reduction of the royalty in the event that there was no patent then you would agree they were piggybacking on the patent?
1978.77-1413,3,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,5293.169,5294.495,"No, I would not agree to that, Your Honor."
1978.77-1413,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5294.495,5296.154,You just say it would be a different case?
1978.77-1413,3,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,5296.154,5297.144,"Yes, I will."
1978.77-1413,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5297.144,5297.507,And what would be the result?
1978.77-1413,3,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,5297.507,5299.843,You see that would depend upon the intention of the party.
1978.77-1413,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5302.676,5314.162,But the chief reason why the party -- why they have a reduction in the patent -- patent royalty from 5% to 2.5% because two arm's-length parties agreed on that.
1978.77-1413,3,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,5314.162,5315.475,Exactly and if --
1978.77-1413,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5315.475,5320.208,"And it doesn't really make much difference or does it, why they agreed on it?"
1978.77-1413,3,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,5320.208,5337.691,"Well, I don't think it does but I think in this particular case the fact is they agreed on it because they contemplated that a patent might not issue and Quick Point was willing to pay the 2.5% for what Dean Griswold has referred to as the head start value."
1978.77-1413,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5469.501,5470.207,Thank you gentlemen.
