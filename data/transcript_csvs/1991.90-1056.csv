1991.90-1056,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.016,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-1056, Charles W. Burson v. Mary Rebecca Freeman."
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,27.718,36.595,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1056,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.697,112.85,How many States have such laws?
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,117.535,119.745,47 States have such laws.
1991.90-1056,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,136.967,147.575,"General, when you say the States have such laws, do you mean they have laws regulating conduct not only in the polling place itself under the roof, but laws regulating areas outside?"
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,150.059,158.873,"47 regulate outside of the polling place; 3 other States have laws that regulate, but only in the polling place."
1991.90-1056,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,159.954,166.269,"General Burson, what are the purposes of those laws as you see them and in your State?"
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,166.269,171.262,"Well, political campaigns are emotionally charged events."
1991.90-1056,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.119,251.705,Are there other State laws governing interruption around the polls of voters... voter intimidation and that sort of thing?
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,251.705,251.865,Yes.
1991.90-1056,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,274.652,282.017,"General Burson, don't some States also have other prohibitions such as use of the media on election day?"
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,282.017,283.998,There have been--
1991.90-1056,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,283.998,286.028,"By media I mean television, for instance."
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,288.482,293.103,"--I'm sorry, I didn't understand, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1991.90-1056,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,293.103,303.881,"I'm under the impression... as a matter of fact, I know my home State has a statute prohibiting political advertising on election day in television."
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,306.732,313.748,"They may so do... no, our... on election day, there's plenty of advertising on TV on Tennessee in the morning, particular."
1991.90-1056,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,313.748,330.778,"I must confess that when I came, we happened to live across the river in Virginia, that I was almost offended by the presence of people handing out literature within 25 feet of the polling place."
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,334.651,338.294,"Well, let me make this."
1991.90-1056,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,412.164,427.555,Now Tennessee's law does not prohibit campaigning for a candidate in some other election and it doesn't prohibit solicitation of commercial products and that sort of thing.
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,428.186,432.698,The latter part is right; the first part is not right.
1991.90-1056,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.312,440.023,Whether it's for that election or any other?
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,440.023,443.236,--Whether it's for that election or a future election.
1991.90-1056,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,443.236,449.51,"But commercial products and so forth, there could be a Hari Krishna stand and so forth."
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,449.51,455.424,"Well, there could be a Hari Krishna stand or there could be a hot dog vendor or selling tuna sandwiches."
1991.90-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,455.424,459.137,"So in that respect then, is the statute content neutral?"
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,459.137,462.63,We certainly would say that it is.
1991.90-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,463.471,465.744,How do we judge content neutrality?
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,469.818,478.033,--Well I think you look to see whether the regulation is only justified with reference to the content of the speech.
1991.90-1056,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,507.894,520.232,"Well, what about cases from this Court, such as Kerry and Mosley, where the Court has said that a State can't regulate some but not all potentially disruptive expression?"
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,520.232,537.213,"I think what this Court, in looking and Mosley and Kerry, what those... where the legislature specifically exempted a labor picketing, and what the Court seemed to say was look, we can't see any difference between labor picketing and other type of picketing."
1991.90-1056,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,564.664,571.339,"Well, our cases have said, too, haven't they, General, that the legislature can deal with the evil where it finds it."
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,575.804,576.304,Absolutely.
1991.90-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,590.128,596.392,"If they became a problem and this statute remained on the book, would there then be an argument that the statute is no longer content neutral?"
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,596.392,607.598,"Well, certainly it would have been content neutral as passed, and in terms of the motivation."
1991.90-1056,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,657.774,669.453,"General Burson, the regulation here would extend in some areas to public streets and public sidewalks, if they were within the 100-foot limit."
1991.90-1056,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,670.204,677.407,"Yes, there may be a portion of a sidewalk that would be encompassed within the 100 feet."
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1256.706,1271.085,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1056,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1323.167,1333.655,"Well, Mr. Herbison, would you think the same standard and test should be applied to regulations inside the polling place as outside?"
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1333.655,1341.239,"--Justice O'Connor, inside the polling place, the State's interest is monumentally greater than outside."
1991.90-1056,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1355.01,1359.941,So you think there's just a more compelling State interest inside.
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1360.532,1364.015,"That is correct, as the Supreme Court of Tennessee found."
1991.90-1056,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1364.015,1366.716,Otherwise the test applied would be the same.
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1372.77,1374.152,It is the same test.
1991.90-1056,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1383.107,1391.453,Do you defend the court's decision that the regulation can extend to 25 feet but not 100?
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1391.453,1401.11,"Well, clearly a 25-foot boundary would be more nearly constitutional than the 100 or 300-foot boundary currently enforced."
1991.90-1056,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.74,1404.633,75 feet more... closer.
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1407.365,1408.243,"However, we do not--"
1991.90-1056,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1408.243,1410.647,Do you defend the holding of the court or not?
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1410.647,1411.155,--We do not.
1991.90-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.996,1552.549,"Suppose two friends go to the polls together and they're supporting different candidates, and as they get within the 100-foot area, they're supposed to quit trying to confer to each other."
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1552.549,1561.455,"That would be correct, at least to the extent of any kind of solicitation of one of the other to vote his way."
1991.90-1056,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1562.797,1577.757,Would the statute prohibit a person from driving down a public street that was within the 100-foot limit with a bumper sticker on the car that was in support of a candidate?
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1577.757,1578.989,This statute would prohibit that.
1991.90-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1583.003,1585.106,"Well, that may be."
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1588.649,1591.331,Not necessarily just because of that.
1991.90-1056,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1599.728,1606.053,"Mr. Herbison, you say it creates a First Amendment problem because you're relying on something called the traditional public forum doctrine."
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1613.547,1624.723,"Justice Scalia, in this case we have a public forum property dedicated... have properties dedicated to expressive activity by governmental fiat, that is, voting."
1991.90-1056,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1624.723,1625.554,But that's my point.
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1664.804,1674.912,"Well, Your Honor, this is, we submit, is a case of the public forum by Government fiat."
1991.90-1056,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1685.308,1687.489,"Well, maybe you want to give the doctrine a new name then?"
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1712.048,1716.289,"Well, whatever label this Court chooses to affix is--"
1991.90-1056,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.289,1721.575,A nontraditional public forum doctrine.
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1721.575,1735.733,"--Of course, there is an element of the public forum doctrine that addresses properties which are public forum by governmental edict, which is, we submit, what we have here."
1991.90-1056,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1751.274,1763.091,"Mr. Herbison, to follow up on Justice Scalia's inquiry, you say this is... this area is dedicated to expressive activity, i.e., voting."
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,1774.652,1784.479,"--Well, we submit the legislature is not empowered to impose that kind of restriction singling out a particular type of speech."
1991.90-1056,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1977.381,1995.48,"Mr. Herbison, suppose you have a municipally owned subway or trolley car line which carries advertising, but decides not to carry political advertising, just because it upsets people."
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,2010.31,2013.253,"Well, certainly the Lehman decision suggests that it is."
1991.90-1056,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.253,2016.495,"Suggests that it is because it's sort of a captive audience, right?"
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,2041.063,2057.714,"Well, this Court has recognized that the reaction of a listener to speech projected his way is not a valid basis for limiting First Amendment rights."
1991.90-1056,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2059.516,2063.36,With listeners in a captive situation?
1991.90-1056,1,30722,john_e_herbison,,2063.36,2072.605,"--Well, a listener is to some extent in a captive situation here, but not to the same extent as in Lehman."
1991.90-1056,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,2292.831,2295.395,"Very brief, I hope, Your Honor."
1991.90-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2410.605,2415.12,"Let me just, on... your correction on page 43, just as a point of information."
1991.90-1056,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,2421.503,2425.316,I think we would have to apply the standard is outcome determinative advocacy.
1991.90-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2427.409,2434.473,"No, the assumption was there was no abortion question on the ballot, but presumably some candidates might have views one way or the other on abortion."
1991.90-1056,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,2434.473,2443.928,"--Just a... it's kind of, I guess, like the Hari Krishna... if somebody is just saying we're for or against--"
1991.90-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2443.928,2445.831,"This not really... this is not a very improbable example, I don't think."
1991.90-1056,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,2445.831,2449.042,"--We're for or against... no, but it really... it just--"
1991.90-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2449.042,2455.646,"Let's say they had something, reduce the deficit, or I'm against high taxes, no more taxes."
1991.90-1056,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,2455.646,2462.631,--I think that just a general statement that was not directed at an outcome either for this or another election would be permitted.
1991.90-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2462.631,2466.965,You don't think that would be as likely to provoke fisticuffs as the--
1991.90-1056,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,2466.965,2472.708,"Well, you know, it might if it were happening, and if that became the case, the State is empowered to restrict that."
1991.90-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2472.708,2474.81,"--Yeah, but this statute wouldn't restrict it."
1991.90-1056,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,2474.81,2479.404,"This statute, if it's not outcome determinative advocacy, this statute would not prohibit it."
1991.90-1056,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2479.404,2482.125,And what about tee-shirts and campaign buttons?
1991.90-1056,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,2482.125,2485.999,Tee-shirts and campaign buttons are restricted under this statute.
1991.90-1056,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2485.999,2489.821,So a voter cannot wear a little campaign button going into--
1991.90-1056,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,2489.821,2493.174,A voter is asked to take the campaign button off as they go in.
1991.90-1056,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2506.194,2512.739,--And a bumper sticker on a car driving by on the street that happens to fall within the 100-foot limit?
1991.90-1056,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,2512.739,2513.22,--Yeah.
