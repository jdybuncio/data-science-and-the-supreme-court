2008.07-581,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.854,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-581, 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett."
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,9.024,24.146,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three reasons why this Court should reverse the Second Circuit's blanket ban on collectively bargained, arbitral forum -- forum selection clauses."
2008.07-581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,105.22,112.766,"Mr. Salvatore, you take the position that the only thing that is at stake here is simply, in effect, the selection of the arbitral forum."
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,134.086,143.237,"Your Honor, in -- in our collective bargaining agreement, the collective bargaining agreement here, the -- the union -- the employee tenders the claim to the union."
2008.07-581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,150.548,151.889,But here it wasn't.
2008.07-581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,151.889,152.311,Yes.
2008.07-581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,152.857,167.399,"Here we are dealing with claims that the union said: Sorry, we are not going to process these claims because we have some tension since the younger workers that replaced you, we also represent them."
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,179.94,181.019,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.07-581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,200.789,213.439,Where does -- where does the contract say anything about the -- the individual succeeding to whatever arrangement there is between the union and the employer?
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,213.439,217.955,"--Your Honor, I'm looking at the petition appendix."
2008.07-581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,217.955,222.216,"I thought that only -- only the union can invoke the arbitration clause, not an individual."
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,222.216,223.561,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-581,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,281.225,282.13,Just so I'm clear--
2008.07-581,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,282.13,306.527,"I don't -- I don't wish to delay your reading, but -- but as -- as part of the decision we have to make, don't we have to have in the background the consideration of the -- that the potentiality that the union might do just what it did here, and that would help, it seems to me, inform our decision on the question that you are presenting."
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,314.495,315.384,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.791,346.463,Is this included in the question presented anyway?
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,346.463,348.182,"--It was -- it was not, Your Honor."
2008.07-581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.182,351.65,Does it have anything to do with the way the Second Circuit resolved this case?
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,351.65,352.854,"It does not, Your Honor."
2008.07-581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.854,359.757,The Second Circuit simply said you could not deprive an individual of the right to a court trial.
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,359.757,360.958,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.958,362.085,And the issue is whether--
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,362.085,362.568,A blanket ban--
2008.07-581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,362.568,383.746,"--Now, if -- if we held that you can require the individual to go to arbitration, in some later case we could confront the question of whether, if the union is in exclusive control of the arbitration and the -- the individual will not get a fair arbitrated deal, that would invalidate it."
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,394.212,395.959,"--Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,400.865,409.518,"So I -- I hate to get into this, you know, nine years' history of dealings between the union and -- and the employees."
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,409.518,411.874,"There is no factual record, Your Honor, for it in the record at all."
2008.07-581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,412.689,414.891,"--Well, there is at least some."
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,450.015,450.47,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,450.47,452.109,And will -- will you go on to that?
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,452.109,452.733,I will.
2008.07-581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,494.434,495.14,What does that mean?
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,504.369,509.837,"What this means, Justice Scalia, is that these individuals cannot go to court."
2008.07-581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,516.801,519.754,Where did we get this phrase -- where do we get the language
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,587.804,592.331,"Your Honor, it does not support it for the -- for the following reason."
2008.07-581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,621.792,623.82,"Well, but it says ""all such claims""."
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,627.801,628.647,--That's correct.
2008.07-581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,628.647,645.046,"And if the statutory right is the appropriate section of an arbitration agreement and the union has ultimate control of the arbitration agreement, then it follows that the union has got ultimate control over the assertion of the statutory right."
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,645.046,648.905,"No, Your Honor, not unless -- not if the union turns that over."
2008.07-581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,650.107,663.477,"Where -- where is the guarantee that the -- if the union says, we don't want to touch this, as in this case, that the employee has the right either to arbitrate or, for that matter, to sue?"
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,664.616,672.333,"--Your Honor, that -- that right is -- is described from this language, ""all such claims""."
2008.07-581,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,689.791,696.51,Has any court decided this issue of the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement in this particular?
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,696.51,701.775,"No court has decided this very issue like this, Justice Alito."
2008.07-581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.672,731.06,"Mr. Salvatore, I -- I didn't think we took this case to -- to determine the specific meaning as to this issue of this -- of this particular contract, which is not an issue of national importance."
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,772.965,774.587,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,774.587,776.712,And the Second Circuit could look into all of these details.
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,776.712,777.507,Absolutely.
2008.07-581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.507,782.164,And inquire into the New York law that you're talking about now and that I don't recall being in any of the briefing.
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,782.164,784.289,"It is, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-581,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,806.543,811.089,I ask you -- let me ask you a naive question possibly or may -- may reflect a misunderstanding.
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,871.907,895.631,"--Well, Justice Breyer, the ADEA provides not only a right to go to court after you've gotten your right-to-sue letter or waited 60 days, but -- but it also provides multiple -- as this Court recognized in Gilmer, multiple avenues that Congress wants to use: Conciliation, persuasion, conference--"
2008.07-581,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,895.631,895.881,Exactly.
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,931.647,944.937,"--Justice Breyer, you have competing policies here because you have the policies of the labor laws which say that unions should have a -- a broad portfolio of -- of topics to bargain about."
2008.07-581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,950.372,953.933,But the union could not bargain about these anti discrimination rights.
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,978.784,984.813,"--Justice Ginsburg, I agree to the degree we're talking about -- you're talking about substantive rights."
2008.07-581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1036.992,1057.703,"Mr. Salvatore, would you -- would you object to or oppose a ruling that said -- that says yes, the -- the right can be subjected to union arbitration, but if the union chooses not to arbitrate it, the individual must have the right to arbitrate it on his own?"
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,1057.703,1061.719,"That's -- that's the practice under this agreement, Your Honor."
2008.07-581,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1082.991,1092.533,"Well, that -- that means that -- and if there's a totally frivolous claim and the employer -- pardon me, the union says we are not going to arbitrate, the -- the employee still has the right to then proceed?"
2008.07-581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.487,1099.813,He has got an arbitration instead of a lawsuit.
2008.07-581,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1099.813,1101.311,If you would -- if you would answer the question.
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,1105.467,1110.931,"Justice Kennedy, the employer has gotten arbitration and--"
2008.07-581,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1110.931,1113.29,In the hard cases.
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,1113.29,1114.324,"--Well, in--"
2008.07-581,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1114.324,1118.867,But it hasn't got the ability to have the union help them weed out frivolous claims.
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,1118.867,1119.632,"--Well, that's true."
2008.07-581,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1133.454,1139.624,"Well, I'm -- I'm not -- I'm not sure that employers nationwide would -- would -- would accept -- would accept that view."
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,1139.624,1141.779,"--Well, I think that the one--"
2008.07-581,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1141.779,1145.387,"And again, maybe that's -- that's a reason for us not to reach it in this case."
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,1145.387,1156.929,"--Well, one of the issues that -- that Congress allows the bargaining parties to figure out is what the scope of their collective bargaining arrangement should be."
2008.07-581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1220.343,1221.03,"And nonmembers, too?"
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,1234.085,1235.337,"--Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1273.744,1276.037,--You said -- the -- fine.
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,1314.364,1316.927,"--In -- in this situation, the employer pays."
2008.07-581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.378,1366.204,"Mr. Salvatore, are you going to get to your explanation about Gardner-Denver before you're all through?"
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,1366.204,1370.264,"Yes -- yes, Your Honor, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.975,1509.991,But not a judicial -- not a judicial forum.
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,1509.991,1512.549,"--An arbitral forum, Your Honor."
2008.07-581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1512.549,1516.504,"Mr. Salvatore, would you just clarify something for me?"
2008.07-581,0,38374,paul_salvatore,,1536.854,1538.165,That's -- that's correct.
2008.07-581,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1556.282,1557.69,"--Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1566.998,1573.135,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Second Circuit's judgment should be affirmed for three reasons."
2008.07-581,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1629.737,1647.839,"Under your first point, are you saying it's impossible for there to be a collective bargaining agreement that reads the way Mr. Salvatore reads this collective bargaining agreement; a collective bargaining agreement which says that the union -- that the grievance must be arbitrated, and it will be done either by the union, or if the union declines to pursue it, by the individual employee?"
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1647.839,1652.166,"Justice Alito, I've looked comprehensively through the cases."
2008.07-581,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1691.025,1697.459,But there is nothing in Federal labor law that would preclude the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement like that?
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1697.459,1710.472,"Nothing except this Court's case in Magnavox, where the Court said that the union may not bargain away an individual's rights where there would be a conflict between the union's interests and the individual's."
2008.07-581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1725.291,1735.163,"But, even in a case in which you don't have -- let's assume -- just assume for the sake of argument that we don't have the discrimination issue or the conflict issue."
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1770.119,1770.742,That -- that's correct.
2008.07-581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1770.742,1771.118,Okay.
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1771.118,1776.335,"And that's why I think the Gilmer point is -- is essential here, Justice Souter and Justice Alito."
2008.07-581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1797.778,1798.262,Right.
2008.07-581,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1798.262,1799.339,Would that mean--
2008.07-581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1799.339,1799.713,Go ahead.
2008.07-581,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1799.713,1805.617,--Would that mean that the employer could not unilaterally impose an arbitration requirement on employees?
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1805.617,1811.302,"I think that would follow, as that be -- would be a condition of employment that could not be imposed."
2008.07-581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1812.145,1815.05,"It wouldn't be unilaterally imposing, right?"
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1837.526,1842.947,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but there are two different points at which the condition of employment arose."
2008.07-581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1862.42,1872.356,But the one thing that's uniform throughout in your answer is that the collective bargaining agreement alone can never subject the employee to -- to mandatory arbitration?
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1872.356,1874.275,That's -- that's how we read this Court's cases--
2008.07-581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.275,1878.37,And it's also true -- is that also true with an ordinary tort suit or any other kind of suit?
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1878.37,1879.166,--Sorry.
2008.07-581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.055,1881.291,A tort suit.
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1896.253,1903.42,"--Well, I think that those category of cases do stand in a different position because there is less of an inherent conflict of interest."
2008.07-581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1904.216,1904.859,Why?
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1904.859,1911.043,"--Well, the union is not going to be the defendant typically in a tort case where the employer is responsible."
2008.07-581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1911.043,1913.746,Doesn't this allow discrimination -- doesn't this refer to discrimination by the employer?
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1913.746,1925.539,"It refers to discrimination, and, as we cite on page 27 of our brief, there are provisions in the antidiscrimination laws that are specifically directed at union discrimination."
2008.07-581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.94,1939.14,"Now, you say section 30 -- it doesn't say anything about union discrimination particularly; it just talks about discrimination."
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1939.14,1939.889,--Yes.
2008.07-581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1940.438,1940.875,Fine.
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1943.514,1944.278,--And that's why--
2008.07-581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1944.278,1944.731,All right.
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1990.727,1997.895,"--I think, Justice Breyer, that the discrimination cases do stand in a different category because of the inherent conflict of the--"
2008.07-581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1997.895,1998.725,Is that the only reason?
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2013.999,2014.904,--I don't think Congress--
2008.07-581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2014.904,2016.42,"If I think that, then I should decide against you?"
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2016.42,2023.431,"--Well, no, because there are two other reasons: The exclusive control over the machinery and the union serving as the gatekeeper."
2008.07-581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2039.174,2042.174,"Well, but those -- I'm sorry."
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2078.848,2098.026,"Yes, you would, but the principles this Court has applied in looking at that broad line -- I'm trying to suggest that there might be situations in which those principles, where the union is serving as the gatekeeper, thereby not allowing a person to vindicate his individual rights in the tort context, to be not--"
2008.07-581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2098.026,2103.29,"I agree with you, but I think -- I don't want to put words in Justice Breyer's mouth--"
2008.07-581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2103.29,2104.008,Very helpful of you.
2008.07-581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2104.008,2115.535,"--But I thought what he was getting at is, if I hold for you here, am I going to have to hold for you in every case in which somebody has in effect a tort claim which is subject to an arbitration clause?"
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2115.535,2116.346,--And the answer is no.
2008.07-581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2117.16,2128.747,"Then I replicate my question because what I'm thinking is simply that there are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, kinds of claims that people go to arbitration over."
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2164.735,2176.683,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I think that your question really is getting at the theory behind collective bargaining agreements and what extent the union can exercise control over the individual rights and circumstances of employment."
2008.07-581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.945,2185.507,"Well, can you give me a hint as to the principle?"
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2186.053,2210.699,"--I -- well, I think that there are limits, of course, on the union's authority that have been recognized in this Court's decisions, and I don't think that ruling in the workers' favor in this circumstance opens up any kind of Pandora's box at all, because all we are arguing for is that the Gardner-Denver line, which was written by this Court unanimously more 30 years ago, continue to be the law of the land, as the Court has reaffirmed it in cases like--"
2008.07-581,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2210.699,2219.663,What if a collective bargaining agreement requires the arbitration of discrimination claims that are not based on Federal law?
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2247.81,2257.758,"--I -- I think that is a harder case, Justice Alito, but I think that the answer under this Court's decisions in Gardner-Denver points the way here, in footnote 19 of the decision."
2008.07-581,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2268.489,2269.487,What about--
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2269.487,2270.314,--to the union's control.
2008.07-581,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2270.314,2274.315,--if it's not a statutory right; it's just a wrongful discharge?
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2318.656,2336.227,"Yes, and I think that there have been conditions of employment and discharge that have been arbitrable, and I don't see that there is a -- an issue there where -- except where that intersection with the statutory discrimination rights occurs."
2008.07-581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2344.459,2345.005,Why has it?
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2401.747,2410.322,"--Well, I'm not sure actually in answering your hypothetical that they would necessarily have to go through the union on the nonpayment because of the Fair Labor Standards Act case."
2008.07-581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2453.428,2458.005,"Well, isn't that kind of conflict always present whenever you have collective action?"
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2470.171,2480.185,"Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, but where Congress has made a choice that individual claims for antidiscrimination rights need to be vindicated in particular ways, and where this Court's--"
2008.07-581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2480.185,2483.511,"Well, they don't have to be vindicated in particular ways."
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2488.351,2491.743,"--Certainly, but there is individual consent in that circumstance."
2008.07-581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2530.773,2535.379,"You did raise that issue, but you didn't say that the consequence of that issue was that you win."
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2544.142,2545.113,Well--
2008.07-581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.113,2550.844,But it's a totally different issue whether because of that question you -- you should -- you should win the case.
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2550.844,2555.777,"--Certainly, the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is fairly included within the question presented."
2008.07-581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.947,2601.573,It doesn't have to be within the question presented.
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2603.979,2605.227,"Well, I think that--"
2008.07-581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2605.227,2610.335,The only question is whether we will -- we will agree that we should inquire into new ground.
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2610.943,2617.097,"--My only point is that this is one of those fuzzy areas where we are not making an independent, alternate ground of affirmance."
2008.07-581,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2626.655,2640.556,"What about the argument that you are -- if you win this case, you are subjecting the employee to a worse situation because the employer will simply say: Fine, I don't have to bargain anything with the union."
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2650.504,2665.42,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I guess I'd answer that question by saying, we will pay our money and take our chances in the sense that the unions here are supporting the workers where the unions are acknowledging that there is this kind of conflict of interest."
2008.07-581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2675.196,2676.412,"Well, they may go the other way."
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2694.468,2697.528,"Mr. Chief Justice, in fact, empirically that's not correct."
2008.07-581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2715.474,2719.958,"But under my scenario, the employer wouldn't have to pay for arbitration."
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2723.316,2731.876,"--Well, under your scenario, I think where the employer would control the arbitral process, the arbitrator knows who is buttering his bread."
2008.07-581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2731.876,2732.266,No.
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2741.995,2748.199,"And -- and that has been the law for 30 years, and we think it should continue to be the law, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2759.035,2762.424,"No, I mean, my point is that there are benefits to employees from arbitration as well."
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2762.424,2763.223,Certainly--
2008.07-581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2763.223,2764.752,But the employer may not agree to it.
2008.07-581,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2769.969,2780.716,"--But that's why this Court has always said that individual consent and agreement is a fundamental precept of arbitration, and where that agreement is absent, a worker should not be forced to that route."
2008.07-581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2781.652,2782.869,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2794.224,2806.702,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents' fundamental right to a workplace free of invidious, class-based discrimination is something their union had no power to barter away in collective bargaining, and the union--"
2008.07-581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2806.702,2830.553,"I -- I just want to be sure that at some point you'd answer this question, if you can: I -- I -- the issue in front of us, as I see it, is just what you said: When can a union require the worker to accept arbitration rather than a court case in an instance where the union member has not signed a special waiver?"
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2903.321,2904.46,"--Yes, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2908.614,2910.162,That's why I am asking you for the principle.
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2910.474,2924.734,"--I think that the -- the best line that we have is -- is stated in both Gardner-Denver and Barrentine as contrasting statutory rights that are related to collective activity, and especially economic activity, are the kinds of things that are normally delegated to the union."
2008.07-581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2941.131,2943.771,Why -- why doesn't this come within that?
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2943.771,2944.77,Because--
2008.07-581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2944.77,2947.991,"Why don't many of these cases, if not most of them, come within that?"
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2957.003,2958.422,"--Well, I -- I think, Justice Scalia--"
2008.07-581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2958.422,2962.969,"You -- you call it a non-economic -- phooey, it's an economic case."
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2962.969,2978.196,"--But I think what's important, Justice Scalia, is -- is, though -- is the line that the Court stated in Barrentine: That if a statute is designed to give specific, minimum protections to individual workers, then that's the sort of thing that the union doesn't have the power to engage in collective bargaining over."
2008.07-581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3009.619,3010.122,It is not taking away the right.
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3017.226,3018.069,Yes.
2008.07-581,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3029.549,3037.595,"You -- you focus on the fact that Congress has given an individual right, but for the many matters that you say are the subject of collective bargaining, you don't need a statute."
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3050.618,3051.963,"Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-581,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3051.963,3054.681,"Well, why isn't it -- why isn't it the same with these statutory rights?"
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3058.226,3064.442,"Well, I -- even the employer here is not claiming that the underlying statutory right is subject to collective bargaining."
2008.07-581,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3065.581,3065.924,No.
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3068.299,3076.531,"--Well, in this instance Congress gave individual employees the right to bring a civil action in a judicial forum as a means of enforcing their antidiscrimination claims."
2008.07-581,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3089.839,3093.306,Why would any employer want to agree to arbitration under this system?
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3098.208,3101.553,"--Well, with -- Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that that's true."
2008.07-581,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3106.799,3109.985,That just begs the question that your interpretation of Gardner-Denver is correct.
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3109.985,3115.546,"Well, it -- it is the prevailing interpretation in every circuit that has considered the question since Gilmer except the Fourth Circuit."
2008.07-581,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3140.943,3149.502,"Your position -- so your position is going to hurt most employees, because assuming that the employer wants to arbitrate, the union gets something in return for agreeing to that."
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3160.577,3168.664,"--Well, we don't think that there is any reason why the employees will not be able to make agreements with the employers, as was made possible in Gilmer."
2008.07-581,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3173.803,3175.383,"Well, the employees have no -- no leverage."
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3185.971,3189.312,"--Well, I mean, there was an argument in Gilmer that they didn't have leverage, either."
2008.07-581,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3201.807,3217.849,"Suppose the employer did have the practice that the Chief Justice suggested, it tells each employee you have to sign an arbitration form, could the union in its collective bargaining negotiations say that you will withdraw this form and that you shall not impose this obligation?"
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3217.849,3224.813,"--Well, that's -- as Mr. Frederick mentioned and is as discussed in several of the briefs, that's an undecided question of labor law."
2008.07-581,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3226.424,3227.578,I'm asking your view.
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3230.433,3231.279,--Well--
2008.07-581,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3231.279,3233.747,--Because I'm concerned it's the same thing the Chief Justice mentioned.
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3240.119,3254.769,"--We think that as long as the employees have been -- have been able to indicate exactly the same level of individual agreement that was upheld in Gilmer and that the arbitral forum itself is going to be adequate, that that takes care of that half of the question."
2008.07-581,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3293.425,3310.294,But doesn't it boil down -- doesn't your argument really boil down to this: That the only case in which it's really going to matter is the case in which the arbitration agreement contains a clause that gives the union plenary authority over the disposition of the claim?
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3350.323,3359.943,"Well, not necessarily, Justice Souter, because there are all sorts of other attributes of the arbitral forum that might -- might well be relevant to the question of whether it's sufficient to effectively vindicate the underlying substantive rights."
2008.07-581,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3382.591,3385.044,You're just using more variables to Justice Souter's question.
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3388.636,3390.636,If the variables are--
2008.07-581,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3390.636,3398.661,"You're saying that this might be -- this might not be true and that may not be true, but suppose all of those other requirements are satisfied?"
2008.07-581,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3398.661,3411.143,"--We think that there needs to be individual agreement in order to comply with Gilmer because of the underlying inherent tension between the collective interests of the union and the individual interests of the employees, especially in antidiscrimination statutes."
2008.07-581,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3411.143,3413.748,"Thank you, counsel."

2008.07-581,3,38374,paul_salvatore,,3450.221,3464.481,"And I refer you, Justice Ginsburg, to page 47a of the joint -- of the petition appendix, which contains the mainframe arbitration Article VI of this collective bargaining agreement, the last paragraph--"
2008.07-581,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3464.481,3466.681,What page did you -- did you reference?
2008.07-581,3,38374,paul_salvatore,,3466.681,3474.132,"--47a of the petition appendix, the last paragraph on that page."

2008.07-581,3,38374,paul_salvatore,,3475.599,3476.148,I'm sorry?
2008.07-581,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3476.148,3477.833,You said Article VI.
2008.07-581,3,38374,paul_salvatore,,3480.598,3483.909,Article VI starts on 43a.
2008.07-581,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3491.174,3491.736,"Oh, I see."
2008.07-581,3,38374,paul_salvatore,,3492.188,3492.999,"Again, VI."
2008.07-581,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3492.999,3493.438,I got you.

2008.07-581,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3512.991,3513.943,Where does that appear?
2008.07-581,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3513.943,3514.898,Is that written down somewhere?
2008.07-581,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3514.898,3515.663,Where does that appear?
2008.07-581,3,38374,paul_salvatore,,3515.663,3520.115,--That's -- that's the -- the agreement between the collective bargaining parties.

2008.07-581,3,38374,paul_salvatore,,3582.043,3583.447,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."

2008.07-581,3,38374,paul_salvatore,,3618.277,3622.15,"--Let me explain that time frame, Justice Souter."
