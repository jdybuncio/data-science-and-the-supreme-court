2003.129_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.919,"We'll hear argument next in No. 120 Original, Virginia v. Maryland."
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,70.083,72.3,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.129_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,103.007,107.129,"Mr. Baida, before you get into your argument, can I just ask you a preliminary question?"
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,117.657,119.593,"--Correct, we are not."
2003.129_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,134.634,146.223,Do you think the compact covers withdrawals of water by Virginia?
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,149.207,165.746,"--It's not the privilege of making and carrying out orders, Justice O'Connor, although that privilege would seem to apply to building something into the river to exercise a riparian right, and there is a riparian right to withdraw water."
2003.129_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,165.746,173.463,"Well, do you... do you take the position that Maryland could reject every effort by Virginia to withdraw water from the river?"
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,173.463,175.071,"No, Justice O'Connor."
2003.129_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.055,178.835,What is your position then?
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,178.835,183.817,That Virginia has riparian rights with respect to the Potomac River.
2003.129_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.817,187.003,Which includes the right to use some of the water.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,187.003,187.331,Correct.
2003.129_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.331,189.315,And take it out of the river.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,189.315,189.548,Correct.
2003.129_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,189.548,190.579,With your permission.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,190.579,191.392,Correct.
2003.129_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.392,193.031,But only with your permission.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,197.233,201.92,"Subject to a standard of reasonableness, Justice O'Connor."
2003.129_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,201.92,207.729,--Is that reasonableness in part assessed by the fact that Maryland is a sovereign?
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,207.729,209.556,It's--
2003.129_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,209.556,209.931,Pardon me.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,211.118,212.618,--No.
2003.129_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,228.704,234.718,Virginia rights are... Virginia rights are no greater than any private landowner?
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,234.718,236.296,That's precisely correct.
2003.129_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,236.296,240.263,"Even... even assuming that's true, I... I thought a right is a right."
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,244.136,245.136,And... and--
2003.129_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,245.136,248.354,And riparian rights include the right to take the water.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,249.228,249.837,--And--
2003.129_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.837,254.367,"And that's the right to take water, not... not the right to come and beg Maryland to take water."
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,254.367,268.126,"--The river, Justice Scalia, is entirely within the State of Maryland, and that is undisputed from the... the language of the Maryland charter back from 1632."
2003.129_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,270.25,277.31,But the compact reserves to the State of Virginia and its citizens riparian rights.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,286.025,294.021,Maryland's ownership of the Potomac gives it to right... gives it the right to regulate what takes place on and over the bed.
2003.129_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,302.018,302.611,I'm mixed up.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,312.093,312.468,There--
2003.129_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,312.468,328.899,"Is... is it actually that you're saying... I may have misread this and so is it actually... you're saying if... if somebody... if the Governor of Virginia goes to the river with a bucket and takes water, a little bit of water, to wash some pans that he has, that they have to get Maryland's permission?"
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,333.631,334.788,--It's about both.
2003.129_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,334.788,334.989,All right.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,347.281,348.875,Yes.
2003.129_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,348.875,349.514,Yes.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,362.65,364.79,It's... it's about both.
2003.129_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,367.945,368.07,All right.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,371.413,372.866,"--Yes, because--"
2003.129_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,372.866,374.959,Because you can't take water out when you're thirsty.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,377.676,386.157,"--The... the objection is simply that Maryland has the right to regulate what takes place in its territory, and what takes place--"
2003.129_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,386.157,386.813,It doesn't.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,403.556,405.462,--I think that's a different question.
2003.129_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,405.681,406.351,No.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,417.114,421.923,--If they're taking... if they are... the low-water mark on the Virginia side--
2003.129_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,421.923,422.189,No.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,428.843,432.107,"--But I'm trying to understand the nature of your question, Justice Breyer."
2003.129_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,436.245,436.902,In Virginia.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,436.902,439.416,So they're building a trench in Virginia.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,439.416,439.791,"Yes, that's right."
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,439.791,447.305,"Maryland may have some objections to that at some future point in time, but that's activity that's taking place in Virginia."
2003.129_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,447.305,447.726,Yes.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,459.019,463.125,"Well, that may... that... I don't know whether that would actually change the--"
2003.129_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,463.125,464.641,I didn't want to get it mixed up.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,495.456,515.417,"--That imposes restrictions on the three major users of the Potomac River, the Washington Aqueduct, the Army Corps of Engineers, the... the Fairfax County Water Authority and the Washington Sanitary... Suburban Sanitary Commission, and imposes limitations on the amount of water that they can take--"
2003.129_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,515.417,517.448,"On the amount, but it acknowledges--"
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,517.448,517.744,--in periods of low flow.
2003.129_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,517.744,522.57,--that water can and will be removed by Fairfax County?
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,522.57,528.208,Subject to a permitting system that was in place at the time and still is in place.
2003.129_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,545.53,548.607,"Before you do that, can I ask a practical question?"
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,580.499,586.046,"Well, the Maryland administrative and judicial review proceedings answered that question no--"
2003.129_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,632.167,632.541,Why?
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,654.08,659.562,--Maryland had no objection to the Fairfax County Water Authority withdrawing water.
2003.129_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.67,666.465,What authority did you have to minimize the impact?
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,687.925,689.097,"Yes, it is."
2003.129_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.097,689.362,So.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,690.69,693.22,Because the riparian rights that--
2003.129_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.22,693.876,It was ugly?
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,693.876,700.061,"--Well, there was... that was part of it because it... it was in the scenic portion of the Potomac River."
2003.129_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,700.061,701.888,"Well, you should have reserved that right in the... in the compact."
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,709.122,721.133,"What the... what the compact does, Justice Scalia, is it provides that the Potomac River could be used as a common highway by the citizens of both States, and it also secures important private property rights."
2003.129_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,725.255,725.443,All right.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,732.268,733.986,That the States?
2003.129_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,733.986,737.094,"The State, the State of Virginia, the Commonwealth of Virginia."
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,742.452,742.826,That--
2003.129_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,742.826,744.357,It doesn't talk about the commonwealth.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,744.357,746.012,--That's exactly what this Court has said in--
2003.129_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,746.012,748.98,"Well, is that... I mean, is that a premise of your argument?"
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,748.98,750.308,--Yes.
2003.129_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,750.308,759.836,Do you... do you also deny that the State with respect to withdrawal of water for its citizens that the... do you deny that the State stands in the shoes of its citizens?
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,759.836,769.427,The... the State... the Commonwealth of Virginia brought this action on behalf of its citizens to seek--
2003.129_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,769.427,769.831,No.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,773.486,775.173,--No.
2003.129_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,776.797,793.727,"So, in effect, are you saying the State... it... it is just as though the State had express rights under article VII because in making the claim that it's making, it stands in the shoes of its citizens, and its citizens do have rights."
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,795.477,795.883,Yes.
2003.129_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,797.898,803.897,Then it's irrelevant that the... that article VII speaks only of citizens and not of the State.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,804.802,806.52,"--No, it's not irrelevant, Justice--"
2003.129_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,806.52,807.816,Then what... what difference does it make?
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,807.816,827.746,"--Because all that the compact does, it secures... it... it makes a... there is... the compact drafters recognized the difference between jurisdiction and sovereignty and private property rights, and when they wanted to, they knew exactly how to go about addressing issues of sovereignty."
2003.129_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,827.746,833.181,"Now, one of my questions in this case is this."
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,912.587,912.993,Yes.
2003.129_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,939.871,960.255,"Yes, but it said, as has been pointed out, that Virginia was given a proprietary right and a privilege to erect any structures necessary to the full enjoyment of Virginia's riparian ownership, which presumably encompasses taking out water."
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,960.255,978.513,"--And the presumption, Justice O'Connor, is overcome by looking at the rest of the award, and what the... the arbitrators did, they did give Virginia title to the middle of other bodies of water, namely the... the Tangier Sound, the Pocomoke Sound, and the Pocomoke River."
2003.129_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,980.496,992.116,"Yes, but do you deny that Virginia has riparian ownership up to the low-water mark of the Potomac?"
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,992.116,1003.659,"--The arbitrators said that Virginia has full dominion over this right in the soil up to low-water mark, but beyond that point, Virginia only has a right to use the river."
2003.129_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1009.469,1010.391,But it says--
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,1017.98,1024.617,"A right of use, Justice Scalia, is subject to governmental authority and regulation, and that's exactly what this Court said--"
2003.129_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1024.617,1036.426,"Well, but it says here in the Black-Jenkins Award and in the earlier compact, the privilege to erect structures necessary to the full enjoyment of the riparian ownership."
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,1040.019,1059.573,"--This Court has said in, for example, Massachusetts v. New York that Massachusetts' right to use Lake Ontario was still subject to the regulatory authority of New York because New York had title to the bed of Lake Ontario."
2003.129_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.573,1061.556,"Mr. Baida, can I ask you sort of a basic question?"
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,1084.782,1091.107,"The... Maryland is to treat them identically, and that's set forth clearly in article VII of the compact."
2003.129_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1091.107,1096.949,"So that either... on either side of the river, a property owner could stick a pipe in and drain the river."
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,1096.949,1112.442,"Not... not if it has any kind of adverse impact from Maryland's perspective, whether it's in Maryland... if... if the City of Rockville wanted to do this, it would encounter presumably exactly the same kind of reaction that Fairfax County initially did."
2003.129_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1112.442,1122.298,You say the riparian rights on either side of the river are subject to the paramount authority of the Maryland... the State of Maryland to... to govern what happens to the water.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,1122.298,1123.829,Yes.
2003.129_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1123.829,1136.588,"And... and in the exercise of that authority, could Maryland give a higher priority to the citizens of Rockville than to the citizens of Vienna, Virginia?"
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,1136.588,1145.913,"No, and this Court said in Yates v. Milwaukee that... that the riparian right cannot be arbitrarily and capriciously denied."
2003.129_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1146.288,1146.507,No.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,1154.925,1155.941,"--Well, Your Honor, I think--"
2003.129_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1155.941,1163.813,And... and what is... what is the source for your statement that Maryland has to be non-arbitrary?
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,1171.325,1184.319,--I... I think it's again set forth in Yates v. Milwaukee where the Court said that a State cannot... or a government... municipality cannot arbitrarily and capriciously deny someone the exercise of a riparian right.
2003.129_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1184.319,1185.943,So in your opinion--
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,1189.505,1190.864,Yes.
2003.129_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1194.393,1195.737,So we're talking about... all we're talking about is property rights here.
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,1198.408,1199.22,--Yes.
2003.129_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1235.518,1236.595,So your opinion is--
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,1256.633,1259.367,--And I think it's also required by the Constitution.
2003.129_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1259.367,1260.788,Your... your point--
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,1262.818,1264.412,I think the Due Process Clause.
2003.129_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1269.254,1272.206,"Oh, but that's just an obligation it has as to all of its citizens."
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,1275.314,1277.719,No.
2003.129_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1312.659,1319.0,"What was wrong with the Special Master saying, yes, Maryland has this 1632 decree."
2003.129_orig,0,15564,andrew_h_baida,,1365.029,1379.117,"--Justice Ginsburg, the... the flaw in the reasoning is that it ignores the plain language of the charter which this Court said includes the Potomac River in unmistakable terms to the further bank."

2003.129_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1797.37,1799.058,Very well.

2003.129_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1818.829,1821.876,Does that plain language tell us what riparian rights are?
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,1821.876,1829.233,--The plain language of article IV of the Black-Jenkins Award uses the term riparian ownership.
2003.129_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1829.233,1833.575,"But you said plain language of the compact, and now you're all of a sudden talking about Black-Jenkins."
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,1833.575,1833.95,It's both.
2003.129_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1833.95,1835.668,The compact does not use the word riparian.
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,1835.668,1836.542,That... That's correct.
2003.129_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1838.573,1842.524,So you say it's the plain language of the compact with the gloss of the Black-Jenkins Award.
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,1842.524,1843.352,--We think it's both.

2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,1862.374,1876.651,"That's... that's correct because the enabling legislation for the Black-Jenkins Award provided that neither of the States would be deprived of any of the rights or privileges, nor would the citizens be deprived of rights or privileges that they had under the Compact of 1785."
2003.129_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1876.651,1877.103,How... I'm sorry.
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,1890.63,1899.407,"Your Honor, the citizens in Virginia only had those rights under the compact because Virginia as a sovereign entered into an interstate compact with Maryland."

2003.129_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1927.942,1930.832,So that sovereignty is inherent in ownership?
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,1930.832,1935.096,I think that's correct.
2003.129_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1981.983,1991.729,"Except for the sense of the document, at least of the compact, as I read it, is that the State is treated just like any other owner."

2003.129_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1996.352,2000.945,--in the compacts or the... or the Black-Jenkins Award to the contrary?
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2000.945,2004.521,"Well, the Black-Jenkins Award clearly deals with Virginia as a State."

2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2057.375,2058.0,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.129_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.139,2068.386,For the preservation of fish or for the performance... for preserving and keeping open the channel?
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2068.386,2070.181,That's correct.
2003.129_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2070.181,2077.007,Has... has Virginia issued... is a Virginia fishing license valid in the... in the Potomac?

2003.129_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2132.453,2132.844,Yes.
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2135.203,2156.46,"No, Your Honor, because we contend that no permit was required in the first instance, and we also challenged that specific permit because the Maryland legislature required that it contain a condition requiring the water authority to put a flow restrictor into the pipeline for the sole purpose, the Maryland legislature said, of allowing Maryland to control growth and development in northern Virginia."
2003.129_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2162.395,2166.986,So we're... we're talking now about a flow restrictor in the pipe?
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2166.986,2167.596,--That's correct.
2003.129_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2167.596,2168.455,"I mean, that's what it comes down to."
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2168.455,2168.939,That's correct.
2003.129_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2170.236,2179.686,"Well, but Virginia objects on general principle, I take it, to the idea that Maryland can restrict the amount of water it takes out of... of the Potomac."
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2179.686,2185.292,"--That's exactly right, and I don't mean to say my answer is limited to just the Fairfax County Water Authority."
2003.129_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2196.881,2202.332,But do you... what about the general right of a riparian owner on a river to withdraw water?
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2207.595,2210.172,"I don't believe that that would be a riparian right, Your Honor."
2003.129_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2210.172,2218.123,"Well, then who decides what limit can be... can be imposed on the riparian owner's right to withdraw water?"
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2218.123,2225.417,"With respect to the Potomac River, there's a low flow allocation agreement in place that Congress required which allocates the flows during periods of low flow."
2003.129_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2237.192,2238.489,But assume there are no agreements.
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2252.64,2253.749,--No.
2003.129_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2255.029,2256.154,Could you drain the river?
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2256.154,2260.87,"Not under the low flow agreement and not under the water supply coordination agreement, absolutely not."
2003.129_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.87,2261.183,No.
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2277.895,2279.223,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.129_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2288.235,2288.954,"Well, they weren't talking about the Potomac River."

2003.129_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.11,2331.529,I'm just trying to... trying to... we have an original jurisdiction case involving a fight between two States.

2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2349.538,2350.163,It could be here.

2003.129_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2387.384,2390.398,And that's Federal common law because two States are involved?
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2390.398,2391.148,That's correct.
2003.129_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2398.3,2398.503,All right.
2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2417.887,2425.759,"Under... under our view of the case, no, because the compact gave that citizen the right to do it, subject to Federal regulations, subject to Virginia regulation."
2003.129_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2435.115,2439.346,Is that what the Special Master specifically held in your view?

2003.129_orig,1,41932,stuart_a_raphael,,2487.859,2488.858,--That's exactly right.
