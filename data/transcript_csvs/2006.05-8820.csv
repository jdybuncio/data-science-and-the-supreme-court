2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.014,We'll hear arguments next in Lawrence v. Florida.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,5.468,8.967,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,105.567,108.925,"It would presumably, though, be limited in some ways."
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,120.077,121.467,"--Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,143.553,148.127,You're saying the application is the application... the petition for certiorari is the application?
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,148.127,148.643,"--No, sir."
2006.05-8820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.121,168.916,"Well, we can't act on it unless, unless it's final."
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,174.211,175.414,"Well, except--"
2006.05-8820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.414,178.194,How can it be final action and yet still be pending?
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,178.194,188.362,"--To utilize the word ""final"" there would be... we can use the word ""final"" after a jury determination and that in one effect, in one sense, is final."
2006.05-8820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.029,206.011,It's final as far as the application for state review is concerned.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,206.011,209.494,There... it is the--
2006.05-8820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,209.494,210.899,Which is the text that we're dealing with here.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,210.899,211.243,--Yes.
2006.05-8820,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,222.193,229.096,"I take it you're talking about language, if I followed it, in 2244(d)(2)."
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,229.096,229.752,"Yes, sir."
2006.05-8820,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,229.752,233.236,And it tolled the statute while the
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,264.034,264.519,"Yes, sir."
2006.05-8820,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,264.519,265.347,But it is pending.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,265.347,267.112,"Yes, sir that is--"
2006.05-8820,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,267.112,268.299,That's where we are in this argument.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,268.299,269.985,--That is exactly our position.
2006.05-8820,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,269.985,270.547,Thank you.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,270.547,273.313,That this application is pending.
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,273.313,290.633,"Of course, the other way to read the language is that the state application is final... otherwise you couldn't file the Federal petition for certiorari, and that petition may affect what happens with your application for state relief, but the state application itself is final and over."
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,290.633,296.256,In that sense it is not final in that it can be altered and that this Court can order--
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,296.256,299.021,"Well, it has to be final before you can file a petition for cert.--"
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,299.021,299.598,"--Yes, sir."
2006.05-8820,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,302.441,303.8,Does it say that?
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,321.48,322.324,--Yes.
2006.05-8820,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,322.324,324.479,So it doesn't require a final state application.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,328.54,330.179,"Yes, that's exactly true, sir."
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,330.179,354.233,"--So what about the argument raised by your friend that exhaustion doesn't require filing a petition for certiorari, that the state procedures are considered fully exhausted upon the final decision in the state court and that it makes sense to treat this, this 2244, in a parallel way with respect to the exhaustion requirement?"
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,354.233,365.946,"Well, Your Honor, first of all, it would require this Court to substitute the word ""exhaustion"" for the word ""pending"" in the statute."
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,407.695,418.487,"How do you know what is pending with respect to when the state defendant, movant, doesn't file a petition for certiorari?"
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,419.346,420.096,"Well, I believe."
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,420.096,425.048,--Is the state post-conviction application still pending on the 90th day?
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,425.048,439.917,"I believe it is, Your Honor, and I think the logic that this Court has used in the context of 2255's obtains as well, and it... it is pending because the reason that we have 90 days... it's an unusual amount of time that we have to come to ask this Court for relief."
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,448.772,455.894,"Well, anybody who wants the additional time... this law was passed to prevent people from delaying."
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,459.33,483.93,"I would suggest to you, Your Honor, that it should be... this should be construed the same way that the finality of a state conviction, the finality of a Federal conviction, and the finality of a 2255 are determined, and that is at the time that either this Court has dealt with certiorari by denying or granting it or that 90 days has, has been--"
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,483.93,487.788,But if you filed... so you say you get 90 days whether you file or not?
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,487.788,488.865,"--Yes, I do, sir."
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,488.865,498.096,"But if you want the additional time that it takes for an opposition, for waiver of response, for this court to dispose of it, then you have to file a petition for cert?"
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,498.096,500.423,"I don't... that is not my position, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,505.093,505.749,Right.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,505.749,510.857,--that practitioners will not be making this error because they will be acting in concert--
2006.05-8820,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,510.857,537.736,"But the Chief's point is that if a petition is in fact found it will end up being more than 90 days because then you would have, in addition to the 90 days you'd have to file the cert petition, the time it takes for this Court to dispose of the petition, and the statute of limitations would be tolled throughout that entire period, not just a fixed 90 days."
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,537.736,540.22,"--That is true, ma'am."
2006.05-8820,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,540.22,571.347,"Do you... does your argument mean that a defendant who wanted to file within the 90 days, wanted to file in the district court, wanted to file the habeas application in the district court within the 90 days, couldn't do so because it would be premature because the, the state application is still pending?"
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,571.347,587.528,"I believe that the way that we have been seeing the opinions come from this Court and from the various courts around the country are that there seems to be a favorable disposition to protective 2254, 2255 petitions."
2006.05-8820,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,612.877,621.811,Do you read the tolling provision in 2263(B) the same way as you read the tolling provision that's before us?
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,621.811,622.28,No.
2006.05-8820,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,659.266,665.028,"Do you think Congress really wanted to have two different, entirely different tolling concepts in these provisions?"
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,665.028,699.28,"I think they did, and one of the reasons that I believe that they did, number one was to achieve their goal of moving things faster if the states were able to guarantee counsel, and the second is that they told, as well, in 2263(B) the main difference between 2263(A) and (B)(1) is that the time when you're getting your certiorari petition ready for this Court under the opt-in provision is not tolled."
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,746.074,760.459,"You know, what about 2244(D)(1)(a) where Congress referred expressly to the time for seeking direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review?"
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,781.747,786.23,"Well, the distinction, I have at least two things to say about that."
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,810.937,820.169,"Well, they would have just said during the time of the application for state post-conviction, or the expiration of the time for seeking review of it."
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,820.169,832.476,"--I believe that Congress is presumed to have read, written its laws knowing the history of interpretation of this Court."
2006.05-8820,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,904.633,910.71,"Do you think the final, the judgment in the criminal case is still pending because it can be acted upon?"
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,910.71,926.079,"Not the judgment in the criminal case, but I would suggest that the judgment in the 22... I mean the 385.1 procedures in Florida which would be that post-conviction application because that's where we are."
2006.05-8820,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,935.325,950.257,"Are you saying, are you arguing that there, during this period, there is an application for state relief pending in the state courts or that there is an application for state relief pending in this Court?"
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,950.257,961.488,"I am saying that the application in state court is yet pending when it is here, because that court can be ordered by--"
2006.05-8820,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,961.488,962.174,Where is it pending?
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,962.174,963.08,--this Court to act upon it.
2006.05-8820,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,963.08,964.643,Where is it pending?
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,964.643,972.514,It is pending still in state court because this Court can order that court.
2006.05-8820,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,972.514,979.136,I thought your argument on brief was that it is pending here and the statute says pending.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,999.145,1000.611,"Yes, ma'am."
2006.05-8820,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1020.979,1030.63,In the same sense that it is pending after the trial court has acted but before the defendant or the petitioner decides whether he wants a state appeal.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1030.63,1031.426,"Yes, sir."
2006.05-8820,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1031.426,1032.473,I don't know where it's pending.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1047.733,1048.233,Yes.
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1048.64,1055.308,But in what sense is it an application for state post-conviction review when it's pending before us?
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1060.962,1061.79,You are--
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1061.79,1066.273,"--but it's not an application, it's an application for our review, not state post-conviction review."
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1066.273,1069.788,--It began as a complaint.
2006.05-8820,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1113.239,1115.659,"It's a Federal writ, isn't it?"
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1121.486,1126.297,But it comes under this Court's appellate jurisdiction versus its original jurisdiction for writs of certiorari.
2006.05-8820,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1126.297,1137.293,"If you succeed you're going to get an order from this Court to the state court say, saying, go back in this state proceeding that has been begun, and do it right."
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1143.509,1144.445,"Yes, sir."
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1178.605,1187.413,"Do you have any, I suppose this, we ought to know better, but how long the average disposition time is for a petition for certiorari in a case like this?"
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1187.413,1190.255,I believe it's like 44 days if you don't--
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1190.255,1190.599,No.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1207.592,1209.42,--It's not usually that long.
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1211.748,1214.294,"Well, why don't you take, let's just if say you take 90 days, and you get--"
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1214.294,1214.979,--You get 42 or so.
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1214.979,1215.745,--And you get a two month extension.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1215.745,1216.276,Yes.
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1216.276,1222.289,Then you get another month for the opposition depending on what circuit you're from for the extension.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1233.159,1233.956,"It could, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1233.956,1252.215,"Now I guess... my question is, in a law that imposed a one-year statute of limitation, is this an implicit additional, I realize it's a question begging to some extent, but implicitly an additional six-month period would strike me as odd."
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1252.215,1257.12,"Well, Your Honor, it is not a one-year statute of limitations per se."
2006.05-8820,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1278.641,1290.98,"Let me ask on that, Ms. Bonner, what typically in Florida is the time elapsed between the conclusion of the criminal proceeding and the conclusion of the state collateral relief?"
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1290.98,1291.855,It's quite a while.
2006.05-8820,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1293.215,1294.666,"But it's more than six months, I assume."
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1294.666,1295.901,"It's a long time, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1296.276,1297.447,"Two, three, four, five years."
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1297.447,1297.806,"--Yes, sir."
2006.05-8820,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1297.806,1300.946,"And all that time, the statute has been tolled?"
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1300.946,1303.398,"Exactly, till it's... that's why I don't look at exactly--"
2006.05-8820,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1303.398,1306.568,The question is whether there may be another six months added on to that five or six-year period.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1306.568,1307.193,"--Yes, sir."
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1309.348,1314.985,"Well, the reason that's tolled is because it's designed to encourage the exhaustion of the state procedures."
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1319.563,1323.498,--But it's the state petition which is pending for your review.
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1380.163,1387.661,Any... any statistics on how many petitions for cert from state post-conviction collateral review are granted?
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1395.953,1402.935,"I don't know how many are granted, Your Honor, but one thing that struck me as I was reading through these cases is that many are granted to the state."
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1431.096,1434.657,"No, but if the state is petitioning for cert it means you've won."
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1434.657,1436.045,It means you've won.
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1436.045,1437.92,So presumably you're not looking forward to further--
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1437.92,1439.811,No.
2006.05-8820,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1443.403,1449.776,I suppose you'd have to file a protective petition with the district court saying we won but we might still lose.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1449.776,1450.385,I guess.
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1482.996,1485.059,--Assuming you make the same argument you make on questions 2 and 3 about--
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1486.807,1488.464,I'm sorry.
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1488.9,1496.71,I would be very surprised if the court found you were out of time because the state had filed a petition for certiorari.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1496.71,1497.896,--I'd be surprised--
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1497.896,1498.443,And have it granted.
2006.05-8820,0,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,1498.443,1530.805,"--I'd be surprised too, but I've practiced a long time and I've seen some very odd things happen in courts and, both a stay and abey, and the other procedures that have been discussed by this Court have not been handed down as mandates to the lower court to require the lower court to rule in a certain way, or to absolutely stay, or to entertain protective motions and then permit those protective motions to be supplemented at a time later."
2006.05-8820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1535.569,1536.334,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1545.237,1565.261,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner's case amounts to no more than a disagreement with AEDPA's recognized policies and procedures, and an improper attempt to convert ignorance of settled law into an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable relief."
2006.05-8820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.237,1594.717,"Mr. Kise, can I ask you what your view in this matter would be if the Court grants certiorari, would the application be pending during the period that the case is under advisement in this Court?"
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1594.717,1595.56,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1601.713,1603.385,Either way.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1603.385,1610.992,"Well, in both circumstances the answer would be no, and in both circumstances I think the relief that would be accorded--"
2006.05-8820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1610.992,1611.789,Let me ask a second question.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1621.222,1629.407,"--It may be pending in state court during the further proceedings, but it's not pending during the time that it is at this Court, because this Court has not--"
2006.05-8820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1629.407,1632.311,"So it started pending again after an interruption, is that the way it would be?"
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1632.311,1635.622,"--Based on equitable principles, I think that would be the interpretation, yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1635.622,1637.871,"Forget about equitable principles, statutory principles."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1649.929,1654.241,"You're using the phraseology interruption, and I would, would--"
2006.05-8820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.241,1658.441,"Well, period when it's not pending followed by a period when it begins to pend."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1658.441,1665.189,"--In that unusual circumstance, Your Honor, I think principles of equitable tolling would apply to keep the petitioner's ability to file."
2006.05-8820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1665.189,1670.625,"But there would be no statutory right in your view, it would depend on the equitable considerations?"
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1670.625,1689.491,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor, because statutory pending contemplates a finality, it contemplates... and I think that this is, it is one of the fundamental problems, I believe, with petitioner's construction, is this ignoring of not only the plain language of the statute but what this Court has said about this statute, about 2244(d)(2)."
2006.05-8820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1698.91,1709.437,"But it doesn't say state pending or pending in state court, and what I want to do is go back and ask a question somewhat along the lines that Justice Stevens asked."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1724.477,1727.242,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe it is, and I believe that's what this Court said--"
2006.05-8820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1727.242,1737.783,"By the same token, why isn't it pending between the final disposition by the state appellate court and the determination to seek cert here?"
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1737.783,1739.299,"--Well, I have two answers to that, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1749.436,1751.201,That was the issue in that case.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1752.872,1755.792,"--Correct, Your Honor, but the language utilized nevertheless--"
2006.05-8820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1755.792,1761.836,"I can't when I write something, I don't think I or anyone else can, if it happens to be a state case, refrain from using the word state."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1769.881,1771.802,"--Fair enough, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1779.377,1782.704,But why isn't your sister's answer to that adequate?
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1793.419,1801.336,"--I would, I would respectfully disagree with that, with that nondistinction, if you will, Your Honor, in the sense that the application--"
2006.05-8820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1801.336,1809.474,"So you're distinguishing between a state judgment and an application upon which further, further proceedings can be had."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1811.644,1817.595,"--Because I would, I would disagree with the notion that further proceedings could be had on that application."
2006.05-8820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1823.235,1830.31,"Let's assume that the, the petition for cert is granted and this Court grants relief."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1855.112,1867.326,"I would say, Your Honor, that the state application may be the subject matter of what you are looking at from a subject matter standpoint, but what the Court is ruling on is the petition for certiorari, which was a Federal court ruling on--"
2006.05-8820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1867.326,1893.205,"It's a petition for certiorari to review action taken on a state petition, just as at the state level, whatever may be the, the nomenclature for filing an appeal from the state trial court to the state appellate court, is an application which relates entirely to the original application for relief that was filed in the state trial court."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1897.501,1906.262,"--And I would respectfully disagree, Your Honor, because I don't see how it can be final for 1257 purposes and still pending for purposes of the statute."
2006.05-8820,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1906.262,1906.997,But that... that--
2006.05-8820,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1906.997,1911.869,It's the application that is not subject to review.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1917.507,1920.351,"In this case, Your Honor, the application is the state court."
2006.05-8820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1946.184,1949.402,But they would correct it if we told them to.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1949.402,1964.114,"In that circumstance, yes, Your Honor, certainly they would in a circumstance, in the very unusual circumstance where this Court were to accept certiorari and then subsequent to the acceptance of certiorari, then reverse the ruling."
2006.05-8820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1964.114,1974.0,"And when it got back in the state supreme court, they would still be working on the application that had been pending until the end of the proceedings down there, and then suddenly came back to life after we sent it back."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1974.0,1977.39,"Yes, Your Honor, but that is, again, the extraordinary circumstance."
2006.05-8820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1996.227,2005.723,"I think what you're saying, though, is when you have ambiguous language, a sensible rule is not a rule, it has to have a lot of exceptions to make sense."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2008.94,2009.923,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2029.51,2032.118,Those are the most likely where people are going to get mixed up.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2126.814,2131.109,"Thank you, Justice Breyer, and I would respectfully answer your question I think in three ways."
2006.05-8820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2203.626,2206.266,Can I ask... it seems very strange to me.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2230.833,2232.677,"Exactly my point, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.63,2233.833,No.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2242.281,2245.406,"There isn't a need to cover us up, Your Honor, because you've won in state court."
2006.05-8820,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2245.406,2248.92,Provided equitable--
2006.05-8820,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2248.92,2252.31,You're worried about winning in the Supreme Court.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2252.31,2257.355,"In the one in 1,000 or one in 5,000 cases, equitable principles would then apply."
2006.05-8820,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2267.178,2276.816,--But you're asking us to say that the Congress has written a statute which doesn't take account that the state might sometimes file a petition for certiorari that would be granted.
2006.05-8820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2282.313,2282.954,--Would you advise a client that way?
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2285.124,2285.827,Well--
2006.05-8820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.827,2293.777,You've won here and the state is taking certiorari to the Supreme Court.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2307.834,2319.205,"--I don't think there would be... I think it would be ill advised to, to direct a petitioner to file in Federal court under those circumstances because there would be nothing to file."
2006.05-8820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2320.329,2320.875,I agree.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2320.875,2322.36,There would be absolutely nothing to file.
2006.05-8820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2322.36,2331.949,The irony of your position is that it has those harshest consequences in those rare cases where there was a denial of constitutional right.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2331.949,2341.118,"Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree that it has its harshest consequences, because that's where the equitable tolling principles would in fact apply."
2006.05-8820,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2341.118,2344.96,--Why do you need equitable tolling?
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2381.992,2382.711,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2382.711,2388.911,So why shouldn't it be the same way for collateral review as it is for direct review?
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2409.965,2417.196,"I would say it's different, Your Honor, respectfully, for two reasons: One, because this Court has said that direct review is different in numerous cases."
2006.05-8820,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2437.828,2475.126,"Well that means, that means that if a petitioner who has had his state application for collateral relief denied wants to petition this Court, but doesn't want to lose out on the possibility of seeking Federal habeas, that prisoner has to do two things at the same time: One, prepare a petition for cert; and the other is to prepare, prepare a complaint to file in a Federal district court."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2483.747,2489.714,"Well, Your Honor, I would say that in many circumstances that would be the case, but not always the case."
2006.05-8820,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2506.317,2507.426,"Here there were 31 days, right?"
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2507.426,2510.55,"--Then they would need to file... yes, Your Honor, and they would need to--"
2006.05-8820,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2510.55,2515.046,They'd have to file a Federal court complaint and a cert petition within the 31 days.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2515.046,2515.828,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2615.694,2622.567,"Is it, is it clear that he can go to district... I mean, I'm not familiar with how these things work."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2638.168,2640.512,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe there can."
2006.05-8820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2641.589,2642.573,District courts do that?
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2647.93,2650.914,"--Well, I don't know that they would be considering the exact same issues, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.21,2659.801,"You're sure that happens, that while cert is pending here there is a habeas proceeding ongoing in district court?"
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2659.801,2668.235,"--Well, I certainly hope that in the 10 of the 11 circuits that have agreed with Florida's position here that that is happening, because if not then they are at risk, depending on how--"
2006.05-8820,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2668.235,2681.027,"Wouldn't a district judge who knows that there's a cert petition pending just say: Well, I'll wait; this petition will be held pending the Supreme Court's disposition of cert.--"
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2681.027,2685.383,--I would respectfully say to Your Honor that it's not an automatic stay.
2006.05-8820,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2722.697,2726.462,"Well, I'll accept your view as being the personal experience."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2734.021,2736.285,"Well, they may not have to--"
2006.05-8820,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2736.285,2741.799,"I'm not sure if I would tell the district courts that's what they ought to do, is a wise expenditure of resources."
2006.05-8820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2743.408,2747.469,"Well, I mean, it sort of depends on how often cert is going to be granted, doesn't it?"
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2768.35,2770.116,"--I think that's exactly right, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2779.644,2783.094,But isn't it true the real problem with the capital cases?
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2788.109,2789.186,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.186,2796.948,"In the non-capital cases there is an interest in promptness, but the longer the guy stays in jail is not going to prejudice the state."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2818.658,2821.454,"Well, it may be that long."
2006.05-8820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2842.632,2844.788,That's if you're formally right on the metaphysical question.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2902.984,2904.764,"I think it's partly fair, Your Honor."
2006.05-8820,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2942.421,2946.279,"--Mr. Kise, there are two applications."
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2988.652,2998.539,"Well, respectfully, Your Honor... and I know that that is the petitioner's argument and I see that you have given me that question, but I don't know that it is that much of a choice."
2006.05-8820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3072.166,3077.586,Let me be clear on your answer to Justice Stevens' earlier question.
2006.05-8820,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,3096.374,3104.933,"I think once it's back in the state system then it would have to be considered pending, because the statute contemplates that while it's part of the state process it would be pending."
2006.05-8820,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3109.823,3111.119,"Thank you, Mr. Kise."
2006.05-8820,2,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,3113.119,3113.962,"Thank you, sir."
2006.05-8820,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3178.063,3184.028,Records don't have to... typically are not filed with the petition for cert. So the record would be back in the lower court.
2006.05-8820,2,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,3184.028,3185.918,So that solves that.
2006.05-8820,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3186.824,3195.321,"Just to be clear, it is your position that to get... you think everyone's entitled to the additional 90 days whether they file or not."
2006.05-8820,2,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,3195.321,3196.022,"--Yes, I do."
2006.05-8820,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3196.022,3205.66,"To get the additional time for an opposition that would be considered here, you have to file the petition for cert. In other words, if you don't file after the 90th day it's no longer pending."
2006.05-8820,2,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,3205.66,3205.879,Absolutely.
2006.05-8820,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3205.879,3206.144,Okay.
2006.05-8820,2,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,3217.5,3221.044,Why is my position that they would not?
2006.05-8820,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3221.044,3221.67,Wouldn't that lead to that result?
2006.05-8820,2,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,3232.634,3243.739,"Well, Congress couldn't have been too concerned about that 90 days because it certainly permitted the trigger to have the 90 days included within it, and this Court has allowed the 90 days--"
2006.05-8820,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3243.739,3244.239,--I'm sorry.
2006.05-8820,2,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,3245.348,3249.441,"--A, 2242(b)(A)."
2006.05-8820,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3249.441,3249.644,Yes.

2006.05-8820,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3266.637,3267.637,Does your argument--
2006.05-8820,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3267.637,3277.101,I guess you could also say that except in capital cases the defendant will not have an incentive to delay.
2006.05-8820,2,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,3278.507,3280.052,"Of course, of course."

2006.05-8820,2,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,3327.675,3328.613,Oh yes.
2006.05-8820,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3328.613,3329.174,The death penalty.
2006.05-8820,2,35515,mary_catherine_bonner,,3329.174,3329.768,Oh yes.
