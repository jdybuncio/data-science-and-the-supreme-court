1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,11.905,14.954,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.79-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.752,131.431,"Mr. Smith, you say that the question presented is whether the Secretary of Interior must reserve indefinitely the 3 million acres reserved or mentioned in the Carey Act."
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,137.307,161.337,"Well, that's the way the -- Mr. -- Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the case originally arose on the -- on the State's application for 27,400 acre tract to reserve that under the temporary withdrawal statute of 1910 which permits the State to ask for a temporary segregation in advance of a plan."
1979.79-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,250.13,259.872,"The -- the State is bound by the case or controversy and all the other related requirements of Article III, the same way any other litigant in its --"
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,259.872,263.855,That's -- that's -- I -- I couldn't agree with you more.
1979.79-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,323.151,332.337,"But what if we were to say that the Secretary's action in declining the 27,000 acres where a request was perfectly proper."
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,339.646,356.939,"I think that -- I think that you would have to go on to the extent that we have this judgment binding the Secretary of Interior to reserve, you know, on the event -- the 3 million acres on the eventuality --"
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,356.939,364.114,"(Voice Overlap) if we just make a judgment, that would get rid of it, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,364.114,377.944,"Indeed, it would get rid of it, although, I think, you know, I think that there is a -- you know, a case or a controversy between the parties as to the -- as to the meaning of the Act and because I think that the -- the State has brought a lawsuit."
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,386.966,400.641,"Do you think the -- do you think the District Court held that if -- and the Court of Appeals that if -- that if the Secretary has withdrawn and put to other federal uses, all the public lands."
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,419.251,419.691,Yes.
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,419.691,422.57,And that he could not arbitrarily deny it.
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,426.413,440.964,"Oh, but I think -- I -- I think that the -- I think that the fact that the District Court and, you know, granted the States -- you know, request for the prayer for declamatory relief ordering the Secretary to have withdrawn, that Idaho was entitled to have withdrawn and patented 3 million acres of land."
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,455.747,456.561,And so answer your to my --

1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,458.964,459.969,-- I would violate the judgment.
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,459.969,463.728,"Your answer to my question is that yes, the District Court did hold that --"
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,463.728,463.78,Yes.
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,463.78,466.097,-- he would have to reclassify or --
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,466.097,466.311,Yes.
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.311,466.554,-- or --
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,466.554,466.974,-- I think that's --
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.974,469.164,-- withdraw this land.
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,469.164,469.865,I think that's right.
1979.79-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,472.806,494.374,"Do you think that the day after the Carey Act was passed, Idaho could've gone in the Federal District Court in Idaho and asked for -- to serve of a declaratory judgment not that it was ready with any plan but just requiring the Secretary to make sure it didn't let the original 1 million acres go?"
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,494.374,500.501,"Well, if the Idaho -- you know I think, we would take the position that Idaho would not be entitled to, you know, that kind of relief."
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,516.769,518.557,"Yes, but not assured."
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,538.111,538.131,Exactly.
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,538.131,541.772,"And it doesn't need to reserve anything, no matter how much land is available."
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,542.601,543.022,That's our position.
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,543.022,552.898,"And if -- if that is your position, it seems -- it seems to me that Idaho certainly has a -- has a case or controversy with you."
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,553.514,553.55,Yes.
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,553.55,558.356,-- is this to view the Government expressed Idaho in the administrative proceedings?
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,558.356,561.224,Is this the view that the Government expressed Idaho in the administrative proceedings?
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.261,561.495,Yes.
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,565.821,566.579,Exactly.
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,566.579,572.258,"As long as at least -- as long as some land is on withdrawn, at least as long as there are some available."
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,576.744,576.875,Exactly.
1979.79-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,576.875,578.146,-- in complete discretion.
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,578.146,578.676,Exactly.
1979.79-260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.05,588.94,"(Voice Overlap) objected that right, didn't it?"
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,588.94,591.162,The District Court rejected the argument that the --

1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,597.913,599.113,Yes.
1979.79-260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,599.113,601.763,I know there is in the judgment but in its opinion.
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,601.763,602.673,I think so.
1979.79-260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,602.673,617.569,And you think so.
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,617.569,634.785,"If you look on -- if may I refer the Court to page 18A of the appendix to the petition, where the Court says that in -- in presenting a grant of title did not occur under the Carey Act seems quite clear from the language of the Act, the legislative history, administrative interpretations and court interpretations all be a dicta."
1979.79-260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.299,650.685,They didn't argue that in your point.
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,657.469,664.115,"That they had a present grant of 3 million acres -- well, I mean, the District Court interpreted the -- you know, their claim to and then present a grant as --"
1979.79-260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,664.115,664.343,So that's what they allege.

1979.79-260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.729,697.462,"This argument was weighed -- made, as I understood it, to say that the 27,000 acres that had been preempted for highway rights away or something like that, I forget what it was, that that preemption by the Secretary was invalid -- reservation by the Secretary was invalid because it had -- the land had previously been made available to the State."
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,698.964,699.303,No.
1979.79-260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.434,735.902,"How much is available still, some 11 million acres, isn't there?"

1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,753.354,766.872,"I think, Mr. Justice Stevens, that the controversy is right to the extent that the -- that the State has asked the District Court and the District Court has granted this declaratory relief essentially."
1979.79-260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,766.872,771.862,"And supposing you vacated the territory relief and start all over, how would anybody be heard?"
1979.79-260,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,780.048,780.277,That -- that may well be --

1979.79-260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,804.214,808.677,"Well, why do they need it until they've asked for some land that they haven't been allowed to get?"

1979.79-260,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,830.511,832.663,I think their complaint isn't in the appendix.

1979.79-260,1,21172,david_h_leroy,,1925.731,1927.074,-- was the Secretary's discretion.
1979.79-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.074,1927.616,But do you contend --
1979.79-260,1,21172,david_h_leroy,,1927.616,1927.81,But --

1979.79-260,1,21172,david_h_leroy,,1929.368,1940.737,What the District Court suggested is that we have an opportunity to go back in and should have if the Carey Act is properly interpreted to petition for reclassification which Idaho would do.
1979.79-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1952.144,1955.504,"Well, I'm still not quite clear on your answer to my question."

1979.79-260,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.333,1981.937,"On the merits of this question, are you -- do you claim that you should -- that that reclassification must be granted --"
1979.79-260,1,21172,david_h_leroy,,1981.937,1984.56,We claim as the District Court suggested --
1979.79-260,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.56,1986.803,"-- on this 27,000?"
1979.79-260,1,21172,david_h_leroy,,1986.803,1989.392,We -- we would so claim yes.
1979.79-260,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.56,2008.39,"Well, do you -- you deny then that a withdrawal by the Secretary for another use for the United States is enough to defeat a Carey Act claim?"
1979.79-260,1,21172,david_h_leroy,,2008.39,2010.914,"Yes, we would per se when the Secretary --"
1979.79-260,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2010.914,2011.978,Would you do?
1979.79-260,1,21172,david_h_leroy,,2011.978,2018.386,"We do, when the Secretary -- especially when the Secretary per se, contends that he has no authority."
1979.79-260,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2018.386,2028.716,"What if his claim was ""Well, you don't get this land because we've already withdrawn it for some other purpose,"" and that's enough of a reason."
1979.79-260,1,21172,david_h_leroy,,2028.716,2039.03,Then we would not so -- we would not so contend that we would be automatically entitled to the land because we have rejected of the in present theory which we presented to the District Court.
1979.79-260,1,21172,david_h_leroy,,2050.712,2053.11,Let me pursue it because I want to be sure that I understand your position.
1979.79-260,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2067.099,2067.377,Yes.
1979.79-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2067.703,2067.976,I see.
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2078.636,2080.19,That's correct.
1979.79-260,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.19,2104.219,"Well -- well, then, suppose the Secretary had withdrawn for stock purposes or for all sorts of things all but 2 million acres of the public land in Idaho and then Idaho came in and made a -- and made a present claim for 3 million acres."

1979.79-260,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2169.351,2182.395,Was -- what you're saying that the Carey Act is the factor that the Secretary has to take into consideration in passing on any application for withdrawal of public lands?
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2182.395,2185.445,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it -- it is in this sense."
1979.79-260,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.624,2282.91,May I ask you another question?
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2298.192,2310.444,"Not -- not automatically, Your Honor, for the acreage and entitlement and reservation and potential for Carey Act application was there."
1979.79-260,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.444,2325.57,"If that's true, the -- is it not also true that -- that if -- if the Secretary purported to withdraw so much that there was less than 3 million available, you would then have a right under the judgment to enjoin him or to prevent him from making that additional withdraw?"
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2325.57,2325.937,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-260,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.937,2330.755,And anything that invaded the 3 million would be subject to reclassification made available.
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2339.249,2357.855,"There's a present case or controversy because in this particular identification of acreage, a part of that 3 million acres the IBLA and the Secretary assert that they can -- they can reject to have right in their absolute discretion or opportunity to -- to petition them for a contract on that acreage."
1979.79-260,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.855,2362.072,It isn't the best way to challenge that is by making a request for some of that land and having them do it.
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2369.431,2381.968,It's -- it's our -- it's our suggestion of the Court that IBLA exercises exactly such an absolute discretion because they intended to and so they did in this particular partial in acreage.
1979.79-260,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2381.968,2383.375,"But not the 27,000."
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2385.823,2388.156,"Well, the -- the partial is withdrawn."
1979.79-260,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2388.156,2393.909,"They were complaining that they gave the wrong reason for something they have a perfectly lawful right to do, if I understand you."
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2393.909,2402.991,"And they are suggesting that they will not entertain, as the District Court suggested they must or petition for reclassification because they have the absolute discretion under the Carey Act not to do so."
1979.79-260,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.822,2426.356,"Mr. Attorney General, I -- I took it -- I take from what Mr. -- if I -- if I didn't misunderstand Mr. Smith, he said part of this 27,000 acres had been withdrawn for stock-driving purposes."
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2426.356,2427.31,"Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1979.79-260,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.374,2431.546,But not all of it.
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2431.546,2431.957,No.
1979.79-260,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.929,2564.883,"Would you think that the State would have the -- would have the right to have -- set aside for Carey Act purposes, lands that had been withdrawn for oil shale development?"

1979.79-260,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.904,2576.254,The Secretary -- how about Idaho's claim?
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2579.338,2581.854,It would not automatically override write such withdrawal.
1979.79-260,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.393,2598.263,And you adjust to -- you -- you at least have the -- the right to -- to have it shown that the withdrawal was regular and authorized by statute?
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2598.263,2598.889,Exactly.
1979.79-260,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2604.574,2609.395,"Mr. Attorney General Leroy, supposing the oil shale withdrawal covered 7 million acres?"
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2621.059,2635.004,"Well, Your Honor, again, we would be entitled to request other -- of the Secretary and identify and petition to him for Carey Act application in withdrawal and --"
1979.79-260,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2635.004,2637.212,"As I understand this sir, you wouldn't even have to do that."
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2645.155,2653.752,Justice White presented a harder case suggesting that lawful grants had -- had already been issued dropping us below the 3 million.
1979.79-260,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2654.345,2656.032,"Well, but that's not -- that's not true."
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2673.128,2681.956,Not unless either Congress modified the Carey Act or Idaho modified its terms and conditions of acceptance of the Carey Act.
1979.79-260,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2683.852,2716.784,"What if -- what if the Secretary in response to the type of situation posed by Justice Stevens said, ""I recognized the Carey Act, I recognized the oil shale act, it necessarily requires me to balance the needs for uses of public land and in the exercise of my informed discretion, I grant the oil shale act withdrawals,"" would you feel that you had anything more than an appeal to the Court of Appeals for abuse of discretion under the Administrative Procedure Act?"
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2716.784,2733.342,"It will be our position, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that there is a conditional entitlement in an already conceived Congressional purpose flowing from 1894, we would acknowledge that the acts and the management duties of the Secretary need to be read together."

1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2802.114,2809.616,"-- in the sense that he says very directly that 3 million acres ought to be reserved, so that from time to time, applications can be made."
1979.79-260,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2810.988,2825.39,"Well, it's not ought to be reasonably the words that Mr. Smith called my attention to -- are -- it is likewise clear that the Carey Act conferred upon the State of Idaho a right of entitlement to 3 million acres of -- of land suitable for irrigation."
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2837.022,2852.833,"Well, Your Honor, there is an entitlement of entitlement flows from a Congressional act in 1894.And as to -- as to other acts including oil shale activities, they would -- they were necessarily be a reading together before a court of -- of those."
1979.79-260,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2943.432,2946.317,What did Idaho do in 1895?
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2946.317,2957.434,"In 1895, Idaho became the second State to, through its state legislature, pass the statute that -- that accepted the donation, the grant of Congress with regard to the Carey Act."
1979.79-260,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2971.347,2987.825,Do they set up a mechanism whereby private settlers could make claims analogous to the way you make mineral claims or homestead claims by locating on the property and residing on it for a year?
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,2987.825,3009.267,"Yes, the purpose of those several Carey Acts were also to set up a structure whereby contracts could be entered in with construction companies to construct the works necessary to transport the waters long distances and apply water to the land and as well, contemplated boards and land commissioners to receive applications and administer the actual settlers who filed under the Act."
1979.79-260,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3216.891,3223.556,"Mr. Leroy, is it your view that the grant is so firm that Congress could not change its mind?"

1979.79-260,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3299.283,3302.363,What's the real argument here?
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,3335.175,3349.298,"The difference, as I understand the Government's position, is that they say they have the absolute discretion to contemplate receiving no applications at all the receiving, no petitions for reclassification at all, to not giving us the time of day on the Carey Act."
1979.79-260,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3394.092,3405.064,"Mr. Attorney General, exactly what did the Government deprive Idaho as of now, 1895, as of right now?"
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,3405.064,3416.412,"The Government has deprived those by the stands that they've taken in the IBLA and by the Secretary of Interior of an opportunity to seek any lands under the Carey Act, saying that they have in their absolute discretion."
1979.79-260,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3416.412,3419.425,Did they deny you the right to file a piece of paper?

1979.79-260,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3454.457,3456.122,And that resulted in what?
1979.79-260,3,21172,david_h_leroy,,3456.122,3463.759,That resulted in this actual case not -- that's not being a lot of petition for reclassification with any likelihood of success.

1979.79-260,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3477.477,3485.72,-- do you recognize or do you agree with me that it has a completely unconstitutional statute on the books?
