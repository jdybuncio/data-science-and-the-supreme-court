1966.222,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,24.174,"Number 222, Edward John Nowakowski, Petitioner, versus James F. Moraney, Superintendent State Correctional Institution."
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,26.977,32.494,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Mr. District Attorney."
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,231.203,241.731,Well Mr. O'Hern this case I gather from the -- after hearing the writ of habeas corpus was denied wasn't it?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,241.731,242.461,Yes --
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,242.461,244.678,-- a probable cause issue?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,245.768,250.173,The district judge found that there was probable cause for taking the appeal.
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,250.173,252.368,So he signed a probable cause.
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,252.368,253.361,Yes Your Honor.
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,253.361,265.896,"And then the indigent here was denied leave to proceed in a form of paupers on an appeal as to which the District Court had certified there was probable cause, is that it?"
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,265.896,268.079,"Already, that's right Your Honor."
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,268.079,270.351,And what was he denied?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,275.139,278.792,"Yes, Mr. Justice, he had three parts."
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,282.916,285.133,That is in the habeas corpus?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,285.133,286.118,Yes.
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,329.286,338.178,"May I ask why in addition to denying leave to appeal in form of paupers, was there a formal order would you think that docket the appeal?"
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,338.178,338.577,"Yes, that's right Mr. Justice."
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,338.577,341.351,Not withstanding the other standards except for the probable cause?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,341.351,343.492,Yes.
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,370.417,383.068,"Well I take it if you're right here, all that required of us is to direct the Court of Appeals to docket his appeal and proceed at it, is that it?"
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,383.068,390.948,"Well that would be one way of doing it Mr. Justice, but I personally feel that the issue here is somewhat broader than that."
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,543.113,553.984,"Even though he has the certificate of probable cause and the district judge who heard the case denied him relief but said nevertheless he has a non-frivolous claim, is that you --"
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,553.984,557.006,That is what the District Court found.
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,624.148,626.125,Was one of those cases a habeas corpus case?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,626.125,628.741,"No, those were both direct appeals Mr. Justice Stewart."
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,628.741,629.838,That's what I thought.
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,633.769,638.461,"To get an indigent's appeal, you need a certificate of probable cause."
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.461,640.052,Under what section?
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,640.052,643.302,"28 U.S. Code, Section 1915."
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.608,674.082,You say 1915 provides for certificate of probable cause and --
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,674.082,675.055,"It's not a certificate of probable cause, is it?"
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,675.055,675.84,"No, that's why --"
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,675.84,676.006,It's a --
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,676.006,677.87,it's been interpreted that way.
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,677.87,679.923,But that it's taken in good faith.
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,679.923,680.99,Yes.
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,680.99,681.899,It's different language.
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.899,695.926,Well if it's going to say that whatever -- I thought the amicus is certificate of probable cause in this case was because of 2253?
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,695.926,697.316,That's right.
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,697.316,699.198,"No, I don't think so."
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.198,721.424,"2253 says in circuit cases just like this you can't take an appeal whether informal or not without a certificate of probable cause, because of a state case that -- and it's a state -- this for habeas corpus where it follows in custody by the state."
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,750.44,752.265,Well I think there is Mr. Justice --
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,752.265,756.667,Well why -- where are the cases to say that?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,756.667,760.432,Well that's the way the statute reads.
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,761.388,770.89,Well it said -- 1915 says an appeal may not be taken in form of paupers if the trial court certified in writing and it would not taken him to stay.
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,773.334,774.773,"That's right, but it has --"
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,774.773,779.836,Well I know but -- if there's -- he doesn't have to certify that it isn't good faith.
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,779.836,786.755,Well in fact the issue what is -- it amounts to the certificate of probable cause and in Ellis --
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.755,792.894,"I just thought you say that is the practice in federal cases, for a federal prisoner?"
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,792.894,795.887,"I -- that's my understanding, the practice Mr. Justice."
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,819.649,844.34,"Well I just -- all I say is I just don't claim any requirement in 1915 where there is a probable cause and that as long as there's a -- as long as you can establish that he's indigent, and the trial judge doesn't say that there's bad faith here, there's no title to an appeal."
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,844.34,846.846,"Well I think, you know, I'd like to agree with you."
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,852.813,855.667,Well this is about the case that tested out because there was a certificate of probable cause --
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,855.667,856.514,That's right.
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,856.514,857.909,-- under 2253.
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,857.909,859.0,That's right Mr. Justice.
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,873.754,877.899,"Or evading, Mr. O'Hern, do you need to go beyond that in this case?"
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,909.356,910.247,I suggest that.
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,919.591,923.403,"Actually, isn't your position is that a matter of permitting him --"
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,923.403,923.863,He --
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,923.863,924.104,-- that that's not --
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,924.104,925.207,-- matter of right.
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,925.207,933.086,"-- as a -- since he has a certificate of probable cause, the Court of Appeals must allow him of right to docket his appeal."
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,933.086,943.841,Of course the only problem is then that with that is subsection (d) which provides that the courts may dismiss the case if satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious.
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,958.221,965.487,"But as I understand this record that doesn't appear that the Court of Appeals ever heard of this case, never got beyond the clerk's office."
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,965.487,968.551,That's what would appear from the bearer record Mr. Justice.
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,968.551,970.155,Well how do we know that --
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,970.155,970.317,We don't know.
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,970.317,973.268,-- that with any determination that it was frivolous in the merit?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,973.268,978.535,We do know that there was certified to this Court a very extensive record.
1966.222,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1053.737,1067.833,"Mr. O'Hern, do you know whether any representations are made to the court prior to the entry of Judge Biggs, Chief Judge Biggs' order on 835 of the record."
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1111.026,1111.754,That's right.
1966.222,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1111.754,1119.027,So was any representations made that Judge Biggs said this fellow is not a pauper or something like that that you know of?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1119.027,1122.366,"That's my knowledge, I think that's conceded Mr. Justice."
1966.222,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1122.366,1123.934,That he was a --
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1123.934,1124.406,Pauper.
1966.222,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1124.406,1143.266,"-- that there's no issue here.This surprise me a bit, the application for leave seems a form of paupers is filed July 16, was it?"
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1143.266,1144.181,Yes sir.
1966.222,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1144.181,1156.653,"And Judge Biggs' order is entered in July 27, and there's no indication of why he entered the order."
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1165.841,1198.011,"Apparently not, but while I can't speak for the Court of Appeals, I would be inclined to think that the practice is to have at least one member of the panel examine the papers, the record which as I say was certified to this Court included the opinion of Judge Marsh from the western district and of course included the transcript of the hearing which is illuminating but is not entirely dispositive of the issue."
1966.222,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1198.011,1217.917,So we must -- I suppose that would be testified here in assuming that the Court of Appeals has disagreed with the District Court with respect to the nature of characters substantiality of the appeal.
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1217.917,1218.73,That's what I take would be fact.
1966.222,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1218.73,1222.205,And the facts of the issue before us.
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1226.569,1227.899,I do Mr. Justice.
1966.222,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1245.734,1245.942,Yes.
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1245.942,1259.381,Well that under 2253 that certificate of probable cause to appeal as required quite regardless of the indigency of the petitioner isn't it?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1259.381,1262.398,"I'll tell you frankly Mr. Justice, I'm not entirely sure if it's no."
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1262.398,1263.917,Well then it says so?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1263.917,1264.11,It appears to say --
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1264.11,1271.05,"Or my mistake, it has nothing to do -- that provision of the code has nothing to do with form of paupers bail none does it?"
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1271.05,1271.498,Right.
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1271.498,1277.911,"Has to do with the merits of the appeal, and it's equally applicable to a millionaire and to a pauper."
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1277.911,1279.32,Except for one thing.
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1279.32,1280.352,Is that correct?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1280.352,1280.379,Yes.
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1280.379,1281.494,I haven't got it before me but that's my recollection.
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1281.494,1282.633,Yes that's right.
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1282.633,1283.531,Yes.
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1283.531,1298.195,"But if the district judge had for example denied the certificate then the same question is presented as to whether in appealing from the denial of that certificate, counsel should be allowed to the applicant for the writ of habeas corpus."
1966.222,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1298.195,1299.885,"And it was in the denial on the certificate, and you don't have that case."
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1299.885,1301.288,"No, that's -- there was not."
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1302.401,1312.012,"Of course he doesn't even need to appeal from it, all it need to do is ask the Court of Appeals for the certificate of probable cause which isn't necessarily on appeal."
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1312.012,1314.079,That's correct Mr. Justice.
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.079,1316.398,"And he can ask a circuit justice for it, I suppose?"
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1316.398,1320.457,He could.
1966.222,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1320.457,1323.716,We'll recess now.
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1326.071,1329.687,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1419.959,1423.223,Well he can appeal his right if he's a pauper.
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1423.223,1427.603,"Well it depends on how you interpret 28 U.S. Code, Section 1915."
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1427.603,1430.071,How would you interpret it?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1430.071,1434.201,Well I would like it to be interpreted in this fashion.
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1445.615,1459.78,"Well you couldn't call it frivolous, could you, if a party who is paying had a particular probable cause, he may have his case docketed."
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1459.78,1462.833,"If he pays the fee, yes Mr. Justice."
1966.222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1462.833,1465.788,Well why shouldn't he pay --
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1465.788,1467.793,I suggest that it should.
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1497.613,1516.667,"Mr. O'hern, but if you prevail and the district -- the Court of Appeals has directed to docket the appeal as an informal paupers appeal, don't you suppose the Third Circuit on the prisoner's application would assign counsel without our telling him that --"
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1516.667,1520.851,"I would be inclined to think that is the practice in the Third Circuit, I notice --"
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1520.851,1532.103,Should we reach the question whether constitutionally there's any compulsion on the Third Circuit to assign that if at least until we know that they will not assign it?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1532.103,1537.083,Well of course one of the applications in this case Mr. Justice was for the assignment of counsel.
1966.222,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1537.342,1538.446,Whether the application was?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1538.446,1548.636,"Yes, on his second petition for a -- he filed actually two pleadings in the Court of Appeals and one of them was a request for the assignment of counsel."
1966.222,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1550.692,1555.188,Didn't' make an affidavit of poverty?
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1555.188,1556.376,He did file that Mr. Chief Justice.
1966.222,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1556.376,1557.109,He did file such an affidavit.
1966.222,0,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,1557.109,1560.998,"He did, that's correct."
1966.222,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1641.96,1644.916,You may Mr. O'Hern.
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,1664.87,1672.171,I think it's conceded Your Honor.
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1755.613,1760.264,Well where does Judge Biggs gets the power to do that?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,1760.264,1762.684,Under Section 1915 I --
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1762.684,1764.901,Where?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,1764.901,1774.536,"Under Section 28-1915, the Court may dismiss the case --"
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1774.536,1774.784,Well he isn't.
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,1774.784,1780.088,-- if the allegation of poverty is untrue or have satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious.
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1780.088,1782.405,Well he isn't the Court is he?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,1782.405,1783.277,Pardon?
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1783.277,1785.601,He isn't the Court is he?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,1795.505,1801.239,"Well, it was my understanding that he was acting on behalf of the Court."
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1801.239,1802.417,How can he?
1966.222,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1802.417,1810.107,"It says in page 135 of the record it says “Present Biggs, Plager and Freidman."
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,1810.107,1812.255,"He was on behalf of the Court, I'm sorry."
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1812.255,1813.988,But one of the panel of the Court.
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,1813.988,1814.514,Yes I'm sorry.
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1814.514,1814.873,Yes that's what I --
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,1814.873,1816.23,I didn't understand what you meant Your Honor.
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1816.23,1819.876,Yes.
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,1819.876,1843.537,"So that there was this action and it wasn't a bare application which reached the clerk's office and was sent back because the fees, the filing fees were not advanced to the extent that the petition itself set out the petitioner's case in the three regards."
1966.222,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1978.347,1980.308,For what reason?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,1980.308,2016.135,"Because the actual sentence in regard to -- if the Court should decide that this man is entitled to a hearing before the Third Circuit and referring it back to the Third Circuit that there's no doubt that the Third Circuit could hear it, but whether or not eventually a new trial would be allowed after service of the complete time or expiration of complete time."
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2022.175,2033.0,"Well I take it you point is that since federal habeas looks to the least, if he served complete sentence and he's not been released since then, is that it?"
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2033.0,2037.64,"There's nothing in this particular charge to release him from, because he's serving on a --"
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2037.64,2046.572,Well does this -- does the conviction on this charge have any bearing of the recidivism to the like and the punishments he's got in this sentences he's now serving?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2046.572,2047.336,None Your Honor.
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2047.336,2048.496,None whatever.
1966.222,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2048.496,2050.626,But in another state?
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2050.626,2053.161,"No, they were committed in Pennsylvania."
1966.222,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2053.161,2054.681,I beg your pardon?
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2054.681,2056.777,I didn't understand you question Your Honor.
1966.222,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2056.777,2061.895,Could this be used against him in a recidivous charge in another state?
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2061.895,2064.71,"Possibly in another state, not in Pennsylvania."
1966.222,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2064.71,2072.413,"All these -- these all goes to the merits of the habeas corpus appeal in the Third Circuit, doesn't it?"
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2072.413,2072.844,That's correct.
1966.222,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2072.844,2075.069,"Doesn't go to the issues now before us really, doesn't it?"
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2075.069,2076.284,"No, that's correct."
1966.222,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2077.137,2078.585,No I didn't mean to --
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2078.585,2082.98,I just want to point out that there is that situation existing.
1966.222,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2082.98,2085.029,Suggesting that he may not have a merit --
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2085.029,2087.652,That's right.
1966.222,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2122.048,2124.199,Was it done on that ground?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2124.199,2135.046,"Without specifically saying why it was done, we -- there was no reason given Your Honor."
1966.222,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2141.082,2143.727,Or might not be done at all.
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2143.727,2167.306,"It's true it may not have been done at all, but the action of Justice Biggs or the Circuit Court of Appeals in which the appeal is dismissed in order to justify it without looking to any wording in the opinion it would have to be done on the basis of some provision of Section 1915."
1966.222,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2167.306,2173.508,Should that be done if you didn't say it was.
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2186.386,2205.717,"Well I believe that the basis for dismissing without knowing the basis for dismissing, without knowing what they may be in the particular case would have to be assumed to have been done properly under this Section."
1966.222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.717,2207.326,In what respect under this Section?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2210.874,2218.689,Denial of the entire petition Your Honor which included in form of paupers counsel and the --
1966.222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.689,2220.479,No but counsel --
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2220.479,2223.728,-- the merits of the appeal.
1966.222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.728,2226.865,Well didn't he also move for a transcript?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2226.865,2228.992,No.
1966.222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.736,2244.702,"How about page 136, petition for records and documents in form of pauper?"
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2262.652,2273.69,"That's true Your Honor, but as later -- as the petition states later, there are other reasons given in the bear."
1966.222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.69,2289.027,"Well that may be so, but they did -- he did ask for a transcript and it was denied, along with counsel."
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2289.027,2301.402,"Considering part of his petition, the petition was denied there's no question, but that wasn't the only point of his petition."
1966.222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.389,2313.91,"What do you think the Court's grounds were for denying this petition with all of his grounds, whatever they were?"
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2313.91,2326.235,I believe that assuming that the Court's actions were according to statutory authority that the Court dismissed on the basis of frivolity.
1966.222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.235,2328.712,So it passed on the merits?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2328.712,2336.319,To the extent that they could determine from the record presented to them that this appeal was frivolous.
1966.222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.319,2343.959,So you don't contend that the Court denied because any doubt of being a pauper or anything like that?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2343.959,2346.154,"No, I do not believe so Your Honor."
1966.222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.154,2351.346,And that you think they've got appointed counsel said he thought the merits were not frivolous.
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2351.346,2352.716,I believe sir.
1966.222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.944,2363.452,"So it comes down to frivolity and whether the court sitting without a record, without counsel, without argument or without briefs can dismiss it as frivolous?"
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2363.452,2365.459,Can do that yes.
1966.222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2523.126,2526.579,Let me just make sure I understand.
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2557.032,2561.99,"It is possible Your Honor, I believe yes."
1966.222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.99,2562.55,In spite of the fact --
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2562.55,2564.439,It wouldn't happen in the same way --
1966.222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.439,2572.124,In spite of the fact that 2253 provides for certificate of probable cause either from the trial court or from the Court of Appeals.
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2572.124,2576.384,Well I don't know this 2253 enters into this part of it.
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2590.707,2593.329,Well they're rather important extra proceedings aren't they?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2594.008,2595.789,Well they aren't necessary because --
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2595.789,2597.83,He can answer a motion to dismiss.
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2607.876,2614.472,"Your Honor, I agree that the opportunity is greater in the case of a paid attorney for --"
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2614.472,2617.033,Well but its purpose is rather important one.
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2617.033,2618.229,It is very important.
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2639.909,2642.113,"Well on motion, there wasn't any motion here was it?"
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2642.113,2649.356,"No, there can't be because there's no one on the other side at this point Your Honor, I agree."
1966.222,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2681.954,2685.95,But either have the right to argue the motion wouldn't he?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2685.95,2687.385,"To that extent, yes."
1966.222,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2687.385,2688.099,Yes.
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2688.099,2695.17,There are differences -- I don't mean to say and there are important differences as Justice Brennan points out.
1966.222,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2704.823,2704.923,May I --
1966.222,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2704.923,2705.946,May ask?
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2705.946,2706.959,-- excuse me.
1966.222,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2706.959,2713.672,May I ask if this petition was filed pro se or was it filed by a lawyer?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2713.672,2719.506,It was filed pro se.
1966.222,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2733.321,2736.378,And the District Court relieved him of that post?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2736.378,2751.357,"Yes, and the District Court have ruled and the attorney had filed the appeal for this defendant, but then asked to be excused before the -- before any further proceedings --"
1966.222,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2751.357,2752.97,"When you say appeal, the notice appeal?"
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2752.97,2756.432,"Yes had filed notice, excuse me."
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2762.189,2771.195,"May I ask this, what he filed was petition, was any notice by any one given to the state of his filing?"
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2771.195,2772.735,To the circuit court?
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2772.735,2778.132,"Yes, when he filed to the circuit court."
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2778.132,2784.167,There was no notice that I know.
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2784.167,2785.302,What ordinarily happens?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2807.506,2807.863,"Yes, the warden."
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2807.863,2810.337,Is the respondent on the appeal.
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2822.395,2830.48,I think that the appellant has to notify the respondent who would be the warden on this one.
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2830.48,2834.415,And then I take it there's an affidavit or something of service for the respondent?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2834.415,2835.704,That's correct.
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2835.704,2842.052,Nothing like that was before this panel of the Court of Appeals at the time it took its action with it?
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2842.052,2844.449,"Your Honor, not that I know of."
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2846.618,2850.757,I just wanted to know how we can say this was a docketed appeal in those circumstances.
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2850.757,2868.315,"I only -- perhaps I'm mistaken, but I was under the impression that if the Court, the circuit court, had considered this matter and Justice Biggs had issued an order that it would be a docketed matter."
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2868.315,2879.654,"Well that suggests then that without the respondent ever hearing about it, the Court of Appeals can throw out an appeal if it thinks that the face of the papers if was decided."
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2879.654,2885.417,"Again, because of the -- I'm not sure that such a notice was ever given."
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2888.237,2918.924,"Well do you think the Court of Appeals could in that circumstance, an appellant files whether he has paid counsel or not, I gather your argument is that at least power whether it derives from 1915 or that of other statutes, power in the Court of Appeals, sua sponte with the respondent never having even heard that the appeal was pending to examine the papers and enter an order of dismissal without hearing the appellant for notice of respondent and otherwise."
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2921.431,2924.58,"I think that yes, I think that 1915 gives at par."
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2924.58,2928.606,"My, oh my, what did Congress said it would."
1966.222,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2928.606,2936.939,"Is this a normal procedure as to indigents in the Third Circuit, or this case just as forwarded?"
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2936.939,2946.034,"I think that the Third Circuit has a record, Your Honor, providing counsel of giving hearings."
1966.222,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2993.027,2994.457,It's only a ticket of entry --
1966.222,1,45830,william_e_pfadt,,2994.457,3011.813,"It provides -- that's right it's a requirement, and there are cases which hold that the certificate of probable cause actually is nothing more than that the trial judge believes that the person asking for this is sincere."
1966.222,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3104.992,3107.531,Mr. O'Hern.
1966.222,2,21328,daniel_j_ohern,,3107.531,3109.471,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
