1977.76-1701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.83,We will hear arguments first this morning in Tennessee Valley Authority against Harem J. Hill.
1977.76-1701,0,24942,griffin_b_bell,,9.56,13.472,Your Honor and may it please it the Court.
1977.76-1701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.613,215.128,"General Bell, am I right in thinking that the Tellico Dam itself is on the Little Tennessee prior to its confluence with the Tennessee?"
1977.76-1701,0,24942,griffin_b_bell,,215.128,220.301,"Right, just before the confluence."
1977.76-1701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,264.064,268.108,"That was before the discovery of the existence of the snail darter, was it?"
1977.76-1701,0,24942,griffin_b_bell,,268.108,268.853,"Yes, sir."
1977.76-1701,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,325.905,329.496,Is it alive?[Laughter]
1977.76-1701,0,24942,griffin_b_bell,,329.496,336.541,"I have been wondering where its end is, if it is.[Laughter]"
1977.76-1701,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,341.939,344.67,"Mr. Attorney General, your exhibit makes me wonder."
1977.76-1701,0,24942,griffin_b_bell,,350.069,353.908,"Well, we have -- I -- I do not take it as one because I do not have to."
1977.76-1701,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,354.651,359.2,"Your argument would apply to every endangered species, American eagle, no matter what it might be, is that right?"
1977.76-1701,0,24942,griffin_b_bell,,359.2,362.047,"Absolutely, that is what the Sixth Circuit held."
1977.76-1701,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,363.208,369.41,"The statute -- the statute, the Endangered Species Act, does not distinguish as among various priorities of endangered species, does it?"
1977.76-1701,0,24942,griffin_b_bell,,369.41,370.759,It does not.
1977.76-1701,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,372.778,373.131,Yes.
1977.76-1701,0,24942,griffin_b_bell,,373.131,383.733,"Once it gets on the list, it is a -- it is an endangered specie and then this case it goes much further because a critical habitat is a thing."
1977.76-1701,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,383.733,385.28,The snail darter is on the list?
1977.76-1701,0,24942,griffin_b_bell,,385.28,397.2,"It is on the list and this particular area has been designated as a critical habitat, which means that under the holding of the Court we cannot move the snail darter as we have."
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2168.868,2172.102,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1977.76-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2194.76,2198.611,"Mr. Plater, Judge McCree did write separately below, did he not?"
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2202.43,2203.383,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.76-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2217.047,2225.149,"Many times up here, particularly concur in the result, that means we think the majority opinion is rather poor and we have reasons of our own?"
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2225.149,2229.834,"Your Honor, I do not want to second guess Judge McCree, but it might be noted --"
1977.76-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2229.834,2232.431,"Well, you said that it was a unanimous opinion --"
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2232.431,2232.664,Excuse me?
1977.76-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2232.664,2233.915,-- it may be an unanimous judgment?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2233.915,2239.391,"Unanimous position taken by the Sixth Circuit that this project should be enjoined, and thank you, Your Honor."
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2313.921,2319.121,What would you have done if snail darters are on Chickamauga Dam under TVA?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2320.078,2343.814,"Your Honor, that is a question also like the question asked by Mr. Justice Powell and the point is the biologists tell us that if you could find the species in a completed project, that would be a biological indication that that population was not endangered by the dam because indeed it was living there, established there, breeding and then, of course, no completed dam would have to be taken down."
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2343.814,2350.244,"But suppose the Department of Interior say it was, it appeared in Chickamauga Dam?"
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2350.244,2351.261,"No, Your Honor."
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2358.321,2360.174,But suppose they say that --
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2360.174,2361.061,"Well, Your Honor --"
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2361.061,2362.51,-- and they are wrong?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2362.51,2367.473,"If they are wrong, then this answers the question posed also by Mr. Justice White."
1977.76-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2386.909,2392.11,But to say you concede there is judicial review of the Secretary of Interiorâ€™s action?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2392.11,2392.435,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.76-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2392.435,2398.067,Either in putting species on the endangered list or in saying that for certain areas it is critical habitat?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2398.067,2401.741,The current pending action seeks a delisting of a species that has already been listed.
1977.76-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2401.741,2404.074,Is there a judicial review of either finding?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2404.074,2406.9,There appears to be and respondents have no legal argument.
1977.76-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2406.9,2409.516,Under the Administrative Procedure Act?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2409.516,2412.03,"I am not sure what he basis of the claim there is, Your Honor."
1977.76-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2414.506,2419.189,Let me pursue a question that Mr. Justice Marshall put to you.
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2448.233,2451.707,"Your Honor, that of course is not this case."
1977.76-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2451.707,2456.18,"No, we are asking you a hypothetical questions to test your arguments?"
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2456.18,2456.521,That is a good point.
1977.76-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2456.521,2457.803,As we did to the Attorney General?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2457.803,2465.274,"Your Honor, the question is whether there is a remaining prospective federal action which will jeopardize the species."
1977.76-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2479.125,2483.306,The federal action is the continuance of the dam?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2483.306,2487.925,"In that situation, Your Honor, that certainly is a question that would have to be raised."
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2551.454,2557.761,Do we know right now how many snail darters are there?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2557.761,2559.952,"We know approximately, Your Honor and this is --"
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2559.952,2562.648,"Well, how many have been removed?"
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2562.648,2570.441,"In the present case, Your Honor, we do not have a full record on the transplantation, but these are the facts as best we know them."
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2570.441,2571.779,Do we not need that?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2583.327,2584.21,Your Honor --
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2584.21,2585.587,Would your argument be the same?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2585.587,2588.41,"No, Your Honor, it would not be if the Secretary of Interior changed --"
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2588.41,2590.902,"You would not have any argument, would you?"
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2593.082,2600.388,"Your Honor, if the Secretary of Interior changes the listing of the species and the critical habitat then clearly this case is no longer --"
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2600.388,2602.661,That was not my question.
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2602.661,2603.173,"Excuse me, I misunderstood."
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2603.173,2612.868,"My question was, should we not know what the transplanted snail darters, how they are faring?"
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2622.2,2623.176,All right.
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2639.833,2644.836,How can we accept it when you are now getting ready to say that what they say is not true?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2644.836,2647.338,"Your Honor, that is based on arithmetic."
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2647.338,2649.694,How do we know what is true?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2651.972,2653.942,"Your Honor, that is correct."
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2684.314,2689.024,"If I may correct you, that is the latest scientific evidence you know about."
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2689.024,2692.742,"Your honor, I have checked the records of the Secretary of Interior (Voice Overlap)"
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2692.742,2698.416,"Suppose there is some other records available, do you seriously object to this going back?"
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2698.416,2712.313,"Your Honor, they may be reasons for this case to be remanded, however, transplantation is not a fulfillment of the Act, and therefore, that would be an incidental inquiry."
1977.76-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2714.099,2720.714,"Do you mean that even if a successful transplant took place, you would still be opposing the functioning of this dam?"
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2720.714,2724.533,"Not at all, Your Honor, but we would request that the legal procedures be followed."
1977.76-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2739.336,2745.143,Or else -- else he could simply say that this is no longer its critical habitat?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2745.143,2754.492,"Your Honor, under the Act, I believe that both of the elements are separate violations, that is to say it is illegal for an agency either to render a specie extinct or to destroy its critical habitat."
1977.76-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2754.492,2767.389,"Or to modify its critical habitat, but if this -- this continue to be an endangered species, but if the area to be flooded by the dam is no longer its critical habitat, there would be no violation of the statute."
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2767.389,2769.505,Unless the Secretary --
1977.76-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2769.505,2772.841,If the fish thrived in the Hiwassee River?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2772.841,2784.465,"Your Honor, if the fish thrives in the Hiwassee River, then indeed as Mr. Chief Justice Burger suggested, through this procedure this case would come to an end, but that does not appear to be the biological evidence."
1977.76-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2792.456,2795.658,"Well, that is not historically true for every species."
1977.76-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2803.441,2805.265,And that is history of evolution?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2805.265,2818.914,"Your Honor, however, apparently the Hiwassee River is connected geographically to the Little Tennessee and biologists tell us that if the Hiwassee were a good habitat for the species, it would be there by the process of evolution."
1977.76-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2831.418,2834.002,Mr. Plater may I interrupt you right there.
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2846.471,2848.25,"No, Your Honor."
1977.76-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2903.185,2905.128,"Last place has been discovered, I take it?"
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2905.128,2908.777,"Your Honor, TVA has looked everywhere for snail darters.[Laughter]"
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2913.835,2916.841,They have not checked the basement of our building here?[Laughter]
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2916.841,2921.213,"Your Honor, if snail darters were in the base of this building then I suspect they would not be in danger."
1977.76-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2921.213,2922.603,They would not have found him?
1977.76-1701,1,46710,zygmunt_j_b_plater,,2922.603,2925.901,"They would have found them, Your Honor, and there would be a bounty on the snail darterâ€™s head."
