1993.93-5418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.087,"We'll hear argument now in No. 93-5418, Orrin S. Reed v. Robert Farley."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,9.772,12.491,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-5418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,63.573,74.548,"Mr. Solovy, you said Congress put these in the Act, but the Act really didn't apply to any State unless the State voluntarily adopted it, isn't that right?"
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,74.548,75.131,That's correct.
1993.93-5418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,89.558,100.948,"So Congress' participation in it can easily be called a Federal law, but I don't know how the Interstate Act itself qualifies as a Federal law."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,100.948,116.125,"Well, with all due respect, Justice Scalia, I think the Court treaded this ground in Cuyler and in Carchman, and, indeed, in taking the certiorari in Fex v. Michigan--"
1993.93-5418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.125,117.075,For this purpose?
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,117.075,124.231,"--For -- well, I don't see what the jurisdiction of the Court would have been to grant certiorari in Fex if this were not a Federal law."
1993.93-5418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.231,136.372,"Oh, I think it's one thing to say that we have jurisdiction over interstate agreements and quite another thing to say that for purposes of habeas corpus we would be enforcing a Federal law."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,136.372,158.718,"Well, with all due respect, Justice Scalia, I fail to see the distinction for -- if this Court has jurisdiction for certiorari and jurisdiction to take a case on certiorari, then I cannot see how it doesn't qualify under 2254 as a Federal law to be enforced under habeas corpus."
1993.93-5418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,161.404,165.891,"Perhaps enforceable, but not necessarily to be enforced."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,180.817,184.785,"Again, Justice Scalia, with all due respect, this is a real Federal law."
1993.93-5418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,212.051,214.686,Can a State get out of this interstate agreement?
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,214.686,215.153,--Of course.
1993.93-5418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.621,223.275,"Well, I don't see how -- if a State violates its own law, we don't accept habeas corpus because a State can change its law."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,234.082,244.974,"That would be a very hollow agreement indeed, and such a ruling would cause all of the States to opt out and disappear from this Act."
1993.93-5418,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,291.503,299.359,"Mr. Solovy, I guess you concede there's no constitutional violation of the speedy trial clause here."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,299.359,314.034,"Well, this Court said, Justice O'Connor, in deciding Carchman, that Congress had in mind in passing this Act, at least in part the prisoner's speedy trial constitutional right."
1993.93-5418,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,314.784,321.455,"Well, do you take the position that the Constitution was violated, the speedy trial clause, in this case."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,321.455,323.721,--I'd say the purpose of the Constitution--
1993.93-5418,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,323.721,324.407,Why don't you answer the question?
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,324.407,324.89,--Yes.
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,331.827,336.215,"Are you treating this, then, as though -- as a counterpart to the Speedy Trial Act."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,346.403,349.772,"--That's a very helpful question to my position, Justice Ginsburg, because that's--"
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.772,367.0,"But, on the other hand, if you are equating it -- to the extent that it's implementing the same purpose that the constitutional provision implements, then if you're dealing with a constitutional violation, then mustn't you show prejudice, and where is any prejudice here?"
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,367.0,380.577,"--Well, I don't -- well, there's a great prejudice to Mr. Reed because Mr. Reed has been in the penitentiary for 11 years and if the Act were enforced he would have been discharged in September of 1983."
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,381.977,388.063,"Well, that's not the kind of prejudice a violation of the speedy trial provision of the Constitution would be addressing, is it?"
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,388.063,395.419,"--Well, but this is very much, Justice Ginsburg, like jurisdiction, that's always addressed in Federal habeas corpus."
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,395.419,398.871,"Why isn't it very much like a statute of limitations, which is not jurisdictional."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,398.871,419.452,"It also is very much like a statute of limitations, and Justice Thomas said in his opinion in Doggett that the reasons for statute of limitations, statutes of repose, Speedy Trial Act, is you have a legislative determination that past that point in time the defendant shall not be tried, and--"
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,419.452,423.737,But a statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that the defendant raises.
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,426.038,434.561,"--In this -- in this -- under the Interstate Detainer Act, Justice Ginsburg, the defendant, the prisoner, does not have to assert the defense."
1993.93-5418,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,501.485,530.67,"Mr. Solovy, if we had a case on habeas review from a decision in a lower Federal court, under the notion expressed in Hill against the United States, this might not be the kind of claim that would survive on Federal habeas review from a Federal court."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,545.697,547.43,"No, I do not, Justice O'Connor."
1993.93-5418,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,556.904,561.439,"Well, we've treated, though, 2254 like 2255."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,564.991,565.593,--Yes.
1993.93-5418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,586.091,588.274,But that's a different ground of distinction.
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,611.203,617.793,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, I think all courts are entitled to deference, State and Federal courts alike."
1993.93-5418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,630.517,634.303,But doesn't the text of 2255 say the same thing about coming from a Federal court?
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,634.303,634.903,It does.
1993.93-5418,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,662.622,669.476,Why isn't that an argument for a different statute as opposed to a different definition of the terms which are common to the two sections?
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,669.476,673.761,"--I'm not sure, Justice Souter, I understand your question."
1993.93-5418,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,674.396,687.621,"Well, you're saying that the Federal prisoner has already had certain chances for Federal review that the State prisoner doesn't, which may be a very good reason for having different -- having a different statute governing the two cases."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,692.507,693.041,--That--
1993.93-5418,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,693.041,698.245,"And it seems to me -- why aren't you across the street making that argument, I guess is another way to put the question."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,698.245,700.78,"--Well, we did make the argument, of course, across the street."
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,706.351,713.505,I think Justice Souter means why didn't you ask Congress to amend the statute to make a distinction between 2255 and State habeas.
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,713.505,739.386,"--Well, because I think, if I read correctly this Court's precedent -- and certainly I've read a lot of this Court's precedents in preparation for this argument -- this Court has never adopted what the Solicitor General has suggested here, that a State prisoner who has not procedurally defaulted, who has properly preserved at every turn in the road his or her right, does not have to show--"
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,739.386,744.774,"Well, that's -- there you're making an assumption that I don't think is quite settled on this record."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,775.893,782.63,"--Well, we don't think, Justice Ginsburg, that he was silent to a point where he should be penalized."
1993.93-5418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.264,847.489,"Mr. Solovy, before we leave this point, I had thought -- I had thought we rejected the proposal that 2255 and 2254 should be similarly interpreted."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,855.778,858.547,"--Well, I certainly agree with that, Justice Scalia."
1993.93-5418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,858.547,859.713,I'd be happy to change that.
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,859.713,869.503,"No, I think you should adhere to your dissent and the reason for your dissent, and that's the way I read Sunal, Hill, Davis."
1993.93-5418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,869.503,870.688,You don't want me to adhere to my dissent.
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,874.807,877.275,"Well, your dissent helps me to show there's a distinction."
1993.93-5418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.06,883.728,"I could be persuaded otherwise, I suppose--"
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,884.912,890.416,"Well, there -- if you can, Justice Scalia -- if you can, then there is a very good reason."
1993.93-5418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,916.884,924.204,"We rejected that kind of argument, though, in our cases dealing with collateral estoppel and estoppel by judgment."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,936.379,941.499,"I agree, and I agree that that's where, Chief Justice Rehnquist, the analogy stops."
1993.93-5418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,978.339,994.55,"Supposing this case had come from the Federal courts and was subject to the Hill-Davis-Timmreck line of reasoning, and you claimed a Speedy Trial Act violation, right; do you think any sort of a Speedy Trial Act violation could be raised in that situation?"
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,994.55,1007.542,"--No, I think at that point the gentlemen -- the prisoner would have been precluded because he would have presented his claim to the Federal district court and then to the appellate court, and I assume certiorari was denied."
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1020.201,1029.557,"But I don't understand -- if the reason -- the reasoning for the objection, for rejecting the objection would be that it doesn't go to the fairness of the trial and it doesn't go to guilt or innocence."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1029.557,1030.24,That's--
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1030.24,1037.06,That's the same thing here; that it was some days more than 120 days doesn't go to guilt or innocence or the fairness of the trial.
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1037.06,1048.118,"--That's exactly why I think comity, the reasons for deferring in Federal habeas corpus does not pertain here, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1058.723,1059.759,"Well, now we're going back to jurisdiction."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1066.663,1076.352,"--I agreed it was like, but I did not agree that it wasn't jurisdictional, because if you look at the statute, if you look at page 6a of our appendix, it says that:"
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1100.7,1105.704,"Are you suggesting that any time a rule is phrased in terms of ""must"", it becomes, quote, jurisdictional?"
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1105.704,1128.285,"--Well, in these terms it is certainly jurisdictional, because if you also look, Justice Ginsburg, at sections V(g) and (f) and (g) -- I'm sorry, section (d), (f), and (g), you will see that the prisoner remains in custody of the sending State; here the Federal court."
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1135.605,1154.583,Can you explain to me what sense it makes to say a violation of the Speedy Trial Act is not attended by this automatic rigid release but a violation of this Detainer Act is so accompanied?
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1174.814,1180.817,"--Well, I think -- you know, the purposes behind both of those, Justice Ginsburg, are very much the same."
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1352.964,1385.268,"Suppose this judge were aware, this State trial judge, of the 120-day provision, he had it in his mind, and he said at that conference to set the trial date; I know about the limit, but you've papered me with motions, I think a reasonable extension is necessary, and so I'm setting the trial at X date and that is, in my judgment, a reasonable continuance in light of all the motions that you filed."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1385.268,1391.772,"You would not be graced here with my presence, because that would then conform exactly with the statute."
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1395.624,1403.647,"And it would have been so easy for that to have happened if only defendant, instead of standing silent, had said to the judge when they were setting the date for the trial--"
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1403.647,1404.63,Justice--
1993.93-5418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1404.63,1407.016,"--Look, you're setting it after the 120 days."
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1407.016,1409.384,"--Justice Ginsburg, I can only repeat two things."
1993.93-5418,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1442.372,1451.645,"Were the occasions on -- or the occasion on which the judge said put it in writing occasions when he was setting the trial date, or were those general motion sessions?"
1993.93-5418,0,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1451.645,1455.347,"I think the -- Justice Souter, I don't have an exact memory."
1993.93-5418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1476.493,1477.762,"Very well, Mr. Solovy."
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1479.328,1484.016,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-5418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1524.657,1537.715,"May I ask you about -- on that point, whether if the petitioner has sought review of the Indiana Supreme Court's decision to deny him relief under the IAD, would we have had jurisdiction to review the petition?"
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1537.715,1539.048,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1993.93-5418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.246,1563.782,But is that because the petition would have raised a Federal question?
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1563.782,1568.067,--We don't dispute that there is a Federal question involved in the IAD.
1993.93-5418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1590.265,1596.919,"If we can agree to that, what, then, is the significance of the point that you made about this not being an Act of Congress?"
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1596.919,1611.013,"--That -- the significance of that, I think, is that the term ""laws of the United States"", as used in the habeas corpus statute, is, indeed, quite different from the terms of the certiorari statute."
1993.93-5418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1644.667,1649.702,So you're arguing this is not a law of the United States within the meaning of the habeas corpus statute.
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1649.702,1651.087,"Exactly, Justice Stevens."
1993.93-5418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1651.087,1653.471,Did you make that argument in your brief in opposition to certiorari?
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1653.471,1654.789,"We did not, Your Honor."
1993.93-5418,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1673.417,1676.619,"Well, why is it jurisdictional?"
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1685.892,1689.196,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-5418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1709.123,1711.875,"Which is the same language that's used in Article III of the Constitution,"
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1718.965,1727.821,"--Well, again, it's because -- as this Court has recognized, the very same language can mean different things as it's used in different contexts."
1993.93-5418,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1743.247,1756.138,"I take it, then, you accept your opponent's argument that what satisfies the requirement of the law under the two sections, 54 and 55, may be different?"
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1756.138,1757.523,Um--
1993.93-5418,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1757.523,1762.392,"And hence the standards applicable should be different, which would defeat your Hill argument."
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1762.392,1764.677,"--No, I don't believe so."
1993.93-5418,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1937.056,1941.376,But didn't we hold in one of those cases that this was a Federal question?
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1941.376,1943.228,That's correct.
1993.93-5418,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1958.421,1965.725,But what language did we construe in whichever one of those cases it was that we decided there was a Federal question?
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1965.725,1977.533,"Well, in Cuyler, which I believe was the case with the extended analysis, the Court didn't purport to construe any particular statutory language."
1993.93-5418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.658,2101.328,"May I ask if you are saying in this second argument -- for present purpose, we'll assume the IAD is a law of the United States, which I understand you disagree with."
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2112.786,2116.939,That's correct.
1993.93-5418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2160.985,2167.122,Do you think in Stone the Court assumed that the State prisoner was being held in violation of the law of the United States?
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2167.122,2179.43,"To the extent that the exclusionary rule as developed by this Court, which is at least as Federal as the IAD, is a law of the United States, then I believe the Court was required to assume that."
1993.93-5418,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.43,2189.87,"But when you say equitable discretion, you don't mean a case-by-case analysis, do you?"
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2197.392,2198.927,"No, not at all."
1993.93-5418,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2231.399,2244.372,"But don't you think there's some truth to the argument made here that the Stone against Powell was based not on the extent of habeas corpus, but on the -- really, the construction of the exclusionary rule?"
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2244.372,2247.407,There's certainly language in Stone to that effect.
1993.93-5418,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2273.356,2291.334,"In Withrow -- I checked it briefly -- we did not cite Davis v. the United States, unless I'm incorrect, and Davis v. United States was the case in which we said these two statutes, 2254 and 2255, are identical in scope."
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2300.959,2304.594,"No, I don't believe so, Justice Kennedy."
1993.93-5418,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2322.555,2326.49,"Well, but how do you square Withrow with the statement in Davis, then?"
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2326.49,2364.382,"Well, we believe, in essence, that Stone v. Powell and its rule represents a fact situation or a rule-situation specific application of the fundamental defect, inherent miscarriage of justice standard; that, in essence, what Stone represents is the Court's conclusion that an alleged violation of the exclusionary rule in which, by hypothesis, evidence that is perfectly trustworthy has been admitted, can never amount to a fundamental defect that inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice."
1993.93-5418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2378.709,2393.385,You have alternate arguments for -- on the merits; one is Stone v. Powell and the other is the more traditional one.
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2401.574,2403.942,That was something -- we did not argue it.
1993.93-5418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2408.828,2413.798,"But now that you have it, you are supporting it."
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2413.798,2419.286,"Well, among other things, we're supporting it because we believe the Seventh Circuit was correct."
1993.93-5418,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2474.354,2475.889,I think you are right on that.
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2479.241,2479.858,I--
1993.93-5418,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2479.858,2480.777,"I mean, the right is personal."
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2488.113,2503.373,--I suppose I would disagree with the notion that it does have the kind of relationship to the truth-seeking function that those rules -- in which the -- in the cases where the Court has declined to apply Stone have had.
1993.93-5418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2586.941,2590.56,"No, but may I suggest this distinction on Stone against Powell."
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2620.514,2624.566,"Well, it mandatorily requires dismissal of the charges."
1993.93-5418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2627.768,2631.97,"Well, there's no jurisdiction to hold him other than pursuant to the charges that would have been dismissed."
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2631.97,2639.676,"--Well, certainly, that's the basis of petitioner's detention, is the judgment of conviction."
1993.93-5418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2666.726,2668.009,But now you're making a different argument.
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2678.198,2679.731,Um--
1993.93-5418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.731,2685.019,"Why is he -- if it is a law of the United States, why is he not being held in violation of a law of the United States?"
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2685.019,2693.957,"--Well, among other things, because each Court that's actually reached the merits of the IAD claim has held there was no violation, and that includes the Federal district."
1993.93-5418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2693.957,2698.128,"Yes, but -- I know they may have said that, but what is the explanation for that conclusion that you find satisfactory?"
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2698.128,2715.24,"I believe the district court's explanation was entirely satisfactory, that periods during which pretrial dispositive motions were pending are periods during which the petitioner was unable to stand trial, which are expressly excluded from the calculation under the IAD."
1993.93-5418,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2719.792,2723.894,Let me rephrase the question and get away from the debate as to who's responsible for the delay.
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2745.759,2751.829,"If you assume this to be a law of the United States, then I believe, yes, he would be held in violation of it."
1993.93-5418,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2759.685,2778.313,"Were you accepting the argument a moment ago that any time a prisoner files a pretrial motion that for whatever reason would have to be disposed of prior to trial, that he, during the period that motion is pending, cannot be tried, and hence the running of the period is tolled?"
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2778.313,2789.954,"We believe that the delay caused by such motions are periods, within the meaning of the IAD, during which the prisoner is unable to stand trial."
1993.93-5418,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2789.954,2795.525,"So that whenever such a motion is filed, the clock stops, is that right?"
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2795.525,2796.792,Yes.
1993.93-5418,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2804.981,2810.135,Have they followed the same rule when the State files motions that need to be disposed of before trial?
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2810.135,2811.435,--I'm sorry?
1993.93-5418,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2811.435,2817.205,Have they followed the same rule when they're dealing with a motion filed by the State that requires disposition before trial?
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2817.205,2821.14,I'm not aware of whether that rule has been followed for State motions.
1993.93-5418,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2821.14,2823.259,Would you argue with the same result in that case?
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2823.259,2827.061,I think that would be a plausible result.
1993.93-5418,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2981.376,3008.694,"I guess in our habeas cases involving Federal convictions where we will not accept habeas if there's been a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue below, even though the outcome is incorrect, there's no doubt that in some cases, unless you believe the lower Federal courts are always right, the defendant is being held in violation of Federal law."
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,3008.694,3011.496,"I believe that's correct, Justice Scalia."
1993.93-5418,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3011.496,3012.015,It has to be true--
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,3012.015,3012.632,Yes.
1993.93-5418,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.632,3014.415,--Unless you assume that the lower Federal courts are always right.
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,3014.415,3016.9,That -- I believe that's absolutely correct.
1993.93-5418,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3016.9,3023.739,"We say, in effect, he may well be held in violation of Federal law, but he has had a full and fair opportunity to litigate that, end of matter."
1993.93-5418,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,3023.739,3025.872,"Exactly, Justice Scalia."
1993.93-5418,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3041.617,3043.384,"Thank you, Mr. Abel."
1993.93-5418,2,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,3045.653,3049.605,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, may it please the Court:"
