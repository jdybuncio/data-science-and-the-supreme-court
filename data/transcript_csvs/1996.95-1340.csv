1996.95-1340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.086,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1340, Hughes Aircraft Company v. United States, on the relation of William J. Schumer."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,9.998,13.39,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.23,150.888,Mr. Starr--
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,154.591,159.925,"Well, Government knowledge would not, of course, be a bar with respect to the Government."
1996.95-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.359,165.929,So in fact he's liable.
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,186.131,206.107,"--Your Honor, if I may, it seems to me that under the Landgraf analysis, the fact that you are permitting private parties theretofore barred to bring the action is indeed an additional burden using the judgmental process that this Court in Landgraf said is--"
1996.95-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,206.107,214.843,"Mr. Starr, the conduct that can be charged is the same, but in one case you have the Government as a prosecutor."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,245.701,274.111,"--Justice Ginsburg, we believe the key distinction is the fact that there is an expansion in your hypothetical of the public service, which is quite decidedly different, in our view, than empowering private individuals who do not take the oath of office and who do not operate, as this Court has noted in case after case, with the same sort of strictures that a public actor, a public official acts under."
1996.95-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,332.528,349.639,"Mr. Starr, are you then saying that if the Government agency... let's say there's an antidiscrimination law that's put in the charge of a Government agency, and then Congress decides to add on to that a private right of action because the agency isn't well-enough staffed."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,361.326,369.441,"It seems to us that, while that is a more difficult question in terms of the creation of that sort of private right of action, yes."
1996.95-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,382.332,384.993,"Mr. Starr, you're not really saying that they can't do that."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,394.769,396.299,Exactly.
1996.95-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.299,397.591,So you're not speaking of the constitutionality.
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,397.591,397.861,No.
1996.95-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,400.133,400.513,Right.
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,400.513,401.064,--issue at all.
1996.95-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,416.272,422.797,"Well, what fairness here seems to be, in effect, an estimate of the odds of getting prosecuted, or the odds of getting caught."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,426.541,438.958,"--It is... I accept the point that the odds of getting caught would not, I believe, harkening back to Justice Ginsburg's hypotheticals, carry the day for me."
1996.95-1340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,521.412,522.501,"Well, it's not only fairness."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,534.489,547.148,"This Court has said with respect to statutes of limitation in particular that the elimination of that kind of defense does, in fact, work a change, and should not, in fact, be retroactively applied."
1996.95-1340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,547.148,547.639,What's your best case for that?
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,547.639,549.421,"I can get you that on rebuttal, Your Honor."
1996.95-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,549.421,557.776,"But that's a defense against everybody, isn't it, Mr. Starr, and this is not a defense against everybody, and it's a defense that doesn't have any relationship to the primary conduct."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,557.776,566.402,"It does have a relationship, Justice Souter, I believe, if I may beg to differ, with respect to what this bar is all about."
1996.95-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,604.886,615.593,"Yes, but of course, your answer assumes that in any event, even under the old regime, the Government could have sued for precisely what this particular relator is suing on."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,615.593,619.306,--That is correct.
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,688.142,695.085,"Before you leave that, could... if... suppose we were to disregard the label, jurisdictional or not, and look at it under--"
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,695.085,695.966,--I missed the first part of your--
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,695.966,703.69,"--Suppose that in looking to see whether it's retroactive or not you don't necessarily look just to the label, which is what you want."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,703.69,705.072,"--Yes, that is correct."
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,705.072,713.337,"Suppose we were to look at whether there was fair notice, reasonable reliance, and the settled expectations of your client, all right?"
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,713.337,714.058,Yes.
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,714.058,714.478,Landgraf.
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,726.036,728.837,It makes a material difference as to--
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,728.837,730.918,As to how they would have behaved had they only known.
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,730.918,731.63,--It makes a... sorry.
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,731.63,733.49,And what I want you to do is to explain how.
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,733.49,740.015,It makes a material difference in terms of the incentives to keep the Government apprised.
1996.95-1340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,765.032,775.62,"Well, you don't argue now and you don't argue in your brief that it gives them the incentive to disclose to some public group that there is a problem, and I suppose that that's because that's just unrealistic?"
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,775.62,780.834,"It is in the context of highly, shall I say sensitive and important projects."
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,785.147,786.295,Let me put the question differently--
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,786.295,787.046,--Yes.
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,787.046,790.78,--because I'm trying... suppose you find out that the Justice Department hires 50 more lawyers.
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,790.78,792.63,Yes.
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,792.63,794.613,Nobody would say that that makes any difference.
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,794.613,795.232,I agree.
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,795.232,798.585,"Although individuals might think, oh, boy, I better really be careful."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,801.737,802.688,Again--
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,802.688,809.284,"That is, what practical difference does it make to your client, had your client known in advance that this new law would have governed?"
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,809.284,810.863,"--Again, it seems--"
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,810.863,811.313,Other than--
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,811.313,811.794,--Yes.
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,811.794,812.713,--there are 50 more lawyers.
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,812.713,819.439,"No, that the incentives again are, with respect to the underlying conduct, keep the Government fully informed."
1996.95-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,978.592,979.203,Mr. Starr--
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,999.545,999.996,Yes.
1996.95-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,999.996,1001.268,Is that a public disclosure?
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1001.268,1001.979,"Yes, it is."
1996.95-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1002.778,1003.659,Just one person--
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1003.659,1003.99,--Yes.
1996.95-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1003.99,1005.5,--no matter how high up in the company.
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1005.5,1023.672,"Yes, it is, and the reason that, Your Honor, while that seems counterintuitive, we think a careful reflection of the... both congressional purposes but also, Your Honor, if one looks at the rest of 3730(e)(4)(A), there is a very important and forgotten person in the drama, and that's the original source."
1996.95-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1062.037,1071.283,"But Congress did use the words, public disclosure, and the words public disclosure generally imply something more than tell one officer of the company."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1071.283,1074.835,--I could not agree more in the normal context.
1996.95-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1121.656,1170.948,"Well, what your interpretation may mean in effect is that for almost any Government investigation, or audit of some suspected fraud or false claim, if, in conducting the audit or the investigation anyone other than the wrongdoer is asked questions, other employees, sub-employees, any employee, then it seems under your interpretation it virtually wipes out an audit or an investigation for any qui tam action, ever, because inevitably I guess some employee would be talked to who wasn't party to the alleged wrongdoing."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1170.948,1180.375,"--The apparent harshness of the regime that I am espousing and that you're discerning, Justice O'Connor, is upon reflection true to Congress' intent."
1996.95-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1208.514,1212.024,"Yes, but there's another value, and that's the value of the prosecution."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1219.371,1239.443,"I agree with that as well, because there is, in fact... but I don't think that that should change the Court's disposition, but the Second Circuit's approach is correct and the Ninth Circuit's approach is wrong, because, in fact, of the concern that in this balance that the public prosecution function is important, but it in fact needs to be supplemented by private relators."
1996.95-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1266.261,1270.605,"Mr. Starr, it's public disclosure in one of a series of different kinds of hearings and so forth."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1270.605,1271.114,--Yes.
1996.95-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1271.114,1274.405,Which is the category in which this public disclosure was made?
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1274.405,1279.049,In an administrative audit or investigation.
1996.95-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.369,1314.282,"Mr. Starr, suppose Congress had written this statute 3729(a)(1) and (2), which is what you're addressing here--"
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1314.282,1315.582,--Yes.
1996.95-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.582,1328.031,"--without the word public in it, and it just said, no court shall have jurisdiction under this section based upon the disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing and a congressional blah, blah, blah, blah, and so forth."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1333.304,1334.035,Yes.
1996.95-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.338,1357.55,"But an administrative investigation doesn't necessarily mean disclosure outside the Government, does it?"
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1357.55,1381.436,"--No, it does not, but there has to be disclosure... the point is, as one takes the entirety of the provision, there must be a disclosure, then apply allegations or transactions in this... so under my interpretation of your redrafted statute, Justice Scalia, it might very well be that under this disclosure would have taken place if there was a communication from DCAA to the Air Force."
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1387.461,1391.494,But is there such a thing as an audit or investigation where they don't even tell the person audited?
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1407.923,1416.709,"Your Honor, I think you have collapsed the object of the wrongdoer, which is a ""corporate entity"" with what Congress was trying to encourage--"
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1416.709,1417.47,"No, I'm just saying in your view--"
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1417.47,1418.031,--which is whistleblowers.
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1418.031,1422.405,"--In your view, it makes it public if you just tell the corporate entity being investigated?"
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1422.405,1432.27,"I think it has to come to the attention of an individual who was... we believe the Second Circuit is right here, which is the most natural approach, someone who is not involved--"
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1432.27,1432.701,Fine.
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1457.828,1460.069,--I would very much lose because of the last part of your definition.
1996.95-1340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1460.069,1466.423,"Yes, but if you're interested in, say, a clear rule of law that's minimal and satisfies all your requirements, why wouldn't that do it?"
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1466.423,1481.764,"Because I think that will strike a very different balance than what Congress struck, Justice Breyer, because what you will be doing is, in fact, encouraging, quote, whistleblowing actions by individuals who have no information to provide to the Government."
1996.95-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1495.952,1500.665,Why do you make the assumption that Congress did not also have the purpose to encourage prosecution?
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1500.665,1502.505,--It is a balance.
1996.95-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1532.415,1540.231,Will the fact that in fact it saved the Government money at the end of the day result in some reduction of the ultimate liability here?
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1540.231,1542.824,If there's a technical... this is... if I may--
1996.95-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1542.824,1545.245,"If it's technical, because I just don't understand the real effect--"
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1545.245,1546.594,--The--
1996.95-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1546.594,1548.817,--if you allow the suit to go forward at the end of the day.
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1548.817,1557.323,"--The underlying problem, Your Honor, is in fact the Ninth Circuit's... which is our third argument, the definition of false claim as the Ninth Circuit has now defined it."
1996.95-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1584.13,1595.217,"Well, but the act doesn't just say false or fraudulent claim, it says a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1595.217,1596.689,That's exactly right.
1996.95-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1596.689,1605.594,"So if you seek approval of... you know, I assume that means approval that this portion of the job has been fully completed satisfactorily."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1606.694,1616.01,"It depends upon whether it is, in fact, a condition of contracting and whether there is a falsity that affects your entitlement to claims."
1996.95-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1616.01,1617.142,It doesn't say that.
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1622.555,1654.235,"For approval simply means that the Government must, in fact, say, we are... we have your request, and we will now pay or approve its payment, and what we think, Your Honor, the difficulty in what the Ninth Circuit has done, is to take any kind of violation, whether it has an effect on your entitlement to the payment or approval for payment and says regardless, whether it's an environmental regulation, if it's not a condition for contracting, you've stated a False Claims Act, and Justice O'Connor--"
1996.95-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1654.235,1656.017,"So you read approval to mean, approval for payment."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1658.92,1659.678,--Approval for payment.
1996.95-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1659.678,1661.37,It doesn't say that.
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1663.361,1669.015,"Well, we think that the case law, Your Honor, is very clear with respect to what the nature of a claim is."
1996.95-1340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.756,1685.594,"Thank you, Mr. Starr."
1996.95-1340,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1685.594,1686.866,I thank the Court.
1996.95-1340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.866,1688.366,Mr. Gold.
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1718.216,1722.971,"Two things, if I could, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1738.96,1739.551,Right.
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1739.551,1743.664,--but rather that the Government had lost money.
1996.95-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1775.514,1778.657,And what is that penalty if no money is lost--
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1778.657,1821.964,"Well, it is still... at the time it was $2,000... a false claim, and I think the point of this, Justice O'Connor, is shown first of all by the particular provision we have here in the background, or as we emphasize in our brief, a case like the Rohleder case in the Third Circuit, where the contractors certified that subcontracts had been let as was required by the Government regulations through competitive bidding, when in fact they hadn't."
1996.95-1340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1821.964,1829.421,"--Mr. Gold, I expect the $2,000 is peanuts compared to what else you're entitled to, and that is the costs of the action, the costs of the civil action."
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1844.239,1847.561,And getting those from the plaintiff's--
1996.95-1340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.561,1849.062,Would be--
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1849.062,1849.533,--point--
1996.95-1340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.533,1849.903,--Right.
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1849.903,1856.288,"--Well, but also from the point of view it is not... from the plaintiff's point of view it's not much of an enrichment."
1996.95-1340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1862.482,1865.985,But that explains why the suit proceeds.
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1877.383,1878.071,--Right.
1996.95-1340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.071,1878.903,Plus what you'll spend in--
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1878.903,1885.387,"And if I could, and then I'd like to go back to the law issues here, the two issues left in this case."
1996.95-1340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2040.6,2042.169,--This is addressed to the third question?
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2042.169,2043.479,The third question.
1996.95-1340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2052.237,2063.433,"On that question, Mr. Gold, it seems to me just as a practical matter the board of directors of a defense corporation would say, you know, in the light of this new statute, we have an expanded new liability for punitive damages."
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2084.447,2113.268,"I don't think there is any doubt that when you change a jurisdictional bar, which we think it's fair to call this... I mean, it doesn't go to the merits... in a way which makes it easier for plaintiffs to bring suit, opens the courthouse door, you have some effect on the legal regime."
1996.95-1340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2113.268,2116.13,"But it does take away a defense, does it not?"
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2116.13,2118.812,I don't believe it takes away a defense.
1996.95-1340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2118.812,2121.744,Because previously you had a defense if you disclosed to the Government.
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2123.283,2129.999,"You had a defense in terms of saying, this person cannot be a plaintiff."
1996.95-1340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.965,2226.872,"Mr. Gold, would you explain to me again how it could be under the old regime that if I was a contractor and I disclosed to the Government, I could nonetheless be held liable--"
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2226.872,2229.753,You... if--
1996.95-1340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.753,2231.155,--under the False Claims Act.
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2231.155,2255.66,"--If you had a situation in which you disclosed to the Government your prior nondisclosure, the Government certainly could act to bring the suit."
1996.95-1340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.552,2258.214,Let's assume I disclose at the outset.
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2258.722,2260.975,"--Well, there's simply no violation."
1996.95-1340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2260.975,2262.245,--Under the old regime.
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2262.245,2263.737,Under any regime.
1996.95-1340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2263.737,2274.884,"Well, you're not saying, Mr. Gold, that the statute made no change by eliminating a defense that had previously been available."
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2276.784,2279.715,"No, I... I would not want to say that."
1996.95-1340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2317.88,2333.321,"So the effect of a disclosure before this change was exactly what it is after the change, and secondly you're saying there is no provision under the new statute for a relator to bring an action if the Government couldn't bring an action."
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2333.321,2343.169,"There's no... if the Government brings the first case, there can be no relator."
1996.95-1340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2352.064,2356.475,"But they're saying, I think, which is bothering me too, that it just isn't fair."
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2393.331,2416.837,"The proposition that you can after the fact, which is what we're dealing with here, tell the Government something and save yourself from liability is simply an erroneous statement."
1996.95-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2417.828,2444.635,"Well, but now you're ignoring, I think, the point, which is if you fail as a Government contractor to disclose something on the form that the Government said you should have put it on, and the contractor later realizes, oh, that should have been on that form 8929, and it wasn't, I'm going to tell the Government, I really goofed, I made the mistake, the Government can still sue, but you've told 'em."
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2458.915,2459.373,--Well--
1996.95-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2459.373,2463.958,"So to that extent there is a retroactive change, is there not?"
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2463.958,2478.225,--There is a retroactive change in terms of the... the openness of the courts to the private party.
1996.95-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2518.243,2538.176,"Well, but isn't that what this petitioner is coming before us and alleging, that until the 1986 amendments we had assumed that while the Government could still complain, that no qui tam action could be brought by this particular relator, and they say that was this situation."
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2540.497,2545.33,"--Well, two things, if I could, because I'm down to my last 5 minutes."
1996.95-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2730.414,2736.906,"But do you agree with the Solicitor General's definition, because as I read the briefs, you and the Solicitor General have a different approach."
1996.95-1340,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2736.906,2749.875,"Well, in the peculiarities of this case, our approach and the Government's come down to the same thing."
1996.95-1340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2814.618,2816.08,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2817.889,2824.896,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2905.477,2905.997,Excuse me.
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2916.973,2934.825,"--Justice Scalia, if the misstatement could not as a matter of law have borne on the entitlements claimant, or entitlement to payment, it would not be a violation of the act, and there are many statements that might be false statements under 1001 that would not qualify."
1996.95-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2942.97,2947.755,"Well, I mean, there also may be some provisions about you have to report this, that, and the other thing."
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2956.73,2957.701,I think that's right.
1996.95-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.735,2969.228,So you're willing to be committed to that.
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2971.41,2972.091,Yes.
1996.95-1340,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2974.632,2976.012,Is that another way of saying it must be material?
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2976.012,2977.604,Yes.
1996.95-1340,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2977.604,2978.754,Yes.
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2978.754,2996.845,"In fact, I think, although the courts have torn themselves inside out trying to determine whether in this provision and the criminal false claims provision materiality is an element, in fact, to the extent materiality is an element, it really is embedded in the test of whether it bears on entitlement to payment or a benefit."
1996.95-1340,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3059.266,3063.2,"What about a disclosure to, say, not just to Hughes but to Northrop in a case like this?"
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3063.2,3068.963,"--Well, I think a disclosure to Northrop would be in most instances a public disclosure."
1996.95-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.08,3101.535,"Well, Mr. Waxman, before you do that, have you... are you changing your position from what the Government... I didn't understand that to be the Government's position in its briefs."
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3116.243,3117.494,--To the extent--
1996.95-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3117.494,3118.435,Wasn't that the test in your brief?
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3118.435,3121.086,--There was some language in our brief to that effect.
1996.95-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3122.178,3122.478,Well--
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3122.478,3127.922,"--that was the burden of our statement, but we... in an effort to create a bright line--"
1996.95-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3127.922,3128.843,--So you--
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3128.843,3139.91,"--we are saying that if it's disclosed, either by the Government or by Hughes management, to someone in the corporation because they're a corporate employee, that's not public disclosure."
1996.95-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3184.509,3187.872,--As an employee means he acquires it by reason of his employment.
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3191.162,3193.575,Receives it because he is an employee.
1996.95-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3205.233,3208.675,What if somebody who happens to be a messenger in the company happens to see that?
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3213.147,3218.029,I was confident we would get into some hypotheticals.
1996.95-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3218.029,3220.783,"Well, you say it's a clear line."
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3221.082,3225.806,"My clear line is that that would not be a public disclosure, because we need a clear line."
1996.95-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3249.562,3250.851,Unless it has nosy messengers.
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3250.851,3251.802,Excuse me?
1996.95-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3251.802,3253.412,Unless it has nosy messengers.
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3253.412,3272.527,"Unless it has nosy messengers, and I think that this really is the test that does approximate as best as we can determine what Congress' intent was with respect to the changing of the... just changing of the qui tam bar from Government information to public disclosure."
1996.95-1340,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3274.005,3277.458,"On that point, with respect to retroactivity, assume this is not a jurisdictional bar."
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3284.363,3311.312,"--We think that the statute is not truly retroactive even taking your point about the defense as against a qui tam relator, because this Court stated in Landgraf that a statute has genuine retroactive effect only where the statute would either impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed."
1996.95-1340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3312.141,3313.332,So how does it work with the statute of limitations?
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3313.332,3332.365,"--Here, application of the new qui tam provisions will not impair any legal rights that Hughes possessed when it acted, it will not increase any Hughes legal liability for its past conduct, and it will not impose any new legal duties on Hughes with respect to transactions already completed."
1996.95-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3333.265,3336.157,"As to number 2, that depends on whether you want to be realistic or not."
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3336.157,3351.157,"--Well, yes, but this Court did say... I do want to be... I want to be very realistic, and I think this Court in Landgraf was realistic in saying a statute does not operate retrospectively merely because it upsets expectations based in prior law."
1996.95-1340,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3357.941,3361.444,So you would say if there were additional punitive damages that would be no good.
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3361.444,3362.303,That--
1996.95-1340,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3362.303,3362.814,That would up the penalty.
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3362.814,3363.605,--That is correct.
1996.95-1340,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3363.605,3365.926,But the fact that there are going to be more litigation costs--
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3365.926,3367.769,That is absolutely correct.
1996.95-1340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3367.769,3376.855,"--So how does reviving an action by, say... statute limitations, 10 years later, 20 years later, Congress says, oh well, we'll change it."
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3376.855,3381.537,The cause of action here is a cause of action under the False Claims Act.
1996.95-1340,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3385.37,3386.579,Finish your answer.
1996.95-1340,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3386.579,3397.499,"And, indeed, even under the prior regime, if Mr. Schumer had filed an action, and it turned out the information was in the Government's files, we could have taken over the case and it would have proceeded."
1996.95-1340,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3398.415,3400.182,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
