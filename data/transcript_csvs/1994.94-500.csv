1994.94-500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.747,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 94 500, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Erich Schleier, and Helen B. Schleier."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,10.388,13.74,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-500,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,117.277,126.754,"But you do have a tort like remedy in the sense that you have in effect punitive damages, and that's tort, that's not contract."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,126.754,135.19,The tort like remedy is to be a tort like remedy for a personal injury.
1994.94-500,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,156.013,161.377,"But they get us... they get us outside the simple ambit of Burke, though."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,161.377,162.518,"No, I don't think so."
1994.94-500,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,168.743,170.813,That was not the majority opinion.
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,170.813,172.633,"No, you state in your concurring opinion--"
1994.94-500,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,172.633,173.705,"I thought it was very good, but--"
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,173.915,193.157,"--What I'm trying to say is that in your concurring opinion you said that the majority holds that what determines a tort like claim is whether... is solely whether the claim remedies the personal components of the employee's loss, and we think that's the correct interpretation of Burke."
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,249.875,258.16,"Mr. Jones, is it not the case that age discrimination claims are sometimes joined with title VII claims?"
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,261.272,266.207,"It may be that there are independently violations of those two separate statutes, but there's no--"
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,266.207,292.513,"But my question is, if you can bring both claims, as I understand you can, and this will cover settlements as well as litigated cases, then can't the parties manipulate themselves in and out of tax consequences by either putting the damages under title VII in their settlement papers or under the age discrimination act?"
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,292.513,299.597,"--Here again, you run into the resistance of the Commissioner to mere form as opposed to substance."
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,333.039,341.455,How are Equal Pay Act cases treated in this regime that the Commissioner is now administering?
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,341.455,350.471,I have to admit that's a very difficult question for me because I'm not 100 percent confident on the remedial scheme of the Equal Pay Act.
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,393.958,395.09,But there's a case where there would be a total overlap.
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,401.835,404.987,"I'm sorry, I really can't answer that question."
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,412.07,440.27,"Well, my concern is that you take this panoply of antidiscrimination laws, title VII, the Equal Pay Act, the age discrimination act, the disabilities act, and they all seem to be remedying the same type of wrong, yet in some cases the award will be excludable and in other cases they will not, and what sense does that make?"
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,440.27,445.542,"Well, it makes sense in respecting the distinctions that Congress drew between those statutory schemes."
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.849,505.891,"And even if we take title VII itself, and now in the post... was that 1991?"
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,505.891,506.272,1991.
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,506.272,524.153,"Even two parts of title VII, I believe your position is that if it's intent discrimination then it's excludable, but if it's impact, then it's not excludable, and those two are often pled in the alternative."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,524.153,524.473,Certainly.
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,524.473,528.467,"I think it's an intent case, but if I don't make it on that, then it's an impact case."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,528.467,540.806,It would be inconsistent with Burke to regard the disparate impact case which provides only for back wages to be excluded from income.
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,572.566,590.748,"So but you're largely, then, leaving it, at least as far as settlement is concerned, up to the parties when you have, it could be one or could be the other, and good faith you could plead one or the other, but for settlement purposes you'll pick the one with the advantageous tax consequences."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,590.748,599.344,"As I have already explained, the Service's only tool in that situation is to enforce what it believes to be the substance of the party's recoveries."
1994.94-500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,760.678,769.683,"In the law of torts generally, in the case law on torts and in the treatises, do we often refer to liquidated damages?"
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,772.997,784.844,"Well, liquidated damages I think came out of contracts, but I think that what we have to... what... Lorillard v. Pons is helpful in understanding what's going on here."
1994.94-500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,826.692,839.439,"Liquidated damages in traditional contract law often means a sum that is awarded because the actual damages would be very difficult to assess, doesn't it?"
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,839.439,840.26,--That's correct.
1994.94-500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,858.612,874.054,"Mr. Jones, as you know, I didn't... in Burke did not think that your regulation making the line, the tort like line was within the statute, but we held that it was."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,899.488,915.561,"Well, the point that we're... the distinction I'm trying to make when I talk about wilful is whether the resulting award is compensation for the underlying injury or compensation... or rather, not compensation, but punishment for the employer's misconduct."
1994.94-500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,915.561,917.481,"Well, you could say the same about assault."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,923.405,930.299,"I think the difference is that when the statute refers to injury, I think it's in the legal... context of the legal injury."
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,948.031,949.022,These aren't punitive damages.
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,961.231,977.66,"--Sometimes, but I think what I was trying to point out is it's reasonably clear that in dragging this term along into the ADEA it wasn't describing the contractual historical notion of liquidated damages."
1994.94-500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1006.011,1015.376,"But what about a State tort statute that says, henceforward for certain types of torts... let's say torts by ski resorts."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1041.163,1049.959,--It becomes... it... that's a question that I think the Commissioner would answer it becomes a nontort like remedy for a personal injury.
1994.94-500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1049.959,1054.921,"All right, but that's not what I would consider... I mean, I don't know what we... what you meant by tort like."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1057.593,1057.903,"That's right, it is--"
1994.94-500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.903,1059.205,"--not you personally, Mr. Jones--"
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1059.205,1059.626,--I think--
1994.94-500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1059.626,1059.836,--but the IRS--
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1059.836,1060.206,--Yes.
1994.94-500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1060.206,1067.14,"--invented this tort like thing, but I would not consider the touchstone of tort like to be whether you are entitled to pain and suffering damages."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1067.14,1074.395,"Well, again, you have to focus on just not tort like, but the context of this is tort like remedy for a personal injury."
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1103.194,1117.813,"May I take it that the Commissioner then, despite Justice Scalia's opinion, had no occasion to rethink whether it should maintain this tort or tort type rights regulation?"
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1135.113,1155.937,"In two rulings issued by the Service both before and after Burke, the agency has concluded that a statutory remedy that provides simply back wages and liquidated damages in an equal amount and that does not, like an ordinary tort, provide compensation for personal components of the loss, is not excluded from income under the regulation."
1994.94-500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1160.85,1169.559,"But is it not true that even if it were not a tort like remedy, if it's a remedy for personal injuries, you still get the exclusion."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1171.679,1179.353,"Workman's Compensation comes in directly under a different part of 104(a), and in fact you don't have to--"
1994.94-500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1179.353,1181.824,"What about an insurance recovery, say, on account of--"
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1181.824,1185.917,--Insurance recovery... a mere accident comes in under 104(a)(3).
1994.94-500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1185.917,1187.738,"--So it doesn't have to be a tort, is what I'm trying to--"
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1187.738,1202.999,"Under 104(a)(2) it has to be damages on account of personal injury, which the Service interpreted to require there to be a tort or tort like compensation or the personal injury, so it's easy to overrun the various components of the statute."
1994.94-500,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1236.091,1236.371,--It's--
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1236.371,1239.302,--of limitless factual variation like cases are treated alike.
1994.94-500,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1239.302,1250.631,"--The... you put your finger on just the part that's bothering me, that I don't understand this tort like notion."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1275.667,1276.496,Yes.
1994.94-500,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1276.496,1285.262,"So you argued both things, so my question really is, isn't this effort to say is it really a tort or is it really something else, just a waste of time?"
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1285.262,1293.049,It's not so much a waste of time as I will concede that it is... it tends to create confusion.
1994.94-500,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1293.049,1305.356,"So why not say, forget IRS reg to the contrary notwithstanding, forget whether characteristically it's called under ancient history in Blackstone or something tort, or has some other name."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1313.411,1313.671,I understand.
1994.94-500,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1313.671,1314.942,I just want to get your reaction.
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1314.942,1322.578,"Well, my reaction to that is that the Service since 1960 has applied this regulation to pursue the goal that you've described."
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1370.638,1381.135,"If, in fact, the remedy in a title 7 case, let's say, is just back pay and nothing further is awarded, it's still excludable under the current position of the service, is it not?"
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1381.135,1385.837,"If it's a title VII remedy, that for a--"
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1385.837,1386.398,But did you--
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1386.398,1391.441,"--portion of title VII it provides additional compensation, then it qualifies as a tort like remedy."
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1391.441,1394.824,"--Even though, in fact, the jury awards only back pay."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1394.824,1399.277,"Only back pay, and I think I can explain that, but it's complicated."
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1417.149,1418.458,You're talking in the traditional tort--
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1418.458,1418.859,--I'm talking--
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1418.859,1419.78,--the personal injury type tort--
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1419.78,1421.341,--I'm talking in the traditional sense.
1994.94-500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1421.341,1433.679,"--but here you've got the exact same thing that you have in Burke, except now the statute says, in addition to back pay... we're not measuring the losses if we were talking about personal injury automobile accident, it's straight back pay."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1433.679,1434.05,No.
1994.94-500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1439.963,1445.487,"Mr. Jones, what do you do about... remember my ski resort example."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1445.487,1445.728,Yes.
1994.94-500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1445.728,1458.326,Which you said isn't a tort because there's no... suppose someone's injured under such a statute and is not killed but is injured to such a degree that the person becomes ill and cannot go to work.
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1475.546,1477.567,"That sounds correct, and I also want to emphasize--"
1994.94-500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.567,1479.648,"It sounds correct that it's strange, or it sounds--"
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1479.648,1496.161,"--No, it sounds correct that your literal interpretation of the statute makes some sense, but what I want to emphasize is that the hypothetical that you've postulated doesn't really have enough information in it for me to feel like I can offer a firm view of how the Service would react to it."
1994.94-500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1500.291,1516.533,"--I cannot imagine why any interpretation which applies a different test when the person just gets sick and is out of work for that reason and another test where the person loses the job by reason of the same tort, I just... that seems to me weird."
1994.94-500,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1516.533,1534.346,"There's one other point that I just have to talk about briefly, because it's a very important point to the Commissioner, and that is that liquidated damages should be excluded from income for an additional reason, which is that their award only for wilful violations is analogous to punitive damages and private fines."
1994.94-500,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1587.419,1588.97,"Very well, Mr. Jones."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1590.302,1596.837,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1652.953,1657.545,"Burke was a title VII claim, wasn't it, or a pre 1991 title VII?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1657.545,1658.607,"--It was, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1658.607,1660.827,"And you're not quarreling with that decision, I take it?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1660.827,1661.418,Not at all.
1994.94-500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1699.553,1703.025,"Oh, but Congress treats it... the statutes are not fungible."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1707.227,1708.008,They are different.
1994.94-500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1708.008,1709.4,"That's Congress' decision, not ours."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1709.4,1717.946,"They are different, Justice Stevens, but the remedies... and I emphasize the remedies, because Burke did speak in terms of remedial schemes."
1994.94-500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1731.694,1734.876,"Well, can you get... you can get punitive damages under title VII as amended, can't you?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1734.876,1735.667,"Yes, you can, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.667,1737.527,"Unlimited, and you can't get those here."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1737.527,1744.453,"If I may correct you, Your Honor, punitive damages as well as pain and suffering under post 1991 law are kept."
1994.94-500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1750.917,1754.718,"Yes, but that... you can get 300,000 if your actual damages are only 20."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1754.718,1756.611,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1756.611,1758.793,Whereas you can't do that under this statute.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1758.793,1759.974,"That is true, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1759.974,1761.845,So the statutes are not all exactly alike.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1761.845,1762.225,I--
1994.94-500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1762.225,1762.796,That's all I'm suggesting.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1767.438,1773.01,"--I agree with Your Honor that they are not alike, just as title VII's remedial scheme is not exactly the same as the disabilities act."
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1773.01,1776.803,"Well, maybe the problem is not the Internal Revenue Code or the IRS."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1786.931,1787.27,Well--
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.27,1801.759,"Congress has simply provided an irrational differential in compensation, but if that produces an irrational differential in tax law, the problem is with the origin of the relief."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1801.759,1808.314,"--Your Honor, we don't feel that there is an irrational difference between the ADEA and title VII, or the disabilities act."
1994.94-500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1856.816,1860.928,"Yes, but there's another difference that keeps running through my mind."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1883.044,1890.368,"Your Honor, I'm in a difficult position to say whether a plaintiff who is a victim of age discrimination feels less hurt than other plaintiffs."
1994.94-500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1920.948,1930.335,"The disabilities act comes under, is under the title VII pattern rather than the age discrimination pattern, does it not, the Americans With Disabilities Act?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1930.335,1934.088,"Your Honor, it is probably closer to the title VII pattern."
1994.94-500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1937.329,1941.21,But it has a broader panoply of remedies than the age discrimination act.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1941.21,1942.612,"Broader, Your Honor, yes."
1994.94-500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1950.737,1961.774,"To the extent that the core remedy under the age discrimination act is making up for lost wages, why should that escape income tax?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,1961.774,1972.262,"Your Honor, the reason for that is the reason which I think has ultimately been recognized by the Internal Revenue Service itself in Revenue Ruling 93 88."
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1998.9,2002.021,"Well, the statute doesn't talk about tort like injuries, does it?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2002.021,2002.66,"No, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2004.493,2004.823,Personal injuries.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2004.823,2011.657,The regulations define that to mean an action prosecuted involving tort or tort type rights.
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2011.657,2034.941,"Well, certainly if you just look at the term personal injuries, you think of it, you know, in terms of the sort of thing that comes as a result of, say, a typical automobile accident... you break your arm, you know, you can't walk right afterwards... not the sort of damages that you're talking about."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2034.941,2049.563,"Your Honor, historically it is true that personal injuries have emerged from the tort law, and many things that we would recognize as torts or tort like now did not exist, or would not have been recognized as causes of action in 1919 when the statute was enacted."
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2049.563,2052.572,"Yes, but as I say, the statute doesn't say tort like."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2052.572,2053.464,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2053.464,2060.58,The statute says... so I don't know that it's necessarily correct to say that anything you call tort like is a personal injury under the statute.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2068.804,2077.621,"We actually agree with that, Your Honor, because we believe the Court in Burke emphasized not only must there be a tort like character in the law, there has to be a personal injury."
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2113.815,2118.406,"Well, what about the tort of malicious interference with contractual relations?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2118.406,2118.767,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.497,2122.62,"That really is economic, isn't it, entirely?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2122.62,2125.543,"--That is correct, Your Honor, and that tort is not necessarily within the reach of this exemption."
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2130.845,2139.67,"Well, what if I'm a defendant in an action like that, or a plaintiff in an action, and you know, I'm not a company, I'm simply an individual."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2142.813,2147.294,"You may very well have, but I question under your hypothetical whether it is a personal injury."
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.34,2153.389,Why isn't it?
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2156.09,2157.612,A right to contract is--
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2157.612,2166.488,"Is that any less personal than a right to be employed regardless of my age, or to be employed regardless of my sex, or--"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2166.488,2171.031,"--Well, Your Honor, I think what you're getting at may be that the statute uses the term personal injury."
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.046,2181.829,"--Well, I think so, but we've abandoned that, and in fact it doesn't just say personal injury, it says personal injury or sickness, but we've abandoned that."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2181.829,2182.039,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2182.039,2182.848,We've said it means any... you know.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2186.44,2190.004,"And this is where the Threlkeld case, for example--"
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2190.004,2190.334,Yes.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2190.334,2191.216,--provides a guide.
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.631,2201.531,To the human identity.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2201.531,2207.535,"Yes, Your Honor, something that rises to the level of an intangible or a physical invasio of security."
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.535,2208.216,That's too profound for me.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2213.8,2216.622,Your Honors have asked two questions.
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2218.601,2220.792,Say over 60.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2220.792,2221.203,Okay.
1994.94-500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.661,2232.701,"Yes, but have you injured them in anything other than an economic way?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2234.293,2236.694,"--Oh, I think you may very well have."
1994.94-500,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2251.233,2275.48,"--Do you want to say something about the third... what seems like a third part of the statute, that as you've talked about the tort like nature of the suit, and I might go along with that for the sake of argument, the IRS reg defines the words, damages received, all right, and so the damages have to be damages from a tort like suit."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2275.48,2275.99,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2275.99,2281.073,"And also it says there somewhere in this background personal injury, and I'll go along with that."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2319.208,2322.49,"Let me explain, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2332.207,2332.808,I say yes.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2358.755,2364.127,"On account of, perhaps somewhat different from the phrase personal injuries, is not a precise term of art."
1994.94-500,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2365.089,2370.162,"Yes, but it still suggests that these personal injuries had something to do with--"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2370.162,2371.273,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2371.273,2373.595,"--on account of, and now that's the part I'd like you to address."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2373.595,2376.777,There is a loose notion of causation underlying that term.
1994.94-500,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2381.589,2386.491,"Simply but for, and then do you have authority for that, that it means only but for?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2386.491,2392.676,--I believe that was not addressed in the 1918 legislative history.
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2430.792,2435.194,"Well, never mind the measure, whether it's measured precisely by the personal injury."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2442.931,2444.424,"--Which individual, the--"
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.424,2448.905,The individual being discriminated against in an age discrimination case.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2448.905,2452.678,"--You do not have to show, necessarily, that the person was aware of that."
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2452.678,2453.279,That's the only personal injury.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2456.742,2457.083,Right.
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.083,2458.112,"Personal identity, whatever you said."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2458.112,2458.543,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2459.073,2462.135,"If the person didn't even know about it... but he's still entitled to damages, isn't he?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2462.135,2463.006,"--He is, Your Honor, because--"
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2463.006,2463.804,With no personal injury.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2464.886,2467.488,"--I disagree in one respect, Your Honor, respectfully."
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2474.192,2476.664,"Oh, I see, so it doesn't have to be on account of."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2476.664,2479.916,"It does, Your Honor, because there has to be an act of discrimination."
1994.94-500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2483.359,2484.708,But I don't understand your first answer.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2493.154,2503.682,"Well, I think Justice Scalia is hypothesizing a case in which it is quite possible a plaintiff may not be aware that the act is a violation of the ADEA."
1994.94-500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2504.921,2507.255,"Well, by the time the complaint is filed she surely does."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2507.255,2510.136,It is highly likely that by that point the plaintiff will be aware of it.
1994.94-500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2510.136,2537.135,"When... if you're right that this... these damages under the age discrimination act should be treated just like damages for disparate treatment under title VII, and then we come to the jury, and the question that the judge asks counsel is, he says, well, this is excludable from income, I understand."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2550.832,2552.242,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2555.915,2568.335,"Well, isn't there an irony, then, the one who ends up benefiting from this is the tortfeasor, because the jury will say, oh, well, we can give less because what we give is not going to be subject to tax."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2568.335,2575.908,It is possible that the tortfeasor in the age case just like the tortfeasor in any tort case may have to pay less to the victims.
1994.94-500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2575.908,2585.184,"But doesn't the judge also charge that they are supposed to make him whole, or her whole with respect to back wages?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2585.184,2588.927,"That would probably be the charge in an age case, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2677.905,2684.561,"Well, since Lord Campbell's act and Lord Tenterden's act, wrongful death does compensate for pain and suffering, doesn't it?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2687.353,2691.464,"Not all tort... or I believe not all wrongful death statutes do that, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2728.629,2732.042,"What kind of statutes are those, now, wrongful death statutes and any others that--"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2732.042,2734.634,"--Wrongful death is a particularly clear example of it, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2734.634,2735.543,--Okay.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2735.543,2743.299,"The ones that I mentioned, the Colorado statute we cited in our brief, the wrongful death statute in Revenue Ruling 84 108, the Federal Employer's Liability--"
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2743.299,2753.253,Do you know for a fact that the Government has allowed deduct... or nonreporting of income under those particular statutes that--
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2753.253,2760.49,"--Well, it's my understanding that the Revenue Ruling 84 108, which dealt with two wrongful death statutes... one is a Virginia statute and one is Alabama."
1994.94-500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2786.416,2795.462,"--Yes, but isn't that commanded... forget the regulation provision, wouldn't the plain language of the statute have compelled that result, if it's on account of personal injuries?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2795.462,2806.729,"--Well, we think so, Your Honor, but the Government has taken the position for this case that there is an absolute prerequisite under the Burke analysis that there be a count for something like pain or suffering."
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2806.729,2811.012,"Well, maybe... maybe that's explainable because that's real personal injuries--"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2821.879,2823.081,That may be.
1994.94-500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2825.152,2825.933,We didn't say that in Burke.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2828.394,2836.909,"--Nevertheless, we feel that illustrates why the Government's insistence on the presence of a pain and suffering count, as it were, is improper, is incorrect."
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2860.064,2864.809,"Well, isn't it entitled to deference in interpreting its own regulation?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2864.809,2873.213,It is entitled to deference with respect to agency views that first of all interpret a statute to which Congress has--
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2873.213,2877.475,"No, my question was, isn't it entitled to deference in interpreting its own regulation?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2877.475,2879.897,"--Within limits it is, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2893.557,2900.362,"Well, has it been inconsistent in its interpretation of its regulations as applied to this particular case?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2900.362,2901.181,"--Oh, I think so, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2922.485,2932.302,"Well, if the Government... if it turned out that we felt the Government were consistent in interpreting its regulation, would it then be entitled to deference in this case?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,2932.302,2936.093,"From what I've heard, no, because the Government is going contrary to the decision in Burke."
1994.94-500,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2957.537,2965.612,"Yes, but that was on the tort side, but certainly it did not dispense with the requirement that the injuries be personal injuries."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,3071.524,3071.792,Yes.
1994.94-500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3071.792,3094.668,"And if that is so, is this really the kind of case which the Court had in mind when it was pointing to the sort of discretionary valuation that juries make, and if the answer is no, then perhaps even though the jury and some panoply of remedy features are satisfied here, this still wouldn't fall within what Burke was getting at."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,3094.668,3114.69,"Well, the reason I think that is not the case, Justice Souter, is first of all the Court did cite the Rickel case, an age discrimination appellate decision, and the court also had as a background, as it were, the post 1991 amendments showing how the addition of certain features to a remedial scheme can apparently transform the character of the damages."
1994.94-500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3154.098,3159.491,But here the range is simply the liquidated damages double the back pay award.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,3159.961,3160.429,"That is right, Your Honor."
1994.94-500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3160.429,3161.821,--A range is one other remedy.
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,3161.821,3171.669,"It is one other remedy which, under prior decisions of this Court, Brooklyn Savings, Overnight Motor, was held to denote too difficult to measure, too obscure except for estimate by liquidated damages."
1994.94-500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3171.669,3206.04,"But if the Court thought that... if the Court thought that jury discretion in a different sense, discretion in weighing evidence to determine in the first place whether there had been a discrimination and, in the second place, whether it was wilful was important, then there would have been no need, I suppose, to emphasize the range of damages too, and when you get to the range of damages, isn't that a signal that what the Court was really talking about was a discretion that goes beyond the kind of discretion that we talk about in fact finding, and points--"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,3206.04,3206.301,Well--
1994.94-500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3206.301,3214.145,"--to the kind of discretion that we speak of in terms of valuation, which does not seem to be present here?"
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,3214.145,3215.487,--I understand Your Honor's point.
1994.94-500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3234.659,3244.105,"No, but in the presumed damages case, damages are presumed but the jury has to set the amount, whereas here, the jury does not have that kind of discretion."
1994.94-500,1,42880,thomas_f_joyce,,3251.09,3253.692,It is a matter of arithmetic once there's a finding of wilfulness.
