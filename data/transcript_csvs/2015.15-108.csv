2015.15-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.495,"We'll hear argument next in Case 15-108, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v. Valle. Mr. Landau."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,10.495,23.12,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case turns on the straightforward point that the people of Puerto Rico are the source of authority for the laws of Puerto Rico."
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,41.14,58.03,"Mr. Landau, could Congress amend 48 U.S.C. 1704, which covers Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa? Could it amend that statute and put Puerto Rico in there as well?"
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,58.03,72.47,"It could certainly amend that statute, Your Honor, with respect to Federal prosecutions in Puerto Rico pursuant to its authority over Federal prosecutors. Your question, Your Honor, raises a very intricate question with -- with --"
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,72.47,74.69,In -- in the statute is -- it works both ways.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,74.69,91.26,"In the statute, Your Honor, it does because there's no question Puerto Rico is in a unique status that is different than Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa precisely because those are all territories governed, as traditionally, by organic acts of Congress."
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,91.26,91.71,But is there -- is there --
2015.15-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,91.71,93.43,What -- what about the Northern Marianas?
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,93.43,109.1,"Your Honor, they are in an interesting position that is generally more analogous to Puerto Rico in the sense that they are a Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas with a compact of their own that was very much modeled on Puerto Rico, although it's somewhat different than the Puerto Rico model."
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,132.83,150.8,"Mr. Landau, could you finish your answer to my question? You said yes, as far as what the federal Congress can deal with, what the federal prosecutors do, but the statute works both ways. Are you saying it couldn't -- Congress has no power to do that with respect to Puerto Rico?"
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,150.8,163.27,"I would say, Your Honor, that that raises a very interesting and tricky issue with respect to the compact that the 1950 Public Law 600 offered the people of Puerto Rico that was accepted."
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,168.04,171.35,"You're saying it's a hard question, but you haven't given me --"
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,171.35,179.41,"Well, I -- I -- I think the answer is probably not, insofar as this Court said -- and I'm not saying this myself."
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,206.13,208.62,Just take the statute as it is.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,209.92,210.26,Right --
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,210.26,212.94,-- not telling prosecutors what to do in a particular case.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,212.94,234.29,"Well, and -- and, again, Your Honor, I think the critical point here, and I think what is most telling going back to some of the colloquy that just happened in the other case, Congress since 1952 has never attempted to do anything like that, to tell the people -- to exercise control over what the government officials in Puerto Rico --"
2015.15-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,234.29,235.405,That doesn't mean it couldn't.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,245.32,254.0,"It is not essential that you recognize Puerto Rico as a sovereign with a capital ""S,"" because if you get 12 political --"
2015.15-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.0,257.26,"That's our usual double jeopardy law, isn't it?"
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,257.26,257.65,It -- it is --
2015.15-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.65,260.16,"-- two sovereigns, it's a different matter."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,260.16,277.205,"It is the shorthand that this Court has typically used, the dual sovereignty doctrine. But the Court made clear this is the lesson of the Wheeler case where the court was -- the Ninth Circuit said, gee, these Indian tribes don't look like sovereigns to us, because they are subject to the plenary control of Congress."
2015.15-108,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,299.54,302.01,"Well, I don't understand how that helps you, Mr. Landau."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,309.485,310.0,Correct.
2015.15-108,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,310.0,313.4,But that seems to be just -- you're not taking another step back.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,324.135,326.38,"That, Your Honor, is the crux of the case."
2015.15-108,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,367.45,371.135,"Well, but Congress today, if it felt like it -- and of course it won't."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,374.56,380.275,"Well, this then goes to the relinquishment issue, Your Honor, in terms of what is the nature of the compact."
2015.15-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,393.08,398.775,"Well, suppose we assume that Congress could rescind the existing compact."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,398.775,399.974,Right.
2015.15-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,399.974,402.44,Do you then lose your case?
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,402.44,404.21,"Absolutely not, Your Honor. And that is --"
2015.15-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,404.21,404.98,Why?
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,404.98,407.855,"Because this is, again, the lesson of Wheeler."
2015.15-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,430.51,433.5,"Are there -- you know, ""sovereignty"" is a slippery word."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,446.415,452.88,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I couldn't agree more with your insight, that ""sovereignty"" is a slippery word."
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.68,528.185,"Mr. Landau, we have a situation as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,568.01,570.965,"You're absolutely -- you're absolutely right, Your Honor."
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,584.44,585.19,But they could.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,592.05,594.64,"No, that's absolutely right. And -- and about 21 --"
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,594.64,605.41,Then there's no way you could break that situation of having -- it depends on which -- which jurisdiction goes first.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,605.41,629.96,"That's correct, Your Honor. And that -- that is true in about 21 states, that as a matter of State law, either statutory or constitutional, do not allow a subsequent prosecution. But again, that doesn't change the point. What -- what made a cert grant appropriate and intolerable was that the Federal -- was the difference between the Federal and State courts in Puerto Rico on the Federal constitutional question."
2015.15-108,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,633.18,659.48,"Mr. Landau, there's something you said that resonates with me, because I've been trying to find a definition of ""sovereignty."" And one has been created in the briefing by saying that states are sovereign; yet if you look at international usage, they wouldn't consider states necessarily sovereign because they can't order their foreign affairs."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,694.49,695.39,Absolutely.
2015.15-108,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,695.39,701.395,And it can't be that it's the compact alone.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,704.575,705.295,Absolutely.
2015.15-108,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,705.295,710.305,-- that you meet that would create sovereignty in the Double Jeopardy sense?
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,710.305,742.41,"To -- to take your -- your question in turn, Your Honor, this Court has made it clear in a series of cases starting in Wheeler in 1978 that really tries to synthesize what the Court has been saying with respect to the dual sovereignty doctrine for over a century. And what the Court said is, in the Double Jeopardy context, we are trying to decide whether two offenses from different entities are the same offense. That has traditionally been called ""dual sovereignty."" But what we mean by ""dual sovereignty"" in this context doesn't require this broader -- let's say -- I'll call it ""sovereignty with a capital S"" inquiry."
2015.15-108,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,749.265,757.78,"Now, I'm looking at Lanza, and it says -- I think Lanza says, and it's a Double Jeopardy --"
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,757.78,757.87,Right.
2015.15-108,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,757.87,789.83,"-- Clause, that for Double Jeopardy Clause purposes, sovereignty means, one, that the separate entity possesses the authority to determine what shall be an -- an offense against their peace and dignity; two, can enact laws without the interference of the other; and, three, draws authorities to punish the offender -- and this is the one that you've been arguing -- from a distinct source of power from the other sovereign."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,789.83,790.26,Right.
2015.15-108,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,790.26,793.3,And -- and you keep saying it's the Constitution.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,802.44,802.93,"It is, Your Honor."
2015.15-108,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,803.34,804.67,-- by this distinct source of power?
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,804.67,823.69,"If -- if could just say -- make two quick points in response to that. First, Lanza is not the last word on this because Wheeler, in the '70s, clarified what Lanza meant because, for instance, the Ninth Circuit in Wheeler said, well, the Indian Tribes don't fit the Lanza definition because Congress has plenary authority to overrule at any time."
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,843.51,860.71,"Mr. Landau, I thought that, in the -- in the case of the Indian Tribes, what -- what the Court said is they were once sovereign before we got here and we took some of that sovereignty away. That's not the case with Puerto Rico."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,860.71,861.315,Yes.
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,889.66,899.51,"But the rationale was that the tribes had this sovereignty, and that's what was being respected."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,899.51,900.7,"That -- that -- that is correct, Your Honor."
2015.15-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,916.95,918.785,"Well, what is it? That is, look."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,925.96,926.495,It does.
2015.15-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,926.495,930.05,The Insular Cases are totally changed in their applications.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,930.05,930.32,Right.
2015.15-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,930.32,940.58,"The political implications I'll just stay away from. On the other hand, if we write an opinion that says it's just a territory, that has tremendous implications."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,940.58,941.21,Correct.
2015.15-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,941.21,946.23,How did we tell the UN it wasn't a colony? Why are we not reporting on this colony every year?
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,946.23,946.83,Correct.
2015.15-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,946.83,957.705,"So either way, between those two, the implications in law and in politics and everything else are overwhelming. Therefore, you argue a third and middle position."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,987.31,987.82,Yes.
2015.15-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,987.82,989.875,"Take a little time, if you like."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,992.68,1004.34,"Absolutely, Your Honor. They are different, Your Honor, because Congress invited -- in Public Law 600, Congress said, we recognize the principle of government by consent."
2015.15-108,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1006.47,1008.235,Going back to the political issues.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1015.71,1016.31,Okay.
2015.15-108,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1016.31,1021.31,All right? Can the Federal government override a Puerto Rican law?
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1021.31,1022.05,Your Honor --
2015.15-108,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1022.05,1023.225,Can they --
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1023.225,1025.49,This goes to --
2015.15-108,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1025.49,1027.96,Can they veto a Puerto Rican law?
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1027.96,1028.88,"No, absolutely not."
2015.15-108,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1028.88,1029.125,All right.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1029.125,1029.845,They cannot.
2015.15-108,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1029.845,1031.575,Who makes these laws?
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1031.575,1043.16,"The people of Puerto Rico -- well, the Legislative Assembly, the -- the -- the legislative powers of which were vested by the people of Puerto Rico in the Legislative Assembly."
2015.15-108,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1049.99,1053.4,The laws were made by Puerto Rico's comparable Congress.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1053.4,1063.96,"That is correct, Your Honor. And -- and this is the -- I think the point I'd really like to underscore, because I think it's critical here, is this arrangement was not something that Puerto Rico did as a rogue usurpation of authority."
2015.15-108,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1073.07,1080.48,"Even in saying that, Mr. Landau, you're putting Congress in the driver's seat here: It was done at the invitation of Congress. Congress approved it."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1092.58,1092.77,Because --
2015.15-108,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1092.77,1104.58,"-- which seems to make that the issue? I mean, you can imagine a different Double Jeopardy jurisprudence where the issue was who just exercises authority in the real world? But that seems not to be what we ask."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1104.58,1106.15,That's -- that's correct. That's correct.
2015.15-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1157.02,1161.405,Let -- let's call this -- this theory of yours interim sovereignty.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1177.62,1178.88,"Your Honor, again, I think --"
2015.15-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1178.88,1180.56,I -- I -- I just don't know the answer to that.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1180.56,1188.27,"I think that -- that -- that, in a sense, the danger of that is that's already going back to asking about concepts of sovereignty."
2015.15-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1229.21,1229.5,Why does that --
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1229.5,1232.09,That's what distinguishes this from municipalities -- I'm sorry.
2015.15-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1232.09,1237.735,Why does -- why does the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have that authority? Where did it come from?
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1237.735,1246.245,"The -- Congress can recognize and invite an exercise of sovereignty, just like this Court recognized in Lara."
2015.15-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1246.245,1250.76,"But it had complete authority under the Territorial Clause whether to do that or not, right?"
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1250.76,1251.34,That's correct.
2015.15-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1252.29,1256.92,"So that would -- I -- it would seem to me, then, that the authority to do it came from Congress when they passed the --"
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1256.92,1257.12,But --
2015.15-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1257.12,1260.81,-- the law authorizing Puerto Rico to adopt a Constitution of its own.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1260.81,1263.17,But -- but this -- you just said authorizing.
2015.15-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1276.58,1280.66,"Why is -- I mean, you seem to fix on invited as somehow different than authorized."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1280.66,1292.275,"Well, even if you said -- I guess the point is authorized sounds like a delegation of authority. I think the point is Congress said, look, you go adopt your own constitution."
2015.15-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.765,1311.25,Aren't there territorial legislatures?
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1311.25,1312.88,"There are indeed, Your Honor. In -- in --"
2015.15-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1312.88,1313.77,What's the difference?
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1313.77,1314.46,The difference is --
2015.15-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1314.46,1321.78,Why -- why can't you say the laws they enact have as their source the -- the people of the territory?
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1321.78,1322.36,You could.
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1341.09,1355.01,"May I just ask you a question about that? I don't quite understand because this -- this whole issue is a result of a five-to-four decision of this Court in the 1950s, right? Bartkus."
2015.15-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1355.01,1355.565,Bartkus.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1355.565,1357.27,"But yeah, I mean, certainly --"
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1357.27,1362.31,"So -- so talking about cases before that, there was just -- there was no issue before that."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1362.31,1383.5,"Well, Your Honor, certainly the -- the principle of dual sovereignty had been recognized by this Court as early as the 1840s; in other words, that -- that two offenses for Double Jeopardy purposes were not the same if -- if they were created by different entities with something that this Court had recognized, albeit in --"
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1383.5,1391.445,"Recognized how, because this was -- it was a very close case, as you know."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1391.445,1392.28,Absolutely.
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1393.22,1395.415,And so I don't think it was settled before then.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1395.415,1402.4,"Well, but it -- it was something that -- it has been an issue that had divided people in the Court."
2015.15-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1411.625,1419.905,"I'm questioning you looking back before the Bartkus case, for precedent."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1419.905,1420.74,Right.
2015.15-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1449.47,1455.615,"Mr. Landau, I'm not sure you answered my question about why territorial legislatures are different."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1455.615,1460.81,They are different because those -- the other ones are Home Rule legislatures.
2015.15-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1490.07,1505.36,"If you say that the issue is the source of the law in question, it seems to me that the territorial legislature is as much the source of a law as is the legislature of Puerto Rico."
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1505.36,1509.9,"The question, Your Honor, is the ultimate source of authority for the law."
2015.15-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1538.82,1540.29,I see your -- I see your time is getting up.
2015.15-108,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1553.37,1557.48,"Well, you -- again, that would be another way of looking at the -- at the issue."
2015.15-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1588.815,1596.61,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Unikowsky."
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1596.61,1610.42,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under our Constitution, States are sovereign and territories are not. Although Puerto Rico has indisputedly achieved a historic degree of autonomy, it remains a territory under Article IV."
2015.15-108,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1626.75,1638.01,"It does seem, Mr. Unikowsky, as if Congress has given Puerto Rico as much authority as it possibly could have short of making it a State itself."
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1640.095,1641.16,"Well, two responses."
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1649.31,1650.875,What kind of territory is it?
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1650.875,1653.84,It is a -- we think there's only one type of territory --
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1653.84,1654.56,There is.
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1657.205,1657.87,"Well, yes."
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1661.72,1661.97,Okay.
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1662.89,1663.49,Yes.
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1663.49,1666.16,"Now, what is Estado Libre Asociado?"
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1666.16,1669.68,"Your Honor, I believe that's a case that just construed a Federal statute to hold --"
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1669.68,1669.88,"No, no."
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1673.03,1673.61,Well --
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1673.61,1675.595,The alternative of the word Commonwealth.
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1675.595,1676.49,"Well, Your Honor --"
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1676.49,1677.695,I just wonder what it is.
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1677.695,1683.24,"We believe that the Constitution does not include that as a constitutional category, just as it doesn't --"
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1683.24,1687.91,"Where does it say in the Constitution that Congress cannot? After all, Congress can admit a State."
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1689.225,1689.92,It certainly does --
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1689.92,1699.82,Talks about territories. So you're saying Congress and the President too do not have the authority to associate with some other entity under the form of Estado Libre Asociado?
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1699.82,1701.53,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1701.53,1703.35,Where does it say that in any of our cases?
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1703.35,1709.8,"Well, I think the Yankton case very clearly says that if a portion of land is not in a State, then it has to be under a territory."
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1709.8,1711.015,And what are the Indians?
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1711.015,1715.72,"Your Honor, the Indian tribes are a sui generis category explicitly recognized in the Constitution --"
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1715.72,1723.045,"Because -- because we do not recognize explicitly in the Constitution ""Commonwealth,"" therefore there is no Commonwealth? Is that what you want us to say?"
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1723.045,1727.61,I want you to say that this Court has already held in the Harris case that Puerto Rico is a territory.
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1728.63,1729.88,For some purposes.
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1843.83,1847.25,"Your Honor, those five things established --"
2015.15-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.25,1851.565,Take your time. (Laughter.)
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1851.565,1865.16,"I think those features of Puerto Rico and others established that Puerto Rico has undoubtedly achieved a significant degree of autonomy, but those characteristics are not the characteristics that matter for sovereignty purposes or for Double Jeopardy purposes."
2015.15-108,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1900.48,1917.425,But that was not true of many of the territories that were admitted as States. They came in to Statehood and were conferred by a -- the sovereignty was conferred by a -- agreement with the Federal government.
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1978.9,1984.08,"I think it wouldn't be a sovereign if that was not part of the United States, not subject --"
2015.15-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1984.08,1984.78,I couldn't hear.
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1985.6,1986.23,It wouldn't.
2015.15-108,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2014.7,2031.125,"But if Congress has that treaty power, why does it have similar power under its Rule and Regulation Clause of the Constitution? There's no limiting principle of what rules and regulations Congress can make."
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2031.125,2033.75,"Well, let me refer, Your Honor, both to --"
2015.15-108,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2033.75,2034.385,Under that --
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2034.385,2036.0,I apologize.
2015.15-108,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2036.0,2050.01,"Under that constitutional clause, there's no suggestion of how or even what kinds of treaties -- perhaps not in violation of the Constitution, but what kind of treaties Congress can make."
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2053.56,2055.01,"It does, Your Honor."
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2095.25,2095.7,The Indians.
2015.15-108,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2096.22,2106.335,"Mr. Unikowsky, it sure seems as though in the early 1950s, Congress with respect to Puerto Rico, said we want to give it some sovereign authority."
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2135.685,2137.565,"Well, I'd first push back on your premise."
2015.15-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2244.895,2265.93,"And is -- is our argument so abstract that it doesn't acknowledge real practicalities of multiple prosecutions? Of -- of course Mr. Landau couldn't come up and say, please forget Heath and Wheeler and Walter and Grafton."
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2295.54,2302.66,"I will acknowledge that there has been some law review articles suggesting that this whole line of cases is wrong and the Court should look to something else, to autonomy."
2015.15-108,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2339.47,2343.82,"Mr. Unikowsky, you -- you said before that Congress didn't mean to confer sovereignty here."
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2346.255,2347.44,"No, Your Honor, it could not."
2015.15-108,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2354.48,2355.175,I'm sorry.
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2362.16,2363.29,"Of course it could, Your Honor."
2015.15-108,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2363.29,2374.425,"So if it can do that, why can't it have other arrangements with Puerto Rico the way it has with everybody else? Why are we saying that with respect to territories they don't have that power?"
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2374.425,2384.445,"Your Honor, I think if Congress -- if Puerto Rico is to remain a territory, which it is under Article IV, as this Court has held, then Congress must retain the ultimate power."
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2389.27,2389.88,We need to.
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2394.43,2395.01,Your Honor --
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2395.01,2406.19,"UN said that Puerto Rico has been invested with the attributes of political sovereignty, which clearly identify the status of self-government attained by the Puerto Rican people."
2015.15-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.19,2408.58,Who said this? This is the UN?
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2408.58,2411.085,This is what we told the UN.
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2415.14,2416.7,And on the basis of that --
2015.15-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.7,2417.77,"Who -- who is ""we""? (Laughter.)"
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2417.77,2419.57,It's -- what it says here --
2015.15-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.57,2420.27,Who's we?
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2420.27,2422.24,It consists of the President of the United States.
2015.15-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.24,2422.94,The President said that?
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2422.94,2423.575,Or his delegate.
2015.15-108,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2424.2,2426.58,We need to involve counsel in the dialogue. (Laughter.)
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2426.58,2429.53,I -- I have.
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.165,2455.61,All right.
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2459.09,2466.64,"Your Honor, we don't see any inconsistency between what the State Department said and our position today --"
2015.15-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2466.64,2468.47,You said it was like a municipality.
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2481.88,2490.02,"Your Honor, there are differences between a municipality and Puerto Rico, such as Puerto Rico has a much more delegated power than the typical municipality."
2015.15-108,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2492.67,2504.79,"You think that doesn't have meaning? In most municipalities, their offenses are treated as criminal offenses and not criminal infractions."
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2554.415,2555.56,"Your Honor, may I answer?"
2015.15-108,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2555.56,2556.21,Briefly.
2015.15-108,1,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2556.21,2561.565,"Yes, Your Honor. I think that, already as of Shell, Puerto Rico enjoyed that broad police power."
2015.15-108,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2572.07,2582.225,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky."
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2582.225,2604.995,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think to respond to some of the questions that have come up, I'd like to go back and address what the Court has said this test is, for dual sovereignty in the Double Jeopardy context, and why it's been using that test. And the test that the Court has consistently used for the past 100 years is by looking to the ultimate source of the authority, the laws for prosecuting and the authority to prosecute."
2015.15-108,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2689.845,2691.005,I'm sorry.
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2744.98,2757.42,"I don't think that's right. And I'd like to just look at the specific example of Puerto Rico that the Court considered in the Shell case. As you say, by that point, Puerto Rico -- or as you suggested, there had already been significant self-government in Puerto Rico."
2015.15-108,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2791.135,2795.005,But you forget that Congress could veto those laws.
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2795.005,2795.78,It --
2015.15-108,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2795.78,2801.555,"Before 1952, Congress could veto Puerto Rico's laws."
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2803.54,2804.625,I don't think that that's right.
2015.15-108,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.57,2811.98,"Well, now, this is --"
2015.15-108,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2811.98,2813.41,-- gives plenary power to Congress.
2015.15-108,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2813.41,2862.61,"This is -- it's very interesting what you're saying. Remember, though, one of the provisions of the Puerto Rico Constitution, which Congress approved and said it was a Republican form of government, is that criminal actions shall be conducted in the name and by the authority of the people of Puerto Rico. Now, that sounds like a delegation of authority as to source, to go back to the Spanish system if they want. Now, if I take your view, then I guess you have to say -- and it has considerable implication -- that that doesn't matter because Congress can take back what they gave. Now, is that the position of the government or the executive branch? Because that has tremendous implication."
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2862.61,2862.87,Right.
2015.15-108,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2862.87,2887.585,"Because obviously, there is an argument as to whether what Congress and the President gave in Resolution 600, followed by the Constitution, followed by what happened at the UN, under the authority -- and looking to Felix Frankfurter for guidance, who said that the Constitution provides us with many forms of possible relationship."
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2923.51,2935.22,"Well, two -- two responses to that question. The first, I think, is the first part of your question, this statement in the Puerto Rico Constitution that the authority to prosecute comes from the people of Puerto Rico and that it's in the name of the people of Puerto Rico."
2015.15-108,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3041.53,3042.37,But there are some things --
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3042.37,3042.61,-- and in this --
2015.15-108,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3042.61,3054.705,Let's go back to the Insular Cases right there. There are different kinds of territories. It's because of that that Frankfurter says that the Constitution has left the field of invention open.
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3089.08,3095.7,"The Insular Cases were talking about something different and narrower, which is whether all the protections of the Bill of Rights apply to the territories by their own force."
2015.15-108,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3113.31,3126.515,"Do you think it's not possible, Ms. Saharsky -- I mean, putting aside whether Congress has done it here, but you think it's simply not possible for Congress to confer sovereignty in the sense that would matter for the Double Jeopardy Clause?"
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3126.515,3128.83,"Well, it certainly could by making it a State --"
2015.15-108,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3128.83,3129.21,Yes.
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3129.21,3130.67,-- or by making it independent.
2015.15-108,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3130.67,3132.87,But -- but -- but not short of that.
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3132.87,3136.98,We think that that would just be fundamentally inconsistent with the constitutional design.
2015.15-108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3166.77,3184.35,"Suppose Congress could also say, could it not, that -- in its criminal code, that if a crime has been prosecuted and under Puerto Rican law it will not be -- the same -- the same crime will not be prosecuted under Federal law?"
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3184.35,3185.35,"Well, I think there --"
2015.15-108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3185.35,3186.53,Couldn't it say that if it wanted to?
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3186.53,3188.26,I think there are two different options.
2015.15-108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3202.04,3220.135,"No -- well, but -- no, certainly Congress cannot -- cannot deny double jeopardy effect to something that would be double jeopardy, but I'm talking about a statute that says, even though it might have double jeopardy effect, we say -- we say no."
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3220.135,3233.09,"Well -- right, and what I'm saying is I think Congress' ability is to define crimes and to set out what -- what they are and where they are, but if the question is what the Fifth Amendment permits and doesn't permit, we really think that's up to this Court."
2015.15-108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3233.09,3235.11,"Well, it's not a matter of what the Fifth Amendment permits."
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3245.65,3246.25,Right.
2015.15-108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3260.07,3260.9,"No, no, I understand that."
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3260.9,3261.58,But they're looking at it --
2015.15-108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3261.58,3265.4,"I'm just saying, if you like that result, it can be done by the statute."
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3265.4,3266.96,Right -- I'm sorry if I misunderstood the question.
2015.15-108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3268.42,3269.72,I'm trying to be helpful. (Laughter.)
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3269.72,3270.05,I know.
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3276.66,3287.42,"I just want to make sure that I'm being clear, because I think this case does raise a lot of important questions, and I do think that this Court's jurisprudence over the past 100 years has been very careful about what it means to be a double jeopardy sovereign --"
2015.15-108,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3287.42,3309.785,"Could you explain before you sit down when and why the United States changed its position on this question? Because as I understand it, in -- in more than one brief, took the position that Puerto Rico, for double jeopardy cases, is -- for the Double Jeopardy Clause is -- is treated like a State."
2015.15-108,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3309.785,3310.49,That's right.
2015.15-108,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3443.97,3448.08,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Landau."
2015.15-108,3,19410,christopher_landau,,3448.08,3453.99,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. If I could very briefly just say that there's two real questions here, as the questioning has brought out."
2015.15-108,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3538.44,3544.47,"Mr. Landau, would you explain what ""estado libre asociado"" means in Spanish?"
2015.15-108,3,19410,christopher_landau,,3544.47,3548.43,"It means ""free associated state,"" literally, and again, I think --"
2015.15-108,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3548.43,3549.1,Literally.
2015.15-108,3,19410,christopher_landau,,3549.1,3556.39,"-- it has the concept of free and it has the concept of associated, and state, in estado."
2015.15-108,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3556.39,3562.91,Do you know why they didn't use that phrase in the compact with the United States?
2015.15-108,3,19410,christopher_landau,,3562.91,3571.595,"I think they thought that -- that Commonwealth was the more natural English word. I'm not sure, Your Honor."
2015.15-108,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3571.595,3578.04,"I believe, because I've seen the Act, that they didn't because States have a different meaning in the United States."
2015.15-108,3,19410,christopher_landau,,3578.04,3581.66,"And again, we are certainly not saying that we are a State."
2015.15-108,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3590.28,3602.965,"The Solicitor General's office claims that Grafton says that when we're looking at double jeopardy, we're looking at something different."
2015.15-108,3,19410,christopher_landau,,3609.32,3620.51,"Absolutely do not agree that Grafton said that in any and all contexts, that regardless of any kind of territory, it is invariably going to have that political relationship."
2015.15-108,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3626.87,3627.58,And how about Shell?
2015.15-108,3,19410,christopher_landau,,3627.58,3638.17,"Just to finish that one point, Your Honor, Grafton -- it was called Grafton v. United States because the Phillipine prosecution was brought in the name of the United States. Shell is exactly the same thing."
2015.15-108,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3680.98,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
