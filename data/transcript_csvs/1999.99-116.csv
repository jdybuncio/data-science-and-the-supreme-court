1999.99-116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.037,"We'll hear argument next in No. 99-116, Jeffrey Allan Fischer v. the United States."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,12.645,15.294,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,74.363,77.661,"Mr. Horwitz, the... the section is quite lengthy."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,81.859,82.018,Yes.
1999.99-116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,91.156,94.006,B as in buzz or D as in does?
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,94.006,94.739,"--B as in boy, Your Honor."
1999.99-116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,94.739,96.034,"Boy, okay."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,96.034,110.764,"Subsection (a) sets out the prohibited activity, basically theft in subpart (1), then bribery or soliciting a bribe."
1999.99-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,157.77,165.689,"Isn't the difficulty of your position, just based on what you've just quoted, the statute refers to the Government as getting the benefits?"
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,182.077,183.853,The... the answer--
1999.99-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,183.853,184.294,Is that right?
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,184.294,186.09,"--The answer to that would be yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,204.668,205.218,Okay.
1999.99-116,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.218,219.115,"Well, but in a way the benefit goes to the provider as well because we're dealing here with Medicare services by a hospital when they weren't getting paid anything for people who couldn't afford to pay."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,230.284,242.779,"--Your Honor, in the sense of benefits in the sense of a... a verb, anyone who receives largesse, any company that receives a payment from the Government benefits."
1999.99-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,287.283,300.369,"Yes, but that does seem to be what it... it says when it... when it refers to... under subsection (b), when it refers to benefits under a program involving a grant, contract, subsidy, and so on."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,326.78,339.802,"The benefit... and again, getting back to the difference between a noun and verb, Your Honor, the... the purpose, as seen in the legislative history, is to protect the funds that surrogates of the Federal Government are administering."
1999.99-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,350.591,371.397,"Well, it isn't with respect to a given item of charge, but that doesn't mean that the Government's concern is... is somehow over because the Government may have a... a broader, systemic concern even though a particular item of charge has already been paid, and in that respect, it's no longer the Government's business."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,371.397,377.451,"It might, but I would submit that if that's what Congress wanted, they would have said anyone who receives assistance payments."
1999.99-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,378.258,380.695,"Well, the... Congress could have... could have said that."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,405.041,409.177,"--I don't think there is, Your Honor, a exception for Medicaid--"
1999.99-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,409.177,409.801,But there is.
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,429.269,437.414,"--Your Honor, the Medicare benefits are subject to the protection as long as they stay within the program funds."
1999.99-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,458.176,460.407,"--So... so, benefit would include ill gotten gain."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,460.407,461.305,No.
1999.99-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,461.305,462.162,Is that what you're saying?
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,462.162,462.447,"No, Your Honor."
1999.99-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,485.275,489.661,"So, there is a distinction between benefit and funds from which benefits ultimately will be paid, and that's what you rely on."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,489.661,507.176,"There is a distinction between cost of buying a service, at which point the administration of the Federal funds ends, and the individual or company at that point or State, whoever supplies that service, then has the funds to do it as they wish."
1999.99-116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,541.872,562.558,"Mr. Horwitz, before we go on to your parade of horribles, I take it from what you've said distinguishing the fiscal intermediary from the provider, that all hospitals that administer Medicare that receive... that receive the actual dollars, they are out from under the statute."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,573.245,581.792,"If the hospital is receiving those Federal dollars, for example, under a program where it is administering rather than just getting paid--"
1999.99-116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,581.792,585.216,"I'm talking about the... the program that we have before us, the Medicare program."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,590.841,591.913,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.222,632.871,"Well, and the hospital is normally not going to be the defendant here."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,644.676,648.802,"Your Honor, if the hospital were to bribe the intermediary, it would be covered."
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,648.802,650.154,"Oh, yes."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,669.829,670.732,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.732,673.741,Not the hospital by reason of its stealing from somebody else--
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,673.741,674.005,It--
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,674.005,676.844,--a Medicare recipient or anybody else.
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,676.844,681.623,--It is the question of how far does the jurisdictional element go.
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,686.2,687.827,We're not keeping hospitals honest here.
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,690.233,692.623,The issue is how far does the jurisdiction travel.
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,723.951,726.845,"Of course, you could... you could get an employee of the intermediary for stealing a truck."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,727.531,731.669,"--Unfortunately, I would say yes."
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.669,733.006,"I mean, you know, the stealing a truck hypothetical has a lot of--"
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,733.006,733.754,If... if--
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,733.754,739.443,"--a lot of appeal, but... but you have to acknowledge that somebody's theft of a truck is going to be covered by this."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,739.811,744.7,"--If the... if the intermediary has a car and an employee steals that car, it's covered, Your Honor, yes."
1999.99-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,744.7,747.064,You were talking about subsection (c).
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,765.77,770.342,"This is reimbursement of expenses, Your Honor, which is also covered in subsection (c)."
1999.99-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,770.342,772.369,Even reimbursement of expenses.
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,786.159,787.097,"Well, Your Honor--"
1999.99-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,787.097,787.609,"So, I--"
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,787.609,788.741,--Sorry.
1999.99-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,788.741,793.144,--I'm not sure (c) helps... is completely helpful to you.
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,793.144,795.587,"Well, Your Honor, the... the reason why I think it's helpful is this."
1999.99-116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,886.784,890.479,"Mr. Horwitz, a moment ago you referred to a Dixson case."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,892.493,893.092,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,893.092,895.492,Is it cited in your brief?
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,897.023,909.416,"It is cited in the Salinas case, Your Honor, which talks about... which is the only other case discussed... discussing this section 666 in the statute."
1999.99-116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,909.416,911.159,--Do you have a citation for Dixson?
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,913.738,917.806,"I don't have it very handy, Your Honor, but it is cited in the Salinas case."
1999.99-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,937.73,942.43,It seems to me at least it could be argued that (c) is rather narrow.
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,948.747,949.437,--Well--
1999.99-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,949.437,957.001,"And the very fact that it's there indicates that if it weren't there, benefit could otherwise be interpreted as including compensation, which is not helpful to your position."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,957.001,960.917,"--Well, Your Honor, it... it could if... depending on how benefit is described in subpart (a)."
1999.99-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1004.63,1004.804,"Well, let... let me put it this way."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1008.172,1008.631,"No, Your Honor."
1999.99-116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1092.629,1104.059,"Mr. Horwitz, are you... are you distinguishing Salinas on that basis, and in Salinas it was the municipal unit that had the jail that is administering the Federal funds?"
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1104.633,1113.105,"--Well, Your Honor, Salinas specifically did not address the issue of what constitutes benefits under 666."
1999.99-116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1123.049,1124.091,--And the answer is no.
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1124.091,1124.955,The answer is no.
1999.99-116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1135.505,1136.403,"Well, would you answer that question?"
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1142.356,1154.999,"From reading the case, Your Honor, I can't give you a specific answer, but it would appear that the... the benefits are to the Federal Government in a continuing basis to care for its prisoners."
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1167.443,1169.628,I thought they were getting money from the Federal Government.
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1169.628,1170.903,"--Yes, they are."
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1170.903,1171.831,My recollection of the case.
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1171.831,1190.536,"I wasn't... Your Honor, I wasn't intending to zero in on the money, but rather whether the money that was received was received with the understanding that the jail had to administer it under a continuing program and be accountable to the Government as to how it dealt with the Government's prisoners."
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1193.461,1195.966,--There has to be some kind of accountability in your theory?
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1220.4,1233.283,"The... the payment is by the marshal's service, as I understand it, in Salinas to the county or to the sheriff for the purpose of assisting the marshal in keeping prisoners in the local facility."
1999.99-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1243.033,1253.989,"--Well, as... as I recall Salinas, there was a payment per day for each prisoner, but there was also a grant to improve the jail generally."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1253.989,1277.773,"Right, and... and the record, from what I could read of the case, doesn't seem to answer the question of what other provisions might be involved in the marshal's office in determining whether there was some obligation by the jail to satisfy the marshal in the way these funds were administered, rather than simply I'm going to pay you so much a day to keep a prisoner and we don't care how you do it."
1999.99-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1277.773,1294.747,"Well, if we had the Salinas question before us and if the only thing the Feds... the Federal Government paid were a per day reimbursement for each Federal prisoner housed in the facility, then it might be like your case."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1294.747,1311.352,"Yes, Your Honor, with... I assume that your... your question also has within it the presumption that the marshal has no interest in how the jail spends the money and how it takes care of the prisoners because then I think it starts to move it into more of a program being administered by the jail."
1999.99-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1315.593,1320.937,"Well, if the Federal Government had certain standards for how patients should be cared for in the hospitals, that would change it?"
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1320.937,1322.918,"No, not... not how they should be cared for."
1999.99-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1344.183,1350.425,Does the hospital in your case have to be certified by the Federal Government to receive these monies as meeting certain standards?
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1350.425,1355.903,"The hospital has to be certified by the Federal Government, but that doesn't... that's not the... in question."
1999.99-116,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1363.907,1365.349,"Well, then the Government is interested in how it spends its money."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1365.349,1366.477,The... no.
1999.99-116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1390.737,1397.328,"Well, it has a tremendous interest in how it spends the Medicare money, and don't they have like 500,000 pages of regulations on it?"
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1397.328,1401.066,"The... the Government has 5... I don't know the number, Your Honor."
1999.99-116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1401.066,1401.505,I don't either.
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1402.468,1418.305,"But... but the Government has an interest in how the money is spent only to the extent that, under the Code of Federal Regulations, it will reimburse only those reasonable costs related to health care and providing health care to the beneficiaries."
1999.99-116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1423.625,1434.272,"Nobody says... they may not, but why isn't it enough to be a beneficiary, that the Government's whole program is aimed at getting money to the hospital to reimburse them for these costs?"
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1447.431,1455.164,The... the answer to that again gets back to whether they are a beneficiary in the sense of a noun or a verb.
1999.99-116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1459.9,1460.214,Yes.
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1460.214,1461.077,"Yes, they do."
1999.99-116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1465.438,1467.893,"Maybe not, but that's my question."
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1469.878,1485.303,"Mr. Horwitz, do you think that these regulations, 5,000 pages or however many pages... do you think that they prohibit the... the hospital from spending more on patient services than the hospital will be reimbursed?"
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1497.936,1499.607,"--My point exactly, Your Honor."
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1499.968,1500.147,It doesn't.
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1505.595,1506.588,A hospital--
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1506.588,1512.99,But the argument is here that the Government is terribly concerned about the hospital being defrauded into bankruptcy.
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1512.99,1526.362,"--I don't think the hospital... the Government is any more concerned about what happens with the hospital's money, whether it is in the form of defrauding it, spending it wisely or unwisely."
1999.99-116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1526.362,1527.041,I don't think so either.
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1527.041,1529.949,That's... that's the difference that I see.
1999.99-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1558.304,1565.026,"Well, the Government at... at least is... is interested to the extent of making sure that it gets what it pays for with... with its money."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1565.026,1565.571,And--
1999.99-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1565.571,1578.209,"And... and my point... my point is, as I understand from the briefs the reimbursement scheme, the reimbursement scheme is that the Government, in fact, makes quarterly payments, and then at the end of the year they settle up."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1602.387,1608.614,"--There... there's no interest in... if there was, I would submit that the rules and regulations would be different."
1999.99-116,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1615.474,1617.286,"Well, sometimes it goes one way, and sometimes it goes another."
1999.99-116,0,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,1617.286,1620.893,The point is the hospital is reimbursed for a cost of providing services.
1999.99-116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1650.44,1652.091,"Very well, Mr. Horwitz."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1653.958,1658.348,Thank you.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.777,1697.305,"What do you respond to the contention of the petitioner that if that is true, the local grocery store is also a beneficiary and any theft from the corner grocery store becomes a Federal... a Federal crime under this provision?"
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1697.305,1699.69,The... the question of whether the grocery--
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.69,1702.231,By... by reason of the food stamp program I'm talking about.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1702.231,1702.38,--Right.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.96,1719.081,"Right, and the store is reimbursed for what the store provides to the customer."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1719.332,1719.759,Right.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.759,1720.553,By a Federal program.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1720.553,1722.524,"Yes, and our position--"
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.524,1724.34,The same thing as happens here with the hospital.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1727.764,1734.534,"--Our position is that the grocery store, who is approved for participating in the food stamp program, would be covered by the statute."
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1742.897,1744.569,But that's... but that's not crucial to your case.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1753.217,1754.23,"--No, that's not correct."
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.64,1758.883,Okay.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1758.883,1768.84,"--from the grocery store, that employee could also be stealing the food stamp program or could be receiving bribes in connection with the program, and the Government would have an interest in the integrity of those officials at the store."
1999.99-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1769.558,1775.361,It doesn't apply to a third person that just comes in and sticks up someone at the cash register in the grocery store hypothesis?
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1775.361,1776.19,--That's correct.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.098,1812.164,"And you think the Government was really concerned with... with the financial stability of local grocery stores so that it wanted to be sure that nobody is embezzling money from local grocery stores because, after all, these local grocery stores are in the food stamp program."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1812.164,1826.997,"The prototypical financial assistance program Congress had in mind is no different than the Medicare program, in which what the Government does is give benefit monies to... to organizations who turn around and use that money to provide services or other assistance to beneficiaries."
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.997,1827.221,No.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1839.256,1839.899,It's--
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.899,1848.88,"But it's quite something else to say when you have provided services to somebody, we will reimburse you after the fact for those services you've provided."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1863.106,1865.471,"--Well, there are two responses to that, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.037,1874.396,I know.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1874.396,1881.033,And... but they're still financial assistance programs and the Government does have an interest in the integrity of those funds.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.18,1899.017,"Well, you have regulations that prevent that directly and immediately."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1899.017,1905.443,"The... well, the regulations or criminal statutes deal with fraud in connection with the program."
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.079,1929.452,And that would have been picked up under the regulations governing the program.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1929.452,1930.715,Yes.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.715,1931.198,Right?
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1931.198,1932.459,"Well, it would have... yes."
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.07,1948.283,Just as the local grocery store won't be able to sell groceries.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1967.152,1975.285,--Because this is an assistance program in which the whole point of which was to provide federally funded services to needy individuals who qualified under the program.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1987.628,1989.021,A swallow falling from the air.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1995.479,2004.465,"--Well, this case involves a... a Medicare program and the Medicare program depends upon the solvency of hospitals and the... and the integrity of the officials who work there."
1999.99-116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2023.271,2030.396,"You think here in any event... I mean, it seems to me Medicare is about $200 billion or more, isn't it?"
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2030.396,2031.334,--It's $300 billion.
1999.99-116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2031.334,2041.154,"$300 billion, and I think isn't the Federal Government aware that giving $300 billion to hospitals makes a big difference as to whether the hospitals are stable or not?"
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2070.889,2071.534,No.
1999.99-116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2082.591,2091.388,"If that's so, then isn't this unlike the food stamp program, whatever the merits of the food stamp program are or are not vis a vis the statute?"
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2107.733,2108.297,No.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2116.075,2119.303,"It may be fair, but has the Government established that in this case?"
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2134.292,2135.52,Our position--
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.52,2143.075,"I thought the only thing you were relying upon was the fact that it's reimbursed for the services that it provides to Medicare recipients in excess of $10,000."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2144.238,2145.171,--No.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.176,2152.63,--Right.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2156.149,2162.57,"Well, to the extent that there's some requirement that the hospitals be considered in and of themselves aided, we think that criteria is met."
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2169.39,2173.203,"You may think it's met, but did you establish that it was met below?"
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2173.203,2173.662,"Oh, yes."
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2179.032,2179.801,I mean aside from Medicare payments.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2189.395,2189.721,That's correct.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.958,2190.615,Did you establish that below?
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2190.615,2191.519,"--Yes, I think you're correct."
1999.99-116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2224.888,2227.725,"Ms. Blatt, I'd like to come back to the horribles."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2236.208,2243.363,We would take the position that a grocery store that participates in the food stamp program receives the money.
1999.99-116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2258.402,2263.233,Do you make the same distinction with respect to the... the Government insured tuition?
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2263.233,2270.506,--Actually I don't think our theory covers student loans at all because the Federal assistance doesn't ever make its way to the school.
1999.99-116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2293.337,2313.507,Mr. Horwitz made some distinction between patient assigned benefits and payments that would go directly to the hospital that aren't dependent on a patient assignment and said that there was no showing here that the direct payment rather than the assigned benefit applies.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2313.507,2315.712,There is no such distinction under the statute.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2355.948,2373.377,"Well, that's true, but ultimately when... when the books are balanced, the only thing that the hospital gets is... is reimbursement for the cost of services it has provided to the... reasonable cost of services it has provided to the patient."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2373.377,2379.6,"And essentially, Justice Scalia, that is no different than the prototypical financial assistance programs Congress had in mind when it passed this statute."
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.57,2400.44,"Yes, but what... but they gave the money to the organization to give it away."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2400.44,2402.142,They didn't give money away.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2426.541,2427.424,But that's as if--
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2427.424,2428.128,It's a reimbursement system.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.128,2438.653,--That's as if in this case there were an entity that received money and... and held it until the hospital submitted a... a bill.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2454.4,2454.644,"Well, yes."
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.453,2459.439,"But here in this question, the hospital itself performed the service."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2459.439,2461.361,"--Right, the hospital is paid in advance."
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.417,2474.877,The question isn't just whether there's reimbursement.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2497.778,2498.571,Right.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2498.571,2501.62,That's a world of difference from... from another benefit program.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2501.62,2518.137,"There are a lot of benefit programs in which the service provider could have charged the fee, but what the Government is doing is providing a Federal... Federal funding, a benefit program, by providing funds to the organization to turn around and use those funds to... to provide the services."
1999.99-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2518.137,2522.403,"Ms. Blatt, you said a moment ago that the hospitals are paid in advance."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2522.403,2523.258,Yes.
1999.99-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2523.258,2524.599,How do we know that?
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2524.599,2534.381,"We know that from the... the statute, the regulations, and in Good Samaritan actually the Court concerned this very payment structure to preserve the hospital's liquidity."
1999.99-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2545.897,2548.82,"Was that established in this case, that this is the mechanism?"
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2548.82,2550.785,It's required by the statute that that's how they have to be paid.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2552.316,2553.367,In advance of what?
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2567.635,2568.345,I don't think it matters.
1999.99-116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2582.541,2585.294,"Yes, but I think it's misleading to say it's paid in advance."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2596.698,2597.1,--That's correct.
1999.99-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2600.768,2601.09,But--
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2601.09,2602.363,Sorry.
1999.99-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2602.363,2609.793,"--what Justice Scalia just said is your present position now, that sometimes they could be behind and sometimes they could be ahead?"
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2611.34,2611.859,That's correct.
1999.99-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2611.859,2612.823,--bimonthly thing.
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2612.823,2621.27,"It's a bimonthly thing, and so the... the hospitals are advanced the money until there's been a reconciliation to see whether they're ahead or behind."
1999.99-116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2632.262,2633.209,"Well, I can understand that."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2635.355,2636.058,Okay.
1999.99-116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2636.058,2640.319,"But it just seems to me you're going on the theory, hey, kid, here's a quarter, buy some bubble gum."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2663.7,2664.169,No.
1999.99-116,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2664.688,2674.793,"I mean, this is a... this is a very complex, cost focusing, negotiated system of what is repaid, what isn't, and how does that affect the hospital."
1999.99-116,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2676.759,2685.955,--I think the best way to look at it is that Medicare is essentially a grant to hospitals that is calibrated to the cost of providing the federally funded services.
1999.99-116,2,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,3055.545,3056.223,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1999.99-116,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3056.223,3067.424,"Mr. Horwitz, I... I assume that if Blue Cross got this money or some fiscal intermediary and was holding it and then paid the hospital, if it was just holding funds, that the statute would apply to Blue Cross."
1999.99-116,2,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,3067.424,3069.755,"It would apply to Blue Cross and, Your Honor, it would apply--"
1999.99-116,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3069.755,3069.905,Okay.
1999.99-116,2,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,3077.853,3080.179,--The hospital... I think the key--
1999.99-116,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3080.179,3084.251,Or wait... or has to wait in order to make a legitimate claim to them even though it can draw down.
1999.99-116,2,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,3084.251,3093.681,"--I'll try to answer this briefly with the Government's contention here... and it was stated, even in the argument... is simply this is still Federal money."
1999.99-116,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3119.85,3130.427,"You don't challenge that, Mr. Horwitz, Ms. Blatt's statement that sometimes it may be a little bit ahead, sometimes it may be a little bit behind so far as the actual accounting is concerned?"
1999.99-116,2,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,3130.427,3143.913,"That may very well be, Your Honor, and I don't think that's... it's... in any event, the C.F.R. makes clear that what the hospital is getting is cost reimbursement and they may have to adjust that cost later."
1999.99-116,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3143.913,3147.965,What do you do about the argument that that's what's happening in the Model Cities program?
1999.99-116,2,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,3156.122,3160.811,"Because the question still is, is that all that is involved?"
1999.99-116,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3213.746,3214.656,"Well, it is Federal money."
1999.99-116,2,35981,mark_l_horwitz,,3214.656,3216.482,"Your Honor, if it is--"
1999.99-116,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3216.482,3218.421,"My question... well, maybe I'll--"
1999.99-116,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3218.421,3220.27,"Thank you, Mr. Horwitz."
