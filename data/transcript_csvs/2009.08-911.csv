2009.08-911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.635,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-911, Kucana v. Holder."
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,6.837,9.772,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,46.029,48.814,Under what authority were these regulations issued?
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,48.814,64.173,"--The regulation that grants discretion with regard to motions to reopen comes from a section in subchapter 1, not subchapter 2, of the regulations."
2009.08-911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,82.135,84.551,How does that -- how does that read?
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,89.669,91.954,"--Section 1103, Your Honor?"
2009.08-911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,91.954,98.958,The -- the provision that -- that you contend provides the authority for the Attorney General's regulation.
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,98.958,104.16,Section 1103(g)(2) authorizes the Attorney General--
2009.08-911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.16,104.576,I know.
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,118.733,119.669,--Sure.
2009.08-911,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,151.453,152.472,2.
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,162.678,169.432,"--The words used in the -- in the statute is ""under"", which, of course, has a variety of definitions."
2009.08-911,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,178.788,182.09,"It would be clearer if they had said ""in""."
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,182.09,197.415,"Congress could have said ""in"", but I think Congress made it clear by using the phrase ""authority specified under"", so we are not -- we don't have a situation where, as Congress usually would do, they would say"
2009.08-911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,206.437,221.797,"If you were to evaluate the validity of the regulation, as opposed to, like, an APA case or similar to that, what statutory provision would you look to to see if the regulation was consistent with that statutory provision?"
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,221.797,227.017,We would look to section 1103 in subchapter 1.
2009.08-911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.017,232.152,"--So it really doesn't matter what ""under"" means, right?"
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,250.28,251.446,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,255.398,255.864,I understand.
2009.08-911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,256.298,257.231,"Well, but -- is that right?"
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,269.241,283.815,"I think that in terms of looking at the discretion of the Attorney General, historically, on motions to reopen, there have been -- there has been discretion."
2009.08-911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,312.065,320.302,"The -- the subchapter 2 does talk about a special rule on reopening for battered spouses, children, and parents."
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,325.873,335.931,"No, Your Honor, because subchapter 2 does not say that the Attorney General has discretion to decide motions to reopen."
2009.08-911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,340.466,346.203,"So it -- so, absent the regulation, you would interpret the statute as saying there is no discretion?"
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,346.203,351.357,"--Absent the regulation, I would interpret the statute as being silent as to the--"
2009.08-911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,351.357,352.923,"No, that wasn't my question."
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,374.739,378.508,"--I would interpret the statute as not providing for discretion, yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,378.508,383.662,"Well, how does an Attorney General decide without -- without using discretion?"
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,393.665,393.948,No.
2009.08-911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,393.948,394.517,This is hypothetical.
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,394.517,395.15,Yes.
2009.08-911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,398.755,401.505,"Well, then there must be a discretionary component implicit."
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,401.505,413.146,"--I would disagree in -- in this way: If the statute is silent as to whether there is discretion, the Court can look to -- the Court could look to other sources to determine--"
2009.08-911,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,413.146,416.882,"Could you clarify, what is the provision about battered spouses?"
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,422.97,424.236,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-911,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,424.236,440.498,"But the rule is, you may reopen once in that -- that provision on battered spouses, but if you are in that category, you can reopen again?"
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,440.498,441.848,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,453.722,463.178,Why -- why would it -- I don't -- the big obstacle I find with your position is that it doesn't make any sense.
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,531.989,543.13,Judicial review of motions to reopen has -- has been the traditional normal process for the Court to take.
2009.08-911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.086,571.112,"Yes, and I'm saying: Why is it a rational line to say -- I think it's a rational line to say, when lawful discretion is being exercised, since it's a discretionary judgment, you're not entitled to it anyway, and therefore, we won't review it."
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,598.163,600.865,"Well, let me suggest several reasons, Your Honor."
2009.08-911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.865,601.481,Okay.
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,601.481,613.472,"First, if the Court was to read the statute as allowing a regulation to create discretion and, therefore, to remove judicial review--"
2009.08-911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.472,619.608,"Well, you -- you don't -- you don't contest that the regulation can provide discretion."
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,621.975,622.644,--That's correct.
2009.08-911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.644,625.512,"So it is a valid exercise of discretion, right?"
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,625.512,630.048,And courts frequently review decisions for abuse of discretion.
2009.08-911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,648.795,653.097,I just want to return for a moment to the battered spouse provision.
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,676.159,681.277,"Yes, as to the -- as to waiving -- as to waiving the -- on the number of motions, yes."
2009.08-911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,681.36,681.943,All right.
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,688.847,707.658,"Congress specified some 30 instances of discretion to the Attorney General in subchapter 2, and I believe it drew the line there and said, if we did not specify it in subchapter 2, then it is reviewable, just as courts have traditionally reviewed these matters."
2009.08-911,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,707.658,715.414,"The ones that have been codified by statute, those prior to the codification will, by regulation."
2009.08-911,0,40441,rick_m__schoenfield,,717.783,723.501,The regulation regarding motions to reopen existed before the statute.
2009.08-911,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,734.291,735.791,"Thank you, Counsel."
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,758.489,761.874,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,834.171,838.774,What about my question with reference to motions to -- to reopen?
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,849.796,854.284,--I would say that the Attorney General has the discretion to issue regulations with regard to--
2009.08-911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,854.284,854.65,No.
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,858.802,859.136,--Yes.
2009.08-911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,859.136,860.521,Just so we can talk about the statute.
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,875.281,877.114,"Yes, because the statute--"
2009.08-911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,877.114,877.447,All right.
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,882.785,883.285,--No.
2009.08-911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,883.285,884.22,Why?
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,884.22,889.339,"Because in the case that you are positing, the discretion of the Attorney General is implicit in the statute."
2009.08-911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,909.03,909.28,All right.
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,924.206,924.756,--That's right.
2009.08-911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,927.575,934.645,"Again, that seems odd, that the thing Congress cares about so much that it makes a specific provision can't be subject to judicial review."
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,934.645,947.119,"--I think that that is like the -- the various matters that Congress listed as specified as discretionary within the text of the relevant subchapter, that it decided that this was a matter of Executive grace that it did not want the Federal courts involved in."
2009.08-911,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,957.474,971.548,"So, in fact, if -- what we have is a motion in the category of grace, except for asylum, saying, of course, the Justice Department makes a decision that can't be reviewed."
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,986.158,989.51,"--No, I'm not saying that--"
2009.08-911,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,989.51,990.01,Why wouldn't it be reviewed?
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1011.839,1013.625,"--Two answers, Your Honor."
2009.08-911,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1020.029,1023.897,Exactly the same is true of the substantive decision.
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1076.812,1077.864,--I don't think you are.
2009.08-911,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1080.714,1084.518,"Yeah, but you are on the wrong side, if you agree with it, because -- no, you are on the right side, because he wins."
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1086.983,1089.002,"--Well, let me try to explain."
2009.08-911,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1105.659,1107.278,"Oh, but -- well, new things have happened."
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1111.795,1120.365,"What the courts of appeals have said is if what he's challenging is a discretionary determination that the Executive has already made, that that motion to reopen would not be--"
2009.08-911,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1120.365,1125.536,"No, he's not, but his motion to reopen is -- it's my hypothetical; I want to deal with it; I accept yours."
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1130.59,1133.19,--If something new came up--
2009.08-911,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1133.19,1134.041,Something new came up.
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1139.528,1141.711,"--Well, certainly that's what the statute requires them to do."
2009.08-911,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1151.752,1155.038,"And I'm asking you, what possible sense could it make?"
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1155.038,1161.274,Because Congress wants to make sense that the alien is getting -- make sure that the alien is getting a fair shot in terms of the process.
2009.08-911,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1161.274,1163.057,"Look, we're -- two issues."
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1186.557,1195.865,"If what he's seeking is a review of an exercise of discretion, then that is not reviewable, because of the reason that the initial determination is not reviewable--"
2009.08-911,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.865,1202.101,"Oh, by the way, this reopening is done by regulation, not done by statute."
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1220.394,1230.351,"--Right, and what I'm suggesting is that the difference there is between a substantive determination that's a matter of grace and a procedural determination to make sure that an alien gets a fair shot, and--"
2009.08-911,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1230.351,1232.568,"Counsel, I -- I'm sorry, do you want to finish?"
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1276.464,1284.153,"--In the vast majority of cases, of course we believe that the Board can be trusted, and that's why review is for an abuse of discretion, and it has been for many years."
2009.08-911,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1285.47,1298.194,"Yes, but if you take -- if you continued to argue the position you won on before the -- before the Seventh Circuit, it wouldn't be that the standard of review is -- is so deferential that it is okay."
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1299.794,1303.829,"--That's right, but we did not argue to the Seventh Circuit that there was no jurisdiction here."
2009.08-911,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1314.12,1318.672,"And the position of the Department of Justice was the opposite before 2004, correct?"
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1318.672,1324.826,"--There are only a handful of cases, and in those cases, several individual attorneys argued that there was no jurisdiction."
2009.08-911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1383.441,1394.949,Can you give me an idea of how many motions to reopen are brought to the courts for review each year?
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1394.949,1408.025,"--Well, there are approximately between 8 and 10,000 motions to reopen filed by the Board of -- before the Board of Immigration Appeals each year, and about between 15 and 20 percent of those are granted."
2009.08-911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1425.403,1428.772,"So we are talking about 2 or 3,000 petitions to the court each year?"
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1428.772,1438.294,"--But the -- the point that we are making is that there are these circumstances that Congress has recognized, and this Court recognized it in Dada."
2009.08-911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1469.813,1471.296,"Well, because that would be a question of law which is accepted."
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1471.296,1475.9,--I -- I am not sure that it would be a question of law in that circumstance.
2009.08-911,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1475.9,1479.685,"So if you think it's so bad, the Attorney General doesn't have to do it."
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1482.887,1492.576,"I think that the courts have long served a very important check on the Board's authority and on the Board's exercise, and the Board has many cases before it."
2009.08-911,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1495.028,1496.095,"You keep saying ""the Board""."
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1498.178,1504.849,"--Yes, that's right, but the statute also -- the Attorney General -- the Board acts on behalf of the Attorney General under the statute, so the Board--"
2009.08-911,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1504.849,1508.485,"And if he doesn't like what they do, he has the authority to act himself."
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1512.537,1512.92,--That's right.
2009.08-911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1538.188,1540.624,Do we know where the motion -- where -- where did it originate?
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1554.347,1563.453,"--Before the BIA existed, so back in the 1916 context, there were immigration officers, and you could ask them to reconsider or reopen your case."
2009.08-911,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1613.736,1632.133,"I didn't do the math fast enough in my head when you were answering Justice Kennedy's question, but is he correct that the effect of accepting your argument is about 2,000 additional appeals that -- that the Department of Justice will have to brief and the courts of appeals will have to decide?"
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1632.133,1636.685,"You know, I -- I haven't done the math on that, either, and I think it requires the assumptions that I set out--"
2009.08-911,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1636.685,1639.887,"On the assumptions that you made, do you know what the -- the result is?"
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1639.887,1645.691,"--I -- I don't, because we haven't calculated the number of motions throughout, and we only have total numbers in the courts of appeals."
2009.08-911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1654.88,1657.832,Have any of those courts said that they don't have a workload problem?
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1657.832,1661.867,--I think you would know better than I would.
2009.08-911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1663.903,1680.662,"May I ask you, before you sit down: Your response to the briefs here suggests that all of this is beside the point because this was the -- a second motion to reopen, and the statute allows only one?"
2009.08-911,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1680.662,1693.588,"Well, this is comprehensively addressed in footnote 18 in our reply brief, so I will just address it briefly here, but if you have follow-up questions -- which is: If you look at the statutory language, it says that an alien may file one motion to reopen."
2009.08-911,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1699.825,1700.609,"Thank you, Counsel."
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,1721.072,1733.313,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted IIRIRA to reduce the burden that immigration cases imposed, and continue to impose, on the Federal courts."
2009.08-911,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1775.39,1781.36,"But that provision came after the original jurisdictional stripping, a number of years after."
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,1791.216,1794.351,"Well, I have -- I have two answers to that, Your Honor."
2009.08-911,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1806.607,1807.574,You are talking about us acting as policymakers.
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,1816.645,1817.081,"--With respect, Your Honor--"
2009.08-911,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1817.081,1820.533,--stripped jurisdiction earlier or granted it?
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,1820.533,1833.591,--I believe this Court always would have understood and Congress understood that its jurisdiction strip would have had an exception for constitutional claims even as of 1996.
2009.08-911,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1872.799,1897.747,"Well, couldn't we look at the fact that when Congress was considering whether to put back into the jurisdiction-stripping statute an exception for constitutional claims, it then knew, because the courts of appeals except for the Seventh, who just recently did it, were routinely taking jurisdiction over motions to reopen?"
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,1912.34,1916.976,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, certainly had Congress done that, we wouldn't be here."
2009.08-911,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1976.564,1986.305,"Wait a minute, you are -- you are arguing from a real negative, because some courts had said that other statutes were covered by the jurisdictional bar."
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,1996.16,2002.147,"--With respect, Your Honor, it is the same statute as section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)."
2009.08-911,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2033.785,2039.003,"But on the motion to reopen, there is -- Seventh Circuit stands alone, doesn't it?"
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2039.003,2040.705,"It does, Your Honor."
2009.08-911,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2040.705,2042.724,And how many circuits are on the other side?
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2042.724,2044.174,I believe there are six.
2009.08-911,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2044.174,2052.663,Was there any -- ever a decision in any of those six circuits that went the way the Seventh Circuit went on the motion to reopen?
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2052.663,2053.763,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.978,2091.538,"Have they adhered -- have those other courts that you said originally said that other discretionary judgments made discretionary by regulation were non-reviewable, have they adhered to the -- to that view as to those other--"
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2091.538,2097.026,"--They have not repudiated the view, but they have not adhered to it with respect to motions to reopen."
2009.08-911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.376,2098.692,"--Oh, I understand."
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2101.994,2112.369,"--Yes, they seem to treat motions to reopen differently as reviewable, and they have been persuaded to do that by the existence of section 1252(b)(6), the consolidation provision."
2009.08-911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2114.019,2123.625,"Has any of them, since switching to -- or since holding this with respect to motions to reopen, reaffirmed their view with regard to other discretionary judgments?"
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2123.625,2125.875,"--Not that I have found, Your Honor, but nor have they repudiated it."
2009.08-911,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2133.147,2137.432,But we are talking about what is specified under subchapter 2.
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2157.512,2177.24,"Frankly, Your Honor, I do not think that specification of discretion -- with the exception of the battered spouse's provision that you -- that you raised earlier, I do not think the specification of discretion with respect to other aspects of motions to reopen is sufficiently clear in the statute to convey discretion."
2009.08-911,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2177.24,2186.448,"So you -- you consider -- you -- you think it's plausible to have a regime where motions to reopen are not discretionary at all, absent regulation?"
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2188.265,2189.484,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-911,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2225.823,2232.661,"Do you want to say anything about, apparently, this idiosyncratic thought that I have had?"
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2275.505,2275.755,Basically.
2009.08-911,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2275.755,2276.221,Okay.
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2350.867,2354.402,"With respect, Your Honor, I think that no one includes Congress."
2009.08-911,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2358.187,2359.723,I didn't leave anyone out.
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2361.973,2365.877,"--That line might have made sense had Congress drawn it, but Congress--"
2009.08-911,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2365.877,2366.877,How do we know they didn't?
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2395.71,2401.547,"--The words Congress used here, though, are those decisions specified as discretionary--"
2009.08-911,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2401.547,2407.351,"Yes, and we would say those decisions specified includes those decisions that are totally wrapped up in the same thing."
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2417.54,2422.694,"--I agree, Your Honor, that that category of things is unreviewable."
2009.08-911,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2441.172,2441.822,"Well, why not?"
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2465.521,2475.06,"With respect, Your Honor, I think the language Congress used was clear here and extends clearly to decisions -- decisions specified as discretionary under the subchapter."
2009.08-911,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2482.014,2494.955,"Is there any rhyme or reason why from universe of things that could be reviewed in court, Congress put some of the them in the statute and left others out?"
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2494.955,2505.576,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, the description of something as discretionary has consequences for the Attorney General, for the administrative process."
2009.08-911,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2546.737,2553.307,"Well, it's -- the question isn't whether the Attorney General or the BIA exercises discretion."
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2589.813,2592.932,--I will answer your question first.
2009.08-911,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2617.48,2619.915,And I'm not questioning the discretion.
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2654.571,2655.088,--Right.
2009.08-911,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2679.318,2683.288,"If -- if your interpretation of ""under"" is right."
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2683.288,2691.561,"Well, Congress acted later and may, if our interpretation is correct, have attached the jurisdictional significance at that point, yes."
2009.08-911,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2770.058,2782.766,"Do you think absent the special provisions of the -- of the immigration act that we are considering if we were just under the APA, that a motion to reopen would be committed by law to agency discretion under 702?"
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2790.503,2792.205,"--I do not, Your Honor."
2009.08-911,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2821.954,2829.042,"Well, I actually think it helps you because -- there is -- there is something to review, the agency does have discretion."
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2836.946,2837.346,--Yes--
2009.08-911,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2837.346,2838.064,--you don't take that--
2009.08-911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2838.064,2839.464,"Are you going to talk about ""under""?"
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2839.464,2842.95,"--I would love to talk about under, Your Honor."
2009.08-911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2842.95,2843.383,Yeah.
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2843.383,2849.586,"And if I may, I would like to start on pages 6a and 7a."
2009.08-911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2871.802,2872.202,Where is this?
2009.08-911,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2872.202,2872.618,--What page?
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2872.935,2873.418,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2878.02,2878.906,--the government's--
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,2878.906,2881.224,--And pages 6a and 7a in the appendix.
2009.08-911,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3028.083,3031.718,May I ask this question before you -- this is an appropriate time.
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,3040.806,3061.97,"Your Honor, subchapter 1 includes the language that grants authority broadly to the Attorney General to issue regulations implementing the chapter, and the language implemented by the motions to reopen regulations exists in subchapter 2."
2009.08-911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.871,3111.237,"--Except that the text refers not just to the -- the discretion, it refers -- it says the authority for which is specified under this subchapter and the authority to issue that -- the authority to issue the regulation is under subchapter 1."
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,3111.237,3113.855,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3115.739,3115.905,No.
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,3119.991,3121.809,--Yes.
2009.08-911,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3185.233,3207.349,"Do you have any reason why Congress would have taken great trouble to make certain that courts can review asylum decisions, that Congress would not have wanted a court to review a reopening of an asylum matter, which can be done, after all, only if something new comes up that justifies asylum?"
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,3230.528,3240.903,"The -- the best answer I have, Justice Breyer, is that Congress wanted to cut off review at some point, and it was a question of numbers of bites at the apple."
2009.08-911,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3243.605,3245.724,Reopening is not a bite at the apple.
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,3250.426,3272.541,"--And that may have been part of Congress's concern, that, of course, by and large, it's supposed to be, but it may not always be used in that way, and, at some point, Congress wanted to draw the line, and I note here that Congress did not -- I mean what Congress did here was to set up a regime under which things that are specified as discretionary are unreviewable."
2009.08-911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3280.695,3291.419,"And, of course, if your interpretation produces the anomaly that Justice Breyer just described, the government's interpretation produces the opposite anomaly."
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,3291.852,3292.535,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
2009.08-911,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3292.535,3295.621,"Exactly, and that's why I ended up with this unusual--"
2009.08-911,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3297.323,3320.419,"And I suppose it's a large question, if you are talking about, presumably, the unusual cases in which the motion to reopen is -- is justified, that you are talking about 2,000 or 3,000 cases, and the question is whether or not those are -- should be reviewed in the executive branch or should be reviewed in the judicial branch."
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,3320.419,3334.412,"Well, the math that we were given earlier, I believe, does come out to about 2,000 appeals per year, but I remind the Court that Section 1252(a)(2)(D) preserves those that raise questions of law or constitutional questions for review."
2009.08-911,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3348.422,3351.708,"So we are looking for needles in -- in a haystack, right?"
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,3351.708,3354.826,"I don't have the numbers, Your Honor."

2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,3389.381,3408.128,"Justice Ginsburg, we included the appendix to illustrate how Congress uses the preposition under, when it is talking about regulations, so we specifically looked for examples where Congress was talking already about regulations, and the preposition that accompanies that is always under."
2009.08-911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3408.728,3411.497,"You said, earlier, that you had three examples--"
2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,3411.497,3411.98,--I have--
2009.08-911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3411.98,3413.03,--that were not in your brief.

2009.08-911,2,16467,amanda_c_leiter,,3464.927,3465.277,Okay.
2009.08-911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3500.128,3500.378,Yes.
