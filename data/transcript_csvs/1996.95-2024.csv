1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.297,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-2024, C. Martin Lawyer, III, v. the Department of Justice."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,43.67,46.543,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,181.104,186.797,"Mr. Shapiro, is this the district that the Florida supreme court approved, that we're looking at now?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,186.797,194.604,--This... what you're looking at is the district that the Florida supreme court approved under the duress of the Justice Department's letter.
1996.95-2024,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,194.604,197.384,That's 4A of the brief?
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,197.384,198.175,The--
1996.95-2024,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,198.175,199.306,Of the blue brief?
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,199.306,202.848,--This is Appendix B to the brief on the merits for appellant.
1996.95-2024,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,202.848,206.41,"Yes, and this is the one that was superseded by the district that is now in question?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,206.41,206.921,That's correct.
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,216.258,220.059,"Mr. Shapiro, I had a question about the challenge and the choice of forum."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,268.502,277.24,"No, Your Honor, because this was a challenge based on what the Justice Department had forced the Florida supreme court--"
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,277.24,283.521,"But that doesn't tell me why you couldn't say... I mean, the Equal Protection Clause governs the State of Florida, as it does the Nation."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,289.716,293.398,"--First of all, the Florida supreme court did not reserve jurisdiction over this issue."
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,310.432,312.292,I don't mean in that case.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,325.751,336.208,"Well, Your Honor, the only thing I can say is that the plaintiff had the right to contest this district in U.S. district court, and under the Voting Rights Act."
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,336.208,355.06,"Mr. Shapiro, I appreciate that you did, but there was a certain anomaly in you coming to a Federal court to in effect override a decision of the State court and then say that the Federal court has not been sufficiently respectful of the State authorities."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,361.195,364.685,"Well, that issue was resolved in the trial court."
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,375.594,382.657,Do you think you would have had much of a chance had you gone into a Florida trial court and said that what the Florida supreme court did was a mistake?
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,382.657,387.912,"I don't know that a Florida trial court would have jurisdiction in the Voting Rights Act case, Your Honor."
1996.95-2024,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,414.129,417.952,"Mr. Shapiro, may I just clarify, is anybody now claiming that plan should be defended?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,417.952,419.462,"Well, yes."
1996.95-2024,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,430.19,432.963,"I understand, but is anybody now claiming that it is constitutional?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,432.963,435.794,"Yes, because what they're saying, they reserve--"
1996.95-2024,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,435.794,436.676,"And if so, who?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,436.676,439.126,--The Attorney General... I'm sorry.
1996.95-2024,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,465.274,470.127,"Well, I thought in this Court though they don't contest that it's unconstitutional."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,470.127,470.838,--I believe they do.
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.769,476.832,But how does that bear on the arguments you're trying to make?
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,476.832,478.362,It doesn't bear on the arguments.
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.766,488.409,"But then, why don't we go to the district which basically we're talking about here, I take it."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,488.409,488.569,That's correct.
1996.95-2024,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,518.902,521.582,We can't tell where Tampa Bay is on that map.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,521.582,523.794,"Well, that's the whole purpose of our map."
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,525.567,527.737,We now know where Tampa Bay is.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,527.737,529.758,This is a rather large body of water.
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,544.96,546.811,"That's where St. Petersburg is, right?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,546.811,547.031,"--Yes, sir."
1996.95-2024,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,577.582,579.432,"But much of that is the lake, is what you're saying."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,579.432,579.742,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-2024,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,579.742,583.836,And you're suggesting that the judges down there didn't know where Tampa Bay was.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,584.707,585.358,"Well, I don't know."
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,604.822,610.386,"Is that unusual in Florida, to have a district separated by a body of water?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,610.386,623.827,"Well, it is not unusual to be separated by a body of water, but it's a totally different proposition when there... when a district has to be... a piece of land has to be in some district, say in an island and the Florida supreme court stated this in their original decision."
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,678.762,689.88,"But you're not claiming now, as I think was the case in the earlier district, that they put together rural areas with urban areas on both sides of the rivers, or the bay?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,689.88,690.62,No.
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,728.657,730.958,I thought this wasn't a majority--
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,730.958,734.771,"It is not a majority, but the purpose was to create a majority--"
1996.95-2024,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,734.771,736.541,--Why did the NAACP oppose it?
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,740.254,741.476,--Because they... they were correct.
1996.95-2024,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.785,777.099,"Before you leave that, may I just ask, does the NAACP... are they a party to the appeal?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,778.849,779.21,--No.
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,806.28,807.579,"Mr. Shapiro, let me understand."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,807.99,808.22,Yes.
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,808.22,815.656,"--You're talking about the NAACP opposition to the plan that the Florida supreme court adopted, the one that we saw before with the finger--"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,815.656,816.257,That's correct.
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,816.257,821.172,"--and that was a concern with packing into that district, right?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,821.172,821.71,"This plan, that's correct."
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,821.71,827.166,But we have nothing to say that the NAACP opposes the plan that the--
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,827.166,827.457,No.
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,827.457,829.617,"--court approved, that the Federal court approved."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,829.617,829.787,"No, we don't."
1996.95-2024,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,844.777,848.297,But they objected because to do so was packing.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,848.297,848.838,That's correct.
1996.95-2024,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,848.838,853.452,"And if the packing is now less, I don't know that it follows that they still find it objectionable."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,856.983,857.654,It's 36-percent black.
1996.95-2024,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,857.654,863.859,"So I don't know that there... I don't know that we can infer that there's... that they would still object, when in fact they have not done so."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,865.561,882.291,"I'm just pointing that out to say that there was a substantial... that the Florida supreme court was saying, we do not believe that we're obeying our traditional neutral districting principles by doing this, but we're doing it because under duress of the Justice Department--"
1996.95-2024,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.291,883.55,"I'm sorry to get you into this, Mr. Shapiro."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,883.55,883.71,"--Yes, sir."
1996.95-2024,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.71,884.651,I was just curious.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,887.554,888.044,"No, of course."
1996.95-2024,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,888.044,890.115,--why the NAACP would seem to be on the other side of this.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,890.115,890.375,Okay.
1996.95-2024,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,890.375,891.437,I understand it now.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,899.592,900.103,That's correct.
1996.95-2024,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,900.103,901.375,"--386, and--"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,901.375,902.074,We never consented to it.
1996.95-2024,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,902.074,914.532,"--that you've never agreed with it, and that you did not get relief at the State level, and you assert that the plan, 386, violates this Court's constitutional standards."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,914.532,916.134,"That's correct, and it does so for several reasons."
1996.95-2024,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,926.392,929.354,And your client did not consent.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,929.354,929.714,That's correct.
1996.95-2024,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,929.714,930.846,Although was a party below.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,930.846,932.616,"That's correct, and he objected to it."
1996.95-2024,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,972.782,983.05,"But is it not true that if there had been a finding of violation, and then after hearings the court had imposed this plan, you would still make precisely the same objections you're making now?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,983.05,983.48,--Absolutely.
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,983.48,988.903,"But... so if you win... well, you started by saying this is not a good plan, the new plan."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,991.056,991.196,If I--
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,991.196,991.407,--So if you win that's--
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,991.407,992.105,--in the way it was done.
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,992.105,993.968,--I under... let's... suppose--
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,993.968,994.338,I'm sorry.
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,994.338,1002.804,"--Suppose we were to say that this new plan violated the Constitution... you know, the cases we've held... you'd win and that would be the end of it, right?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1002.804,1002.964,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1002.964,1003.245,All right.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1011.633,1017.446,"I would take the position that Mr. Lawyer... that's a complicated question, because in a usual consent--"
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1017.446,1020.389,"No, I mean, because you could say now that this is what you really wanted."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1022.95,1023.23,--That's right.
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1023.23,1026.941,And that would eliminate a whole set of complex procedural issues.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1026.941,1027.151,It--
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1027.151,1029.124,"So what I think you're going to say is no, that isn't the end."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1029.124,1029.821,--No.
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1029.821,1030.453,Okay.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1040.471,1042.131,That's... it's wrong on both counts.
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1052.999,1053.579,All right.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1068.349,1069.03,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1069.03,1072.122,"And they want an injunction, and now--"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1072.122,1072.603,From the court?
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1072.603,1072.783,--Yes.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1074.352,1074.533,Okay.
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1074.533,1075.684,They sue somebody.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1102.823,1103.183,Yes.
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1103.183,1105.366,"Common, garden variety, every day of the week."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1107.588,1108.427,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1108.427,1110.77,"Well, I can understand why the fifth person can attack the merits."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1119.094,1128.652,The answer to your question is that a nonconsenting plaintiff cannot have substantive issues resolved against them in the context of a consent decree.
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1128.652,1137.197,"Well, doesn't it happen every day of the week that people are in cases where they have 10 plaintiffs, 9 of them settle, the judge looks it over, he says, this is fine."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1144.443,1151.967,"As to the other nine, but Mr. Lawyer lives in 386, and in fact he's the only plaintiff in this case who had standing to challenge 330."
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1151.967,1155.159,But didn't the district court rule against him on the merits?
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1155.159,1155.34,Exactly.
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1156.551,1157.142,"Yes, well--"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1157.142,1158.932,They couched it in terms of a consent decree.
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1158.932,1160.915,--But you've been arguing now for 20 minutes.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1165.988,1166.238,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1166.238,1168.209,Why don't you get to that part of your case?
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1168.209,1168.459,I will.
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1193.797,1200.212,"Why does that bear at all on the validity of the most recent plan, the court-ordered plan?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1200.212,1205.745,"--Because... it absolutely does, because the coercive order of a Federal court is based upon adjudication."
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1214.21,1236.906,"Mr. Shapiro, since you are making much of this point, Mr. Lawyer submitted a statement together with Plaintiff Scott and others, a statement of the case, representing to the district court as a result of this Court's decision in the Miller case there are no issues of law to be decided by the court in this matter."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1262.191,1272.059,By the remedy he meant how much time... this... how much time the court should give the legislature to decide what the replacement plan would be.
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1283.959,1291.163,"Accordingly, the only issue for the court to decide at the trial... at the trial... is the issue of the appropriate remedy."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1292.963,1294.996,There was never a trial period in this case.
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1294.996,1298.737,"--But I'm just reading the stipulation, trying to find out what that means."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1306.563,1318.992,"What he meant by that was that he... the remedy meaning the court should determine... assuming that there's an unconstitutional district, the court should then determine how it's supposed to act, and it's supposed to act by referring it back to the legislature."
1996.95-2024,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1318.992,1323.844,"Well, I'm still so confused by your position here."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1328.326,1328.477,No.
1996.95-2024,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1328.477,1329.168,--Wait a minute.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1380.815,1381.586,"Yes, I get to that."
1996.95-2024,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1381.586,1384.328,Do you get to both of those arguments or not?
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1384.328,1384.738,"Yes, we do."
1996.95-2024,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1384.738,1385.65,I'm just so confused.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1385.65,1386.38,"Yes, we do."
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1490.954,1499.139,Wasn't there one point that you had an opportunity to examine the designer of the plan?
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1503.372,1503.592,--Correct.
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1514.729,1520.943,Was he... did he have an opportunity to examine this witness and say--
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1520.943,1521.103,Yes.
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1521.484,1522.313,"--no, I don't choose to--"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1522.313,1523.054,"Yes, he did."
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1536.813,1546.05,"--Did Mr. Lawyer have an opportunity to say, I want to call witness X, Y, and Z, I want to cross-examine, and was denied that opportunity?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1546.05,1553.246,"He wasn't denied the right to call witnesses, but there... this was not... the judge was asked at the pre-trial conference, is this going to be an evidentiary hearing?"
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1572.399,1573.661,He was the plaintiff in the case.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1573.661,1576.343,"--Yes, but the plan was never properly before the court."
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1576.343,1580.704,Where was it that he had the opportunity to cross-examine?
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1580.704,1581.715,At the fairness hearing.
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1581.715,1584.968,So there was testimony taken there?
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1584.968,1585.999,There was no testimony.
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1593.934,1596.708,"Well then, how would he have had a chance to cross-examine him?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1596.708,1597.267,That's the point.
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1597.267,1599.25,But I thought you said he did have a chance.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1599.25,1600.902,"Well, he was given a chance by the judge."
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1613.253,1614.783,And your client declined.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1614.783,1617.905,"Declined, but that was not an evidentiary hearing, so to say--"
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1617.905,1619.337,"Well, it was certainly the next best thing."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1619.337,1627.462,"--The next best thing, but he had no burden to prove plan 386 was unconstitutional, because plan 386 was never properly before the court."
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1642.403,1650.067,Was the judge not told by the representatives of the legislature that the legislature just wasn't going to do anything about this?
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1650.067,1650.308,Well--
1996.95-2024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1650.308,1659.964,"That it had done its thing in the decennial whatever, and that the article of the Constitution that you cite didn't apply except at the 10-year redistricting?"
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1659.964,1668.94,"--Everybody, including the Attorney General of the State of Florida, expected, and stated to the district court, that the State legislature had the right to convene."
1996.95-2024,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1682.75,1698.1,"I took what went on as simply an indication that at least unless and until the extant district was declared unconstitutional, the legislature, simply because of the existence of a lawsuit, had no intention of creating a new district."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1698.1,1698.491,Exactly.
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1708.198,1709.37,But aren't those matters of State law?
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1711.441,1711.631,No.
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1711.631,1720.897,--Whether or not the State of Florida has the legal power to agree with the court to change its district with these representatives present or not would seem a question of State law.
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1723.09,1729.615,Because this Court has made clear repeatedly that this is a matter that is to be reserved for the States in the first instance.
1996.95-2024,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1729.615,1744.355,"If, in fact, the court introduces a decree agreed upon by our four plaintiffs and their defendant, Mr. White, whether Mr. White has the power to make that agreement to the decree is a matter of Mr. White, a matter of the State."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1745.525,1752.18,It's Federal because the Court has made clear that this is a matter which is to be resolved first by the State.
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1766.267,1768.919,"I think you've answered the question, Mr. Shapiro."
1996.95-2024,0,40586,robert_j_shapiro,,1768.919,1769.289,--Thank you.
1996.95-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1769.289,1769.54,Thank you.
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1771.361,1779.287,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1817.903,1837.816,"Did the court below ever enter an order saying, and I hereby give 60 days or 90 days or something in which the legislature can act, or did he just accept somebody's statement that the legislature wasn't going to be called into special session?"
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1837.816,1839.115,--I think it's a combination of those.
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.574,1870.737,What had not yet been adjudicated to be an unconstitutional district.
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1870.737,1871.608,--That's right.
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.608,1885.767,"It's uncontested, is it not, that the legislature had no opportunity, after this Court had determined that the district was unconstitutional and therefore could not be used, to adopt on its own a new district?"
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1885.767,1890.729,This Court... the court did not determine that plan 330 was unconstitutional.
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.729,1892.53,So why should the legislature adopt a new district--
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1892.53,1892.8,Because--
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.8,1894.623,--unless and until the court does that?
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1894.623,1904.408,"--Because I think the legislature, represented by the Speaker here and the President of the Senate and the Attorney General, was fully aware that there was a serious risk of invalidation."
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.408,1916.686,"But legislatures don't enact new legislation just because there's a serious risk, and some of the members of the legislature did not think that these individuals had the authority to commit the legislature to a whole new districting plan."
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1916.686,1918.359,"Well, I don't think there's any thing in the record--"
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.359,1920.051,"There's a letter in the record from one Senator, isn't there?"
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1920.051,1921.972,--That letter was not in the record.
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1932.96,1933.23,"No, I think--"
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1933.23,1934.4,That authority has not been questioned.
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.4,1947.209,--I think there is a serious burden on whoever is taking the word of a couple of members of a State legislature that the State legislature as a body concedes to redistricting for the State.
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1962.21,1965.652,It was not simply submitted on its face.
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1977.839,1979.832,I'm not talking about the statement that it would not convene.
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1999.757,2001.239,"Your Honor, I don't think it's extraordinary."
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2031.252,2034.056,"Well, I think it is one thing to settle litigation."
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2060.753,2068.0,I think what's going on here is that there is... by the time the summer of 1995 comes around there is a very serious Federal challenge.
1996.95-2024,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2094.476,2103.522,"Would the State parties, as you understand State laws, have had authority to concede that the Senate-approved plan... that the legislatively approved plan was unconstitutional?"
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2103.522,2107.696,"--Would have had authority, yes, as... litigating authority, absolutely."
1996.95-2024,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2107.696,2109.477,"They did not make that concession, however."
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2109.477,2110.518,They did not make that concession.
1996.95-2024,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2111.577,2111.777,You--
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2111.777,2125.307,"--The issue in the district court was never pressed whether, had Judge Tjoflat's view prevailed that the court had agreed that a liability judgment had to be entered, whether we would have accepted that as a condition to the entry of the remedy."
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2126.498,2150.795,"--Well, frankly, looking at the series of maps, it didn't strike me as terribly important if we were to say the district judge should have found the plan 330 unconstitutional before deciding which plan to adopt, and if it went back, the court could probably make that finding."
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2153.797,2154.288,When I--
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2154.288,2164.446,"--and chances are the court would say plan 330 was unconstitutional, therefore I have to adopt a plan, and the plan I'm going to adopt is 386."
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2164.446,2176.864,"--When I say that the issue was not joined, the State appellees are prepared to accept and were prepared to accept back in November 20... November 20, a judgment entering a finding of liability without conceding the constitutional issue."
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2205.895,2219.025,"Well, if there were a party, as there appears to be here, to the proceedings below who didn't consent, is that party entitled to an evidentiary hearing before the district court says yes, I'm going to go with 386?"
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2219.025,2220.345,"--Absolutely, and he got it."
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2223.416,2226.567,Did the court say this is not an evidentiary hearing?
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2226.567,2226.687,--Absolutely not.
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2227.908,2228.319,That's wrong?
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2228.319,2228.96,--That's wrong.
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2228.96,2230.45,That's not in the record?
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2230.45,2231.671,That is not in the record.
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2262.293,2265.515,And the court never said this will not be an evidentiary hearing?
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2265.515,2267.898,"--Never said this will not be an evidentiary hearing, and at the hearing--"
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2267.898,2271.211,Counsel here has just misrepresented flatly that the statement--
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2271.211,2274.391,--He's taking one quote that was addressed to the Justice Department lawyer--
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2274.391,2276.724,--Did the quote say this will not be an evidentiary hearing?
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2276.724,2280.335,"--No, and I don't even think that the quote as he quotes it says it."
1996.95-2024,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2280.335,2286.399,"Well, in any event his client was offered a chance to cross-examine."
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2290.593,2291.134,Absolutely.
1996.95-2024,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2320.765,2322.047,Did the court indicate--
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2322.047,2323.147,None of that was done.
1996.95-2024,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2323.147,2330.993,--Did the court indicate in this hearing that there would be any restrictions on the matters as to which Mr.... the appellant could inquire?
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2330.993,2331.252,Yes.
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.376,2432.834,"Mr. Taranto, I'm prepared to accept your analysis as far as whether the district, had it been adopted by the legislature, would be unconstitutional."
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2468.99,2485.882,"Your Honor, I don't agree with that rule, because I think that the proper Federalism rule in this context is one that leaves it to State law what officials have the authority to engage in what kind of settlement of litigation, and that's what is undisputed here."
1996.95-2024,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2487.131,2493.346,"Mr. Taranto, is there anything in the decree that would prevent the Florida legislature today from redefining the district?"
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2493.346,2494.147,"--No, not at all."
1996.95-2024,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2496.648,2502.562,Is there anything in the record indicating objections on the part of legislators to this action?
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2502.562,2509.075,--The following is either in or was attempted to be gotten in the record.
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2535.355,2536.747,Was there an inquiry by the court?
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2546.903,2547.694,"Well, several things."
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.217,2570.287,So you didn't even need the Senators.
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2577.313,2582.155,--I think as a matter of Florida law that is probably correct.
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.733,2609.095,No... there was that statute.
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2612.445,2626.607,"--Florida... a Florida decision, in particular the Abramson decision, which we cited in our brief, that says State agencies can violate their State statutes when necessary to settle a serious claim against them."
1996.95-2024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2628.317,2630.129,I don't see the relevance of that.
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2632.092,2646.621,"--Well, the State as a party itself is... I think the form of the question is, could it change its State statute by voluntarily settling through the Attorney General a serious piece of Federal litigation?"
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2678.055,2681.047,"Well, is this a matter, though, perhaps of Federal law?"
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2706.295,2706.886,I--
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2706.886,2716.47,"--and that we don't accept the notion that, pursuant to settlement authority, the Attorney General can come in and say, speaking on behalf of the State, we accept this?"
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2716.47,2721.385,--I think that the legislative opportunity was given over the course of several months.
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2722.945,2730.12,But it was not given within the context of a finding that plan 330 was invalid.
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2730.12,2739.337,"--That's right, but the price of that rule would be to be... to insist that States in voting rights cases may never voluntarily resolve their claims."
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2745.722,2757.639,"Well, I can certainly understand that a State and this Court might be willing to accept the notion that the attorneys on behalf of the State could agree that the former plan was unconstitutional."
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2766.935,2772.509,"--Well, I think it is a matter of Federal law that an... a proper opportunity to be given."
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2786.808,2808.824,"Well, of course, the concern expressed by this Court in saying there should be such was a concern on behalf of the States that the Federal court shouldn't intrude and take upon itself the job of drawing a legislative district without finding a good reason for it, to wit, invalidity of what the legislature had put its task--"
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2808.824,2809.324,--But I think--
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2809.324,2809.815,--its hand to.
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2809.815,2818.36,"--I think it is also a good reason that the Federal claim is very serious, that there is a real... a real risk of the litigation."
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2824.425,2828.478,"Well, this wasn't a consent decree, of course, because we have a petitioner here who didn't consent."
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2828.478,2828.999,--Insofar--
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2828.999,2830.398,"I mean, it wasn't a consent decree."
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2830.398,2832.97,"--Insofar as the State is concerned, though, it is a consent decree."
1996.95-2024,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2890.951,2910.613,"So your position is that, as far as the State legislature and the State itself is concerned, that counsel had a right to waive any finding of unconstitutionality, and they did so, and the State had a right to waive any opportunity to redraw a district, and they did so."
1996.95-2024,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2912.496,2912.686,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-2024,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2914.035,2915.467,"Thank you, Mr. Taranto."
1996.95-2024,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2917.298,2930.995,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-2024,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3041.502,3046.533,"Well, but how can it do so as against somebody who didn't consent, to wit, the petitioner here?"
1996.95-2024,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3057.602,3065.397,It certainly can have... is required for there to be an inquiry into the validity of 386.
1996.95-2024,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3069.27,3085.372,"Well, but the appellant is in the position of suggesting that there be redistricting, or that the old district be approved, and faces, as the court faces, a difficult task in determining what are legitimate criteria for districting?"
1996.95-2024,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3131.283,3138.326,"Well, I think that the legislature did... had ample opportunity to convene, and to legislate a plan if it had wanted to."
1996.95-2024,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3167.145,3168.517,Your basis for that is?
1996.95-2024,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3173.481,3174.651,--That's correct.
1996.95-2024,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3180.246,3182.687,"And on the basis of a representation of one person, the--"
1996.95-2024,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3182.687,3183.148,"Well, it was--"
1996.95-2024,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3183.148,3189.022,--The ability of the Senate to participate in redistricting of the State is disregarded by the court.
1996.95-2024,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3192.134,3198.567,"--I... to go on to what the legislative opportunity was here, there were then negotiations."
1996.95-2024,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3251.811,3269.814,--Do you agree that Mr. Shapiro erred in stating that the court below at its hearing on 386 said it would not be an evidentiary hearing?
1996.95-2024,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3269.814,3271.797,Let me break that down into two parts.
1996.95-2024,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3292.049,3296.131,"This is all people sitting around in the judge's chambers, perhaps, or in open court?"
1996.95-2024,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3296.131,3301.926,"It's a pretrial conference, and I'm not sure whether it was an open court or not, but I think it probably was."
1996.95-2024,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3301.926,3303.258,Are you going to read from the record?
1996.95-2024,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3303.258,3314.075,"I am reading, and this is page 31 of the hearing from November 2, 1995, and I don't have the record cite to that."
1996.95-2024,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3404.359,3412.046,"Mr. Gornstein, maybe you can explain something to me about this record, because it does seem that in the beginning the plaintiffs, everybody was trying to settle this."
1996.95-2024,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3430.936,3437.492,"Well, I think Mr.... the appellant in this case was not satisfied with the results of mediation, and--"
1996.95-2024,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3437.492,3440.103,"But going into mediation, everybody was on board."
1996.95-2024,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3440.103,3443.555,"--Yes, with the idea that it would be a good idea to mediate."
1996.95-2024,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3488.836,3490.839,"Attorney's fees, I suppose, for one."
1996.95-2024,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3490.839,3497.291,"--I think that that would certainly dictate the result of attorney's fees, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-2024,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3497.291,3498.062,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
