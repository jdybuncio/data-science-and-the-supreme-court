2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.587,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 13-975, T-Mobile South v. the City of Roswell, Georgia."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,8.47,11.456,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-975,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,40.741,43.443,That's not actually what the court below said.
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,52.283,58.62,"--Justice Sotomayor, I'm not sure the Eleventh Circuit did actually specify what the reasons were."
2014.13-975,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,83.085,84.585,"Well, how far does your argument go?"
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,101.213,114.037,"We think that if the denial letter clearly -- clearly directed us to some other document and said -- and said where the reasons were, and that document was contemporaneously available, we think that would be enough."
2014.13-975,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,126.93,127.297,All right.
2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,127.78,129.38,Justice Alito.
2014.13-975,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,129.38,132.266,"--Just to follow up, I'm sorry to interrupt."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,149.11,149.56,Right.
2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,179.063,179.763,"No, that's not -- I'm sorry, go ahead."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,179.763,184.717,"--And second of all, so the district court can do the streamlined work that Section 332 contemplates."
2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,184.717,185.6,But that's not all you want.
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,197.591,200.308,"No, it would not be enough--"
2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,200.308,200.575,No.
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,200.575,202.344,--because the letter needs to tell us why.
2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,202.344,210.516,"It doesn't matter that four days or three days, whatever is later, there is a resolution that doesn't say it's denied, it says the reason we denied it is this."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,211.433,216.92,"Well, I think you'd have it in a timing question, the Solicitor General frames, whether that was substantially contemporaneous."
2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,217.62,217.954,I know.
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,217.954,219.456,--needs to be in a single document.
2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,219.456,221.356,It has to be in a single document.
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,231.347,232.98,I think stapled together would be just fine.
2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,232.98,233.447,"No, no."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,234.899,235.132,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2014.13-975,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,247.12,252.024,"But decision -- decision, Mr. Fisher, often means just denied."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,282.543,287.181,"Justice Ginsburg, we think it's fine to look at other provisions of the Communications Act."
2014.13-975,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,314.582,339.48,"Your bottom line is because of this supposed default, you get your -- your application is granted, and that seems odd when the thrust of this arrangement is that the decision should be in the hands of the local governing board or the local council or something."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,350.605,352.805,"Well, there's two important things about that, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-975,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,384.092,386.961,"Well, I suppose that could be left up to the district court on remand."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,386.961,388.211,"Of course, Justice Kennedy."
2014.13-975,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,390.58,401.621,"Let me ask you, I think we would have a much different case if at the time of the written notice, they appended the official copy of the transcript."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,404.84,407.624,"That's one problem, but it's not the only problem."
2014.13-975,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,407.624,417.48,Because it seems to me you don't make the lateness part -- you don't make the lateness argument that the government makes in your 22 in your question presented.
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,435.775,437.561,"That's right, Justice Kennedy."
2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,440.946,442.448,But do you I'm sorry.
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,442.448,449.284,"--Even if the transcript had been attached, there still wouldn't have been, based on this letter, a specification of reasons."
2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,452.92,454.755,"Well, before you do so, why is the transcript required?"
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,460.926,462.426,"No, it's not."
2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,470.115,471.548,But if the -- I'm sorry.
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,471.548,472.598,The minutes would be enough--
2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,472.598,473.567,I may not have followed this.
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,476.102,478.285,--Then that would not be enough on its own--
2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,478.285,478.971,"Oh, okay."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,478.971,482.256,--because the letter would still need to tell us where in the transcript the reasons were.
2014.13-975,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,483.723,494.58,"Mr. Fisher, you're deriving all this from the word “ decision ” and “ decision ” as even the dictionary you principally cite, Blacks Law Dictionary states, “ decision ”, you know, can mean one of two things."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,505.102,506.888,"--For two reasons, Justice Kagan."
2014.13-975,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,520.464,522.448,"Well, that only suggests that you need reasons."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,526.952,527.852,Fair enough.
2014.13-975,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,553.535,570.062,"But the larger problem here, of course, is that under your view, the Federal statute says that a local legislative body has to act like an administrative agency, and that raises very serious concern under Federalism."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,594.01,594.979,I don't think generally.
2014.13-975,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,598.231,600.166,It would be like Goldberg v. Kelley for--
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,600.166,601.233,--Right.
2014.13-975,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,629.902,634.671,"Mr. Fisher, could you explain how you are disadvantaged?"
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,649.431,657.686,"--Well, as the case stands now, we prevailed in the district court and the district court gave us an injunction allowing the site to be constructed."
2014.13-975,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,670.76,676.231,"Then what would -- then if this Court should uphold the Eleventh Circuit, then what happens?"
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,676.231,681.302,"--If you uphold the Eleventh Circuit, then we go back down to the district court and are going to--"
2014.13-975,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,681.302,682.152,And what happens there?
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,682.152,687.454,"--And I think there we're going to have to have one of these prolonged proceedings to decide what -- first of all, what the reasons are."
2014.13-975,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,724.912,736.469,"Mr. Fisher, assume, and just for the sake of argument, that we do say that a separate writing that clearly sets forth or sets forth the reasons for denial is adequate."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,743.806,744.142,Yes.
2014.13-975,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,744.142,766.322,"Under this board's rules, do -- I'm assuming the board has to be unanimous, majoritarian voting rules, but why does every council member have to have the same reason?"
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,770.874,774.326,"I think, Justice Sotomayor, they might be able to."
2014.13-975,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,794.921,795.138,Oh.
2014.13-975,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.371,799.473,But you say you can't use it in this case.
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,807.313,812.532,"No, Justice Scalia, it's not just the multiplicity of people on the board stating different things."
2014.13-975,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,849.556,850.173,"Well, doesn't that--"
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,850.173,850.992,Does that count as a reason?
2014.13-975,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,850.992,861.197,"--All of these kinds of examples, don't they only suggest that a State or a locality would be well advised to write up a little paragraph that clearly states its reasons?"
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,876.473,880.694,"The nature of substantial evidence review, which has a limiting principle--"
2014.13-975,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,880.694,880.927,No.
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,895.37,899.822,"--But, Justice Kagan, substantial evidence review requires them to defend only on their actual reasons."
2014.13-975,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.252,939.632,"Well, I'm surprised that -- that you're willing to accept that there does not have to be a reason or a number of reasons that -- that the city council agrees on, that, you know, seven members of the city council, each -- each one of them has a different reason, and that's okay."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,941.582,944.601,"--Well, I'm not sure, Justice Kennedy -- Justice Scalia."
2014.13-975,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.398,966.064,Yes.
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,993.231,994.917,I certainly won't argue with that.
2014.13-975,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,994.917,996.983,"Well, then what's the disagreement?"
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1015.412,1015.746,Uh-huh.
2014.13-975,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1015.746,1021.734,"You get some piece of paper, you can't figure out what it means, well, then they'll send it back or they say no."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1037.443,1041.162,"The problem -- we do agree with the Solicitor General, you need reasons."
2014.13-975,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1052.37,1054.286,"Sometimes it could, sometimes it couldn't."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1055.588,1058.373,"Well, let me -- let me just talk about the record in this case, Justice Breyer."
2014.13-975,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1058.373,1059.789,But that's the -- I know.
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1080.886,1085.188,"What I want to use is the record here to be illustrative, Justice Breyer."
2014.13-975,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1087.89,1088.642,"Ah, yes."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1100.966,1102.733,"--Well, let me -- let me just give you a few examples."
2014.13-975,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1119.761,1129.051,"As I understand the SG's position, the SG says there were five members of the council, three of them talked about the incompatibility of this tower with the neighborhood."
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1131.819,1134.705,That statement is--
2014.13-975,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1134.705,1141.626,Do you think that three of them did not base this on the incompatibility of the fake tree with the neighborhood?
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1141.626,1148.947,"--I'm not a hundred percent certain they did, because the motion, as is set forth in JA 340, comes after all of those statements."
2014.13-975,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1176.265,1177.367,The Solicitor General only needs one.
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1177.367,1178.467,"Well, no."
2014.13-975,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1203.099,1213.29,"Well, then you're going to reach the question that Justice Scalia had a view of, which was, you know, if two people think X and two people think Y and one person thinks Z, is that sufficient?"
2014.13-975,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1217.859,1224.014,It's not sufficient because we can't guarantee that that is why they voted.
2014.13-975,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1250.998,1251.998,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1261.554,1263.722,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-975,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1291.723,1293.123,Where does that come from?
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1312.136,1325.044,"The -- the primary reason why we're saying it has to come out at the same time is because otherwise it would frustrate the judicial review provision, where the applicant has 30 days under the statute to decide what action to take based on the denial."
2014.13-975,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1325.044,1338.104,"But wouldn't it more sensible, then, to take a suggestion that has been made that we run the 30 days from when reasons are given, run 30 days from when the minutes are available?"
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1355.732,1360.8,"I think one reason why, Justice Ginsburg, is because it's difficult to read the statute that way."
2014.13-975,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1400.277,1404.396,"How does it work in -- in the ordinary agency, which I should know but I don't?"
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1438.55,1446.573,"--In footnote 6 of our brief we describe some cases along those lines, where -- I mean, in this case we think that you have a majority, three of five given the same reason--"
2014.13-975,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1446.573,1450.108,But if -- I just want to know how it works in the case I put.
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1450.108,1450.492,--Right.
2014.13-975,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.425,1484.681,But doesn't the Administrative Procedure Act require providing reasons when -- when there's a grant or a denial?
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1484.681,1485.348,Yes.
2014.13-975,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.905,1500.79,Don't -- don't you have to give the reasons with the decision under the APA?
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1500.79,1503.242,"Yes, but--"
2014.13-975,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1503.242,1508.463,So how can you give it if -- if there is no majority for any single reason?
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1508.463,1513.282,--You would just -- you would give the rationales of each individual council member.
2014.13-975,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1515.384,1516.317,Has this Court ever held that?
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1517.236,1517.552,"No, no."
2014.13-975,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1518.752,1519.086,It's absurd.
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1519.086,1525.592,"--Justice Scalia, we cited some cases in footnote 6 of our brief that indicate that other courts have allowed that to occur."
2014.13-975,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1525.592,1530.56,I'm -- I'm a little bit confused by that because and this is what troubles me the most.
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1551.407,1559.496,There weren't a majority of council members that gave a reason that wasn't prohibited by the statute or was not supported by substantial evidence.
2014.13-975,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1559.496,1561.179,That's a--
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1561.179,1564.798,And it's not a problem that's unique to this particular context.
2014.13-975,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1572.22,1581.092,Do you want us to write an opinion that says under this Act agencies have to comply with SEC v. Chenery?
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1585.811,1601.506,"--We think that by requiring that decisions be in writing and supported by substantial evidence and then also by providing for judicial review of those decisions, implicit in the statute and explicit in the legislative history is that the local government has to give reasons."
2014.13-975,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1601.506,1612.379,"Either under general laws of zoning or under any similar Federal statute, have we ever imposed -- has the Federal Government ever imposed requirements like this on a legislative body?"
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1612.379,1624.604,"I don't think so, but it's not -- I mean, we realize that this is a little bit of an anomaly in this statute, that normally a city council can do whatever it wants and it's not required to give reasons for its decisions unless it's--"
2014.13-975,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1624.604,1625.854,Is it just a legislative body?
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1625.854,1626.838,--No.
2014.13-975,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1628.906,1629.373,Yes.
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1631.342,1631.725,--Right.
2014.13-975,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.47,1649.22,Do you think that--
2014.13-975,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1649.22,1655.374,--What does the -- what does the Petitioner do with the one council member who didn't give reasons?
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1657.41,1665.765,"So -- so if he didn't give a reason, then I think you just don't count his -- his vote toward the -- the people that gave a rationale."
2014.13-975,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1665.765,1666.898,What happens if--
2014.13-975,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1666.898,1669.4,It was four people who were there.
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1669.4,1670.4,There were five.
2014.13-975,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1670.4,1670.9,There were five.
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1676.471,1683.375,"Yes, but there were still three people that gave incompatibility with the neighborhood as their -- as their reason."
2014.13-975,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1683.375,1703.205,"--What if -- what if three people say, this is -- this is incompatible with the neighborhood, and then later other -- another member or other members provide other reasons, and those other reasons are either invalid under the statute or not supported by substantial evidence?"
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1717.798,1741.18,"I think -- I want to make clear that we're not saying that when you look through the written administrative record to determine what the reasons are, that you read through the whole transcript and that anything that came up during the hearing, like what happens when the power goes out or can't you make these things smaller or something like that is the reason why a particular council member voted, just as we wouldn't think questions at oral argument are your reasons for voting to affirm or reverse."
2014.13-975,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1756.022,1776.101,"Ms. O'Connell, I think part of Mr. Fisher's arguments is that if everyone agrees that reasons have to be given, what sense does it make to require judges to scour the minutes and to scour the transcript and to try to make these judgment calls about, you know, when an individual council member has given a reason?"
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1788.576,1792.528,It's not our position that such a requirement would be difficult to comply with.
2014.13-975,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.0,1826.667,--I think Justice Kagan is not disagreeing with you.
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1859.005,1861.09,--There is certainly not a big deal about it.
2014.13-975,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1861.09,1863.892,Especially since you're making the council do the same thing.
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1865.661,1866.377,Right.
2014.13-975,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.377,1868.878,So why not say you have to spell the reasons out?
2014.13-975,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1868.878,1874.346,"I think the -- that is part of substantial evidence review and part of Chenery, that the reasons have to be clear."
2014.13-975,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1881.536,1882.836,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,1892.158,1895.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-975,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1921.344,1924.796,So when do you think the statute of limitations runs?
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,1924.796,1926.815,--That's a very good question.
2014.13-975,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1926.815,1927.465,The 30 days?
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,1927.465,1933.735,"I have -- I have pondered that because it is an issue in this case, but also, it's an issue going forward."
2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.113,1951.865,Excuse me.
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,1975.148,1989.489,"--Justice Scalia, that is essentially correct, but what we are saying is we believe that the 30 days should run, as Justice Kagan suggested, from the approval of the minutes."
2014.13-975,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1992.257,2001.715,"Well, in this case -- in this case, May 10th the minutes were approved, and May 13th the suit was filed because the time ran out on May 14th."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2001.715,2002.265,--That's correct.
2014.13-975,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2002.265,2003.731,And you think that's sufficient?
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2003.731,2006.683,I think it is only sufficient for this case.
2014.13-975,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2006.683,2017.225,The 30-day period is so there can be a carefully reasoned decision whether or not to file a suit.
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2021.527,2025.497,"Justice Kennedy, that -- that is what happened in this case."
2014.13-975,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2026.097,2043.475,"I thought you were taking the position, in answer to the government, that says you have to have it contemporaneous because of the 30 days that the company has to make up its mind whether to seek judicial review."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2065.389,2068.258,"--Justice Ginsburg, that is exactly what we're saying, and for three reasons."
2014.13-975,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2111.869,2112.302,So are you saying--
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2112.302,2112.853,Excuse me.
2014.13-975,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2112.853,2117.09,--Are you saying that the actual decision is the minutes--
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2117.09,2118.19,Yes.
2014.13-975,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2118.19,2119.373,--as opposed to the letter you've sent?
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2119.373,2120.125,That is correct.
2014.13-975,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2157.481,2166.004,"In your view, if they had waited 60 days before they approved the minutes, then we wait until then for the time period to run?"
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2166.004,2167.439,"That is correct, Justice Kennedy."
2014.13-975,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2187.101,2201.177,"The facility placing -- everyone loves cell phones, apparently."
2014.13-975,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2272.69,2281.812,So why couldn't the city council or this legislative body have waited until its official minutes and sent the letter that day with the minutes?
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2281.812,2287.466,"That they could have, and I think that is what the Solicitor General is recommending."
2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.239,2330.043,"I don't understand -- I don't understand what you're saying, it requires a written decision."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2356.194,2374.322,"I think what I'm saying, Justice Scalia, is that the writing that is sent -- we've had a lot of verbiage in the briefs about what is a decision and how to characterize that decision and whether it has some sort of opinion to it or whether it's just, this is what we did."
2014.13-975,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2387.33,2389.846,"But then you're agreeing with your opponents, it seems to me."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2402.454,2403.837,"Well, Justice Breyer--"
2014.13-975,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.837,2406.372,"But do you agree with them on that, that one document--"
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2406.372,2408.658,"--I don't agree with him on that, Justice Breyer."
2014.13-975,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2413.977,2415.711,"--Well, I don't know if they should be called “ the minutes ”."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2438.16,2441.545,"--Again, I agree, Justice Breyer, as you have stated it."
2014.13-975,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2458.49,2462.125,"Well, that endorses more or less the SG's position."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2480.77,2487.158,"--Well, and I'm not sure it has to tell the reasons if it attaches that, because the reasons will be in there and it'll be up to--"
2014.13-975,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2487.158,2487.71,Something that--
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2487.71,2493.078,"--the district court to either ascertain, glean, clearly indicate--"
2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2493.078,2495.313,And it's ineffective unless that exists.
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2508.423,2509.123,--I would characterize--
2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2509.123,2510.073,--that the phone company got?
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2510.073,2514.677,"--it as a notification of the denial, but the specific--"
2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2514.677,2515.793,It hasn't been denied yet.
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2519.997,2520.781,--I would--
2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.781,2522.514,"--which is, you know, God knows when."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2522.514,2529.601,"--Well, it has to be done with the minutes, and you've got the shot clock running, but you can't have -- you can't make the applicants--"
2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2529.601,2534.07,"Well, you shouldn't send anything out then because according to you, there has been no decision."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2536.853,2541.824,"--Going forward, Justice Scalia, that is our recommendation--"
2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2541.824,2542.807,That's what you ought to do.
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2542.807,2556.749,"--and I think that if you adopt, as Omnipoint has and Helcher and some other Federal cases, that, in fact, it should be the approval of the minutes, then I think that whole issue goes away."
2014.13-975,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2556.749,2559.035,But it sounds like you're changing your position.
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2578.297,2581.632,"Justice Kennedy, I don't believe I am stating the position."
2014.13-975,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2602.212,2619.44,"But where but surely, under your view -- I'm not convinced that your position hasn't radically changed -- but surely under your view, what you've explained to us at page 34, the 30 days begins to run the minute the notice is given."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2619.44,2631.815,"--Justice Kennedy, again, I think when we use words like “ notice ” and “ decision ”, the letter -- or the statute says,"
2014.13-975,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2656.699,2657.232,--Could you--
2014.13-975,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2657.232,2663.269,That may be what the -- what the statute means in light of the practicalities of the situation.
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2708.298,2713.702,"--Well, Justice Alito, that is a multi-tiered question."
2014.13-975,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2788.633,2800.858,"Mr. Carothers, I wonder whether what Justice Alito pointed out about the nature of local governments, which you agreed with, whether that doesn't suggest that we should try to keep our rule quite simple."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2855.925,2866.883,"--Well, Justice Kagan, I -- I don't object to that as long as the minutes are the final decision and so the 30 days can run from there."
2014.13-975,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2912.695,2920.801,"--So that inquiry and challenge will be left up to judges to figure out what the minutes say, don't say, and what the reasons were."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2920.801,2932.274,"--Well, Justice Sotomayor, as -- as I read the jurisprudence, the fact is the substantial evidence in a written record and to see the reasons is pretty much left up to the district court."
2014.13-975,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2932.274,2932.541,All right.
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2939.262,2939.695,Correct.
2014.13-975,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2939.695,2940.462,All right.
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2946.432,2952.0,"I don't believe that is the case, Justice Sotomayor, and I will say it because of this."
2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2973.096,2974.579,"Well, they said that before the vote."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,2989.873,2998.812,"--Justice Scalia, I think that is exactly what happened in that -- in this case by the majority vote on Dr. Price's motion."
2014.13-975,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3008.351,3019.558,"Well, suppose we issue an opinion in this case that says that the the formal instrument of denial must say in simple terms the reason or reasons for the denial."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,3042.506,3051.361,"Well, I don't know the answer to that exactly, Justice Alito, but I will say that whatever the decision is in this case--"

2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,3057.548,3063.837,"--What everybody in the country has, Justice Alito, is they have people knocking at the door to put up cell towers."
2014.13-975,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3084.418,3102.212,"Please articulate your rule, because you just said to us earlier that not every body of this type has -- has minutes, or minutes that become the statement of reasons."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,3112.335,3126.345,"--Justice Sotomayor, what I would -- what I would craft and -- and what I believe to be the appropriate rule is the denial letter simply says denied."
2014.13-975,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3140.886,3150.074,--How does that rule -- now we're forcing minutes on every -- on every city council to have contained the statement of reasons?
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,3150.074,3153.526,"Justice Sotomayor, I don't know how to answer that."
2014.13-975,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3179.011,3180.294,Why -- why do we have to say?
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,3220.321,3235.097,"Well, Justice Breyer, I simply would argue that the minutes have to have substantial evidence, which is -- or have to have the reasons, which is supported by the substantial evidence."
2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3239.884,3244.953,"Counsel, you you spoke of the -- the statutory requirement of a denial letter."

2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3265.2,3265.55,Right.
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,3265.55,3266.969,--shall be in writing.
2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3270.171,3271.271,That's not the denial letter.

2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3282.894,3283.996,"Yes, and constitute it."
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,3283.996,3287.032,--But a simple notification letter of the denial does not comply with it.

2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3313.682,3314.782,I'm taking it as it's written.
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,3325.49,3326.323,And I--
2014.13-975,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3326.323,3330.375,I suppose you have to give a copy of the minutes to -- to -- to the loser.
2014.13-975,2,56128,richard_carothers,,3330.375,3331.561,--That -- that is correct.
