2018.17-961,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.28,10.225,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-961, Frank versus Gaos, Individually And On Behalf Of All Others Similarly Situated. Mr. Frank."
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,10.225,22.715,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Amchem instructs that courts should interpret Rule 23 with the interests of absent class members in close view."
2018.17-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,51.44,61.93,"Why is it an abuse? Because, practically, the class members would get nothing, nothing at all, and, here, at least they get an indirect benefit."
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,61.93,66.94,"Well, the indirect benefit is even less than nothing."
2018.17-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,80.085,84.49,How much would it have come to for each class member?
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,84.49,98.445,"Each claiming class member probably could have gotten between 5 and 10 dollars with typical claims rates if -- for example, in the Fraley versus Facebook settlement, the court rejected an all cy pres settlement --"
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,98.445,98.91,Sorry.
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,144.64,149.54,"Well, the district court applied the wrong legal standard, but --"
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,149.54,150.07,"No, no."
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,152.24,152.42,"Right, right."
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,152.42,167.9,"-- is can we give 10 percent of the class something even if nobody else gets anything, meaning what you would like to do is select 10 percent of the class and pay them alone and do nothing for everybody else."
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,167.9,168.82,"Well, no."
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,178.38,181.54,Everybody else would receive not even an indirect benefit?
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,181.54,185.025,"No, they would receive the opportunity to make a claim."
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,185.025,186.79,They always have that opportunity.
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,186.79,189.625,They don't have that opportunity here as a class member.
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,191.71,193.78,They could opt out.
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,193.78,197.215,"They could opt out in Amchem also, but that didn't make the settlement fair."
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,197.215,217.14,"But I go back to my point, which is are you disputing the finding of fact that under the normal application of feasibility, whether cost outweighs the payment or cost far exceeds whatever could be given out, is that -- are you disputing that?"
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,217.14,218.845,The court never made that finding.
2018.17-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,244.745,249.975,And then is it all right to have some kind of a cy pres doctrine operate?
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,249.975,250.67,I --
2018.17-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,250.67,258.32,Because if -- would -- with -- for all the class members who don't make any claim?
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,258.32,264.57,"I -- I -- I -- I -- I don't understand the question, Justice."
2018.17-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,269.455,278.26,Suppose the class members are notified and only 10 percent of them make a claim.
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,284.96,292.06,"First of all, in practice, I just want to let the Court know that 10 percent is an extraordinarily high claim rate."
2018.17-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,295.405,297.4,And then the 99 percent.
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,297.4,298.09,Absolutely.
2018.17-961,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,333.75,340.78,What -- what do they do? Do they wait until -- a reasonable period and figure that most of the claims are in and then divide it up or --
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,340.78,348.985,The settlement procedures will establish 90 days or 60 days or 120 days to make a claim.
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,377.91,406.97499995,"I'm sorry, I -- I'm talking -- this is a full cy pres award, meaning there's no direct benefit to the class. What about the residual cy pres? I thought in many instances, if a fund is created and the claimants are all paid off, there's some money left over, the residual cy pres, and that's given indirectly often."
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,406.97499995,430.95,"Circuits differ on that. The Seventh rejects that proposal because they recognize that the settling parties have the ability to adjust the claims rate by -- depending on how difficult they make the claims process. So, in a Seventh Circuit case, there is a $1.1 million residual and 12 million class members, though that was 8 cents per class member."
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,486.19,518.615,"Assuming all of that, let's assume a very efficient claim process, let's assume a -- a careful feasibility study by the district court. Are you still -- you're still taking the position that if there's a residual for any reason that's legitimate, there's been an easy claims process, there's been a simple distribution, whatever, you're still saying that an indirect benefit, a partial cy pres, is not okay?"
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,518.615,523.2,I'm saying that you can't reward class counsel for it.
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,527.03,550.055,"So your position is that cy pres is okay, but we should write legislation in our opinion saying that we can't pay class counsel for that. Have you read the Third Circuit opinion that talks about this and says there's a lot to balance in this issue, and are the courts the appropriate one or is Congress the appropriate one?"
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,550.055,550.61,Well --
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,550.61,558.675,Or is the individual district court's discretion appropriate until the Congress looks at this and decides?
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,558.675,561.34,I think Rule 23(e) means something.
2018.17-961,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,575.58,599.925,"In a case such as this, is any effort made -- and would it even be possible -- to determine whether every absent class member or even most of the absent class members regard the beneficiaries of the cy pres award as entities to which they would like to make a contribution?"
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,599.925,619.38,"It's very possible to establish a claims process where somebody checks a box and said, instead of sending me a check for $6, send it to the American Cancer Society. Nobody does that, or at least we -- we haven't seen settlements that do that."
2018.17-961,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,627.595,630.825,So who decides who these beneficiaries are going to be?
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,630.825,633.59,It varies from settlement to settlement.
2018.17-961,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,654.39,662.91,So the parties and the lawyers get together and they choose beneficiaries that they personally would like to subsidize? That's how it works?
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,662.91,664.34,That's usually how it works.
2018.17-961,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,669.76,672.225,Where the judge has designated the beneficiaries?
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,672.225,688.89999995,"There are settlements structured where the judge designates the beneficiaries. And in another Google settlement that we discuss in our opening brief, the parties designated a beneficiary and -- and the court re-designated the beneficiary."
2018.17-961,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,688.89999995,690.59,Mr. Frank --
2018.17-961,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,690.59,691.23,We -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-961,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,691.23,691.625,Sorry.
2018.17-961,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,692.425,693.175,"Oh, please go ahead."
2018.17-961,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,693.175,693.845,No.
2018.17-961,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,693.845,695.095,Justice Kagan.
2018.17-961,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,695.095,698.46,I was going to change the subject. (Laughter.)
2018.17-961,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,698.46,701.25,So was I. (Laughter.)
2018.17-961,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,701.25,702.08,Jurisdiction?
2018.17-961,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,702.08,702.64,Yes.
2018.17-961,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,702.64,705.78,Go for it. (Laughter.)
2018.17-961,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,705.78,720.975,"May I ask you, Mr. Frank, to -- to -- to address the standing issue in this case, to -- to talk about what you think the harm was and whether any court has addressed your theories about the harm?"
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,720.975,723.93,Are you -- are you talking my harm or the harm of the plaintiffs?
2018.17-961,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,723.93,726.18,The harm of the plaintiffs.
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,726.18,767.745,"The harm of the plaintiffs, we discuss that at pages 25 and 26 of our reply brief. And one of the named plaintiffs, Anthony Italiano, alleges a statutory violation that corresponds to the common law tort of public disclosure of private facts. And the lower courts are unanimous in holding that that kind of statutory claim satisfies Spokeo. Even on remand in Spokeo, the Ninth Circuit found standing, and this Court denied cert the second time up. So I don't think there's a real standing issue, unless the Court is inclined to expand Spokeo."
2018.17-961,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,767.745,786.54,"I had thought, Mr. Frank, that the lower court thought that there would be -- there was standing just because it was a statutory claim, and that there was no reason that the plaintiff had to show a particularized or a concrete injury."
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,786.54,814.38,"That is certainly the wrong standard for the district court to have applied, with later Supreme Court jurisprudence indicating that, but we can determine from the face of the complaint that Anthony Italiano made an allegation of concrete injury within the ambit of what Justice Thomas's concurrence in Spokeo indicated was acceptable and what lower courts have unanimously indicated that it was -- was acceptable."
2018.17-961,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,814.38,823.4,"I was curious where you were going to come down before you filed your brief, because, obviously, if there's no standing, the whole class action's thrown out, right?"
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,823.4,832.695,"That would be correct. That would be the right thing to do under Arizonans for Proper English, or Official English."
2018.17-961,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,838.595,849.65,"Now you say -- to follow up with Justice Kagan, who anticipated exactly where I wanted to go -- you say there's an allegation with respect to Mr. Italiano that -- that he was injured."
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,863.24,864.94,"Well, that goes to the merits."
2018.17-961,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,879.26,892.81,"Well, fair enough at a 12(b)(6) stage, but, here, we're entering a final judgment, and should we at least remand to -- to a lower court to make a decision as to whether there is actually standing as opposed to a mere allegation of standing?"
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,892.81,895.88,I don't think that's the case.
2018.17-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,905.15,958.74,"So what is the private -- I mean, what I have here, my law clerk looked it up, is that the search that Mr. Italiano engaged in was his name, that's certainly public, his home address, I imagine that's public, name in bankruptcy, his name in foreclosure proceedings, his name in short sale proceedings, his name in Facebook, and his name and the name of his then soon-to-be ex-wife and the words ""forensic accounting."" Now how, if that -- if those are all the things that he looked up, how are the -- what concrete injury was there because somebody might discover through Google that he made those searches? I mean, I -- I don't quite see how this is some kind of secret or private or -- information."
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,964.35,967.41,"Well, the Ninth Circuit --"
2018.17-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,967.41,970.985,"And -- and -- and the statute -- and the judge, by the way, didn't even try."
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,970.985,971.58,I agree.
2018.17-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,971.58,978.645,"He just said that the very fact that the statute forbids it is enough, which I think is one thing Spokeo says that's wrong."
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,978.645,984.675,I agree that the judge did not apply the Spokeo standard.
2018.17-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1013.74,1023.695,"Yes, the allegation is made, but where is an allegation of some kind of injury that would actually concretely and particularly hurt him?"
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,1023.695,1024.59,Again --
2018.17-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1024.59,1029.985,By somebody looking up on the -- at Google and discovering he made those searches?
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,1029.985,1033.76,"Even under the common law, the public disclosure of private facts --"
2018.17-961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1033.76,1035.275,And which are the private facts?
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,1035.275,1041.19,The private facts regarding the dissolution of his marriage and -- and -- and things of that nature.
2018.17-961,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1041.19,1062.305,"Well, again, though, I think this gets -- we're stuck in the same place, I think, which is that you have to assume that that information isn't otherwise available. At least, fine, you don't want to prove it, an allegation of it, there's no allegation that that information wasn't otherwise available. So what do we do about that? I think that's the part where -- that we're struggling with here."
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,1062.305,1086.485,"If the complaint is not strong enough to establish the concrete injury under what a majority of the Court indicated would be sufficient under Spokeo and what the lower courts have repeatedly found with respect to Spokeo, then the appropriate decision is to have a limited remand and take it back up, assuming that the Court finds jurisdiction."
2018.17-961,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1086.485,1099.74,"Is -- putting aside the question of whether it's pertinent to the standing analysis, just so I understand the claims, the disclosures go to any searches that somebody engages in, correct?"
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,1099.74,1100.865,That's correct.
2018.17-961,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1100.865,1101.81,Okay.
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,1109.53,1115.4,"If -- if both Gaos and Italiano don't qualify, then they might have the wrong named plaintiff."
2018.17-961,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1123.665,1125.74,But it -- but it has to be one of the named plaintiffs?
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,1125.74,1129.6849999,It does have to be a named plaintiff.
2018.17-961,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1129.6849999,1137.44,But your argument is passing standing.
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,1138.96,1140.99,We're not challenging standing.
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1174.185,1174.89,I -- I --
2018.17-961,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1174.89,1175.62,Is there --
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1175.62,1185.59,"-- I -- I understand your fear, but, as I look at the full cy pres awards, they're rare."
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,1215.185,1221.01,"Well, the system will cease to work if the Ninth Circuit's standard is affirmed by this Court."
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1239.48,1253.94,How is the Ninth Circuit's standard different than all the other standards? I thought the circuits had basically coalesced around the ALI three-factor test.
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,1253.94,1256.255,The Ninth Circuit rejected that.
2018.17-961,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1287.65,1292.25,So is this appeal all about feasibility alone?
2018.17-961,0,63047,theodore_h_frank,,1292.25,1292.92,No.
2018.17-961,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1299.18,1314.935,"Thank you, counsel. General Wall."
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1314.935,1319.13,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Two points."
2018.17-961,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1369.52,1372.55,I don't -- I don't understand your argument on the fee.
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1385.885,1389.945,"Well, I still think you have to look at what relief it provides to the class."
2018.17-961,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1449.98000005,1456.17,Is there any reason why we should not decide the standing question? It's a question of law.
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1473.425,1475.88,"I think the Court could decide it, Justice Alito."
2018.17-961,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1480.865,1482.43,"Yeah, but why remand?"
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1482.43,1498.97,"Well, because I think -- and Justice Gorsuch was getting at this a little bit -- it isn't clear -- the -- the common law tort that everybody keeps pointing to required public disclosure of private facts about you. Here, we know that somebody searched Mr. Italiano's name, but from the fact that somebody searches my name, it doesn't mean it was me."
2018.17-961,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1534.24,1559.255,"Well, do you think that every time we get a case where there's been a dismissal at the pleadings stage and a question of standing arises, we should remand it to the lower court to see whether the plaintiff might be able to come up with some additional allegations, or should we decide whether the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged standing, as the plaintiff must sufficiently allege all the elements of whatever claim is being pressed?"
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1559.255,1561.21,"I -- Justice Alito, I think the Court could decide it."
2018.17-961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1568.245,1586.52,"We know this, on that very point -- we have in the complaint, quote -- there was one search that was his name, Italiano, and then, quote, ""the name of his then soon-to-be ex-wife."" End quote. All right."
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1616.035,1625.25,"So, in fairness to their theory, Justice Breyer, I don't think it's the -- I don't think that what they're pointing the harm is the disclosure of the information itself."
2018.17-961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1637.18,1637.57,But that is --
2018.17-961,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1637.57,1638.335,Isn't that an injury?
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1638.335,1638.85,I'm sorry?
2018.17-961,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1638.85,1642.185,"Isn't that an injury, disclosure of what you searched?"
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1642.185,1644.36,I don't think --
2018.17-961,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1644.36,1652.305,I don't think anyone would want the disclosure of everything they searched for disclosed to other people. That seems a harm.
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1652.305,1653.0,I think on a --
2018.17-961,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1653.0,1657.325,"It may not -- may or may not be a cause of action, but it's a harm."
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1657.325,1660.235,"Justice Kavanaugh, I'm not so sure."
2018.17-961,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1664.59,1667.99,"But it doesn't have to be exactly at common law, according to the language in Spokeo."
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1669.42,1671.47,"No, I -- it's just an analogue."
2018.17-961,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1673.61,1675.205,Just as a common sense matter.
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1675.205,1675.85,"Well, on a --"
2018.17-961,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1675.85,1677.84,Just -- just go to plain common sense.
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1677.84,1678.08,"Oh, on a --"
2018.17-961,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1678.08,1681.76,"What you search for, if that's disclosed to other people?"
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1681.76,1688.26,"Yes, I think on a particularized basis, you could conduct searches the disclosure of which would embarrass or harm you."
2018.17-961,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1694.45,1696.18,If it's disclosed to another person?
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1696.18,1699.84,"Again, I'm not sure that it is a sufficient harm under Spokeo."
2018.17-961,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1700.17,1701.08,And -- and what --
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1701.08,1712.05,"-- though, that the predicate problem and the reason I think you don't even get there is this re-identification theory is itself so speculative, I don't think it's at all clear that the Internet sites you click through to could be used to figure out it was you."
2018.17-961,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1712.05,1712.97,But isn't that a merits question?
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1712.97,1713.67,I don't think so.
2018.17-961,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1721.97,1722.27,General Wall --
2018.17-961,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1722.27,1728.915,"And what is the record with respect to that question, about whether anybody can identify the person who did the search?"
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1728.915,1741.135,"As far as we can tell, there is no record because the district court never reexamined this post-Spokeo and no one raised it, either because they were bound not to attack the settlement agreement or because they wanted a ruling on the merits of cy pres."
2018.17-961,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1741.135,1755.1,"General Wall, what's the -- what's the government's position on Justice Thomas's theory in Spokeo that standing can be proven by violation of a legal right granted by Congress, even if it wouldn't be otherwise recognized at common law?"
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1755.1,1758.025,"We have not taken a position on that here, Justice Gorsuch."
2018.17-961,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1758.025,1764.265,So what -- what -- what -- what do you recommend the Court do about that? The government's got nothing to offer us.
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1764.265,1768.39,"Just, we would be happy to supplementally brief the standing question."
2018.17-961,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1774.47,1778.535,Isn't that a reason why we should -- we should not decide it in the first instance?
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1778.535,1783.595,"Justice Ginsburg, for the reasons I gave earlier, I think the Court could on this record or it could remand."
2018.17-961,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1804.03,1812.31,Why -- why -- to pick up on Justice Sotomayor's question earlier -- why shouldn't that be a question for the Rules Committee in Congress to address in the first instance?
2018.17-961,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1812.31,1843.9,"Well, so, look, guidance from Congress would be helpful, but in its absence, I still think we have to say what the fair, reasonable, and adequate standard means under Rule 23. The Rules Committee has essentially punted to the courts by saying the courts are actively looking at this issue, we're not going to address it. Now they did amend the rule in various ways that I think support our approach by saying you should consider fees at the 23(e) stage, you can delay to see what the claims rate is, the court should be looking at the claims rate. I mean, a number of the things that they've done in the amended rule, I think, are designed to tighten up the inquiry."
2018.17-961,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1912.93,1918.585,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Pincus."
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1918.585,1958.2,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To the extent Petitioners are arguing for a per se rule invalidating settlements, where the monetary payments only go to third parties, nothing in the Rules Enabling Act or Rule 23 authorizes a flat prohibition. And as Justice Sotomayor indicated and Judge -- Professor Rubenstein's amicus brief submits, these are very, very rare settlements. But Rule 23(e)'s requirement that settlements be fair, reasonable, and adequate does impose significant constraints, which is why I think these settlements are rare. Maybe I'll just say --"
2018.17-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1958.2,1958.49,Is there --
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1958.49,1960.915,-- something about standing because someone's probably going to ask about it.
2018.17-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1960.915,1964.4,"Well, go ahead and speak to the standing. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1964.4,1981.01,"We agree with the government that there's a serious question about whether this action was ever properly in federal court and that the standing issue has to be addressed before the court could determine the questions presented. So that means either the case should be dismissed as improvidently granted, there should be remand, or the Court should decide the question."
2018.17-961,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2025.71,2029.82,What does -- what does Google admit it discloses to third-parties? I don't know.
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2047.82,2068.24,"Well, the issue here is -- is there were -- there are -- there are lots of cookies and other things that -- that generate the -- the serving up of ads to your particular computer. The question here is the referrer header, which is that the search terms -- when you -- when you conduct a search, you get a list of websites."
2018.17-961,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2074.505,2075.565,Well --
2018.17-961,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2075.565,2078.165,"And that's not a harm, that isn't a harm --"
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2078.165,2079.27,I -- I don't think --
2018.17-961,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2079.27,2079.8,-- to disclose that?
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2079.8,2087.85,"-- I don't think that the mere disclosure of a search without more, your men's shoes search, is not a harm because there's no disclosure that you're making the search."
2018.17-961,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2091.155,2091.62,And could you --
2018.17-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2091.62,2098.69500005,"Based on -- based on -- based on what Justice Alito typed in, right, someone searched for men's shoes?"
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2098.69500005,2101.55,"Well, yes, but not that Justice Alito --"
2018.17-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2101.55,2103.66,"Well, that's kind of revelatory of private information."
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2103.66,2106.0,But -- but not that Justice Alito searched for men's shoes.
2018.17-961,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2106.0,2106.87,But my idea was --
2018.17-961,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2106.87,2109.05,I'm not -- I'm not sure how not.
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2109.05,2109.86,Excuse me?
2018.17-961,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2109.86,2111.81,The -- the -- I'm not sure how not.
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2142.195,2149.6,"Well, there are -- there are lots of ways that information is disclosed that don't have to do with the referrer header. Again, we're talking about the referrer header here."
2018.17-961,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2150.645,2151.44,"Oh, I see what you mean."
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2151.44,2157.99,-- the placement of cookies in your browser and other -- other ways that -- that you may be served ads based on your searches.
2018.17-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2160.22,2168.26,But do you think that problem is going to be meaningfully redressed by giving money to AARP?
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2168.26,2171.2,"Well, I -- I -- I think the question is -- (Laughter.)"
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2171.2,2173.28,I think -- I think it is because I --
2018.17-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2173.28,2176.43,As if only -- as if this is only a problem for elderly people? (Laughter.)
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2176.43,2179.78,"No, but AARP is not the only recipient and elderly people are particularly --"
2018.17-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2179.78,2181.68,"Well, you're changing the subject, Mr. Pincus."
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2182.935,2183.73,It is.
2018.17-961,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2214.87,2215.56,Especially when you use a --
2018.17-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2215.56,2223.8,"Including a group that engages in -- engages in political activity, having nothing to do with the inability of elderly people to conduct searches?"
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2223.8,2227.93,"Well, this grant had nothing to do with political activity."
2018.17-961,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2233.87,2240.505,"May I go back, Mr. Pincus? You -- you talked about the re-identification theory, and I'm not quite sure I understand it."
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2249.955,2288.12,"Well, I think this is one of the reasons why more information, either re-briefing here or a remand is necessary, but what would have to be alleged would be that enough referrer headers went to a single website operator that that website operator could combine them and say: A-ha, I can now figure out that this is the person who made the search and tie the search terms to that person. I'm not sure that would be enough. The restatement section, 652(h), seems to indicate that actual imminent damages are required for privacy violations. In other words, the -- the mere revelation of facts at -- at common law in 1950 -- in the 1960s was not enough, let alone in 1787."
2018.17-961,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2288.12,2289.67,But that's a merits question.
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2292.09,2293.21,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2018.17-961,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2294.67,2302.905,"We're just talking about harm, and you don't have a mini-trial on whether the harm, sufficient for standing, is proved."
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2302.905,2308.595,I think that -- that standing -- there are two ways that standing can be contested by a defendant.
2018.17-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2372.15,2381.27,"Would the following make sense if we get to the merits? Professor Rubenstein's brief -- I'm referring to that, interesting."
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2436.06,2438.51,I think there should be careful scrutiny.
2018.17-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2438.51,2438.81,"Yeah, but, I mean --"
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2438.81,2439.01,I think --
2018.17-961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2439.01,2440.45,-- you heard -- I was trying to make up a --
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2440.45,2440.57,Yes.
2018.17-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2543.82,2544.07,On -- on that --
2018.17-961,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2544.07,2544.38,Why not a --
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2544.38,2548.265,-- that that organization will control the money and decide how it's going to be used.
2018.17-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2548.265,2556.52,"On that point, would you agree that the district court should never be the one suggesting possible recipients of the funds of a settlement he has to approve?"
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2556.52,2557.99,"I -- I totally agree, Your Honor."
2018.17-961,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2575.99,2576.32,Why is it --
2018.17-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2576.32,2576.95,Why do you --
2018.17-961,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2576.95,2577.78,Go ahead.
2018.17-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2577.78,2599.97,"Why do you -- why do you assume that simply because someone wants money in the settlement or is entitled to, that he's also opposed to what gave rise to the -- the wrong? I mean, you may be in an auto accident with someone who's speeding. That doesn't mean you automatically think that highway safety is affected and the speed limit should be changed."
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2599.97,2600.69,"Well, I --"
2018.17-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2600.69,2602.81,You just want money because of what happened to you.
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2602.81,2618.895,"And -- and I think that's why I think the critical first inquiry is, is the -- is the -- in the real world, is the -- is the cost of distributing the money going to mean that people get essentially little or nothing or -- or essentially nothing so that this indirect benefit is better?"
2018.17-961,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2618.895,2619.18,Isn't it --
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2619.18,2620.25,I don't think the -- I think --
2018.17-961,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2620.25,2621.65,I think Justice Kavanaugh had a question.
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2621.65,2621.9,I'm sorry.
2018.17-961,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2621.9,2632.53,"Isn't it always better to at least have a lottery system then that one of the plaintiffs, one of the injured parties gets it, rather than someone who's not injured? Why isn't that always more reasonable?"
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2632.53,2635.3,We agree with the government that a lottery system would be very strange.
2018.17-961,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2638.83,2639.45,This is strange too.
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2639.45,2640.18,"Well, I think this -- this --"
2018.17-961,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2640.18,2642.59,"I mean, it's a question of what's more strange, I think."
2018.17-961,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2642.59,2647.74,"Well, if I may answer the question, I think this is actually -- and this is partially an answer to the Chief Justice's question."

2018.17-961,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2751.15,2753.395,The question's what reasonableness means.
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2753.395,2773.61,"I think that's right. And the question is -- and the answer to that, I think, is when the alternative, when you have a possibility of getting millions of dollars of indirect relief, it is better, it is fair, reasonable, and adequate, to get that when the alternative is likely nothing or the nominal equivalent of nothing. And that's the fundamental decision that ALI made."
2018.17-961,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2789.19,2795.36,In whose opinion do they serve the interests of the individual class members? In the opinion of the individual class members?
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2795.36,2801.635,"Well, the decision is initially made by the class representatives and the lawyers, and it's subject to judicial review by the court."
2018.17-961,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2829.03,2837.73,"But there is the appearance, as the district court said in the hearing, the appearance of favoritism and alma maters of -- of counsel."
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2837.73,2844.6,"Your Honor, I think, in this case, the district court acknowledged that there was the potential of conflict, but he did what a district court should do."
2018.17-961,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2868.965,2879.65,"Well, don't you think it's just a little bit fishy that the money goes to a charity or a 501(c)(3) organization that Google had contributed to in the past?"
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2879.65,2886.94,"So, Your Honor, remember, because we're in the high-tech area and we're in an emerging area, there's only so many organizations that are going to have track records of this."
2018.17-961,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2888.29,2893.35,I bet there are other organizations active in the area that Google had not contributed to in the past.
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2893.35,2895.18,And -- and many were included here.
2018.17-961,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2909.94,2930.495,"Well, I know, but the allegation -- you know, I mean, the allegation is that counsel for the class and the defendant are working together because no money is going to anybody else, it's just going to counsel for the -- for the class, and that Google for its part as part of the deal -- I'm not suggesting that's what's going on -- but the allegation, it says part of the deal, they get to give money to their favorite charity."
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2930.495,2935.3,And the district court looked at it and understood that Google's role ended at selecting potential recipients.
2018.17-961,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2986.15,3025.68,"The appearance problem here, which has happened in many cases, is symptomatic of a broader question, which is why is it not always reasonable, more reasonable in this situation, which is a difficult one, to try to get the money to injured parties, either through pro rata distribution or some kind of lottery system. Imperfect or strange as that may be, it seems to me potentially less strange or why isn't it less strange than giving it to people who weren't injured at all, who have affiliations with the counsel, and who in many cases don't need the money?"
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3025.68,3033.31,"Your Honor, in terms of what the standard is, yes, absolutely, the priority is to give the individual class members money."
2018.17-961,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3052.3,3053.62,How about a lottery versus this?
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3053.62,3056.08,So the lottery doesn't really help much for two reasons.
2018.17-961,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3073.73,3081.7,"But at least it's someone who -- who, quote, to use your analogy, paid for the lottery ticket as opposed to giving the billion dollar award to someone who didn't buy the lottery ticket."
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3081.7,3082.43,"Well, I think --"
2018.17-961,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3082.43,3082.95,"I mean, that's the --"
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3082.95,3083.54,-- it is a little --
2018.17-961,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3083.54,3084.53,"-- that's, to use your analogy, the --"
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3084.53,3111.44,"It's a little passing strange to start -- to use all the money, virtually all the money, to actually set up this lottery process to accept all these claims, administer that process, and then exclude the vast majority of the class and say: And we're going to take some people who were injured and entitled to money, and we're not going to give them their money, we're going to give that money to somebody else because they won the lottery. It's just a little unseemly, in addition to being grossly inefficient, because the only thing it reduces -- it doesn't reduce claims administration cost in terms of accepting claims."
2018.17-961,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3118.585,3123.88,"It -- it reduces, to pick up on the Chief Justice's comments, the appearance of favoritism and collusion --"
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3123.88,3124.31,And that --
2018.17-961,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3124.31,3125.82,-- which is rife in these cases.
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3133.53,3150.69,"Well, he wasn't concerned about the collusion because he specifically found that it did not enter into the decision. And if the district court had -- the standard everyone agrees is, if there's even doubt, if there's substantial doubt about whether the recipients were selected on the merits, that doubt is called against the settlement."
2018.17-961,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3177.8,3178.5,"I mean, if you step back --"
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3178.5,3179.06,Now if someone's opposed --
2018.17-961,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3179.06,3208.42,"-- if you step back from what happened in this case and cases like this, how can you say that it makes any sense? The purpose of asking for compensation, it's not injunctive relief that would benefit a -- benefit a broad class, but the purpose -- benefit the public -- it's compensation for the -- for the class members. And at the end of the day, what happens? The attorneys get money, and a lot of it."
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3227.995,3234.51,"So two parts to that. The first is, with respect to fees, and we don't believe -- because that's Rule 24(h), a reasonable fee adder."
2018.17-961,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3342.625,3350.45,"You started -- you started with what for me is a very good point, which is why is this for us and not for Congress and the committee."
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3369.01,3369.63,"Well, Your Honor, I think --"
2018.17-961,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3369.63,3370.64,-- the court's going to do it?
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3370.64,3381.73,"-- what the Court has before it is the text of the rule, and the one thing the Court can't do is substitute some categorical rule that it thinks more efficient or better than the rule itself. We have to apply the rule --"
2018.17-961,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3381.73,3390.39,"But isn't that what courts do all the time with the word ""reasonable,"" is over time apply -- learn from experience and then draw sometimes bright-line rules?"
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3390.39,3403.44,"As in Rule 23(h), where it's a reasonable fee, courts typically fill reasonableness with factors and considerations. They typically don't substitute a different test, such as to say cy pres is never fair, reasonable, and adequate."
2018.17-961,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3404.095,3405.75,"Mr. Lamken -- I'm sorry, please."
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3405.75,3410.71,"No, and it certainly should be fair, reasonable, and adequate when the alternative is nothing."
2018.17-961,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3410.71,3412.94,"Could I ask you to address standing, please?"
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3412.94,3413.38,Yes.
2018.17-961,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3466.6,3468.145,You can take an extra minute on standing.
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3468.145,3468.655,Okay.
2018.17-961,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3510.82,3518.8,"The -- the alleged injury here, am I correct, is that a third-party will know that a particular person did the search."
2018.17-961,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3522.845,3531.19,"I think that when it's associated with you, that -- that is an injury. But merely disclosing your letter, even if it was an anonymous letter, to a third-party, I think that would have been actionable at common law."
2018.17-961,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3568.53,3572.28999995,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frank, you have three minutes remaining."
2018.17-961,4,63047,theodore_h_frank,,3572.28999995,3610.52,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: My friend is alleging that the district court made factual findings that it simply did not reach because it believed its hands were tied by the Ninth Circuit precedent. It did not look at the potential conflicts between Google and the recipients because, in Lane versus Facebook, the Ninth Circuit approved a settlement where Facebook gave to a charity created by Facebook. It did not look at the difficulty of distributing to some class members because the Ninth Circuit has a de minimis standard."
2018.17-961,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3737.47,3738.89,"Thank you, counsel."
