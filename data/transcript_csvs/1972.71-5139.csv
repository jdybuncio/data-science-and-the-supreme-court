1972.71-5139,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.052,"We’ll hear arguments next in 71-5139, Ham against South Carolina."
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,29.846,33.235,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-5139,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,394.624,397.786,"Mr. Shapiro, do you have your brief at hand there?"
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,397.786,398.727,Yes.
1972.71-5139,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,398.727,408.831,"On page four, the -- right after the quote at the bottom of the page where it says that jurors were excused that should be two jurors should it?"
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,408.831,409.707,That’s correct.
1972.71-5139,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,409.707,410.571,TWL?
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,410.571,412.67,"Yes, its two jurors, that’s a typographical error."
1972.71-5139,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,412.67,413.868,Right.
1972.71-5139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,413.868,421.003,"Mr. Shapiro, under South Carolina practice, after the judge has put the questions that he wants to put on voir dire."
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,425.014,450.456,"The South Carolina practice would permit counsel to question the juror at the judges discretion, that is -- it’s permissible for the judge to allow counsel although the usual practice is for the judge to conduct the entire voir dire examination and the more usual practice is for the judge to ask questions proposed by counsel as was done in this case."
1972.71-5139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,450.456,457.146,Did the counsel for petitioner here seek to interrogate the jury on his own after the judge had declined to put the questions himself?
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,457.146,473.414,"No, the counsel submitted written proposed voir dire questions to the judge prior to the selection of the jurors and when they were refused, he sought no further attempt to question the jurors."
1972.71-5139,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,473.414,483.378,"Then we have to construe that record as meaning that a request on the part of the counsel would have been fruitless, is that correct?"
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,483.378,497.988,I think that’s the necessary conclusion since the preferred practice in the South Carolina is for the judge to put all questions to the jury and when counsel did request that he do so and that request was denied.
1972.71-5139,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,505.404,509.276,"Wasn’t it all said along page 35, the court said this is all irrelevant."
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,510.495,515.576,I think that that certainly indicates the way the judge would have ruled with respect to the --
1972.71-5139,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,515.576,517.203,That’s the way it did rule.
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,517.203,518.15,Exactly.
1972.71-5139,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,518.15,520.207,Well isn’t that what it says on page 35 of the writ?
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,520.207,524.31,"Yes it does, he ruled that the questions were irrelevant and would not put it in way --"
1972.71-5139,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,524.31,530.197,"Mr. Shapiro, three questions to which Mr. Justice Stewart referred to you at page four of your brief."
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,535.389,561.571,"The South Carolina statute which is set out in the footnote 3 on page 5 of the brief states that the court shall on motion of either party in this suit examined on oath, any person who is called to know whether he is related to either party, has any interest in the cause, has expressed or formed any opinion or a sensible of any bias or prejudice therein."
1972.71-5139,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,576.032,581.89,So these three questions were asked five of trial judge in obedience to that statute was that it?
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,581.89,604.523,"That’s correct, that’s correct, although it should be noted that the judge did not even fully comply with the – all of the requirements to that statute of the three questions, the South Carolina Supreme Court held on appeal constituted sufficient compliance under South Carolina Law."
1972.71-5139,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,648.544,650.508,How many judges are on that?
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,650.508,652.293,There are five judges.
1972.71-5139,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,652.293,653.371,And this was three to two?
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,653.371,658.315,That’s correct.
1972.71-5139,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,813.168,830.653,"How far would you carry the specific questions, for example which, if the request had been made do you have any prejudice against people who wear pink shirts?"
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,830.653,830.852,No.
1972.71-5139,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,830.852,837.191,"And the defendant was wearing a pink shirt or his counsel was wearing a pink shirt, do you think that inquiry must be made?"
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,837.191,839.648,I would think certainly not.
1972.71-5139,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,882.781,886.474,What was the final composition of the trial jury?
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,886.474,892.909,The jury was 10 white and two black as finally in panel --
1972.71-5139,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,892.909,899.132,And does the State require a unanimous verdict in a criminal case there?
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,899.132,902.735,"It does, in South Carolina it does require a unanimous verdict."
1972.71-5139,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,902.735,912.86,"So that the, either one, any one juror could have prevented the verdict?"
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,912.86,915.576,"Yes, that’s correct."
1972.71-5139,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,915.576,927.916,"Well, I am to take that the answer or your response to that other question Mr. Shapiro that you’re really concentrating on -- you’re really concerned about the questions on a racial prejudice."
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,929.535,946.362,I think that this case involved two areas which this Court on numerous occasions has recognized or perhaps the most fundamental areas in dealing with impartiality on juries and that’s racial prejudice and pretrial publicity.
1972.71-5139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,996.185,998.472,Was that a constitutional holding?
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,998.472,1001.087,We think that it was.
1972.71-5139,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1040.704,1064.213,"Are you saying in effect Mr. Shapiro that the statutory questions that are required there might be entirely satisfactory for an ordinary routine case but that when special factors emerged, the Constitution requires that the judge exercise discretion to cover a broader range of inquiry of the jury?"
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,1064.213,1098.316,"I think that’s a fair statement of our position which is at in any, in a given case, the irrelevance of the area of inquiry, proposed questions to issues and the circumstances of the case are what must be considered and that when dealing with something as fundamental as the issues in this case, racial prejudice and pretrial publicity that the judge cannot refuse to inquiring to these areas."
1972.71-5139,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1098.316,1111.034,"Well now on the Aldridge case back 49 years ago, had the trial judge there ask any questions at all or had he just refused to make any inquiry?"
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,1111.034,1146.619,There was a voir dire examination in the Aldridge case which is set out at 283 U.S. 309 and that examination did relate to the facts of that particular case bias or prejudice of the juries with respect to certain kind of evidence and certainly even that examination was a lot more extensive than the examination in this case.
1972.71-5139,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1387.2,1397.175,"Incidentally, with this seriatim kind of proceeding where each prospective venireman was asked -- each venireman was asked these three questions?"
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,1397.175,1401.088,"Correct, each juror was called to the -- they were all in the box."
1972.71-5139,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1403.414,1404.309,And repeated the question.
1972.71-5139,0,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,1404.309,1406.212,That’s correct.
1972.71-5139,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1454.428,1457.723,"Thank you, very well, Mr. Shapiro."
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1461.951,1464.943,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-5139,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1549.377,1555.115,Where do we find them in the record?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1555.115,1556.526,Page 12.
1972.71-5139,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1556.526,1571.409,Thank you.
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1571.409,1582.463,"At the top of this page it states the clippings, appearing in Florence, morning news."
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1686.082,1686.73,Which juror.
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1686.73,1690.589,I’m not aware of -- you mean which -- what was the race have to do?
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1690.589,1697.772,"The one you mentioned on 47, I don’t agree with it (Inaudible)."
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1697.772,1698.939,"I don’t understand your question, Your Honor."
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1698.939,1701.356,You said there were two witnesses that were excused?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1701.356,1703.041,Yes.
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1703.041,1703.448,Do you?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1703.448,1704.018,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1704.018,1704.608,Or juror?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1704.608,1705.994,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1705.994,1707.702,For what reason?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1707.702,1711.444,When they stated that they could not give the State or the defendant a fair and impartial trial.
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1711.444,1712.24,They ought it?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1712.24,1713.853,Or that they rather not serve.
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1713.853,1716.953,(Inaudible).
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1716.953,1718.567,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1751.96,1756.174,"In South Carolina, do you use the same questions on a capital offense?"
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1756.174,1757.067,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1757.067,1757.626,Same questions?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1757.626,1759.085,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1759.085,1761.893,Have you read Witherspoon against Illinois?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1761.893,1762.358,I beg your pardon?
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1762.358,1764.369,Have you ever read Witherspoon against Illinois?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1764.369,1768.329,"Yes, I had Your Honor."
1972.71-5139,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1805.764,1814.608,"Mr. Quinn, what would have been lost however, had the Court asked the requested questions?"
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1814.608,1818.118,"In this particular instance, I don’t anything will be of loss, Your Honor."
1972.71-5139,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1834.032,1844.183,"Well, I suppose his irrelevancy conclusion must have been based in the thought that the statutorily prescribed questions covered the ground?"
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1844.183,1845.478,I would assume so Your Honor.
1972.71-5139,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1845.478,1847.94,Because otherwise they certainly were relevant.
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1847.94,1851.531,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-5139,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1851.531,1856.273,Returning Mr. Quinn to those references at page 12 to the newspaper clippings.
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1867.496,1874.337,They were in the records of the -- in the case that was appealed to the States Supreme Court but they are not in the appendix.
1972.71-5139,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1874.857,1877.178,Well are they up here do you know?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1877.178,1885.218,I do not think so.
1972.71-5139,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1953.178,1964.143,"Of course Mr. Quinn even if the conclusion of the answering of these questions by the jurors, the trial judge were to say I don’t find the -- I don’t find the juror to be disqualified."
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,1972.141,1985.177,"Your Honor, I think this is a crucial issue of the cases whether the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right to prove into the prospective jurors as to whether -- as to the propriety of exercise and the preempt for a chance."
1972.71-5139,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1992.809,2002.834,You said under the no form of voir dire is incorporated into the notion of a jury trial as the Sixth Amendment.
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2002.834,2003.607,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-5139,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2018.063,2022.533,Was this issue raised as a constitutional issue in the Supreme Court of your state?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2079.719,2087.833,I think the issue was brought to the attention of the Supreme Court into arguments of the defendant at the Supreme Court level.
1972.71-5139,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2099.641,2104.635,"Well, do you place any reliance on that?"
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2118.895,2139.295,"Your Honor, in our brief on certiorari, we did raised this issue and supported in that brief on certiorari and our brief in our position of certiorari and we have worked the contention at that time that no federal question was presented in the State Supreme Court and we would adhere to this decision on our opinion today."
1972.71-5139,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2139.295,2144.359,"But at least for what it’s worth, the dissenters in your State Supreme Court referred to Aldridge."
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2144.359,2144.825,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-5139,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2144.825,2146.606,Which is not a constitutional decision?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2146.606,2148.143,That’s correct.
1972.71-5139,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2148.143,2157.555,"Of course, if you turn to page 101 of the record at the very bottom there and majority made by Judge Littlejohn."
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2157.555,2159.611,"No, I guess that was the continuance -- I am sorry, I withdraw it."
1972.71-5139,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2159.611,2160.746,That’s a different issue.
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2160.746,2160.883,That was a continuance.
1972.71-5139,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2160.883,2161.73,That’s Powell against Alabama.
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2161.73,2168.067,Yes.
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2179.789,2184.536,What’s your definition of the word “impartial?”
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2184.536,2199.211,"A situation in a way such partiality if it does exist is not interfered with the rendering of a trial based upon the facts and evidences as presented with no outside influencing factors, Your Honor."
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2199.211,2201.678,But you could have a bias?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2201.678,2205.245,I think everyone possesses some bias of some type no matter how slight or how --
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2205.245,2210.313,Do you think the juror has a bias against a particular group of people and could give an impartial trial?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2210.313,2213.81,"I think that would be an undue assumption, Your Honor."
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2213.81,2216.697,"But you can’t ask it, can you?"
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2216.697,2220.843,I can’t state that what bias exist in anyone.
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2224.108,2227.55,And you don’t think anybody is entitled to try to find out?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2227.55,2229.818,"I think that they are entitled to find out, Your Honor."
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2229.818,2233.018,How could you find out without questions?
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2233.018,2235.009,There is no way you could find out that way.
1972.71-5139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2235.009,2235.818,Thank you.
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2235.818,2243.729,"However, there must be some ground where I believe about the prior to the submitting of the questions to the jurors."
1972.71-5139,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2243.729,2262.727,"I take it that your position is that the questions that were asked in this case were sufficient to flush out any part of prejudice, you pointed out that several jurors did respond that they could not be fair, they were then excused."
1972.71-5139,1,43216,timothy_g_quinn,,2262.727,2285.693,"That’s correct Your Honor, I think that the general questions asked did encompass specific question sought absent some showing that the specific questions might elicit some bias or prejudice and the suspicion that somebody’s prejudice must have some grounds for that."
1972.71-5139,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2409.302,2410.21,Thank you Mr. Quinn.
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2415.335,2422.886,I would like to first address myself to the point derived by Mr. Justice Stewart with respect to whether the issue was properly presented below.
1972.71-5139,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2480.355,2487.167,"What I gather Mr. Shapiro, in the Supreme Court of South Carolina that you first -- that constitutional question was first raised, is it?"
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2487.167,2491.448,"That it was explicitly raised in this fashion, yes that’s correct."
1972.71-5139,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2529.712,2545.279,"As Justice Rehnquist implicitly pointed out in dealing with the motion for a continuance, the South Carolina Supreme Court explicitly did deal with it as a constitutional question citing Powell against Alabama and so on."
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2555.806,2565.653,"Frankly, I think it’s without rhyme and reason, the issues which the South Carolina Supreme Court shows to refer to in federal constitutional term."
1972.71-5139,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2598.837,2623.685,"Mr. Shapiro I think under our cases, in order to successfully raise something in the State Supreme Court that hasn’t been raised in the trial court if the ordinary state rule is that you must first raise it in the State Trial Court, don’t you have to show that the Supreme Court of the State passed on the question even though it didn’t have to and then you can bring it here?"
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2623.685,2634.739,"We think that under South Carolina law, the issue was presented sufficiently in this case to present the constitutional issue in the South Carolina Supreme Court."
1972.71-5139,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2634.739,2642.419,You mean South Carolina doesn’t have any rule of say practice that one must make a constitutional objection at ones earliest opportunity?
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2642.419,2643.292,No.
1972.71-5139,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2644.285,2646.154,What you rely on for that?
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2646.154,2668.353,"Well, only the South Carolina decisions which we have cited again in our reply brief on certiorari cases such as State versus Brown 240 South Carolina 357 126 Southeast 2d. Several other cases dealing with voir dire question."
1972.71-5139,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2677.646,2679.696,Adequately raised as a matter of constitutional --
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2679.696,2684.302,As a matter of state law and as a matter of Constitution.
1972.71-5139,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2703.4,2712.293,But it’s true but one could raise a voir dire question in the South Carolina courts either as a matter of state law or as a matter of constitutional law.
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2727.366,2751.175,"We think that the cases are mentioned to the Court indicate that under South Carolina law, a request that certain questions be asked in order to insure an impartial jury raises the question as far as South Carolina is concerned under both state and federal terms and no additional statement is necessary."
1972.71-5139,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2751.175,2753.468,But where are those cases cited?
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2753.468,2760.131,They are cited in our reply brief on the cert petition.
1972.71-5139,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2760.131,2762.54,"Well I don’t seem to have that both if you file it, we can find it."
1972.71-5139,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2763.57,2764.815,"Mr. Shapiro, may I ask you."
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2770.729,2775.876,"Well, we think that it certainly has constitutional dimension."
1972.71-5139,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2786.738,2790.884,Except that it dealt with the District of Columbia statute.
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2790.884,2793.175,It dealt with a case coming up under that.
1972.71-5139,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2793.175,2797.456,That Justice McReynolds dissent was addressed only to the --
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2797.456,2798.723,Right.
1972.71-5139,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2814.259,2821.377,"Well, I suppose your argument is anyway -- I told you it’s not a constitutional decision. Something like it and it will now be the constitutional rule."
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2821.377,2836.943,"I think so, and I think that this Court indicated it as much in Swain versus Alabama where the Court stated that the fairness of trial by jury requires that the influence of race on jurors be explored."
1972.71-5139,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2836.943,2850.586,"Mr. Shapiro, if you are pressing as I assume you are the pretrial publicity issue, I’m a little surprised that you didn’t put in your appendix, what these newspaper articles contain."
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2854.132,2860.596,The newspaper articles as far as I know are not in the trial record.
1972.71-5139,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2861.116,2872.472,Shouldn’t they be if we are going to put the situation in context and determine whether these questions were necessary?
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2872.472,2882.685,I think that the issue which we’re not posing is not -- that we’re posing is not whether or not there was such a pretrial publicity as to deny a fair trial.
1972.71-5139,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2894.994,2901.918,"Well doesn’t the content of that publicity, the substance of it govern the answer to that?"
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2901.918,2923.611,"Not necessarily, we think that for example a juror might be prejudice by publicity which didn’t rise to the -- to such as would -- under to this Court’s decision that deprived him of a fair trial if that juror has said."
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2926.886,2933.288,Well all I see from this record is that there was a newspaper articles about something.
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2933.288,2943.302,The newspaper articles as counsel pointed out into the trial judge dealt extensively with the problems relating to drug crimes --
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2943.302,2945.711,But where do I get that information from?
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2945.711,2949.828,Well only from counsel statement that --
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2949.828,2955.379,Well that didn’t give me anything except that they were -- the names at the newspaper.
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2957.424,2959.112,Well I think counsel only referred to the fact that --
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2959.112,2968.637,I didn’t hear from another clipping which refers to a recent television program and an editor.
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2968.637,2970.184,And the question --
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2970.184,2971.144,Okay.
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2971.144,2973.229,The question on page 36 --
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2973.229,2974.704,36?
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2974.704,2987.53,"Have you -- that he requested that the judge asked stated, have you heard or read about recent newspaper articles to the effect that the local drug problem --"
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2987.53,2988.799,Where is that now?
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2988.799,2991.317,It’s on page 36 of the appendix in --
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2991.317,2992.826,Where do we start in that?
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2992.826,2994.109,Proposed question number 4.
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2994.109,2996.201,That’s proposed question.
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2996.201,2997.657,That’s correct.
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2997.657,3003.066,"But I mean, where is the recent newspaper article that’s mentioned there?"
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3003.066,3003.991,They’re not in the record.
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3003.991,3006.228,"Well, what good as it does if it’s not in the record?"
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3006.228,3010.554,"Well, I don’t think that it’s any good at this point."
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3010.554,3014.242,"Well what -- how can you sustain that point, that they should be asked this question?"
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3014.242,3023.052,Because our position is not that there was such prejudicial publicity as to deny him a fair trial but rather in view of the showing --
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3023.052,3030.365,But is there anything in this record that shows that there was any publicity on this case?
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3030.365,3035.48,There is nothing in the record that shows that there was any publicity about this specific case.
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3035.48,3040.997,Is there anything in this record that show to any publicity about anything?
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3040.997,3056.287,I think that page 12 indicates that the clippings that the counsel handed to the judge dealt with drug crimes in Florence County.
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3056.287,3057.494,Well where is that?
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3075.805,3092.513,"I think that if you read the proposed question on page 36 in light of that submission of the question, it indicates that the newspaper articles related to the fact that the local drug problem is bagged in the words of counsel."
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3092.513,3095.295,Well do you suggest that I go down and read those newspapers?
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3095.295,3096.029,No.
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3096.029,3097.645,Because I’m telling you I’m not going to do it.
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3097.645,3107.288,We’re suggesting that this was a sufficient showing to at least require the judge to ask whether the juror might have been prejudice because of this.
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3107.288,3117.334,Well wouldn’t the judge first have to ask the question as to whether there were papers with articles which the juror could have read.
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3117.334,3122.931,I think that he had been presented with articles which the jurors could have read.
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3135.116,3136.337,Where is that in the record?
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3136.337,3144.697,Well this is again on page 36 proposed question number 4 which --
1972.71-5139,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3144.697,3151.298,That proposed question has proved that this man tells to appeal on the program?
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3151.298,3161.259,We think that that sufficient showing that there was in fact such a television program and that the chief witness did in fact testify.
1972.71-5139,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3184.615,3197.1,Maybe he thought it was irrelevant because after reading the newspaper articles he thought they were so innocuous so vague that that rendered the whole inquiry irrelevant.
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3197.1,3213.062,"Well, of course the newspaper articles didn’t relate to this television program and we think again that it must be remembered that this motion was -- and his questions were posed the day after petitioner was indicted."
1972.71-5139,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3240.393,3248.546,"Well I understand that the page 12 that he did hand the judge clippings, the clippings he was referring to."
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3248.546,3251.315,I think it’s -- it can be assumed that --
1972.71-5139,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3251.315,3252.752,They just aren’t here though.
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3252.752,3256.247,They are not here and I think that they were not the only clippings.
1972.71-5139,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3286.307,3295.341,"Of course Mr. Shapiro, of the four questions that the judge refused to ask, only one of them had to deal with pretrial publicity."
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3297.381,3298.321,That’s right.
1972.71-5139,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3299.707,3308.97,"So that if you are right about the first three, another pretrial publicity doesn’t really -- isn’t dispositive at all in this case."
1972.71-5139,2,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3308.97,3309.558,That is correct.
1972.71-5139,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3309.558,3312.584,Right.
1972.71-5139,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3312.584,3313.598,Thank you Mr. Shapiro.
