2009.138_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.667,"We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 138 in our original docket, South Carolina v. North Carolina."
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,8.572,18.18,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: South Carolina seeks an equitable apportionment with North Carolina of the Catawba River."
2009.138_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,101.037,105.22,I thought your friends agreed that the New Jersey v. New York standard applied?
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,105.22,118.152,"Your Honor, part of what you will be deciding in this case is the appropriate standard for intervention, and the Special Master, we respectfully submit, did not apply the New Jersey v. New York factors."
2009.138_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.669,211.958,"Mr. Frederick, we -- we had a case involving, what, a tax on -- on oil companies, in which it was a State against State case, but we allowed the oil companies who would pay the tax to intervene."
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,215.144,218.143,"First, the interests were different."
2009.138_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,220.221,222.191,Why does that make any difference?
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,222.191,227.813,--This Court has said for 200 years that water is a unique resource within the sovereign control of States.
2009.138_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,280.776,287.413,"Yes, well, these -- these are rules that we are making up ourselves, right, as to when we are going to allow intervention or not?"
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,300.719,322.197,"I don't think I can recall a case in that factual scenario, but I can point you to Kentucky v. Indiana in 1930, in which this Court rejected Kentucky's attempt to join individual Indiana citizens as parties in an original action over Indiana's alleged breach of a contract to build an interstate bridge."
2009.138_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,322.914,328.194,I understand your basic argument that each State should represent its own constituents.
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,341.703,347.263,"--No, in fact, Mr. Chief Justice, I would submit they have the weakest claim to intervention in this case."
2009.138_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.504,430.01,"Well, except that these -- these three entities are the principal entities that are guilty of interbasin transfers, which is essentially what the -- what the dispute is about."
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,430.01,436.132,--The dispute is about the transfer of water and consumption of water in toto.
2009.138_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.1,441.583,"Well, but the focus -- the focus of the complaint is upon interbasin transfers, isn't it?"
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,441.583,454.655,"--The focus of the complaint highlights interbasin transfers to the extent that they are a large quantifiable amount of water being taken out of the Catawba River, that we submit should not be counted on--"
2009.138_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,454.655,455.627,Exactly.
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,473.337,473.868,--No.
2009.138_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,473.868,474.835,Why not?
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,474.835,483.457,"Because in an equitable apportionment case, this Court decides which share of the water is allocable to each State."
2009.138_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.686,492.781,"I understand that, but I'm talking about the real world."
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,507.416,522.05,"--We take the real world, Your Honor, as this Court's cases direct us, and those cases tell us that in situations where the Court is deciding an equitable apportionment between two States -- water, of course, is fungible."
2009.138_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.064,566.329,Are you--
2009.138_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,566.329,590.163,"Mr. Frederick, if this were an ordinary civil case, we would be guided by the rule on permissive intervention, and appellate courts in dealing with that rule give a healthy measure of respect to the trial judge's determination."
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,613.701,615.623,"No, for several reasons, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.138_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,658.432,665.884,"--But, in fact, we've never rejected a special master's desire to -- to have intervenors in the case."
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,665.884,667.744,"Well, virtually every case, Justice Scalia--"
2009.138_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.744,668.695,And that oil case that I mentioned.
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,670.177,671.71,--Maryland v. Louisiana.
2009.138_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.71,672.037,--Yes.
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,673.897,676.692,There was actually no special master recommendation in that case.
2009.138_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,719.124,721.249,"Mr. Frederick, can we go back a little?"
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,753.501,763.511,"--And the case that it cited is Oklahoma v. Texas, which is a very unusual case from this Court's docket in the 1920s."
2009.138_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,835.668,843.151,I -- I guess I haven't heard yet an answer to Justice Ginsburg's first question about whether there was a recommendation from the Special Master or not.
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,843.151,850.428,"Well, I -- I will -- I obviously forgot about footnote 21 of the Court's opinion in Maryland v. Louisiana, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.138_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,851.727,872.811,"Counsel, I don't know that you've actually addressed the operative question of what amount of discretion, if any, are we going to give to special masters to determine when they require the presence of a party to do equity, which is what I read the Special Master to be suggesting."
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,906.936,910.156,"--Well, let's start with the original jurisdiction principle."
2009.138_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.672,988.887,"Well, we've -- we've allowed private parties to be impleaded by the States."
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,992.763,994.854,--Not in an equitable apportionment.
2009.138_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.907,1021.266,I don't--
2009.138_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1021.266,1034.589,"I see your light's on, but can we take this case on the assumption that nothing that you obtain in the way of relief will affect Duke Power under the comprehensive relicensing agreement?"
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1034.589,1035.416,Yes--
2009.138_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1035.416,1041.18,Don't we have to take the case on the assumption that their rights under that agreement might be affected?
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1041.18,1046.491,"--They might be affected, but only in an ancillary way."
2009.138_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1056.174,1060.705,But are you saying you are not seeking a result that's inconsistent in any way with that agreement?
2009.138_orig,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1060.705,1069.731,"--Neither the agreement -- and this is at page 51 to 52 of our brief, citing 39 of the CRA -- says it doesn't affect water rights."
2009.138_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1085.49,1086.613,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1093.425,1108.652,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In order to intervene in an original action in this Court, a citizen of a State that is a party to the action must show a compelling interest, separate from that of other citizens, that is not properly represented by the State."
2009.138_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1126.068,1129.394,"It depends on, I suppose, on what you mean by"
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1146.606,1159.24,"Well, I think that the interest that the private party has is a State law property interest in water, and that's an interest that simply isn't at stake in an equitable apportionment action."
2009.138_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1173.903,1184.541,"I think you could say that realistically when you are talking about an individual water user, a small potatoes water user, a normal resident of Charlotte perhaps."
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1192.866,1204.14,"Well, that -- I mean, in New Jersey v. New York, Philadelphia, which sought to intervene in that case, constituted a majority of the water users within the State of Philadelphia."
2009.138_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.14,1207.891,Did the special master think Philadelphia should have been let in?
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1207.891,1210.203,I don't recall what the special master--
2009.138_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1210.203,1211.295,The answer is no.
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1211.295,1213.342,--said in that case.
2009.138_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.952,1247.888,"Yes, but we haven't -- we haven't been sitting there trying to figure out what would facilitate the proceeding."
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1255.368,1256.994,That's right.
2009.138_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1257.899,1263.756,"So to say that they are just -- you know, they are just Joe Dokes is -- is really very unrealistic."
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1263.756,1272.3,"--Well, to the -- I mean, to the extent that they have valuable information to provide, third-party discovery can take account of that, as can amicus participation."
2009.138_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1321.968,1333.663,"Well, if that -- if and when that is the case, the Special Master will not want them to come in, as the vast majority of special masters have not wanted them to come in, in the past."
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1335.227,1360.796,"I -- I guess what I would say is that I don't think that, either in the recommendation of the Special Master in this case or in the submissions of the -- the would-be intervenors, that there's really any logical limiting principle that would not allow, as a matter of routine, large water users to come in to equitable apportionment actions."
2009.138_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1391.266,1396.219,But not reserved exclusively to State -- to suits between a State and another State.
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1402.326,1403.449,--Yes.
2009.138_orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1433.577,1441.653,"Well, here the complaint was South Carolina's complaint, and these are intervenors on North Carolina's -- on North Carolina's side."
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1441.653,1446.399,--That's where they were seeking to intervene on North Carolina's side as defendants.
2009.138_orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1446.933,1457.411,"And as representing the position of the United States, would you address the FERC license that Duke Energy is raising?"
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1457.411,1460.362,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.138_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1508.139,1511.593,"Well, it isn't a matter of infringing on water rights or apportionments."
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1524.213,1555.935,"Well, the -- the nature of this proceeding makes that outcome not -- not something that would happen even if South Carolina were to prevail, because what South Carolina is seeking is to get more water flowing downstream to it, and so the -- the licensing conditions, which generally impose minimum flow requirements at each of the various dams operated by Duke, would be easier to satisfy, not harder to satisfy, if South Carolina were -- had an entitlement to get even more water flowing through--"
2009.138_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1555.935,1559.34,I don't -- I don't understand that.
2009.138_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1559.761,1561.477,What happens to North Carolina if it has less water?
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1564.257,1581.282,"--Well, Duke -- Duke's dams -- the licensing condition is that each dam allow a certain amount of water to flow through, under the current license that they are operating under, and there are different minimum flow requirements under the renewal license that is being sought."
2009.138_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1590.933,1592.4,"Well, why--"
2009.138_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1592.4,1595.337,"And why isn't Duke Power -- why isn't Duke Power on the other side, then?"
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1595.337,1598.038,"--I mean, I--"
2009.138_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1598.038,1599.368,They have smart lawyers.
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1599.368,1608.8,"--Well, they -- I mean, one possibility is, of course, that Duke is -- in addition to obviously being an operator of dams, Duke is a very large consumer of water."
2009.138_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1618.999,1635.555,"--Well, it may also mean it when it has to increase the outflow, the level of its impoundments reduces, and that may affect its ability to generate power, which in turn may -- may affect its license."
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1635.555,1642.661,--It -- it may have some effect on its ability to -- to generate power.
2009.138_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.407,1690.328,"Mr. Miller, if I -- if I understood your argument, you are saying that Duke's interests are really with South Carolina, or -- to increase the flow."
2009.138_orig,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1702.729,1711.257,"--As I said, Duke is an operator of thermal power plants that are large consumers of water, and some of those are located in North Carolina."
2009.138_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1711.257,1712.911,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,1719.208,1731.358,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Special Master correctly concluded that Charlotte, Duke, and the Catawba River Water Supply Project should intervene in this original action."
2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1741.416,1743.494,This is our original jurisdiction.
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,1757.677,1769.593,"Our claim is not that the Special Master should get deference on legal questions, but she should get deference on -- on the narrow question of whether it would be helpful to her to have these intervenors in the case."
2009.138_orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1770.264,1773.856,But tell me what she said that makes them helpful.
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,1780.15,1794.613,"--Well, she pointed out, for example, that Duke Energy, which controls the flow of this river and is participating in the FERC proceedings, would establish a -- a direct link between this adjudication and what's going on before the FERC."
2009.138_orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1800.045,1806.873,"Well, your adversary has just said none, according to the terms of the license and what the FERC has said."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,1811.337,1812.383,"--Oh, I think--"
2009.138_orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1812.383,1813.791,--at face value?
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,1813.791,1823.816,"--I think FERC has not said that there will be no effect, that there would be no effect upon the licensing proceeding from the original action."
2009.138_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1830.987,1839.626,"Yes, I think all FERC said is -- is that nothing in its license would -- would require allocation of water by -- by North Carolina."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,1852.883,1862.971,"Well, Duke of course pulled together 69 other stakeholders to join the comprehensive relicensing agreement to -- to smooth FERC's acceptance of -- of the new license."
2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1883.199,1884.556,"Counsel, let me tell you what I'm very worried about."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,1904.189,1913.233,"Mr. Chief Justice, private parties and cities have intervened in the past in original actions and have been named as defendants in original actions."
2009.138_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1913.233,1934.566,"But even in the New Jersey v. New York decision, the dissenters there that would have allowed the intervention did say that in general it is unwise to encumber original jurisdiction cases with non-State parties."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,1990.462,2004.173,"Well, in -- Justice Ginsburg, in the case of New Jersey v. New York, New York City was a party defendant, and in this case the City of Charlotte occupies the exact same position as New York City."
2009.138_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2004.173,2007.015,That's because the State chose to sue it as a party defendant.
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2007.015,2011.718,"It did, but of course a State can only sue a proper party defendant."
2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2023.104,2030.256,"You're -- all of the intervenors, prospective intervenors, they want to make sure North Carolina doesn't lose water, right?"
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2030.256,2033.863,That -- that is not their exclusive interest.
2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2033.863,2036.831,"Well, their -- well, they want to reduce South Carolina's claim on the water."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2036.831,2037.256,No.
2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2050.03,2056.87,"Well -- to the extent they have differing interests, why aren't those interests fully satisfied by amicus participation?"
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2056.87,2068.413,"Well, when -- when South Carolina first opposed, for example, Charlotte's motion to intervene, it said: Oh, Charlotte, you can file an amicus brief as to any dispositive motion."
2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2077.488,2081.766,"Shape the record, but intervention status would give you the right to appeal, right?"
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2081.766,2085.451,It would allow us to seek leave to file exceptions to an--
2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2085.451,2087.202,"Right, and appeal the normal case."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2087.202,2087.81,--Yes.
2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2087.81,2088.512,"Well, that's my question."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2107.49,2119.75,"Well, let me say two things, Mr. Chief Justice: If the proposed decree affects the interests of Charlotte or the joint venture or Duke, I think they ought to be allowed to file exceptions, which this Court can grant leave or not."
2009.138_orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2123.326,2131.448,So how does that get us to avoid involvement in interstate -- intrastate disputes over water use?
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2135.726,2148.505,"--Well, South Carolina and the United States present this vision of an equitable apportionment action in which the Special Master simply divides up the flow of the river, and then it's up to each State to subdivide among its users."
2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2181.896,2188.394,"And North Carolina, as a sovereign State, can represent the interests of its constituents as it sees fit."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2204.436,2211.946,"--Well, as to Duke -- Mr. Chief Justice, I have explained, Duke's interest is not in maximizing the share -- North Carolina's share of the river."
2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2229.019,2229.596,"Well, then that's--"
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2244.321,2249.66,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think this -- this is not a novel proposition."
2009.138_orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2268.996,2282.879,"You are advocating a rule that says, almost, you have a right to intervene because you have an interest that won't be adequately represented."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2282.879,2283.492,--We--
2009.138_orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2283.492,2284.756,Is that your position?
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2297.639,2316.508,"--We are saying that the Special Master got it right, when she said that you have to show a compelling interest that's not properly represented by a party State, and she applied the New Jersey v. New York test, finding, at page 27 of her report, that neither Charlotte nor the joint venture are properly represented."
2009.138_orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2316.508,2330.988,"So you see the issue before us as being was she right or wrong, even though Nevada said -- I'm sorry -- that North Carolina said that it was going to adequately represent each of these interests, but that just wasn't correct?"
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2330.988,2331.908,I think the question is--
2009.138_orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2331.908,2333.94,That North Carolina is not telling us the truth?
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2333.94,2338.795,"--I think the question is, should the Court accept the Special Master's recommendation?"
2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2351.416,2352.242,You don't--
2009.138_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2352.242,2357.913,The intervenors -- the intervenors are users of the water from the river?
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2357.913,2358.989,But not mere users.
2009.138_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2372.658,2375.406,They -- because they use a lot of water.
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2398.207,2405.846,"Certainly, our position is not that mere users of water or all users of water may intervene in original action."
2009.138_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.406,2414.483,And is it automatic then?
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2423.432,2424.961,"No, Justice Scalia."
2009.138_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2437.88,2442.75,"And, also, how helpful the intervention will be to the management of the case."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2442.75,2443.16,--Correct.
2009.138_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.081,2446.752,"And, of course, the Special Master's determination of that is not final."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2448.172,2449.47,--That's correct.
2009.138_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2449.47,2452.765,"But it is a discretionary intervention you are arguing for, not a mandatory one."

2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2468.819,2469.899,"--Well, what's special about it?"
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2482.83,2492.434,"--Well, Charlotte has special status because South Carolina seeks specific relief -- injunctive relief -- against Charlotte's interbasin transfer."
2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2492.434,2497.808,"Well, and that relief will affect how much water is available for me to draw out and use on my farm."

Indiana, which is that, if a plaintiff or plaintiff State in an original action is seeking relief against a citizen of a State, that citizen ought to have an opportunity to come into the litigation and defend its interests."
2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2551.706,2559.423,"Well, let's say the interest -- the dispute is really in effect between company ABC in North Carolina and company XYZ in South Carolina."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2564.158,2565.577,"No -- well, of course--"
2009.138_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2565.577,2572.511,"Do we let them just use the States as, you know, a façade to get into this Court and have their dispute adjudicated here?"
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2572.511,2572.823,--No.
2009.138_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2618.541,2632.283,"Do you think the same -- the same test applies to the appropriateness of naming a private party defendant, as you would urge for intervention by a private party defendant?"
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2632.283,2632.802,--Yes.
2009.138_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2655.01,2661.896,May I ask this question: In what respect does the relief sought against the city differ from the relief sought against the State?

2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2714.282,2727.264,"I think it would not be surprising if she came down -- if she were to come down with a decree, it would not be surprising that -- that it would decide whether or not to allow Charlotte's interbasin transfers to continue."
2009.138_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2745.1,2761.559,"Well, in -- in deciding what's equitable as between the two States, I guess the -- the Court, ultimately, and the Special Master, initially, will have to decide what uses of water by one State or the other are not equitable uses--"

2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2823.768,2828.034,"I don't think I have done that math, Justice Breyer."
2009.138_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2828.034,2828.534,"Well, about."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2828.534,2829.345,Yes.
2009.138_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2836.262,2836.968,Out of what?
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2836.968,2851.369,"Well, the flow of the River -- the minimum flow of the river, under the -- under the CRA is 1100 cubic feet per second, so unfortunately you'd have to -- you'd have to convert from cfs to--"
2009.138_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2851.369,2855.6,"Well, I mean, do they account for, like -- there's a certain amount of water in dispute."
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2868.39,2870.437,"--Well, I -- it's a significant proportion."
2009.138_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2870.437,2870.921,You must have some idea.
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2870.921,2872.142,It's a significant proportion.
2009.138_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2872.844,2877.059,"Well, significant -- is that more like 3 percent, or is it more like 90 percent?"
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2880.182,2883.852,"--Well, I haven't done that calculation."
2009.138_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2890.009,2892.867,And I guess it depends on what you mean by the water in dispute.

2009.138_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2916.62,2916.932,Okay.
2009.138_orig,2,26568,h_christopher_bartolomucci,,2916.932,2917.681,--being carried out.
2009.138_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2917.681,2923.804,"So insofar -- so insofar as what they are after is interbasin transfers, just what Justice Scalia said is correct."

2009.138_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3020.561,3025.135,Did -- did the decree only apply to taxing these particular companies?
2009.138_orig,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3028.606,3035.93,"Yes, Your Honor, as the Plaintiff States were seeking to attack the Louisiana tax at issue."
2009.138_orig,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3039.069,3041.975,"As -- as the allocation would in this case, presumably."
2009.138_orig,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3041.975,3044.396,"Well, I don't -- and that question--"
2009.138_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3044.396,3044.849,Is that yes or no?
2009.138_orig,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3046.988,3048.033,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.138_orig,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3090.924,3091.439,"Well, how is just this involved?"
2009.138_orig,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3106.678,3109.896,"--Your Honor, there are -- there are very few interbasin transfers."
2009.138_orig,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3109.896,3111.69,I -- that's not my question.
2009.138_orig,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3111.69,3111.986,Yes.

2009.138_orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3410.565,3413.735,Are you prepared to say the same thing with respect to your city?
2009.138_orig,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3413.735,3415.092,--With respect--
2009.138_orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3415.092,3418.497,And to your -- and to the CRWSP?
2009.138_orig,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3418.497,3425.105,"--With respect to the city, we have said in our briefs that we will defend this interbasin transfer."
2009.138_orig,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3453.39,3462.9,"Well, if it's an attack on -- if it's an attack on Charlotte, I would expect the State to be standing there protecting it and not feel that they can't do that without Charlotte, itself, coming into the case."
2009.138_orig,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3462.9,3476.256,"Your Honor, we will defend this interbasin transfer, but the fact of the matter is injunctive relief is sought as against Charlotte, and there is something to be said for fairness in allowing that entity to be present in this Court."
2009.138_orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3476.256,3476.724,Are you--
2009.138_orig,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3476.724,3477.472,"Now, turning--"
2009.138_orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3477.472,3482.44,--Are you prepared to say that you are not adequately defending the interest of the CRWSP?
2009.138_orig,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3482.44,3485.408,"--Correct, Your Honor, that that is an interstate entity."
2009.138_orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3496.311,3497.902,You haven't answered my question.
2009.138_orig,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3500.262,3501.057,--Yes.
2009.138_orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3501.903,3502.325,--them.
2009.138_orig,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3506.228,3508.588,--We -- we cannot represent the interests of the joint venture.
2009.138_orig,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3535.638,3548.101,Let's go back to the question of couldn't the Special Master receive the information she wants if these three entities come in as amici?
2009.138_orig,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3567.45,3573.701,"Your Honor, if that were the -- the standard, there would never be intervention motions in any of these proceedings."
2009.138_orig,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3594.973,3595.504,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.138_orig,4,20869,david_c_frederick,,3597.458,3600.269,"I have four points, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.138_orig,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3600.846,3608.153,"Tell me, are you seeking injunctive relief out of any of the three intervenors?"
2009.138_orig,4,20869,david_c_frederick,,3608.153,3608.621,--No.
2009.138_orig,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3667.96,3671.568,But it affects the agreement on which the license is based.
2009.138_orig,4,20869,david_c_frederick,,3677.721,3680.033,"The license hasn't been issued, Justice Scalia."
2009.138_orig,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3688.089,3697.32,"Are you willing to concede that if whatever you ask for here affects that license, once its issued, that then Duke's intervention is proper?"
2009.138_orig,4,20869,david_c_frederick,,3697.32,3704.756,"--No, because the United States can enter -- can affect the interests and represent the interests of its licensees."
2009.138_orig,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3715.905,3721.839,I thought Duke said the problem is not the United States -- so much the United States granting a license.
2009.138_orig,4,20869,david_c_frederick,,3734.036,3749.576,"The agreement is a private contract among various water users, and it is no different than the fact that all users of this river will be affected, one way or the other, by whatever decree this Court issues, whether they are on the South Carolina side or the North Carolina side."
2009.138_orig,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3749.576,3750.766,"Thank you, counsel."
