1971.71-404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.867,"We will hear arguments next in 71-404, Colten against Kentucky."
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,42.858,44.147,Thank you.
1971.71-404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,196.17,198.409,And what was the increased penalty?
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,198.409,206.274,"In his case, it was a five-fold increase in a monetary penalty and increase from a $10 fine to a $50 fine."
1971.71-404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,248.513,252.067,"Mr. Goldman, it may of no significance."
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,257.177,267.666,"In the particular court in which Mr. Colten and Mr. Bell were tried, the court commissioner is a lawyer."
1971.71-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,312.914,315.112,(Inaudible) county Lexington?
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,315.112,318.43,Fayette County is the county in which Lexington is situated.
1971.71-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.43,322.107,Are transcript kept of these lower court trials.
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,322.107,322.896,"No, they are not."
1971.71-404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,420.745,436.789,"Mr. Goldman, I gather from either the respondent's contention or yours that one can even plead guilty in the quarter sessions or at an appeal to the court of general jurisdiction and obtain a trial de novo, is that correct?"
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,436.789,440.226,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,497.154,502.153,"But in this case, your client did not plead guilty in the Quarterly court, did he?"
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,502.153,502.685,"No, Your Honor."
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,502.685,504.98,"If he is not guilty, did he had a lawyer."
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,504.98,505.751,He had a lawyer.
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,505.751,506.729,At the Quarterly Court?
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,506.729,508.782,He had a lawyer at the Quarterly Court.
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,508.782,511.138,Was he a college student?
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,511.138,514.336,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, he was a college student."
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,514.336,516.046,Locally there in Lexington?
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,516.046,527.849,Locally at the University of Kentucky and counsel was provided for him -- voluntary counsel through the American Civil Liberties Union.
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,527.849,532.212,Did the same witnesses testify at both trials?
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,532.212,561.923,"My understanding is that there were few witnesses at Quarterly Court, I was counsel in the trial de novo at Circuit Court that there was one witness, it's my understanding -- my recollection my co-counsel telling me that appeared at the Quarterly Court that did not appear, police officer who testified at the Quarterly Court who did not testify at the Circuit Court."
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,566.002,570.672,How long did it take you to try the case in the Circuit Court?
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,570.672,573.724,The equivalent of approximately one day.
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,573.724,581.521,How long did it take in Quarterly Court in this case?
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,581.521,587.663,I don't think I can answer that question with sufficient confidence.
1971.71-404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.935,613.259,Can you get a jury in Quarterly Court?
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,613.259,619.439,"You can, the Kentucky Constitution provides for a six member jury."
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,656.702,660.237,Your client didn't ask for a jury trial in the court?
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,660.237,690.497,"No Your Honor, he did not ask for a jury trial and the reason for that is that my client is a young man who at that time had quite long hair, rather long mustache and as the trial judge in Circuit Court remarked in words or fact, he dresses in the sort of way that's different from the general way which we are used to seeing people dress."
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,704.862,708.394,You didn't ask for a jury trial in the Court of General Jurisdiction either?
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,708.394,718.214,"No, and I might point out that the way the procedure is set up, when you go to Quarterly Court, you have to affirmatively request a jury trial."
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,750.593,758.098,Did the Bell case arise from this from events occurring on the same day of Mrs. Nixon's visit to the place.
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,758.098,774.574,"No, Mr. Justice Stewart, the Bell case rose about 60 days later as in relation to a campus demonstration connected with the Cambodian incidence."
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,774.574,775.787,At the University of Kentucky?
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,775.787,777.48,It was at the University of Kentucky.
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,815.74,822.95,"Well, we need to go further than the Bell case and in any event, it didn't arise from anything related to these events."
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,822.95,824.575,"No, it did not."
1971.71-404,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,824.575,833.222,"Can you tell Mr. Goldman, in Kentucky may a jury in the Circuit Court determine the sentence as well as guilts?"
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,833.222,841.579,"The jury does determine the sentence as well as guilt in Kentucky, within the statutory limits."
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1074.442,1086.542,"Did the evidence show that except for the police officers, most of the members of the crowd or group were the same people, who had been whooping and hollering party out at the airport?"
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,1086.542,1091.275,"No, the evidence only show that they were people who are out at the airport."
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1109.49,1111.277,So it was not a regathering of the same group.
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,1111.277,1112.382,"No it was not, Your Honor."
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1117.311,1120.779,"Mr. Mendez, had he been a member of the group?"
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,1120.779,1126.006,"It's not clear in the record Mr. Mendez and Mr. Colten knew each other but where Mr. Mendez is, it's not --"
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1126.006,1126.619,And that's all we know from the record.
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,1126.619,1129.179,That's not revealed in the record.
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1266.747,1269.668,Who had been following Mrs. Nixon around the police officers or --?
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,1269.668,1274.977,"Well, both the police officers and these individuals who had been out at the airport."
1971.71-404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1353.883,1360.665,I thought he had to do go back into the Gomez's car in order to do it.
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,1360.665,1369.354,"He testified that he went back to his own patrol car, closed the window and proceeded to issue the citation."
1971.71-404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1492.336,1502.501,"Haven't record sometimes said, there is a constitutional right to privacy, and the right to be let alone, a right not to be harassed?"
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,1502.501,1512.685,"Yes, when there is such a constitutional right to be balanced against the constitutional rights of assembling an expression, those rights have to be balanced."
1971.71-404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1520.803,1533.399,"I wasn't thinking of the police officer, I was thinking about what you called overtly ignoring someone by following him around all day."
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,1533.399,1537.357,"Well, Mrs. Nixon, following of Mrs. Nixon --"
1971.71-404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1537.357,1539.164,Does it make any difference who it is?
1971.71-404,0,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,1539.164,1542.987,"I think it does Your Honor, and I think it makes the difference what an individual is doing."
1971.71-404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1581.134,1587.13,"Very well, Mr. Goldman, Mr. Willmott."
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1587.13,1591.616,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1611.072,1614.145,He was a state police officer or county or city?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1614.145,1616.923,"State police, all the officers involved in the --"
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1616.923,1617.923,Highway patrol?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1617.923,1620.148,"Yes, sir, captain state police."
1971.71-404,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1777.39,1784.034,Does the record show the width of the road and the width of the shoulders?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1784.034,1789.448,I think that the gravel portion of the shoulder was estimated at two feet.
1971.71-404,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1795.259,1802.35,Was there fence beside the shoulder where these cars were parked?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1802.35,1806.217,"Yes Your Honor, immediately to the right."
1971.71-404,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1820.939,1828.316,"Had this been to the black top to the fence or from the edge of the shoulder to the fence, what does the record show?"
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1828.316,1839.177,"I don't think the record shows a distance, a firm distance and the only thing I can give is an approximation from my own recollection."
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1839.177,1844.937,"Well, as I understand the car was pulled off the road, right?"
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1844.937,1845.538,Yes Your Honor.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1845.538,1848.412,And the State Trooper was behind him.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1848.412,1849.347,Off the road.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1849.347,1853.081,And did the other cars come behind the state trooper?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1853.081,1853.636,Well there is testimony.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1853.636,1855.621,"Well, where was Colten's car?"
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1855.621,1856.051,Pardon.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1856.051,1857.248,Were was Colten's car?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1857.248,1861.704,Colten stopped his car off the road behind trooper Miller's car.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1870.296,1875.632,"My whole point was, at the time the Captain came up, who was in the road?"
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1875.632,1880.503,Colten was standing in the road while talking to trooper Miller.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1886.311,1889.028,"Well he wasn't blocking the road, was he?"
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1889.028,1900.99,"There is disputed testimony, his testimony is that he was standing by the right front fender and the officers testified that he was variously in the road and off the road and walking around the car."
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1900.99,1904.04,"Well, if it's two lane road, it's pretty hard for one person to block it."
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1909.801,1912.349,"Where were those cars, that's what I was trying to get to you?"
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1912.349,1921.131,Well they parked off the shoulder and in front of Mendez's car and behind the police cars had stopped -- three more police cars.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1921.131,1923.134,So they weren't in the roadway?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1923.134,1924.277,No Your Honor.
1971.71-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1924.507,1926.468,Then what was blocking the roadway?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1926.468,1928.151,The police cars were in the roadway.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1928.151,1930.333,And that's all was blocking it.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1930.333,1933.36,That and the crowd was in the roadway.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1933.36,1934.5,"Crowd, how many people?"
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1936.177,1941.318,"Well, it was 15, approximately 12 to 15 to 18 people."
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1941.318,1944.856,And they were scattered all over the road?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1944.856,1951.818,"The testimony, depending on which side you look at it, puts them in the roadway or on the right side of the car, some of them still in the cars."
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1951.818,1958.747,But the captain didn't find any fault when until he asked the lieutenant what's going on?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1958.747,1959.86,"Well, the --"
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1959.86,1965.084,And the lieutenant told that man there is what my trouble is and then he got arrested.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1965.863,1967.283,"No, no Your Honor."
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1967.283,1968.172,"Well, correct me."
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,1968.172,1978.914,"The trooper Miller had his light flashing, he had a person sitting in the car, there was car in front of him, a car in behind of him, Captain Mayes got out of his car and asked him, what's going on."
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2003.421,2005.93,Then how did Colten get arrested?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2005.93,2023.218,"Well after Captain Mayes told the crowd some four or five times to please leave, trooper Brown got at, was third state policeman in line, he got out and asked Colten two times to leave and he kept telling him, I am going to stay around and see what happens."
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2043.423,2046.348,Why did he grab him with the arm?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2046.348,2049.635,I don't personally know why he grabbed him by the arm.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2049.635,2055.824,"He denied, that he stand him up against the fence."
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2055.824,2057.989,I don't think he denied it.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2057.989,2061.168,"Well, what right did he have to do that?"
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2061.168,2063.065,I don't know that he hit him Your Honor.
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2077.487,2084.572,"Whether or not Colten was mistreated that day by the police, has no bearing on the issues in this case, does he?"
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2084.572,2085.839,No Your Honor.
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2085.839,2088.469,That is after the arrest.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2088.469,2107.943,"And I think that in this case where we have got to apply the standards of vagueness and over breadth to the actual facts and appellant has made much of the fact that he feels his speech, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly was tightened."
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2285.86,2288.948,That 12 to 18 people include the policeman?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2288.948,2290.278,No Your Honor.
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2305.485,2311.504,How many cars does the record show had pulled up and stopped on the shoulder of the road?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2311.504,2331.795,"The defense or the civilian cars were estimated between 6 and 10 and there were three state police vehicles and there has to have been a county police vehicle because it was a county police (Inaudible), now that one came up later."
1971.71-404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.159,2391.07,So are you going to argue the Pearce point increased sentence?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2391.07,2393.668,Yes Your Honor.
1971.71-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2393.668,2407.72,"Before you leave the facts, was this a road which at that time was being used for access to the airport by people who wanted to get there or was it only used for people leaving the airport?"
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2407.72,2421.381,"Serves both, it is an entrance and an exit from the airport and other than a road that winds through a park going out the back way, it's the only entrance to the Lexington Blue Grass Airport."
1971.71-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2421.381,2430.023,"The record show anything about the volume of the traffic in that airport, the frequency of people coming to catch an airplane."
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2430.023,2436.473,"No Your Honor, there is no testimony to that effect."
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2502.985,2509.29,"(Inaudible) to show where Mr. Colten was standing when he was arrested, is that?"
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2509.29,2518.231,"Yes Your Honor, when he was physically placed under arrest he was on the right side of the cars that had pulled off the road."
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2518.231,2521.987,"He wasn't on, well how did he get to the fence?"
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2521.987,2525.473,Your honor he wandered all over.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2525.473,2528.906,When he was told to move and disperse?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2528.906,2532.196,"By which officer Your Honor, he was told by --"
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2532.196,2535.603,"Officer who arrested him, he was obeying his orders."
1971.71-404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.603,2538.312,He was told several times to move wasn't he.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2538.312,2538.916,Ten times.
1971.71-404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.916,2539.328,Right.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2539.328,2539.805,At least ten times.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2539.805,2549.508,But I am interested in the officer who arrested him for not disobeying his order to move from what place.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2549.508,2555.081,I believe the record will show that he was standing at the right rear fender of the Mendez vehicle.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2555.081,2556.939,Was that on or off the road?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2556.939,2558.912,The Mendez vehicle was off the road.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2558.912,2560.74,"Where was he, off the road?"
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2560.74,2565.13,"He was standing by the right rear fender of the car, the car was off the road."
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2565.13,2566.351,So he was off the road.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2566.351,2566.936,Yes Your Honor.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2566.936,2569.024,So he wasn't blocking traffic.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2569.024,2576.499,"No sir, he wasn't out in the street at the time trooper Harlow arrested him."
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2576.499,2579.759,And he was arrested for not dispersing.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2579.759,2580.317,Yes Your Honor.
1971.71-404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2580.317,2589.315,Rather he was convicted because the judge says specifically was convicting him for refusing to comply with the lawful order of the police to disperse.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2589.315,2590.182,Yes Your Honor.
1971.71-404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.182,2598.964,"I take it under Kentucky law, a refusal to disperse following any of those instructions where it supported a conviction."
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2598.964,2608.28,I think it would Your Honor.
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2663.434,2667.936,Is there a transcript of the proceedings in the Quarterly Court here?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2667.936,2668.621,No Your Honor.
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2668.621,2670.38,Just the transcript above.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2675.67,2682.466,"I think it was more thorough in the Circuit Court, I think there were more witnesses other than the fact that I think."
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2682.466,2686.518,And ordinarily I take that Quarterly Court proceedings are not transcribed.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2686.518,2690.687,No Your Honor you must bring your own (Inaudible) in if you wish to transcript.
1971.71-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2690.687,2694.849,"I suppose if it's $10 fine, not very many people do that."
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2694.849,2696.064,No Your Honor.
1971.71-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2696.064,2697.306,"That is the fine here, $10."
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2697.306,2700.922,$10 in the Quarterly court.
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2705.652,2712.493,"Can I ask one more question, I take it -- the Circuit Court is actually a Upper Court."
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2712.493,2713.698,Yes Your Honor.
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2713.698,2717.866,"I take it, now the court knew, this was a trial without a jury wasn't it."
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2722.336,2728.822,"I am sure they did, Mrs. Wilson in her closing argument mentioned the $10 fine in the Lower Court."
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2733.147,2737.737,He didn't say why he chose to pose of $50 rather than $10 fine.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2737.737,2744.49,"No Your Honor, there is no explanation of why he increased it from 10 to $50."
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2744.49,2757.4,"Now with this advice, before you can do that, you do have to -- judge does have to say why he has done it and within the limits of circumstances under which he may make the increase."
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2757.4,2764.875,And I think that is to show if there is a lack of any vindictiveness or that he is applying a penalty for the --
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2764.875,2770.082,Why don't think that same requirements apply in these case.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2770.082,2775.003,Because I think this is a whole new ball game.
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2782.861,2787.909,Or he could just plea guilty without saying even that and yet get a trial de novo.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2787.909,2810.227,"Right and he could all for mitigating circumstances and receive a suspended sentence and to require the Circuit Court to try a man later on the same case on a not a guilty plea and then be unable to impose any punishment whatsoever, defeats the whole purpose of the trial de novo system."
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2810.227,2812.617,What's the maximum that could have been imposed?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2812.617,2815.243,Six months and $500.
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2815.243,2817.985,And that's what happened in this other case.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2817.985,2830.134,Bell case; I am not familiar with that other than I have seen the brief in the case.
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2830.134,2835.345,But I suppose Kentucky wouldn't have been obligated to give him in a constitutional sentence.
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2835.345,2849.451,"In the Circuit Court they would have been banned by the constitution to give him a jury trial, yet, expressly by State Constitution and statute."
1971.71-404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2849.451,2856.349,"They cannot waive the jury and except for the consent of all the parties, isn't that it and the judge?"
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2856.349,2863.6,It must be expressed as a waive from the Circuit Court.
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2959.899,2987.742,"Exactly and yet some states do so provide that a more severe sentence cannot be imposed upon a new trial and told us in a case argued earlier this term that it does not hamper their system, those referred to in petitioner's brief, that is what he is trying to call the attention."
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2987.742,3009.034,"But I think that in a trial de novo system that it is essential that the state and the accused start out at parity, that you are hamstringing the prosecution, if there is a very low fine or a suspended sentence or a probated sentence."
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3031.011,3046.309,What if the courts would take it that (Inaudible) wouldn't apply to petty offenses?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,3046.309,3049.736,I think that that should be a distinguishing characteristic.
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3049.736,3054.345,What would that do in Kentucky?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,3063.088,3064.542,"No, Your Honor."
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3068.779,3077.945,Well are they limited where they may impose punishment to ordinances or statutes which limit to six months?
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,3077.945,3081.358,I think they are limited to below 12 months and --
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3081.358,3086.964,"Below 12, well, that's not quite blindly drawn on petty offenses."
1971.71-404,1,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,3086.964,3088.648,"No, Your Honor."
1971.71-404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3088.648,3097.976,"But I suppose it does with lot of statutes where the penalty is less than six months, the possible penalty."
1971.71-404,2,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,3097.976,3098.74,Yes.
1971.71-404,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3098.74,3110.988,And also suppose whatever the authorized penalty is jailed very often can be meted out in the Quarterly Court?
1971.71-404,3,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,3110.988,3115.976,"In my personal experience, no, not in cases like this."
1971.71-404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3115.976,3120.059,Is jail really a realistic threat in the Quarterly Court?
1971.71-404,3,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,3120.059,3121.356,"No, Your Honor."
1971.71-404,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3130.531,3133.807,This particular statute authorized what a maximum six months?
1971.71-404,3,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,3133.807,3136.822,Six months and $500 fine.
1971.71-404,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3136.822,3138.685,And he could have gotten six months.
1971.71-404,3,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,3138.685,3139.68,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.71-404,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3139.68,3143.783,And you would have said that's alright.
1971.71-404,3,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,3143.783,3148.802,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.71-404,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3196.204,3197.116,Thank you Mr. Willmott.
1971.71-404,4,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,3200.401,3202.278,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.71-404,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3202.278,3227.616,Mr. Willmott has suggested that if the Pearce doctrine is extended to petty cases or is construed as applying to petty cases that it will have a tendency to have these county courts give the maximum sentence in every case so as to avoid any problem.
1971.71-404,4,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,3228.89,3238.853,"I think the experience referred to when the Rice case was argued here indicates the contrary. If that were to be done it would be, of course, self-defeating."
1971.71-404,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3321.607,3323.515,Not jury trial.
1971.71-404,4,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,3323.515,3327.464,"Well, the jury trial in the Quarterly Court is available."
1971.71-404,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3327.464,3330.004,I know but is it constitutionally required?
1971.71-404,4,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,3333.302,3336.542,"Had we asked for the jury trial, it would be."
1971.71-404,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3336.542,3337.669,Under the state constitution.
1971.71-404,4,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,3337.669,3338.553,Under the state constitution.
1971.71-404,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3338.553,3339.499,Not in the federal.
1971.71-404,4,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,3339.499,3341.99,"No, under the state constitution it would be."
1971.71-404,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3341.99,3343.126,But not the federal.
1971.71-404,4,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,3343.126,3350.526,"Under the federal constitution, I think it would be too, though this Court has not yet so held in the cases."
1971.71-404,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3350.526,3352.787,"It's held the opposite, isn't it?"
1971.71-404,4,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,3352.787,3364.647,"This Court has held the opposite, I would hope some day this Court may reconsider that issue, particularly in light of the fact that this Court has now held but a 12 men jury is not necessary."
1971.71-404,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3439.263,3448.285,"What about someone who is at the last minute as some of us do trying to get to that airport, catch a plane."
1971.71-404,4,16039,alvin_l_goldman,,3452.463,3455.701,"Their rights were not hindered in this case, we felt with Mr. Colten."
1971.71-404,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3524.218,3526.482,"Thank you Mr. Goldman, thank you Mr. Willmott."
