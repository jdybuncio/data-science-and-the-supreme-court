1970.840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,21.19,"840, Astrup versus the Immigration and Naturalization Service."
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,23.604,30.708,"Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court."
1970.840,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,291.775,292.36,Mr. Halvonik.
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,292.36,292.819,Yes?
1970.840,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,292.819,294.568,"The government has filed only one brief, didn’t it?"
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,294.568,295.504,That’s correct.
1970.840,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.504,297.082,Because you talked about a reply brief.
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,297.082,299.01,"Their reply brief, right."
1970.840,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,566.218,572.027,"When you say he wasn’t told what was really going to happen, precisely what are you alluding to?"
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,572.027,589.079,"I’m alluding to the fact that he was told that he wouldn’t be able to become a citizen but he was also told that he would be released from liability for service in the armed forces, and best he made his choice looking at these two alternatives, but those alternatives, it turns out, weren’t real."
1970.840,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,728.402,730.67,You’re talking about the rule of elementary fairness.
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,734.686,749.347,"Well, I assume from both Moser and Johnson that it’s a rule of-- that this Court would enforce if there weren’t any other objection to it, any constitutional objection the other way."
1970.840,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,752.782,758.346,"So, it’s just anything that the majority of this Court thinks is elementary fair or unfair?"
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,758.346,789.0,"Well, I think when you’re resolving situations such as deciding in Moser whether a man intelligently waived his right to become a citizen, which is also the question here, or you’re deciding in a question like Johnson whether a man intelligently exercised the privilege against self-incrimination, one necessarily looks to see what’s fair and if he’s been misled by the government, it’s hardly fair to make him suffer the consequences of his original position."
1970.840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,789.0,792.095,That’s illegal or unconstitutional?
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,797.222,798.939,"Well, we’re here, I suppose, to decide two things."
1970.840,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,835.422,839.182,This case does involve a matter of statutory construction?
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,839.182,839.494,It does.
1970.840,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,839.494,840.811,Not a constitutional issue.
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,840.811,856.792,"Well, it doesn’t involve the constitutional issue, except to the extent that one would think considerations that were relevant to this Court in reaching constitutional determinations would also be relevant to Congress when they’re trying to construct the statute."
1970.840,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,903.276,909.077,"I see you have, in your brief, made constitutional arguments including an Eighth Amendment argument."
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,909.077,921.032,"Yes, our constitutional arguments, as I say, are, it seems to me, inconceivable that the Court would declare Section 315 unconstitutional on the basis of the arguments that we have made."
1970.840,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1036.165,1037.162,How old was he?
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,1037.162,1039.301,He was 23 at that time period.
1970.840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1039.301,1047.243,"You have emphasized, I think exclusively, the change in the law."
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,1057.563,1060.153,"Yes, there was a change-- there may have been a change in his physical status."
1970.840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1060.731,1076.795,"If he’d known at the beginning, if he’d known at the outset that he would never pass the physical examination, would he have signed this-- entered into this engagement, waiving the right to become a citizen?"
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,1076.795,1083.89,"If I understand your question, Mr. Chief Justice, if he knew he could avoid service through another way, would he have executed the exemption?"
1970.840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1083.89,1085.081,Yes.
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,1085.081,1086.525,I would think--
1970.840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1086.525,1101.531,"Suppose, for example, that he had his right leg off of the knee at the outset, he just would’ve stood by and waited until they called him up and then demonstrated his lack of physical fitness then--"
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,1101.531,1103.944,"Well, that’s pretty-- I imagine that’s true."
1970.840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1105.527,1115.459,"Here, the physical condition-- his acceptability for military service altered during this span of time didn’t."
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,1131.398,1131.869,"Yes, it does."
1970.840,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1159.203,1164.676,"Mr. Halvonik, what is the chronology?"
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,1173.522,1175.891,"Yes, he passed the pre-induction physical."
1970.840,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1175.891,1181.032,"And the second examination was how long after that, a year-and-a half or so?"
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,1181.032,1185.894,"About that, yes, a year-and-a half to-- no, about a year later, I guess."
1970.840,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1185.894,1187.099,It wasn’t very long.
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,1187.099,1187.791,"No, it wasn’t very long."
1970.840,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1187.791,1199.475,Is there any question at all about the integrity of his disability?
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,1200.294,1216.273,It must be conceded that there’s no question about it because the government admits that he’s a man of good moral character and I assume that any man who malingered or came up with a fraudulent illness in order to avoid military service wouldn’t be deemed by the government a man of good moral character.
1970.840,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1216.273,1219.713,What was the cause of the-- his not passing the physical?
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,1220.551,1222.846,"It was bursitis, yes."
1970.840,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1222.846,1224.945,"Well, this doesn’t last very long."
1970.840,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,1224.945,1226.217,"No, it doesn’t."
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1558.759,1562.723,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.55,1936.734,"Mr. Stones, what class of aliens would have been entitled to take advantage of Section 315 (a) under the “or” has applied the language?"
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1936.734,1939.638,"That-- I want to get to that, Mr. Justice White."
1970.840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.825,1972.944,"Under your Savings argument, no one who had applied before--"
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1972.944,1973.943,Would be s--
1970.840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.943,1974.899,Would be subject--
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1974.899,1975.766,Would be subject--
1970.840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1975.766,1977.267,Would be entitled to take advantage of the two-pronged--
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1977.267,1980.037,"That’s right, and--"
1970.840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1980.037,1984.23,That Section 315 would go on being applicable in the future.
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1984.23,1987.751,"That’s right, to the-- it would-- and there was still a considerable class of aliens to whom it would--"
1970.840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1987.751,1990.875,"Who, at some date in the future, could have said “has applied.”"
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1990.875,2003.509,I think it is not unusual for Congress to place a statute like that both in the present and the past tense simply to be all inclusive and to make it unambiguous that it’s all inclusive at any time that it’s read.
1970.840,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2275.98,2282.601,"This doesn’t actually involve the case, but do women aliens have to do this too?"
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2282.601,2282.795,"No, they don’t."
1970.840,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2282.795,2284.976,I’m worried about this day and age.
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2284.976,2286.125,"They don’t, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1970.840,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2288.531,2290.726,But the statute says any person.
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2290.726,2292.845,"Well, I assume that--"
1970.840,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2292.845,2294.187,As a matter of practice.
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2294.187,2295.146,As a matter of practice.
1970.840,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2312.807,2320.654,"This is an argument that I pass from the merits of it, but that if he had served, he’d be in a different category."
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2320.654,2323.424,"Well, that’s right."
1970.840,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2345.739,2349.355,"Mr. Stone, you agree with that result in the Second and Ninth Circuits?"
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2349.355,2352.625,"It’s the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits."
1970.840,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2385.971,2395.973,"Well, what bothers me mildly is that then you’re in a position of making eligibility depend on a successfully physical examination."
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2395.973,2420.437,"Well, I think, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that that is on the surface when you first think about it, rather troublesome, and it did-- we do find that there are aspects of our application of 3-- Section 315 that are somewhat harsh, as I-- we’ve pointed out in our brief and as I want to get to, but I don’t think it’s that specific aspect because I-- if you think about it, what is-- after all, what is at stake here is service."
1970.840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2485.444,2495.771,"Mr. Stone, would the government say the same result would be reached if there hadn’t been an amendment in 1952 where the man had actually been called to serve?"
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2495.771,2510.177,"Well, in all those cases, Mr. Justice White, it has been stipulated, and I’m afraid the government has not been totally consistent after the-- in the aftermath of Ceballos and Shaughnessy in arguing whether the 1952 Act or the 1948 Act apply."
1970.840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.12,2543.766,"But, the-- under your applicability argument or your Savings Clause argument, I suppose you make the same argument with respect to whether the 315-- is that before--"
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2543.766,2557.749,"I’d rather not face that, but I suppose we would make the same argument that, under the 1948 Act, actual service didn’t matter and, in one case, that was argued and held that actual service did not matter under the 1948 Act."
1970.840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2557.749,2562.231,And actual service wouldn’t make any difference in terms of the applicability of 315.
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2562.231,2564.556,That’s right.
1970.840,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2564.556,2587.128,"Mr. Stone, in your comparison with the man that actually applies who is not an alien and doesn’t pass the physical, am I correct that, here, if he passes the physical and is taken in and is subsequently dis-- honorably discharged, he would be covered?"
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2587.128,2589.539,"I suppose he would be, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1970.840,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2594.295,2594.859,I know.
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2594.859,2600.369,"That, actually, if he were dishonorably discharged, actually I suppose it could be argued depending on what time it was in his service."
1970.840,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2604.911,2610.262,My trouble is being subject to the draft and actually being drafted.
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2613.415,2615.424,He was theoretically subject to the draft.
1970.840,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2615.424,2616.352,He was subjected.
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2617.781,2618.568,He took the physical.
1970.840,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2618.568,2619.274,One step.
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2619.274,2624.024,"And, unlike the first time he took the physical-- he failed it, yes."
1970.840,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2625.704,2629.83,"Mr. Stone, I’ll ask you one more question following through with Mr. Justice White."
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2642.724,2648.946,"That theory is not involved in this case, Mr. Justice Blackmun, and we haven’t argued that position with respect to the 1948 statute."
1970.840,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2769.73,2772.228,Didn’t he assume something else too?
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2776.113,2778.166,"I guess he would have assumed that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.840,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2778.166,2778.282,But--
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2778.282,2781.852,He would assume that he would stay in the same condition he was in prior to 1952.
1970.840,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2781.852,2782.42,Could there be any--
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2782.42,2801.422,"And, for that reason, we consider petitioner in a much less harsh application of the statute than, perhaps, others similarly situated of who might not have had a change in their physical status between the time that they sought the first exemption and the time they the exemption--"
1970.840,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2801.422,2827.796,"Well I wonder, the laymen, as this man was, not a lawyer, thinking in technical terms, if he really sat down and had a debate with himself about all the elements that he ought to waive, surely he would’ve given priority to the continued physical condition that would render him eligible and would be far less likely to be trying to predict whether Congress was going to change or not change the law."
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2830.433,2833.201,I’m afraid I don’t quite see the--
1970.840,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2833.201,2839.133,"Well, if he sat down trying to evaluate what were the problems, what he should consider in his choice."
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2851.813,2852.374,"That’s right, and--"
1970.840,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2852.374,2864.22,"And if he knew, suppose he were consulting the doctor at the time and the doctor said “you’ve got an incipient diabetic condition,” he probably then wouldn’t have tried to rest on the other ground."
1970.840,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2864.22,2867.749,"Would not apply for an alien’s exemption, that’s precisely the point."
1970.840,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3039.251,3040.479,"Thank you, Mr. Stone."
1970.840,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3043.606,3045.315,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.840,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3258.427,3259.535,"Thank you, Mr. Halvonik."
