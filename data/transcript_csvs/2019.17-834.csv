2019.17-834,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.68,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-834, Kansas versus Garcia. General Schmidt."
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,7.68,16.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In a typical and recent year, more than 15 million Americans became victims of identity theft."
2019.17-834,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,133.16,160.48,"But isn't it telling, General Schmidt, that in all three cases that we have, the prosecutor initially charged false Social Security number on the I-9, and it was only when the prosecutor appreciated that that couldn't be done that the I-9 charge was deleted?"
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,160.48,173.36,"I think these cases are here, Justice Ginsburg, because they do, of course, present the issue of the intersection between IRCA and generally applicable state law. These cases all straddled, in their time lines, this Court's decision in Arizona."
2019.17-834,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,205.4,205.44,Do you --
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,205.44,207.28,-- of different criminal conduct in the department.
2019.17-834,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,207.28,227.12,"-- do you agree that the result would be different if the information was harvested from the I-9s; in other words, if state officials went to employers, said let me see your I-9s, and then that is used to gather information that's used in the Kansas prosecutions?"
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,227.12,229.16,"I think it likely would, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,248.72,258.28,"But the package that was submitted to the employer was all in one package, the I-9, the withholding form, federal and state."
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,280.56,301.8,"That's true, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that speaks to the important distinction that's at issue in this case. Our view of what Congress did in 1986 against the backdrop of this Court's decision in DeCanas, that prior to IRCA the employment process generally was available to -- was within the scope of state criminal law. In 1986, Congress created something new and different."
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,354.12,354.36,May I --
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,354.36,355.96,And that system is what's permitted.
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,355.96,368.84,"Can I unpackage your argument a little bit? Is it your position -- I seem -- you seem to be conceding that you can't use the -- prosecute for any false statements on the I-9 form, correct?"
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,368.84,374.52,"Your Honor, as I've said to the Chief Justice, we aren't doing that. We concede -- we don't intend to do that."
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,374.76,374.8,All right.
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,374.8,377.08,"-- maybe for a broader purpose, that's a different case."
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,377.08,394.0,"So what meaning do you give to the part of the preemption language that says you can't use the form in any way? The precise language is, I think -- I don't have it."
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,394.0,395.92,"Is that the language in (b)(5), Your Honor, where the --"
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,395.92,396.28,Exactly.
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,396.28,396.96,-- where Congress --
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,396.96,424.04,"So, if you can't use it in any way, why can you use the information contained therein for employment verification? Meaning I certainly do understand an independent verification, like a criminal check, criminal law check. But you're still using it for employment verification, correct?"
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,424.04,425.68,"Well, I think not, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,429.8,433.6,"Well, that's why I'm having a problem, which is I'm not quite sure how the -- how --"
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,433.6,434.2,We -- we --
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,434.2,437.16,-- you can concede one without conceding the second.
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,437.16,445.0,-- we think that employment verification is -- is best used to describe the I-9 system that Congress created in the IRCA.
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,471.44,471.52,All right.
2019.17-834,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.52,472.04,It's so --
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,472.04,473.4,I understand that would --
2019.17-834,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,473.4,476.8,-- it would be so easy to circumvent the I-9 then.
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,483.12,506.92,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I think I understand the point, and if I understand it correctly, it is that information that is false, stolen information from somebody else that is contemporaneously submitted to an employer, if it's not the same false information on an I-9 and other employment-related documents, it would necessarily reveal the fraud on the I-9, if I'm understanding Your Honor's question. That may well be."
2019.17-834,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,524.84,525.8,But the two things --
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,525.8,525.92,They --
2019.17-834,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,525.92,526.48,Sorry.
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,564.24,575.12,"And so, too, Justice Kavanaugh, ride together background checks for many, many jobs now, not just traditionally highly sensitive, with teachers, for example, and employment application forms that --"
2019.17-834,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,575.12,581.48,Let's just focus -- let's just focus on the I-9 and the tax forms and Social Security numbers because that's --
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,581.48,581.6,Right.
2019.17-834,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,581.6,582.52,-- what this is about.
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,587.52,595.36,"Then I think, Justice Kavanaugh, that the -- the best answer to that is what Congress did not do."
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,643.8,666.88,"You couldn't -- you couldn't sue or prosecute a case for someone's fraud on the W-4 and name the U.S. as a victim, correct? The fraud is on the government because W-4s are submitted to the government for tax purposes, correct?"
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,666.88,667.8,I -- I think --
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,667.8,670.68,You don't have the power as a state --
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,670.68,672.84,"I am -- I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,672.84,679.36,I don't believe you have a power as a state to prosecute crimes where the U.S. is a victim.
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,679.36,682.0,"I -- I -- I am -- I am certain we don't do that, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,682.0,682.16,I know you don't.
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,682.16,683.08,What I'm struggling with is --
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,683.08,686.8,"It seems like there would be a real separation of powers, too."
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,686.8,687.28,Yeah.
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,689.96,690.36,So why is it --
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,690.36,691.96,-- vindicate the interests of the United States.
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,691.96,710.0,"-- permissible for you to prosecute or to claim there isn't a field preemption in doing exactly the same thing by calling this a fraud under state law, because the victim has to be the U.S."
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,710.0,713.52,"Well, I -- I'm -- I'm not sure the victim does have to be the United States, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,716.92,731.64,"Ah, that's stolen Social Security, but that's different than the fraud that -- of submitting the W-4 to the government. I have a -- I do have problems with the K-4 for your other side to answer."
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,740.6,744.2,"Your Honor, there was -- Garcia was the only case that went to a jury."
2019.17-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,768.64,769.8,"Well, Arizona."
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,769.8,794.72,"To -- well, I think that Arizona, as we read it at least, Your Honor, with respect to the employment provision, the 5(c) provision in Arizona, that was a conflict preemption analysis where Justice Kennedy writing for the Court suggested that, because of the method the state was using, the criminal law, Congress in that application in particular had declined to use the criminal law to criminalize work by unauthorized aliens. Here, that analysis isn't present at all."
2019.17-834,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,833.2,869.72,"If I could go back to Justice Kavanaugh's question, because you recognize that you can't use the I-9s to prosecute aliens in this way. But you also acknowledge that the W-4s are going to be present in every case in which the I-9s will be present, which gives you the ability to conduct all the prosecutions that you could have done through the I-9s. So what -- what effect then does -- does Congress's bar on states using the I-9s, in fact, have?"
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,869.72,890.08,"I -- I think, Justice Kagan, back to my earlier point about what Congress was doing in our view in 1986, remember prior to 1986 there was no federally mandated very disparate requirement for collection of personal information throughout the country by employers. And Congress was very concerned about what now seems commonplace but at the time was novel."
2019.17-834,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,908.08,908.84,But I think --
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,908.84,911.96,"But they used different language in (b)(5), a more passive voice."
2019.17-834,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,935.52,956.64,"But let me -- let me ask the same question, maybe from a different perspective, which is our decision in Arizona, because our decision in Arizona said that states could, in fact, not prosecute unauthorized employees for seeking employment. And -- but this gives you a tool to do just that in every single case."
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,961.56,967.4,"Well, Your Honor, as I suggested earlier, the way we read the reasoning in Arizona is not applicable here."
2019.17-834,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,978.52,986.44,"Well, you're talking about extending Arizona, but I'm suggesting that if you are right on this case, we -- we might as well not have issued Arizona."
2019.17-834,0,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,986.44,1024.08,"No, I think not, Your Honor, because, again, what the state is focused on here, and I don't think this is seriously disputed -- mildly, perhaps, in the record -- is vindicating its traditional interest in prosecuting fraud. The fact that incidentally our generally applicable laws intersect with the employment context or perhaps the immigration context does not mean that Congress has commanded, nor should we carve out, special application or lack of application of our general laws to persons because of their work authorization status. In other words, Arizona is a very different circumstance."
2019.17-834,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1036.36,1051.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michel."
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1051.08,1061.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents stole the identity information of others and passed it off as their own on tax withholding forms."
2019.17-834,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1119.76,1142.32,"Does this represent a change in the government's position? I thought the government's prior position was that on documents that the employee or the prospective employee is filing at the same time as the I-9, there would be preemption?"
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1142.32,1143.24,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1186.84,1212.08,"Could you do this? Could a state have a law which says it is a crime for an alien to take information from the S form or other information that they give that's referred to in the federal statute, and it is a crime to do that and fraudulently give it to an employer for the purpose of obtaining a job?"
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1212.08,1216.68,I think that that might be preempted under the --
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1216.68,1217.08,Ah.
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1219.88,1220.28,"Well, that --"
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1220.28,1223.76,In your opinion? I'm not holding you to it forever.
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1225.6,1229.52,"I -- I think, of course, that is -- it's far removed from this case where --"
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1229.52,1230.56,"Well, I'm not saying that yet."
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1230.56,1230.92,Yeah.
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1230.92,1236.36,I want to know if they could do that; in other words -- shall I repeat it? You -- you know what I said.
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1236.36,1249.84,"Well, our -- our position, as we laid out in the Puente brief, is that a law that regulates fraud on the work authorization process, which I think is what your hypothetical was, although I'm not sure I've tracked every piece of it."
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1249.84,1256.08,What it does is it says that if you take information from the S -- is it S-9? Is that what it's called?
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1256.08,1256.8,The I-9.
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1256.8,1273.12,"I-9 or these other papers that are referred to, and you, Mr. Alien, go and give it to an employer for the purpose of pretending that you're somebody you aren't so you'll get a job, would that be preempted?"
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1273.12,1274.56,"Yeah, I do think that would be preempted --"
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1274.56,1275.16,So do I.
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1275.16,1275.6,-- under our case.
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1275.6,1321.24,"Now, if that's so, I just wonder how this differs, because it defines the state law as applied in this case, though it's much broader, but as this case as it was put in the arguments by the prosecutors and by the complaints and so forth, what he did was, what was charged was using identifying information or documents which are the same information as on the I-9, using it to defraud another person, which they did, I guess, in order to receive a benefit, which benefit was a job."
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1341.48,1342.52,Maybe I can help you out.
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1342.52,1342.8,Yes.
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1342.8,1359.76,"I think it's the distinction -- and this is a critical one -- between work authorization, which is a defined -- which is a term of art under immigration law, in IRCA, and general requirements for obtaining a job, such as submitting a tax withholding form, submitting a background check."
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1401.8,1423.88,"All that's true, but the allegation in the criminal cases here, I think, were that the people, the defendants, were aliens and that, moreover, they submitted the information from the I-9 form -- it didn't say I-9 form, but it was from the I-9 form -- and they submitted it to get a job."
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1437.6,1438.4,"So, Your Honor, I think --"
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1438.4,1439.88,Where am I wrong on that?
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1439.88,1444.96,"So I -- I think, at -- at a minimum, they submitted it for two different reasons."
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.48,1465.16,"Well, then why isn't it --"
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1465.16,1465.6,And that's --
2019.17-834,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1465.6,1475.08,"May I ask you a question about -- before your time expires, about the meaning of the language in (b)(5), any information contained in the I-9."
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1477.64,1481.88,I think that simply means -- that simply covers everything that's on the I-9 form.
2019.17-834,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1501.6,1506.2,I still don't understand what you make of it and how it fits the language of the statute.
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1547.4,1567.4,"Oh, I think if you look at the full phrase, Justice Alito, which is ""use the I-9 or any information contained in the I-9,"" it -- I think it simply means that they can't use either the I-9 in whole or the information that appears on the I-9, which, you know, if you look at the I-9, which is in -- in our appendix, it has the Social Security number and other information like that."
2019.17-834,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1567.4,1578.32,"But you forget the rest of it, which says for purposes only related to the fraud sections of the -- the federal code."
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1586.04,1586.56,Yes.
2019.17-834,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1586.56,1587.36,-- to seeking a job.
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1587.36,1591.0,"That last point, I think, is the critical one."
2019.17-834,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1608.4,1609.04,But why? The whole focus --
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1609.04,1610.64,-- letting preemption flow from --
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1610.64,1612.04,I didn't do that.
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1627.16,1627.6,And --
2019.17-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1627.6,1636.6,And then my -- my question has been trying to figure out why isn't the very thing? Because it certainly sounds like the very thing.
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1636.6,1645.04,"I agree that the term sounds similar, but I do think it would be a mistake to -- to be confused by that because work authorization is very different than --"
2019.17-834,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1645.04,1645.8,"Well, Mr. Michel --"
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1645.8,1646.24,-- getting a job.
2019.17-834,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1646.24,1674.92,"-- let me put the same sort of question in another way, because when you were speaking with Justice Breyer, you said that a state law that regulates fraud in the work authorization process would be preempted. And I guess the question here is Kansas has a generally applicable law, but even generally applicable laws can be used to regulate fraud in the work authorization process, and when a statute, even though generally applicable, is used in that way, shouldn't the same results follow?"
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1674.92,1677.84,"May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2019.17-834,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1677.84,1678.48,Yes.
2019.17-834,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1678.48,1678.8,Yes.
2019.17-834,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1702.0,1703.96,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hughes."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1703.96,1738.6,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin with the rule that we asked the Court to adopt: States may not prosecute individuals for using false information to demonstrate work authorization under federal immigration law. To put this slightly differently, if to satisfy an element of a state offense the state proves that an individual used false information to show federal work authorization, IRCA preempts the prosecution. If this element is not present, there is no IRCA preemption."
2019.17-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1738.6,1740.36,Even if they were applying to a college? Meaning --
2019.17-834,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1740.36,1744.6,I'm sorry. You can answer that question after your time has --
2019.17-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1744.6,1744.88,I'm sorry.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1744.88,1759.8,"Thank you, Your Honor. IRCA requires preemption here because Kansas prosecuted Respondents for using false information to demonstrate federal work authorization. Kansas chose to prosecute fraud claims."
2019.17-834,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1846.56,1856.6,"If -- if the -- the I-9 process, the -- the individual applying for authorization uses a false Social Security number, can that number ever be used to prosecute him for identity theft?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1856.6,1861.04,"Yes, it can, Your Honor. Our theory of preemption is a limited one."
2019.17-834,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1876.08,1882.16,"I'm sorry, just -- so the Social Security number is used in the I-9 process to establish work authorization?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1882.16,1882.56,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1882.56,1887.4,And the state can use that number so long as it's not being used to show work authorization?
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1887.4,1895.4,"That's right, Your Honor. If a state offense has unrelated to work authorization, our theory of preemption does not apply."
2019.17-834,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1895.6,1901.72,"Including -- including to get a job, right? In other words, work authorization and applying to get a job are, as Mr. Michel told us, two different things?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1901.72,1906.76,"I think that's inaccurate, Your Honor, because the way the state prosecuted here was absolutely tethered to federal work authorization."
2019.17-834,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1911.4,1925.52,"I don't mean to -- just so I make sure where your head -- that we're on the same page, so you would say that the Social Security number, even though it's information contained on the I-9 in the process, can be used, say, to get a driver's license but not to get a K-4?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1925.52,1927.44,"Well, I -- I think that's right, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1934.64,1939.44,"How are you defining work authorization, just so I'm clear on the answer to the Chief Justice's question?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1939.44,1940.44,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1963.24,1965.36,"Mr. Hughes, give us some examples."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1967.04,1967.72,Examples --
2019.17-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1967.72,1978.96,Let's assume -- you mentioned getting a driver's license or getting into a college or getting a credit card. Let's assume that false information was used for any of those processes.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1978.96,1981.92,"Our theory of preemption does not apply to any of those, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1981.92,1982.48,All right.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1988.72,2011.36,"If the element is are you authorized as a matter of federal immigration law to work in the United States, and somebody commits fraud in answering that question, that is what federal law preempts. And so our theory of preemption is a straightforward one that we think is easily applied, which is just the question of is this an element that is necessary to the state offense. If it is, there's preemption."
2019.17-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2014.24,2014.52,How about --
2019.17-834,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2014.52,2014.8,So --
2019.17-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2014.8,2021.48,-- how about a -- a form that you file so that your employer will directly deposit your pay into your bank account?
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2021.48,2027.36,"So, Your Honor, if there is -- the element that I just described is not present, we don't think there's preemption."
2019.17-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2028.96,2035.6,"But the -- the -- the specific question, the form is submitted so that your pay will go directly into your bank account."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2038.04,2071.28,"Well, Your Honor, and -- and, again, to answer the hypothetical, I have to know if the prosecution includes an element of -- of -- of what the -- what the fraud is, because, in that theory, Your Honor, it's not clear why the use of a false Social Security number would be relevant, or would be a material aspect, but -- but, if it is, that prosecution could proceed."
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2071.72,2094.48,"States -- states may impose requirements for particular jobs or maybe even for all jobs, but let's just stick to particular jobs that go beyond the requirements necessary for obtaining any employment in the United States, such as information for a criminal background check or to prove age that's a requirement for the job, using dangerous machinery. Does your argument apply to that?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2094.48,2096.04,"No, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2113.92,2114.36,Counsel --
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2114.36,2120.96,"So, if the K-4 serves a purpose other than policing compliment with the federal requirement for obtaining work, then that would be sufficient?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2120.96,2136.72,"Well, I think -- and let me be quite clear about this, Your Honor -- I think if the state had charged this as simply the Kansas misdemeanor offense, which is making a false statement on a state tax form, I think we would have a very different case in that circumstance."
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2136.72,2137.96,Why does it matter?
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2137.96,2156.72,"Because the -- the distinction, Your Honor, is because when the state prosecutes using -- and the theory is false information to show federal employment authorization, that is an immigration offense. That's an immigration offense that's defined by IRCA, the Immigration Reform and Control Act. That's an immigration offense that is -- is regulated by the federal immigration --"
2019.17-834,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2156.72,2157.4,So if a state --
2019.17-834,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2157.4,2164.0,"So, to make all these distinctions that you're talking about, you look to the elements of the state law or you look to the underlying conduct or you look to both? How does it work?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2164.0,2172.8,"Your Honor, I think you look to the elements and then you understand, as applied in that context, what is the theory that the state is offering to prove the elements of that offense? So --"
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2172.8,2179.08,"Well, on the elements of this offense, it's just, as I understand it, using someone else's identity. Right?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2179.08,2180.84,"It's to receive a benefit, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2183.36,2183.72,Okay.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2191.96,2193.4,"Your Honor, if the state were --"
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2193.4,2196.4,"Because you concede the form could be used for other purposes, right?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2196.4,2197.44,"Your Honor, if a state --"
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2197.44,2207.8,"But we agree the state form can be used for other purposes besides compliance with the immigration laws, right?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2207.8,2210.68,"Yes, I think I agree with you, Your Honor, yes."
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2210.68,2210.92,Okay.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2216.6,2218.2,"Yes, of course, of course."
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2218.2,2218.8,Okay.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2225.56,2237.4,"That's right, Your Honor. And our point, though, is the state, if the state had wanted to charge this as a state tax offense, of saying we have these state tax forms, you've put inaccurate information on --"
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2237.4,2246.76,"No, no, but even identity theft, would -- would you concede then that a state could have an identity theft case based on this same form?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2246.76,2252.32,"Your Honor, I think the question is what their theory of benefit is, what is the intent to defraud --"
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2252.32,2254.68,So it's not about the elements.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2260.28,2272.12,"Well -- well, Your Honor, there is a -- an element of the -- the offense, the intent to defraud, and then the state applying that to the individual circumstance has to show what the intent to defraud in that particular case is."
2019.17-834,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2272.12,2281.84,"If a -- I'm sorry -- if a -- if a state passes a law making it a serious felony to use a false Social Security number on a state tax form, is that state law preempted?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2281.84,2285.56,"I -- I don't think so under our theory, no, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2285.56,2287.24,"Well, how is that different than --"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2287.24,2289.08,Because that's not what Kansas has done here.
2019.17-834,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2290.24,2303.56,"And why exactly is it different from what Kansas has done here and how does that fit with your implied preemption theory of enforcement discretion, which I thought was tied to the use of the false Social Security number?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2303.56,2322.08,"Your Honor, what Kansas has done here is it is on its face objectively prosecuting an immigration offense, because it has said repeatedly in the lower courts that necessary to show it's -- the intent to deceive element, was showing that individuals used false information to show that they were eligible under federal law to hold employment when they were, in fact, not."
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2322.08,2322.4,What type of --
2019.17-834,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2322.4,2337.28,"Well, Mr. Hughes, it just seems a -- a -- a little bit odd to look to, you know, particular statements that Kansas made in order to determine whether a particular prosecution is preempted. So that's why I asked the question that I asked."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2343.72,2352.28,"Well, Your Honor, I think it's the same analysis the Court used in a case like Buckman, for example, and Buckman is looking at general state fraud laws and said, well, this is fraud on the FDA."
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2376.6,2376.8,"So, Mr. Hughes --"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2376.8,2377.76,-- that led to that fraud.
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2377.76,2397.76,"-- just to follow up on -- on Justice Kagan's question, if the -- if Kansas's theory of the benefit in this case were that by filing a W-4, the defendant had an intention to comply with Kansas tax law, would that be un-preempted in your -- in your theory?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2397.76,2398.84,"Your Honor, if there --"
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2398.84,2400.28,"I think -- I think that would be safe, right?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2400.28,2401.72,"I think that might be, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2402.0,2402.2,Okay.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2402.32,2402.96,-- that the state might have a difficult --
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2402.96,2411.48,-- so we really are down to drawing distinctions on preemption here based on Kansas's particular intentions in a particular case.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2411.48,2416.12,"Well, it's the nature of how they're applying the intent-to-defraud element in that context."
2019.17-834,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2422.88,2433.12,"But, again, Mr. Hughes, the idea of it's -- it's because of how they're applying their law, how do we know how they're applying their law at the outset, right? We want to make these decisions at the outset."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2439.72,2464.6,"I think, as a practical matter, Your Honor, what would happen in a case like this is, if the state charges somebody with this issue that is around a hiring offense, saying that there's identity theft, the defendant under the rule that we permit -- or we -- we advance would be entitled to file a motion to dismiss that charge, saying this charge is preempted by federal law, and the state would then have an opportunity to say no, that is not the theory of -- of prosecution that we advance in this particular case."
2019.17-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2464.6,2482.88,"Mr. Hughes, can I ask you to bring your answer to a more practical answer, which is how would you think -- give me a hypothetical or even this -- why this case differs from the case you think is not preempted?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2482.88,2483.36,This --
2019.17-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2483.36,2492.44,"By that, I mean what do you see in the -- what are the words in the charge here that are different than the words that you think are not preempted?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2492.44,2496.56,"So I think looking just to the charge itself can be difficult, Your Honor, because the state charges often are --"
2019.17-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2496.56,2498.92,That's why the Kansas court went to the -- to --
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2498.92,2499.12,Right.
2019.17-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2500.24,2502.16,-- to the as applied challenge.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2502.16,2524.24,"However, the state appellate court said that this goes directly to employment eligibility, and this is exactly how when the -- the Respondents challenge saying you've not provided us sufficient evidence to show the benefit element, the state was obligated to say here's the evidence that we have shown that satisfies the benefit element. What was the evidence they provided? It was exclusively eligibility for employment that's tethered to federal --"
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2524.24,2524.84,So Kansas --
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2524.84,2525.12,-- immigration law.
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2525.12,2527.28,"-- will never make that mistake again, Mr. Hughes."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2527.28,2527.96,"Your Honor, there --"
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2527.96,2537.28,"And in every future case, they will say the benefit that the defendant is seeking is the opportunity to comply with our tax laws and our -- our revenue laws."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2545.56,2547.2,"I disagree with that for a few reasons, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2550.48,2550.84,Sure.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2557.48,2559.2,"Well, a few things about that, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2570.4,2580.28,"But every time an employee uses a false identification number in these cases, Kansas will use a different set of magical words, and that will be the end of this problem?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2580.28,2601.36,"But, Your Honor, what the distinction is, is while Kansas may prosecute a wide range of -- of offenses on its tax system, and we certainly don't disagree with that, what Kansas might not do is have its own individual immigration policy and immigration offenses. I think I agree with you there are ways that Kansas can charge similar sorts of conduct when it relates to the tax system that is not a state adopting its own immigration system."
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2601.88,2602.28,What type of --
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2602.28,2618.4,"I was going to say just -- just to conclude with that point, Your Honor, I think to the extent that this is, as you suggest, angels dancing on a pin, I think that suggests the opposite conclusion, precisely as to why preemption is warranted here because of how Kansas charged this case. And if that is where -- where the Court agrees, then there shouldn't be any concerns about --"
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2618.4,2630.88,"Then why shouldn't we DIG this case? I mean, if this is about a one-off prosecution that has no chance of recurring ever again and, you know -- I mean, I know you're vigorously defending your client, but we don't usually take cases that have such limited application."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2630.88,2633.64,"We would perfectly welcome a DIG, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2636.8,2638.64,What type of -- what type of --
2019.17-834,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2638.64,2639.16,Touche.
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2639.16,2642.16,-- preemption are you relying on? What type of preemption are you relying on?
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2642.16,2651.44,"Your Honor, we argue both express preemption on the language of 1324a(b)(5) as well as conflict with -- or, sorry, with -- as well as implied, with respect to implied --"
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2651.44,2655.28,I don't see how you get express preemption out of (b)(5).
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2660.88,2666.24,The conflict is the similar sorts of conflicts that the Court recognized with respect to Section 3 of SB 1070.
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2666.24,2667.24,But what -- what is the conflict?
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2667.24,2674.04,"The conflict is the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, how the federal government uses prosecutorial discretion to establish a consistent --"
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2674.04,2674.88,"Well, how do we know --"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2674.88,2675.8,-- federal immigration --
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2675.8,2695.44,"-- that the federal government has taken the position that this particular case or cases of this particular type shouldn't be prosecuted? This is not a situation like Arizona, where a state has criminalized something that is not criminal under federal law. It's a case where the same conduct is criminal under federal law and, Kansas says, under Kansas law."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2696.24,2707.08,"Your Honor, that was exactly the case with respect to Section 3 of SB 1070, where the state had adopted precisely the federal standards in assessing what was the underlying state offense, and they still found preemption."
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2707.08,2713.64,What is the conflict? The federal government doesn't say this is contrary to our -- our enforcement priorities.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2713.64,2726.44,"The conflict is states having independent immigration policies that differ from how the federal government has established the priorities with respect to both which tools to use for enforcement, as well as which -- who to, in fact, prosecute."
2019.17-834,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2726.44,2736.64,But you conceded that a state could pass a law making it a felony to use a false Social Security number on a state tax form.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2736.64,2741.92,"Your Honor, and that would not be an immigration offense, and that would not be a state having its own individual immigration policy."
2019.17-834,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2741.92,2755.8,But that would be -- but that would certainly be a way for a state to target people who are non-citizens who are unlawfully in the country from obtaining employment by enacting such a law.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2761.8,2776.44,"Your Honor, if there is an underlying targeting that is the intent behind that law, I think that that might be susceptible to other challenges, not the ones we bring here, but related to either constitutional claims or selective enforcement or other kinds of challenges to that. That is, by no stretch, the argument, though, that we press in this case."
2019.17-834,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2776.44,2784.52,"So the specific -- to follow up again on Justice Alito's, the specific reason that that's not a conflict but this case is a conflict is?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2784.52,2803.24,"The specific reason is because the federal government establishes a uniform immigration policy with respect to who they're going to prosecute and who not, and that has immigration consequences. But, beyond that, I think our field preemption argument is an extraordinarily strong one because all of the criteria that existed with respect to Section 3 of SB 1070 are present here."
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2855.4,2876.84,"If the -- if the person whose identity is stolen has, let's say, five dependents and the applicant for employment has no dependents but puts down five dependents so less money will be withheld under federal and state law, could that applicant be prosecuted for that offense?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2876.84,2888.04,"Your Honor, as I've said, our theory is that yes, applicants can be prosecuted -- sorry, the -- the -- the -- the immigrant who has put down the information can be prosecuted? Yes, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2929.96,2934.92,Why should we worry about the briefs below? I -- I guess I'm following up on Justice Gorsuch's question.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2947.64,2949.88,"Well, Your Honor, I think the point is -- I -- I think there are two points."
2019.17-834,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2953.64,2953.84,Right.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2953.84,2967.8,-- that we think the Court should adopt is that a state offense is preempted if an element of that is use of false information to show federal employment authorization under the immigration laws. And the second question is the applicability of that in the context of this case.
2019.17-834,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3010.88,3018.48,"I'm repeating myself now, but you've said many times the state could have a law prohibiting false statements on the K-4."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3018.48,3021.72,"Yes, I think they could, Your Honor, that's right, and that wouldn't be an --"
2019.17-834,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3021.72,3021.84,And --
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3021.84,3022.6,-- immigration offense and that would not be --
2019.17-834,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3022.6,3030.6,"-- and you've said that's fine, even though that might be the same kind of conduct that would be done on the I-9?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3030.6,3036.4,"Your Honor, I think if somebody were challenging that law, it would be an argument that's different than the sort of argument that we're advancing for you here."
2019.17-834,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3036.84,3038.08,"Well, they're not challenging the law."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3048.64,3052.72,"Well, I don't think that would be preempted, Your Honor, because it would not be prosecuting an immigration offense."
2019.17-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3064.8,3092.64,"So, in fact, the -- the -- here, the state is prosecuting this person for using this false information which is on the I-9, or wherever, in order to show that he has federal authorization to work and, thereby, is entitled to a job, which is the property which he tried to get through deception? Is that right?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3092.64,3093.96,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3093.96,3098.12,"And in a different case, they might not use the words in their brief."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3121.84,3122.92,I -- I think that's --
2019.17-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3122.92,3141.8,"I mean, if they were trying to get a job by using this to show that they were in the hospital, then the defense would say, or the prosecution would say, they -- they -- they showed they were in the hospital. And if they tried to get it through showing authorization, federal, the prosecution would say that."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3143.24,3144.48,"I -- I think that's right, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3150.88,3151.24,Yes.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3151.24,3153.16,And they're going to have to put that before the jury.
2019.17-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3166.08,3187.36,"So is it up to the defense lawyer in the -- in the court -- I mean, I don't know if you could always say this, but say to the -- to the jury: Jury, they've used the word fraud to obtain a benefit, but they have not explained to you how that fraud was used to obtain a benefit."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3201.72,3202.68,"Well, that's right, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3202.68,3205.16,"Am I right, or, no, don't say I'm right if I'm wrong. (Laughter.)"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3205.16,3206.28,"No, you -- you're right, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3278.88,3280.24,So the state can't --
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3280.24,3281.0,-- when Congress enacted it.
2019.17-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3281.0,3289.72,"-- according to you, can't have a law that says you can't have a job in this state unless you submit a K-4?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3289.72,3290.84,"Kansas -- sorry, a state --"
2019.17-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3290.84,3296.2,"Kansas can't say, have a law, that says you can't have a job in this state without a K-4?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3296.2,3299.96,I think Kansas probably -- I don't think there's a federal preemption problem with that.
2019.17-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3300.84,3308.2,So why isn't that this case? They're saying they couldn't get this job unless they submitted the K-4?
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3308.2,3311.48,That -- that's not this case because that is not the State of Kansas law.
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3375.16,3375.8,Excuse me.
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3375.8,3379.08,-- not the label that the state uses for the prosecution.
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3379.08,3386.68,"How is it expressly preempted under (b)(5)? That argument mystifies me, because (b)(5) says nothing about work authorization."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3403.24,3404.36,"So a -- a few things, Your Honor."
2019.17-834,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3455.96,3466.44,"No, but you want us to say -- you say it's expressly preempted, even though all of the elements, practically all of the elements of the rule that you're advocating are not mentioned at all in (b)(5)."
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3480.32,3486.16,"Well, this is information that is contained in and they're using it for the same purposes that underlie (b)(5), which is showing --"
2019.17-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3486.16,3486.64,But did I --
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3486.64,3487.32,-- federal employment authorization.
2019.17-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3487.32,3492.64,"-- understand you to say that you thought your better theory was field preemption, not express preemption?"
2019.17-834,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3492.64,3520.72,"I -- I think they're both good theories, Your Honor, but, yes, I think the (b)(5) points up to field preemption and I think field preemption is a very strong theory for us because this -- we have direct congressional direction that establishes the -- the balance between the states and the federal government. And in (b)(5), whether one thinks that that is express preemption or not, I think it -- it undeniably identifies the policy judgment of Congress that the federal government alone should have the authority to prosecute these immigration offenses. Thank you."
2019.17-834,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3520.72,3524.08,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, General Schmidt."
2019.17-834,3,21539,derek_l_schmidt,,3524.08,3572.72,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to try to make three points. With respect to Justice Alito's line of questioning on the (b)(5) language, (b)(5) is certainly, if read as a preemption provision, most unusual, at -- not least of which is because it is not aimed exclusively at states. Preemption is a supremacy clause concept that regulates the relationship between the federal government and states. But (b)(5) speaks not only to that but also to the relationship between the law Congress passed and what the federal government may do, and, most importantly, as I was discussing earlier with Justice Kagan, what private employers may do with this information that they were compelled to collect and maintain in a novel manner back in 1986. And we think that explains your earlier question, Justice Alito, with respect to what does ""information contained in"" mean."
2019.17-834,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3706.72,3707.68,"Thank you, counsel."
