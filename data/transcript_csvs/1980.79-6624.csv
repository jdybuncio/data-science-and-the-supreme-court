1980.79-6624,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,We will hear arguments next in Lopez against the United States.
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,73.062,75.614,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-6624,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,258.982,261.8,"You lost me there a minute, Mr. Cleary."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,265.652,281.247,"Yes, Your Honor, because in this case, if you look at the disposition of the other defendants, particularly Virginia Bowling, who copped out and became the government witness against him, who owned and operated the drop house in southern California, she was given a misdemeanor with a recommended probation."
1980.79-6624,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,369.017,374.354,Do I gather the practice in that Court is the Judge often asks all the questions of the panel?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,374.354,375.287,--That is correct.
1980.79-6624,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,379.575,384.677,"No, but I mean... counsel have to submit questions to the Judge, and he either agrees or--"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,384.677,385.829,--That is--
1980.79-6624,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,385.829,386.329,--refuses to ask them?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,386.329,386.979,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6624,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,492.528,494.997,Why?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,497.682,499.418,Race have to do with this trial?
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,499.418,500.534,Yes sir.
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,500.534,509.54,"Your Honor, in this case, I think we have the defendant, who is Mexican, I think by his appearance it would be obvious."
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,519.163,521.365,"Half of the jurors were Mexican, weren't they?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,521.365,524.134,"--No, none of the jurors were Mexican or Mexican-American."
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,524.134,524.784,Are you sure?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,524.784,525.517,Positive.
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,525.517,526.952,How are you sure?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,526.952,531.889,"Well because I included in my brief, their surnames of... well, they might have had a... on the non named side, that is,--"
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,531.889,535.374,I know a Mexican named McCarthy.
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,535.374,535.874,--Right.
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,536.791,537.457,Oh sure.
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,537.457,538.409,Your Honor is correct.
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,538.409,539.076,Sure.
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,542.045,553.153,"Your Honor, I can only state first, that when any defendant might be the object of racial prejudice... the defendant himself, in a federal criminal case... the issue may be asked."
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,564.025,564.444,What's that got to do with this case?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,564.444,564.927,--Your Honor--
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,564.927,569.146,What's that got to do with this case?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,569.146,572.88,"--In this case, the defendant was Mexican."
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,592.811,594.813,There you see race right there.
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,601.65,602.134,Okay.
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,628.051,629.803,Did you argue that to the judge?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,629.803,633.488,"I, in fact, at this time, I didn't know whether or not--"
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,633.488,635.623,Did you argue that to the judge?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,635.623,637.007,--I only said that... I just--
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,637.007,641.611,What did you tell the judge was the reason that you wanted this charge?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,641.611,648.681,"--I felt that the Court, under federal law, should permit a question as to racial prejudice when it's raised by counsel."
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,648.681,650.633,"Pro se, pro se?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,650.633,651.517,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,652.417,654.418,But you have nothing beyond that?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,654.418,663.524,"--Well Your Honor, the Court notes... the Court didn't even permit me, the trial Court, to even finish the six questions that I had asked for and that... my limited role, it is very difficult."
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,680.069,687.223,"And it's your duty to see that he is acquainted with the facts, that's a part of your job."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,687.223,687.856,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,688.758,690.225,And here you didn't.
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,695.078,699.547,"Your Honor, there are some times even trial lawyers know that you can't anticipate every move at trial."
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,700.232,716.009,"One of these days I'm going to write an encyclopedia of 116 foot shelf of things that lawyers could have done that they thought of on their way home, after the hearing."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,717.475,719.111,"--Yes, Your Honor, I think I could probably--"
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,719.111,720.727,"That doesn't help me here, though, does it?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,720.727,728.314,"--No, I don't think it was it was pertinent here because the reason it wasn't, was that the daughter, Kim... there was some question as to whether or not we were going to call her to testify."
1980.79-6624,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,761.818,772.96,"May I ask, Mr. Cleary, have we ever addressed the question whether discrimination against a Mexican is racial discrimination?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,772.96,773.726,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6624,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,787.352,793.689,"Well minority, all right, but is the discrimination racial, that's what I mean, technically racial?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,793.689,795.889,Well the question is as to--
1980.79-6624,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,795.889,801.524,"Of course, with Orientals, you have a different color than Caucasian, so are blacks."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,803.276,804.309,--Well if I--
1980.79-6624,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,804.309,806.511,A different race?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,806.511,808.947,"--Well I think that even if a person were, say, a Mexican-American--"
1980.79-6624,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,808.947,815.934,"I don't suggest there may not... nevertheless, be the kind of discrimination you are arguing for, but is it a racial discrimination?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,815.934,818.353,--Status as a Mexican is not.
1980.79-6624,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,832.128,843.203,Well there might be discrimination against the discreet minority of Mexicans... my brother Marshall has been suggesting... is that necessarily a racial discrimination?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,844.77,851.374,--Well I think that in the context of this case there was inquiry as to alienage and to an alien problem.
1980.79-6624,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,939.998,962.397,"Mr. Cleary, I suppose it's an unspoken premise of your entire argument that when you put a question about ethnic or other prejudice that the person to whom the question is addressed will immediately answer in good faith and fully and honestly?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,962.397,963.597,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6624,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,966.265,973.421,Do many people in the ordinary course of human experiences admit prejudices when they have them?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,973.421,976.157,"--My experience, it has been yes."
1980.79-6624,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,977.507,985.578,Yours is contrary to the human experience reported in all the authorities who have undertaken to write on the subject.
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,985.578,994.032,"--Well Your Honor, the one difficulty with that area is that there is... if you put it as a rhetorical, you know, would you be raising prejudice against the defendant sitting here?"
1980.79-6624,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.911,1042.798,"Mr. Cleary, let me call your attention to the Appendix at page 18."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1103.989,1116.963,"I don't think so, Justice Rehnquist, and I think in this case if you look at... what the question was asked to measure the response, it could have been aliens or the alien problems, it could have been the feeling about the immigration laws, how a person feels about it."
1980.79-6624,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1141.079,1143.747,Well didn't he have the defendant stand up?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1143.747,1146.013,"Yes, he did, he did have to stand."
1980.79-6624,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1172.43,1178.318,"Of course your trial judge here, unfortunately, was from the District of Columbia, wasn't he?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1178.318,1179.253,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6624,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1179.253,1185.074,"Are you making any point, however, that he did other than apply the current Ninth Circuit law?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1185.074,1192.71,"I think that, under the Ninth Circuit law, he could have followed it."
1980.79-6624,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1233.82,1236.522,"That was a statutory case, was it not?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1236.522,1241.008,"It was, but it was dealing with the terms we're dealing with here, and the bias of prejudice."
1980.79-6624,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1260.038,1273.714,"Well, Mr. Cleary, was the basis of your concern that there exists in your community a bias against Mexicans, or is it a bias against Mexicans engaged in bringing in illegal aliens?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1273.714,1276.214,"No, my concern is not as to the offense, at all."
1980.79-6624,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1284.67,1294.009,"Well that's what... is there any... are you suggesting that in the community generally there is a bias against Mexicans, that they are looked down upon as a minority, or something?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1294.009,1311.571,"I think the history and tradition of California is overwhelming in that respect, starting back from the California days to studies now in California history teachers... they get a period of... of rebuke... of the Mexicans within the culture, originally California was a part of Mexico."
1980.79-6624,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1311.571,1315.808,"It doesn't matter that the offense was importing the illegal aliens, it could have been any offense?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1315.808,1332.084,"It could have been any offense, but I think that it brings out the racial characteristic, because you're going to have other individuals involved in it, and again, the fact, the exploitation of people who themselves might be Mexicans, might be another aggravating factor that would be considered."
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1364.989,1373.645,"Mr. Cleary, would your rule apply to a Mexican-American charged with murdering a Mexican-American?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1373.645,1375.763,"--Yes, Your Honor, it would."
1980.79-6624,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1375.763,1376.68,I thought so.
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1391.792,1392.259,Right.
1980.79-6624,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1393.109,1407.634,"Regardless of what may be a court as a Sunday morning quarterback would see as a possibility of racial prejudice in a particular case, either by the reason of the charge in the case or the race of the defendant."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1434.619,1435.852,--That is my submission.
1980.79-6624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1436.853,1438.737,Provided the defendant is a Mexican?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1439.122,1439.655,--No.
1980.79-6624,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1449.828,1452.513,"By a whole Negro jury, who are just prejudiced against Whiteys?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1452.513,1453.313,--Precisely.
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1455.096,1457.598,And the all Negro jury opposed against Negroes?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1457.598,1458.181,--There--
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1458.181,1458.998,You could have that.
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1458.998,1461.167,--Well I think that a person--
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1461.167,1463.419,Is there any way... is there any end to this?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1465.121,1481.13,"--Your Honor, I think that when you deal with racial prejudice, we're dealing with such a touchy and very sensitive area, that if counsel who hopefully are not incompetent, seriously want the inquiry made, for the Court to deny it, I think, would be improper."
1980.79-6624,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1481.13,1483.598,Well what about religion?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1483.598,1485.515,That's not before the Court.
1980.79-6624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1498.392,1503.662,"Mr. Cleary, before you sit down, let me be sure I understand... I may not have caught the full thrust of your argument."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1519.338,1519.955,--There is no--
1980.79-6624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1519.955,1528.294,"Suppose he has to ask a) Mexicans, b) Negroes, c) Catholics, d) what... made a list of 100."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1529.261,1533.598,"--No, in fact, I think what is the purpose is, one, it shouldn't be sua sponte."
1980.79-6624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1535.815,1536.233,I understand.
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1546.589,1549.025,--I think it has to be in the context of the particular case.
1980.79-6624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1549.025,1550.158,It has to be one of the defendants.
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1551.143,1554.361,"No, I'm saying only as to the defendant, but as to any particular case."
1980.79-6624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1575.342,1586.316,"Well I understand, but need not... you're not even arguing that the defendant in the case in which the request is made has to be of the racial or national origin to which the question pertains?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1586.316,1586.816,No.
1980.79-6624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1593.554,1593.97,Exactly.
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1593.97,1598.957,"My question was, precisely only antagonisms as towards Mexicans."
1980.79-6624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.957,1599.423,Well all right.
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1623.603,1625.854,The witness would not be on trial.
1980.79-6624,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.854,1637.176,"Well, the witness may not be on trial, but the fact that the jury were prejudiced against the testimony of the witness might seriously impair the fairness of the trial."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1637.176,1639.945,"That is a possible thing, but we're dealing with the unfettered--"
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1639.945,1649.986,"Mr. Cleary, suppose the defendant is a blond, blue eyed Mexican or Negro."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1651.67,1654.722,"--I think in that particular case you'd have to give both, the--"
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1654.722,1655.89,You'd have to--

1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1662.044,1665.93,"--Bear in mind now, I'm going to... well, I wanted to warn you that I was going to ask you why."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1665.93,1674.968,"--The answer, I think, in that case is that I think a person who might have those exhibits might trigger off some hostility, which it could be... sensitively inquiry--"
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1674.968,1678.32,"Trigger hostility, they wouldn't even know he was a Negro."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1678.32,1684.807,"--Well, I think that counsel has to make an informed judgment; if he thought the individual might be acceptable and the--"
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1684.807,1687.592,So counsel is going to run the government?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1687.592,1688.142,"--No, I--"
1980.79-6624,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1688.142,1700.849,"Whenever counsel makes up his mind that... this is your position, is it not... that whenever counsel makes up his mind, that that charge is necessary, the judge must give it."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1702.135,1705.053,"--In the inquiry as to racial prejudice that is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1705.053,1706.553,"I have one other question, if I may."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1727.851,1728.836,Excuse me.
1980.79-6624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.49,1744.212,"So that the racial aspect is not critical Rather, it's some characteristic of the defendant that you think might give rise to some prejudicial reaction?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1744.212,1755.07,"Race is a difficult term to define, but it usually includes not only physical characteristics, but certain ethnic delineations that have certain physical characteristics with it."
1980.79-6624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1768.928,1770.296,Why would that be different?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1780.202,1789.874,"--Because I think, and again, I'm not trying to get into anthropology, I think the classifications would not define all of those... I don't think you could call... say, Germans, and French different races."
1980.79-6624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1789.874,1793.895,Well but what difference does it make whether... why is race significant to your argument at all?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1798.113,1798.58,Well I think--
1980.79-6624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1798.58,1805.903,"If you've got a group of people who may be the object of prejudice within a community, why does it make any difference whether they are black or Iranian, I just don't understand?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1805.903,1807.736,"--Mr. Justice Stevens, you are correct."
1980.79-6624,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1816.809,1819.511,"See, you're suggesting an irrational distinction."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1822.162,1828.016,"--Well, no, I'm trying to say that this Court has ruled in the area of racial prejudice, that I have asked for in this case."
1980.79-6624,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.257,1841.259,How about people with beards?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1850.782,1862.472,"Well, I don't want to get into the dissent of the majority in Ham v. South Carolina, my feeling is as to the beards, if it would be a serious prejudice in the case."
1980.79-6624,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.959,1903.082,"Well, suppose we disagree with you on your... what I'll call a per se approach, that any time counsel asks the question must be... do you lose this case, then?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1903.082,1904.332,"--No, Your Honor, I don't."
1980.79-6624,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1904.332,1910.586,"You think there are special circumstances that... in any event, in this case the question should have been asked?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1910.586,1911.02,Right.
1980.79-6624,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.857,1919.959,But you've lost on that in every other Court?
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1919.959,1927.113,--Because the feeling on that one as to the issue was that they didn't really think the question had to be asked in the first instance.
1980.79-6624,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.811,1955.713,"But you argued to the... this is from the Ninth Circuit, is it?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1955.713,1956.429,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6624,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1956.429,1966.921,"Did you argue this... that even if there isn't a general rule about it, at least in the circumstances of this case the question should have been asked?"
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1966.921,1970.406,"Your Honor, in the brief, I think I presented almost all the points."
1980.79-6624,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1972.289,1976.527,"Well, you presented it and it was rejected that's a sort of a factual inquiry."
1980.79-6624,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1976.527,1983.797,"--I felt, my feeling was even under the factual circumstances of the case, should have been heard... there should have been inquiry as to--"
1980.79-6624,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1983.797,2002.792,Mr. Jones.
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2002.792,2018.568,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-6624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.682,2078.892,"Are we to assume that you... that the United States thinks the, if the question about aliens hadn't been asked there would have been error here?"
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2078.892,2088.08,We don't believe that circumstances of this case provide any substantial basis for asking any more than what the trial court--
1980.79-6624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.08,2088.414,I know.
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2090.499,2092.349,--The question was about illegal aliens.
1980.79-6624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2092.349,2102.124,Was there enough... was this the kind of a case where some kind of a question about alienage or Mexican Americans should have been asked?
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2102.124,2110.611,"Well if the trial court hadn't asked either the question about aliens or illegal immigration, it would be a much closer case."
1980.79-6624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.99,2281.942,"Mr. Jones, can I interrupt for a preliminary question?"
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2295.182,2303.438,"The questions were submitted in writing prior to trial, and therefore the government of course had an opportunity to object."
1980.79-6624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2308.759,2317.096,"So you wouldn't know... the government doesn't take the position that there would have been anything wrong with the judge asking the question, it's just that it wasn't necessary to do so?"
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2317.096,2318.798,--Right.
1980.79-6624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.062,2368.231,"Mr. Jones, let me ask one other question."
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2384.823,2386.859,Certainly not.
1980.79-6624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.988,2511.273,"Well it would have in some other circuits, wouldn't it?"
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2511.273,2514.042,"Well, there's no discretion in some other circuits."
1980.79-6624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.042,2517.844,"That's what I... so it's not, you would even get to the discretion problem?"
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2517.844,2519.229,That's right.
1980.79-6624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.229,2523.164,So you would be losing this case in other circuits?
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2523.164,2524.0,That's right.
1980.79-6624,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.585,2532.856,You would have lost this case before now in other circuits?
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2532.856,2534.056,--That's right.
1980.79-6624,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2534.056,2543.427,"But as the Petitioner points out, every defendant belongs to one race or another, and--"
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2543.427,2544.144,That's right.
1980.79-6624,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2544.144,2551.067,"--and potentially at least, there can be racial prejudice against any race?"
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2551.067,2552.483,As Petitioner also points out--
1980.79-6624,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2552.483,2569.829,"And his claim is, as you know, that whenever defense counsel asks about... asks the jury... requests that the jury be asked about racial prejudice, every potential juror... that it's the judge's obligation to ask these questions."
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2569.829,2572.981,"--Rules 24 suggests the contrary, Your Honor."
1980.79-6624,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2591.358,2591.894,Right.
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2593.527,2594.846,Right.
1980.79-6624,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2600.048,2601.55,And there was no denial of that?
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2601.55,2603.785,That's right.
1980.79-6624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.079,2636.422,"Mr. Jones, supposing you had an ordinary burglary trial, had no racial overtones, and about a week after the Pearl Harbor bombing, and the defendant was a Japanese."
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2641.391,2642.243,Certainly.
1980.79-6624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2642.243,2643.543,Well why?
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2643.543,2654.832,"Because under the circumstances, it would be very likely that jurors would find his... his status as Japanese--"
1980.79-6624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2654.832,2656.351,Fact that he's Japanese.
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2656.351,2659.736,"--somewhat offensive, or at least be very sensitive."
1980.79-6624,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2659.736,2661.338,"You're really moving out, now."
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2662.855,2663.671,Excuse me?
1980.79-6624,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2663.671,2666.206,What about Germans and Italians?
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2666.206,2681.216,"At that point, it seems to me that these two questions underscore the need to allow the trial judge and the district courts to look at the circumstances of the case and determine whether a specific question is necessary or not."
1980.79-6624,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2681.216,2696.928,"Well then, Mr. Jones, you are saying no more, I take it, than that it might be an abuse of discretion to decline to ask the question Justice Stevens suggested to you, not a constitutional per se rule?"
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2696.928,2697.528,That's right.
1980.79-6624,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2697.528,2701.963,You weren't suggesting that there should be a constitutional rule on this?
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2701.963,2702.582,No.
1980.79-6624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2702.582,2704.898,"Well, of course, nobody's arguing the constitutional rule."
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2704.898,2705.348,Excuse me?
1980.79-6624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2705.348,2707.666,Nobody's arguing the constitutional rule.
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2709.735,2713.803,I'm not entirely sure that Petitioner isn't arguing for constitutional--
1980.79-6624,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2713.803,2715.489,Well he's arguing for either alternative.
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2727.213,2727.747,--No.
1980.79-6624,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2729.315,2733.434,"Well excuse me, finish with the Chief Justice."
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2733.434,2739.005,"--The per se rule is, under the circumstances, unnecessary in this area."
1980.79-6624,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2746.159,2760.351,"Well Mr. Jones, you may understand what I'm talking about, whether it's a constitutional rule or a supervisory rule, it would end up in being a per se rule?"
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2763.42,2771.242,"--I think they are arguing that there is a per se rule, at least as to supervisory power, and that--"
1980.79-6624,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2771.242,2775.394,So there is no difference; they just want a per se rule either way?
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2779.682,2781.782,--I think that's... I am inclined to agree with your interpretation.
1980.79-6624,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2781.782,2798.376,"Would you think that would be equally applicable as to the need, now, the need from the defendant's point of view, if the defendant has a substantial criminal record but may want to take the stand?"
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2819.623,2827.228,Well there are constitutional implications to that question that I am not prepared to deal with at present.
1980.79-6624,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2863.569,2875.626,"Well what do you suggest, Mr. Jones, should be the standard by which, if it's not a per se rule, the trial judge should decide whether they will or won't ask the question that the defense counsel requests?"
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2875.626,2890.986,"The standard should be and I think, is, that only when the facts of the case or the nature of the charge suggest that there is some substantial likelihood that racial bias will intrude on the deliberations of the jury."
1980.79-6624,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2890.986,2912.751,"Well counsel here had suggested to the judge, one of the reasons I'd like that question asked in this case is that it's likely to come out during the trial a relationship between this young lady and the defendant in that circumstance, had he done so and the judge still refused to ask the question, would you have thought that was the question?"
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2912.751,2914.118,"A closer question, Your Honor."
1980.79-6624,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2927.178,2974.242,"Well isn't it true, counsel, that in a case such as this involving illegal smuggling of aliens, people of entirely Caucasian background might have quite different feelings; some might be very sympathetic to someone who is smuggling illegal aliens because they could use them for labor on... in agri business, and that sort of thing, whereas others might feel that, you know, we just don't want any people like that in this state."
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,2978.861,2981.063,"That's absolutely true, Your Honor."
1980.79-6624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2992.453,3002.492,"Mr. Jones, you're not... when you conduct voir dire, you're not assuming that everybody has... you're trying to find that one rare person who may have the prejudice and you want to get him off the jury."
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,3015.819,3016.386,--And they would have been--
1980.79-6624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3016.386,3018.521,--what's wrong with trying to find out who they are?
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,3018.521,3018.988,--Okay.
1980.79-6624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3021.94,3025.058,There's no question about Mexicans were asked.
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,3030.01,3036.732,"--Illegal... whether the jurors had any feelings about illegal alien problems, that would prevent them from serving--"
1980.79-6624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3036.732,3049.523,"But some of these people, I'm hypothesizing, may actually be out there, are people who are not concerned about illegal aliens but they just don't like Mexicans, period; legal, illegal, citizen, whatever they are."
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,3051.925,3054.527,"--Your Honor... for sure, I have no doubt that there are, Your Honor, but--"
1980.79-6624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3054.527,3058.246,And what's wrong with trying to find out who they are before you let them sit on the jury?
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,3058.246,3062.248,--They could have found out who they were by asking the questions about aliens.
1980.79-6624,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3100.323,3104.044,"Mrs. Bowling lived in Imperial Beach, did she not?"
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,3104.044,3104.927,That's right.
1980.79-6624,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3104.927,3108.096,"Which is about what, 8-10 miles from the border?"
1980.79-6624,1,25538,george_w_jones,,3108.096,3109.012,Right.
1980.79-6624,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3112.548,3127.357,"What you're saying is that no juror... intellectually qualified to sit on the jury would have thought they were talking about Finlanders or Swedes or South Africans, but only about illegal Mexicans?"
