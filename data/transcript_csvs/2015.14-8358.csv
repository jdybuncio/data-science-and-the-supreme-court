2015.14-8358,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.405,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-8358, Lockhart v. United States. Mr. Zas."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,11.405,40.77,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns the ten-year mandatory minimum prison sentence that Section 2252(b)(2) sometimes requires Federal judges to impose. The statutory language in dispute reserves the severe punishment for a defendant with a prior State conviction for an offense relating to any kind of sexual abuse involving a minor or ward."
2015.14-8358,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,50.335,70.725,"Suppose the conviction had been, under Federal law, the -- the conviction for sexual abuse of an adult and we have the same question: Does the mandatory minimum apply? I take it if it had been under Federal law, then the mandatory minimum would apply."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,70.725,71.6,That's correct.
2015.14-8358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,127.08,139.94,"I -- I don't -- why -- why is it in this case -- it -- it does seem to me that Congress, eight years later, when it wrote the -- the second statute, used the -- the -- the same style and that this very much favors the government."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,143.095,148.675,"Because when this language was first added -- first, it was added in 1994."
2015.14-8358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,148.675,149.185,Yes.
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,149.185,150.22,The Federal predicates.
2015.14-8358,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,239.91,254.5,"How do you say it works now for the manufacturing and distribution offenses? We have your position on the possession -- well, you said there's a disparity between a Federal conviction and a State conviction."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,260.24,260.81,Yes.
2015.14-8358,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,371.155,380.525,"Well, there's another possible explanation for that, because the last item in the list itself involves a great many -- itself involves a list."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,406.355,407.335,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-8358,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,407.76,409.795,So why did Congress put them both in?
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,409.795,422.68,"Well, because I think the first point here is it must be for the same reason it used aggravated sexual abuse at the beginning of the list, which -- which I think both sides agree does no independent work."
2015.14-8358,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,423.805,426.54,"Well, there's something that jumps out."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,480.16,494.365,"Well, first, if you go back to the time this -- this language we're talking about was first added in 1996, that Congress not only knew how to -- how to do what Your Honor is suggesting, that is, to be tracking the Federal predicates exactly."
2015.14-8358,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,518.41,519.79,"I'm sorry, I don't follow that."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,519.935,520.33,Yes.
2015.14-8358,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,520.33,533.96,"As I see it, they did, as Justice Alito said, track pretty much exactly 2241, 42, and 43 in developing the list that they -- they add -- that's before us today."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,535.925,539.25,"Mr. Chief Justice, there are really two responses."
2015.14-8358,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,566.93,568.52,"Well, it could have done it more clearly."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,601.505,614.59,"Two responses, Your Honor. First -- and this goes to the Chief Justice's question as well -- this list does not track the Federal predicates as precisely, I think, as some have suggested."
2015.14-8358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,638.6,641.625,I don't understand how that answers the redundancy question.
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,646.725,655.0,"Well, I -- I disagree with that. I think the government reads the modifying clause out of this statute in terms of doing any operative work at all."
2015.14-8358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,656.39,660.56,I'm not sure how your answer was responsive to Justice Alito's redundancy question.
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,660.56,661.14,It wasn't.
2015.14-8358,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,726.44,739.455,"Mr. Zas, is it possible when you read these three terms, as you say, Congress might have meant to be just trying to pick up every conceivable State statute it could think of."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,794.245,797.1,"Well, I think -- I think Your Honor makes a good point."
2015.14-8358,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,799.06,800.095,Maybe I said that wrong.
2015.14-8358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,804.645,807.66,"It makes sense to me, though. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-8358,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,807.66,822.84,"What? If you read -- if you read them going -- going down, right -- well, what do you think would follow? (Laughter.) What do you think would follow from that understanding of this list?"
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,822.84,836.855,"Well, Your Honor, we have tried to figure out what -- what in the world the difference is between sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct when you give these terms their ordinary meaning."
2015.14-8358,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,847.06,857.21,But just presume with me that abusive sexual conduct is supposed to be -- is supposed to include some things that sexual abuse would not. What do you think follows from that?
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,857.21,871.08,"Well, again, first, even with that assumption, you have this prefatory language to the list here, ""relating to,"" which this Court has -- has defined, has interpreted to be very broad."
2015.14-8358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,874.56,886.88,"When I think -- what I think you would say is that if it's in descending order like that, you don't have to make the third one, which is already less than the second, which is less than the first."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,915.67,916.62,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-8358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,916.62,917.36,Your answer.
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,917.36,918.77,It -- it is the answer.
2015.14-8358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.04,939.36,"But -- but the -- the problem with that is -- maybe I'm wrong, but I think you have conceded that there is no difference between the last two, that it -- it's -- it's not descending."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,963.99,965.58,"Yes, we have, but we don't view it --"
2015.14-8358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.58,966.42,What did you do that for?
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,966.42,969.395,We do not view it as -- we don't view it as a concession.
2015.14-8358,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1010.8,1015.26,"But just to be clear, it's abusive sexual contact, right?"
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1015.26,1016.64,Not in our list.
2015.14-8358,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1018.13,1018.835,(e)?
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1018.835,1020.52,-- the Federal predicates.
2015.14-8358,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1025.22,1025.665,I see.
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1025.665,1027.63,Our list is abusive sexual conduct.
2015.14-8358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1033.69,1046.11,"Well, we might be -- when did they write? We're looking at, call it ""your section,"" which is (a)(4); is that right? Or what is it? It's -- for the three things in it."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1048.965,1049.53,Yes.
2015.14-8358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1049.69,1050.79,"I call it ""your section."""
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1050.79,1051.98,It's the penalty provision.
2015.14-8358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1051.98,1052.23,All right.
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1053.73,1055.215,"You can, Your Honor."
2015.14-8358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1055.215,1063.87,"Your section. Then think of several other sections, which are the one I hadn't thought about which Justice Alito raised."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1079.635,1082.62,"They were, Federal predicates prior to --"
2015.14-8358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1082.62,1082.975,Okay.
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1189.935,1191.445,Well --
2015.14-8358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.445,1194.89,You're not going to tell him he's right. (Laughter.)
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1194.89,1223.79,"I wouldn't do that, Your Honor. The courts of appeals that have addressed this precise question, just -- just so it's clear, none of them -- they've all rejected the idea that I -- that I think starts the premise here, which is that Congress meant to -- meant for courts to interpret these terms by reference to the Federal predicates."
2015.14-8358,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1308.06,1329.95,But your -- your argument is that it is just a coincidence that Congress came up with this list of three terms that are redundant and that just so happen to be almost exactly the same three terms in the same order that appear in the Federal provisions.
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1329.95,1332.65,"No, I -- I -- I don't mean to say that."
2015.14-8358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1342.58,1344.24,They didn't use the same terms.
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1344.24,1344.87,That's -- that's right.
2015.14-8358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.87,1346.11,The third term is different.
2015.14-8358,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1346.11,1346.92,But they used -- they used --
2015.14-8358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.92,1349.62,Do you think it was an accident that the third term was different?
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1349.62,1350.13,No.
2015.14-8358,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1357.7,1382.195,"When they use ""sexual abuse"" and ""sexually abusive conduct,"" they were not -- they -- they had in mind the Federal provisions, but they didn't want those terms in this provision to mean the same thing as they mean in the Federal provision, even though, according to you, there is no generally accepted understanding of the difference between sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1382.195,1383.645,That's right.
2015.14-8358,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1405.55,1410.45,"Sexual abuse is defined, and abusive sexual contact is defined, are they not?"
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1410.45,1413.68,They are -- they are defined in Chapter 109A.
2015.14-8358,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1469.7,1479.24,But why would they be focused on Federal sexual abuse involving adults but not State sexual abuse involving adults?
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1479.24,1497.51,"Because the 1996 Congress was focused on a very specific problem that they identify. And that's the link, the connection between child pornography and other sex offenses against children. So that was their focus."
2015.14-8358,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1514.925,1520.875,"No, but the -- the Federal predicate, the Section 109, I believe it is, does apply to adults as well."
2015.14-8358,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1528.769,1535.905,"Because, I think most importantly, Congress controls the Federal -- Federal crime."
2015.14-8358,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1581.495,1589.155,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. O'Connell."
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1589.155,1617.02,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves two competing canons of statutory interpretation, and there are four basic reasons why we think the government's interpretation is correct. First, Petitioner's interpretation creates an unexplained redundancy where the Court would have to conclude that Congress created a list of three things, two of which are the same. Second, our interpretation is consistent with the only possible reading of Section --"
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.02,1617.7,Excuse me.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1625.66,1636.04,"Under our interpretation, what -- what we've said is that the first category and the third category are logically subsets of the more general category of sexual abuse."
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1636.04,1636.35,Right.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1636.35,1657.34,"But there's a couple of explanations for why Congress may have done that. The first is that, when they added these State law predicates to the Section 2252(b)(1) for the first time in 1996, there already were Federal predicates on the list that included aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, and sexual abuse of a minor or ward."
2015.14-8358,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1716.08,1733.53,"Why do you resist -- why -- why do you resist the argument that what Congress was doing was picking up basically the definitions of the Federal offenses that are worded almost identically? If that's what they are doing, then it's understandable what is meant by all three terms."
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1753.35,1760.53,"Justice Alito, we -- we don't think that Congress was trying to pick up the exact definitions of the three Federal statutes."
2015.14-8358,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1773.34,1775.5,"Yes, they could have done it more clearly, of course."
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1792.78,1797.33,"I don't think there is any difference between those two terms. And -- and Petitioner agrees, which is why --"
2015.14-8358,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1797.33,1799.035,So why did they put -- why did they do that?
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1799.035,1800.13,I think because the --
2015.14-8358,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1800.13,1802.16,Just catchy phrases that came to their mind?
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1802.16,1802.49,No.
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.41,1833.985,"Ward -- a ward can't -- why -- why would you say a -- why would you add ""ward"" if -- if that was the reason for it? Why wouldn't you just say of ""a minor""?"
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1833.985,1836.33,"Well, Congress added ""ward."" And --"
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.33,1836.71,I know.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1837.77,1837.97,Right.
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.06,1845.29,"To achieve what -- what you say they were achieving, it would -- it would have sufficed to say ""minor."""
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1845.29,1846.56,"No, I don't think so."
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.56,1846.77,No?
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1846.77,1855.6,"A minor -- a ward is not just a person who is a minor or a foster child, or a person who's been placed under a guardianship because of mental incompetence or something like that."
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.66,1872.67,But that -- that's not somebody who could not -- who could not give consent.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1872.67,1873.34,Under --
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.34,1879.315,You're -- you're saying the reason for it was they wanted to pick up people who could not consent to the thing.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1882.43,1883.65,No -- no.
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.02,1891.385,Prisoners -- prisoners are deemed incapable of giving consent?
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1891.385,1893.82,"The law has the same sort of operation, yes."
2015.14-8358,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1907.85,1911.45,"And ""concrete"" would mean that, if it was a prison guard and a prisoner --"
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1911.45,1911.665,Right.
2015.14-8358,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1911.665,1914.15,"-- even if the prisoner said, ""Yes."""
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1914.15,1915.19,Exactly.
2015.14-8358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1919.11,1922.71,But a ward -- a ward could also be a 40-year-old person who is incompetent.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1922.71,1923.455,Correct.
2015.14-8358,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1982.34,1982.78,Ms. O'Connell --
2015.14-8358,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1982.78,2001.81,"Is Petitioner right when Petitioner says that it was the Department of Justice's original view that involving a minor or ward, it modified all three categories? That that was -- the first position that the government took and then the government changed?"
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2001.81,2002.61,No.

2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2076.51,2077.36,Surely it shows --
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2077.36,2077.74,-- for Congress.
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2077.74,2083.44,-- that -- that an intelligent person could think that that's what this involved.
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2083.44,2089.495,I assume that the person read this and -- and thought that that's what it meant.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2089.495,2096.46,"And -- and, Justice Scalia, I think that's why the canons of interpretation don't get anybody a hundred percent of the way there."
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2096.46,2097.075,I agree.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2147.27,2154.18,"Justice Scalia, I think if you read the text of the statute once, you may think, I don't know what this means."
2015.14-8358,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2171.81,2190.76,"Well, could I ask about your -- your basic theory as to that, which, if I understand it, says the reason why we shouldn't worry about redundancy you create is because Congress just wanted to make absolutely clear that the sexual abuse was also sexual abuse involving somebody who couldn't consent."
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2244.53,2261.38,"It is, but -- but under a generic interpretation of sexual abuse, any generic definition that a court has come up with, I think one that is a typical one is sexual conduct that uses or misuses or injures a victim so as to cause harm or damage."
2015.14-8358,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2301.73,2321.29,"Well, why not just say -- drop the ""abusive""? Just say ""sexual conduct with a minor or a ward""? Because now you have to deal with the adjective ""abusive."" So how does that get you to consent or no consent?"
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2321.29,2333.46,"I think Congress could have done this without saying abusive, but, you know, the Federal sexual-abuse statute of -- of a minor or ward is called sexual abuse of a minor or ward."
2015.14-8358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2362.995,2367.825,What were the -- what were the other three? You said there were four reasons.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2399.21,2399.69,Okay.
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.69,2401.02,I apologize for that.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2401.85,2403.2,No apology necessary.
2015.14-8358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.2,2404.145,"No, it wasn't."
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2404.145,2425.01,"The second reason why we think the Petitioner's interpretation doesn't make sense is because in the penalty provision for production offenses Section 2251(e), Petitioner agrees that the only way you can read that penalty provision is to include State sexual abuse offenses against adults, because Congress worded it slightly differently."
2015.14-8358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2481.68,2481.78,Yeah.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2482.61,2486.96,That's the -- and the three categories that it created for State sexual offenses.
2015.14-8358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2486.96,2487.11,Right.
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2487.62,2490.875,"Which is not a parallel if -- if you read the word, right?"
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2490.875,2491.99,It's not exactly parallel.
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.99,2493.825,Contact is not conduct.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2493.825,2497.29,I -- I think that's -- that is debatable.
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.81,2503.29,It's debatable that contact and conduct are different words? That's not debatable.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2503.29,2504.57,Not that they're different words.
2015.14-8358,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2517.24,2521.845,"You're not suggesting this is just a scrivener's error, are you? That it was meant to be contact?"
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2521.845,2524.98,I think the -- they both do the same job.
2015.14-8358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2530.41,2531.3,"Fourth, fourth."
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2531.3,2549.1,"The fourth is that Petitioner's interpretation would frustrate the purpose of the statute because under the categorical approach, it would exclude as predicates any sexual abuse crimes that were committed against children if the defendant was convicted under a generally applicable sexual-abuse statute."
2015.14-8358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2549.1,2549.33,Okay.
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.15,2596.46,I knew you were going to say that. (Laughter.)
2015.14-8358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2596.46,2597.28,Indeed --
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2597.28,2597.53,I knew it.
2015.14-8358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2597.53,2600.625,-- it isn't just a letter from the Justice Department.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2708.135,2710.715,I think there are two things.
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2756.655,2763.485,"Ms. O'Connell, you -- you don't think Congress can leave it to its staff to decide what a statute means, do you?"
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2763.485,2764.44,No.
2015.14-8358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.44,2767.445,Isn't legislative power nondelegable?
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2767.445,2767.91,Right.
2015.14-8358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2771.18,2784.82,"You asked a really quite broad -- I don't know what the 4,000 people over there are doing, if -- if they're not entrusted by their principals to write words on paper that would reflect the general idea. You think they can't do that?"
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2784.82,2794.2,"Justice Breyer, I think it -- as we explained in the brief, it -- it may have just been a useful shorthand way to describe the most serious conducts included in that provision."
2015.14-8358,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2794.2,2794.93,Who is -- who is the author of this?
2015.14-8358,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2794.93,2796.07,I don't know what the hundred people --
2015.14-8358,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2796.07,2796.46,Who is the author?
2015.14-8358,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2796.46,2798.765,-- are doing over there if they're delegating everything to the staff.
2015.14-8358,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2798.765,2808.335,"This -- this -- this letter that so much discussion has revolved around, who was it in the Department of Justice that wrote?"
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2808.335,2812.59,It was the Acting Assistant Attorney General Ann Harkins.
2015.14-8358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2812.59,2825.795,Could you talk about the rule of lenity? Does the rule of lenity apply with the same force when the question is the substantive definition of a crime as distinct from the penalty that's attached?
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2825.795,2826.32,The Court --
2015.14-8358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2826.32,2831.765,"It seems to me there's an argument that it should apply equally, but have we talked about that?"
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2831.765,2840.69,I think the Court has typically applied the same-strength rule of lenity to both substantive provisions and penalty provisions.
2015.14-8358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2840.69,2842.01,That -- that makes a great deal of sense.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2858.545,2860.74,There has not been a distinction in the Court's cases.
2015.14-8358,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2903.22,2908.15,"Well, can I go back to the -- to the language? You know, it's confusing language."
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2957.225,2964.165,There -- I have a couple of different responses. The first one is that the context is the most important thing.
2015.14-8358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3050.7,3050.91,No.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,3060.105,3064.03,2243 is the sexual abuse of a minor or ward provision.
2015.14-8358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3064.03,3064.17,Right.
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,3064.17,3069.9,"2241, aggravated sexual abuse, has a special subsection dealing with very young children."
2015.14-8358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3077.73,3078.15,"Yes, yes, yes, yes."
2015.14-8358,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,3079.21,3081.575,All right.
2015.14-8358,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3082.805,3087.57,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Zas, you have four minutes."
2015.14-8358,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3087.57,3113.19,"Justice Alito, Justice Scalia, and Justice Breyer I think all echoed the same theme, which is, at the very least, this statute is not unambiguously correct, which is the standard language this Court used in Granderson for when the rule of lenity must apply. So under that rule --"
2015.14-8358,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3113.19,3116.125,I don't think I actually said anything about the rule of lenity.
2015.14-8358,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3116.125,3116.705,"No, no."
2015.14-8358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3118.27,3120.66,I don't think he ever mentioned the rule of lenity.
2015.14-8358,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3120.66,3126.58,"But he did say -- he did use the word ""ambiguity,"" and he did say that the statute was poorly drafted."
2015.14-8358,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3134.125,3145.35,"Well, you -- you are making an argument that an awful lot of this big book is -- is subject to the rule of lenity because a lot of it is very poorly drafted."
2015.14-8358,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3145.35,3148.16,"Well, this is -- this is -- this is not just poorly drafted."
2015.14-8358,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3230.465,3241.24,"My problem is, why would they include adults as a predicate for the minimum in Federal crimes but not in straight State crimes."
2015.14-8358,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3241.24,3241.84,Because --
2015.14-8358,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3241.84,3244.66,I know they have done it in other situations.
2015.14-8358,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3244.66,3245.12,Yes.
2015.14-8358,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3245.12,3259.71,"But why here? If they're worried about the abuse of children, why would they not capture every conceivable person or every conceivable abusive act towards kids?"
2015.14-8358,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3259.71,3278.62,"Well, in -- in addition to the fairness and admissibility problems we've identified, Congress reasonably could have determined that people who commit abuse offenses against adults, as bad as that is, don't pose the same level of danger to children."
2015.14-8358,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3278.62,3285.625,"Well, she's saying why -- but they -- they do include the sexual abuse adult when you're talking about prior conviction of a Federal crime."
2015.14-8358,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3285.625,3285.94,Yes.
2015.14-8358,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3285.94,3294.84,"And the answer, I guess, has to be that you -- the drafters know what they're getting into with the Federal crimes, and they have no idea what they're getting into when they're dealing with 50 State crimes."
2015.14-8358,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3295.77,3296.21,That's --
2015.14-8358,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3296.21,3297.42,I'm not trying to put words in your mouth.
2015.14-8358,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3299.575,3301.165,"Your Honor, that's one answer."
2015.14-8358,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3301.165,3304.91,Let's take a -- an offense as to which there isn't much ambiguity: Rape.
2015.14-8358,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3319.695,3326.07,Because Congress was not focused on symmetry in that way.
2015.14-8358,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3351.9,3353.895,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
2015.14-8358,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3353.895,0.0,Thank you.
