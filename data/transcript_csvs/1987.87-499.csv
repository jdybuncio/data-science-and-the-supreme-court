1987.87-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.211,"We'll wait just a moment, Mr. Lefstein, till the court clears."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,15.351,19.154,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,73.848,80.984,Do you mean the opinion was written sua sponte or the holding was that it had no jurisdiction sua sponte?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,85.137,85.718,Okay.
1987.87-499,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,165.819,172.033,"Mr. Lefstein, before you get to that, what exactly do you want us to do with this?"
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,172.033,179.739,"--What we are actually asking, the relief we're asking for at this particular time is that the appeal be dismissed."
1987.87-499,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,179.739,181.731,No more than that?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,181.731,183.49,That's what we're asking for.
1987.87-499,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,183.49,184.571,What happens then?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,184.571,191.778,"Well, then, it would be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings."
1987.87-499,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,191.778,195.127,Wouldn't we have to say that?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,195.127,198.98,"If that was the Court's order, yes."
1987.87-499,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,198.98,205.265,Because I just don't know what position the case is in.
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,205.265,207.976,"Well, the case--"
1987.87-499,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,207.976,216.561,"We have a court that says I don't have jurisdiction, but I decide, and I am at a loss as to what you do with a decision like that."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,216.561,262.762,"--Well, we are requesting for reasons that we've placed in our brief that if we are correct and that is and if the Federal Circuit is correct, that it did not have jurisdiction, that, therefore, the remedy is dismissal, and we've said that actually for a couple of reasons, and one of the reasons is that Colt did not cross petition and, therefore, they're not entitled under prior holdings of this Court, which we've cited, to obtain the remedy of transfer and, of course, the remedy of transfer pursuant to Section 1631 may only be granted if it is in the interest of justice."
1987.87-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,291.302,299.265,What if we decide that the Court of Appeals shouldn't have decided the merits?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,304.921,308.251,To the Court of Appeals?
1987.87-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,308.251,308.952,Yes.
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,308.952,316.388,"Well, you might remand it to the Court of Appeals, but I assume that you would then have to give directions as to what would have to be done."
1987.87-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,316.388,321.792,"Well, I guess the Court of Appeals would have some sense of its own about what ought to be done."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,321.792,325.715,"Well, that's obviously one of the options that this Court could exercise."
1987.87-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.715,329.176,"Well, your motives and ours may be somewhat different."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,352.35,353.261,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.261,356.764,And was it heard on the merits... it was heard on the merits--
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,356.764,357.495,"Well, wait a minute."
1987.87-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,359.716,360.237,--Okay.
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,360.237,361.927,It was argued on the merits.
1987.87-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,373.195,377.308,"And it was your client... well, no."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,385.033,431.864,"The... it was our opponent, Colt, the Defendant, who had a summary judgment entered against it by the District Judge, who took the appeal initially to the Federal Circuit, and then the Plaintiff, Charles Christianson, moved to transfer the case to the Seventh Circuit on the ground that the Federal Circuit did not have jurisdiction, and at that point, the Federal Circuit, after receiving briefs on that question, and presumably considering the whole issue, entered an order which specifically said that we don't... I think the language was probably a three-line order, which said we see no basis for any jurisdiction in our court, and accordingly, and I'm paraphrasing now, we transfer the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit."
1987.87-499,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,431.864,441.229,"Yes, but the only question for us to decide, I gather, is which of the courts was the proper court for which the appeal should have been taken."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,441.229,447.212,"Well, that's obviously one of the questions."
1987.87-499,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,447.212,453.938,"But if we were to decide that, then can't we send back the merits to whichever court we think should have had the appeal?"
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,453.938,457.53,"That's obviously one option, but--"
1987.87-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,457.53,464.105,"If you decide the Federal Circuit had jurisdiction, the Federal Circuit has already decided the merits."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,464.105,470.427,"--Well, if that's your answer, that's one of the approaches that you could take."
1987.87-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,501.138,508.554,"Well, yes, but we told you to brief and argue the second question, the question of jurisdiction."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,508.554,509.633,"That's right, Your Honor."
1987.87-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.165,523.474,"If we decided that first and agreed with the Federal Circuit as to jurisdiction, we could just say then that they shouldn't have decided the merits."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,525.966,526.775,--Okay.
1987.87-499,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,528.808,533.6,There is no question presented as to the correctness of the decision on merits.
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,533.6,536.622,"--Well, there was a question--"
1987.87-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.622,537.683,There is none here.
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,537.683,541.343,"--At the present time, there is not such a question."
1987.87-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,563.47,567.841,"There has never been an appellate opinion on the merits in this case, is that correct?"
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,567.841,568.752,"No, that's incorrect."
1987.87-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.357,587.725,"You do not question that if we decide that the Federal Circuit did riot have jurisdiction, an available form of relief would be for us to simply send the case back to the Seventh Circuit?"
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,588.527,591.826,That is one of the options.
1987.87-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.119,596.471,"Could do any type... oh, I see."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,600.842,617.936,"--Well, the statutory power is under Section 1631, which indicates a transfer if it is in the interests of justice, and, so, we've made some arguments concerning the matter of whether it is in the interest of justice."
1987.87-499,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,617.936,619.676,I renew my question.
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,622.358,626.08,Our preference is that you dismiss the appeal.
1987.87-499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,631.503,641.331,"In other words, you don't want us to let the Seventh Circuit hear the merits if the Federal Circuit had no jurisdiction?"
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,641.331,647.305,"If you agree with us that it's not in the interest of justice to retransfer it,--"
1987.87-499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,647.305,653.657,And the reason you say it's not in the interest of justice is because Colt made some misleading statements in characterizing your complaint?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,653.657,654.889,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,654.889,658.572,But this was the same complaint that two circuits was inartfully drafted?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,658.572,660.002,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,660.002,664.375,"Well, you also make a point they didn't cross petition."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,664.375,684.378,"That's correct, and I think that that's a highly significant point, and because what Colt is really seeking is a form of remedy which is a transfer back to the Seventh Circuit which could get Colt more or less relief than what they received from the Federal Circuit."
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,712.016,713.056,"May I ask, though?"
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,719.08,721.133,I certainly will.
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,757.244,757.915,Let me ask.
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,761.739,762.33,"Oh, yes."
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,762.928,775.387,"What would you say if half way through the trial, you had filed an amended complaint which clearly was predicated on the patent laws and the section that they construed in this case, would there... which court would have jurisdiction then?"
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,787.965,793.079,"I think under the well-pleaded complaint doctrine, the Seventh Circuit would still have jurisdiction."
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,793.079,796.941,You look at the original complaint and you don't even look at any substantive amendments?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,796.941,814.784,"Even if, arguably, you look at subsequent amendments, I think you still have to, under the well-pleaded complaint doctrine, and I think this is explained very careful in the Franchise Tax Board case, you're still dealing with what is the Plaintiff's cause of action."
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,814.784,819.366,"Yes, but those cases really dealt with the question of whether the trial court had federal jurisdiction."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,831.233,831.813,Okay.
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,870.85,874.881,"So that your answer is basically that even thought it might make a lot of sense, that's not what the statute does."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,874.881,876.754,--That's a good answer.
1987.87-499,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,913.607,919.17,"Well, sometimes it's hard to know the answer under the arising under standard."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,932.671,956.666,"I think the concepts of arising under, although we have a hundred years of history with respect to those concepts, nonetheless, I think they are tests which probably any court is competent or should be competent to decide."
1987.87-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1007.768,1011.831,"If we went off on that ground, we would settle nothing except this case."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1011.831,1040.69,"Well, that's certainly so, but I've read several opinions where this Court has said that they decide matters on narrow grounds, but if the Court is going to fashion a decision which is going to address the matter of which Court, in fact, had jurisdiction, then obviously you couldn't go on some type of law of the case argument."
1987.87-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1079.716,1088.171,"Well, the claim is that the case went forward in the District Court solely or principally on the patent issues."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1088.171,1090.603,"Well, the case on--"
1987.87-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1090.603,1095.337,"And, so, it's as though the complaint hadn't been amended."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1095.337,1113.509,"--Well, but, of course, using that analysis would contravene all of the years of teaching on this subject and as it culminated in Franchise Tax Board, which is that we look at the complaint, and the posture in which that issue arose--"
1987.87-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.509,1122.524,"What I'm saying is it's just as though there's an amended complaint filed because if the patent issues, we're predominated."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1122.524,1148.201,"--Well, if that was the case, then we could have had that resolved in Franchise Tax Board because the clear holding in the language of Franchise Tax Board is that even where the only issue truly at issue in the case is the matter that's decided, if that didn't arise in the complaint, if that was a defense, then we don't have jurisdiction, and what we had here was an anti-trust--"
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.201,1163.341,"Mr. Lefstein, suppose there are cases in which there is a tradition of construing federal jurisdiction narrowly, as the federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, but here Congress was concerned about creating a specialized tribunal who would decide patent issues because there was expertise there that wasn't share by the courts around the country."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1175.44,1176.629,--I understand.
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1182.993,1189.449,You think they considered this problem of amended complaints and maybe a case does change its posture as it develops in the trial?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1189.449,1192.68,"I think they did, and what I base that on--"
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1192.68,1197.462,What's the most illuminating discussion of this particular aspect of it that you can point me to?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1197.462,1236.729,"--There is a statement and it's cited in both briefs, and we didn't tag on one further statement to it, but the statement in the congressional reports... I think... I'm not sure if it's the Senate or the House, it states that the test of appellate jurisdiction depends on District Court jurisdiction and that there is arising under jurisdiction in the District Court in the same sense that there is arising under, and I'm paraphrasing now, that there is arising under jurisdiction with federal question jurisdiction."
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.729,1237.42,"Well, I understand that."
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1258.043,1277.825,"I don't recall anything directed to that, and I might add that with the statement I just paraphrased from the congressional record, they then state contrast Coastal States which was a case of the temporary emergency Court of Appeals, which went off on issue jurisdiction."
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1282.427,1289.202,"Mr. Lefstein, you think the majority of members in Congress and the President understood the well-pleaded complaint doctrine?"
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1289.202,1292.715,I hesitate to speak for them all.
1987.87-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1292.715,1294.686,"This is all very fanciful, isn't it?"
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1294.686,1298.039,I can't speak to that.
1987.87-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1302.113,1305.545,"They wrote something that reads very much like 1331, though, doesn't it?"
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1305.545,1306.784,I'm sorry?
1987.87-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.784,1313.77,They wrote something that reads very much like the provision of the statute that uses the well-pleaded complaint doctrine.
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1316.41,1317.211,"Yes, yes."
1987.87-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.591,1321.744,You don't know if they understood the well-pleaded complaint doctrine?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1321.744,1323.347,--I obviously can't speak to that.
1987.87-499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1323.347,1325.888,You think... you want to make a guess about it?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1325.888,1332.112,"It depends what the experience of the lawyers were, who were on these committees."
1987.87-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1352.927,1372.658,"Would it make a whole lot of sense in terms of the theory of the Federal Circuit jurisdiction to say that if a case turns solely on a patent issue, that except for the well-pleaded complaint rule, would be appealable to the Federal Circuit?"
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1388.38,1412.375,"Well, I think it does makes sense, even if we want to ignore what Congress seemingly said, and even if we want to Look at mere policy because what we have is a situation where Congress also said we want to avoid undue specialization."
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1544.571,1548.054,May I ask another question?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1561.982,1562.672,Right.
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1562.672,1575.722,"Does that mean that if there's a single allegation in your complaint, and I know you deny that there is, but under the patent, that that would be enough to... that would be... satisfy in part and, therefore, there would be a federal jurisdiction?"
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1575.722,1576.191,No.
1987.87-499,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.272,1592.833,Correct.
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1592.833,1615.678,"So that you still have to have a genuine arising under case in your complaint, and I think we touch that in our reply brief, but, basically, we have a situation where we have solely an anti-trust case."
1987.87-499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1619.989,1627.275,"Counsel, what should the Federal Circuit have done here in your view when it gets this case back a second time?"
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1627.275,1638.081,We think they should have dismissed it and then Colt could have sought certiorari or they could have sought mandamus against one or both of the Courts of Appeals.
1987.87-499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1638.081,1641.644,Not sent it back to the Seventh Circuit?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1641.644,1643.376,No.
1987.87-499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1645.638,1646.936,Not certified?
1987.87-499,0,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,1646.936,1648.979,I think they could have certified it.
1987.87-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1654.643,1657.365,"Thank you, Mr. Lefstein."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,1659.797,1673.635,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.282,1715.593,Why did it reach those issues?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,1715.593,1720.527,It reached those issues because those are the issues presented to the District Court for summary judgment.
1987.87-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1720.527,1721.707,By?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,1721.707,1723.109,"By the Plaintiff, by Christianson."
1987.87-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.109,1728.601,"Well, didn't the Defendant rely on the patents?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,1728.601,1733.705,"In the summary judgment motion, the argument was made that--"
1987.87-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.705,1736.256,"Well, what about in the answer to the complaint?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,1736.256,1741.82,"--In the answer to the complaint, we did allege patent invalidity in response to paragraph 18."
1987.87-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.673,1781.356,Was there a pre-trial conference or was there just a motion for summary judgment?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,1781.356,1791.804,"--I believe our adversaries have announced a desire to make a motion for a summary judgment at a conference at which we discussed the scheduling of a trial, and, so,--"
1987.87-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1791.804,1796.377,"Well, had there been a pre-trial conference outlining the issues?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,1796.377,1797.666,--There had been conferences.
1987.87-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.2,1805.512,Is that in the record?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,1807.533,1814.028,"It's certainly a notation in the docket of the conference, but I'm not sure whether there was a transcript made."
1987.87-499,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1853.374,1858.968,You say the District Court judgment defines the well-pleaded complaint?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,1858.968,1869.276,"--In setting forth the elements of liability that were imposed, Your Honor, particularly important here because the complaint was so incomplete and poorly drafted."
1987.87-499,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1869.276,1882.984,"1338, I think as your opponent points out, it talks about having original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any act of Congress relating to patents."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,1888.597,1893.3,"We are saying that... two things, Your Honor."
1987.87-499,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1902.556,1913.495,"But ordinarily you think of 1338 as a grant of jurisdiction, and that people should know when the complaint is filed whether the Court has jurisdiction or not."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,1913.495,1925.412,"Ordinarily, and it would be the first issue if the question were state versus federal jurisdiction, but the alternative basis for jurisdiction here would be under the anti-trust laws."
1987.87-499,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1932.476,1939.911,"Yes, but if you take your view, you would never know whether a case was one arising under an act of Congress until you saw the judgment."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,1939.911,1945.025,"--I use the judgment as just one way to interpret the complaint, Your Honor."
1987.87-499,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.998,1959.294,"But lots of times, the theory of a case changes entirely from the time a complaint is filed, and this may have been one of them, till the time judgment is entered."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,1966.929,1979.777,"This is similar to Justice Stevens' question that an amendment, for example, of a complaint is something that comes after the complaint and would change, could change the jurisdiction of the District Court."
1987.87-499,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2016.04,2019.424,What was the ultimate relief granted by the District Court?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2023.585,2024.055,--No.
1987.87-499,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2028.46,2035.393,And wasn't that just a threshold step toward assessing liability under boycott and anti-trust theory?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2035.393,2041.447,"Perhaps a threshold step, but, nevertheless, the result was--"
1987.87-499,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2041.447,2042.198,But the relief--
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2042.198,2044.83,--the validity which we could no longer enforce those patents.
1987.87-499,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2044.83,2054.375,"--But the ultimate relief the Plaintiff was seeking and that the District Court was driving toward was damages under the anti-trust law and boycott theories, was it not?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2054.375,2059.699,"The... well, can I answer that question first with respect to the District Court?"
1987.87-499,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2085.218,2090.95,Are you saying that this case could not have been brought in state court under a state anti-trust law?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2090.95,2097.105,--It could not in the present form.
1987.87-499,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2098.544,2104.599,"I don't know Illinois law, but suppose under New York, the Little-Sherman Act, could this be brought in state court?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2106.419,2111.084,--This case as liability was imposed could not.
1987.87-499,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2117.518,2119.86,No jurisdiction in the state court from the outset?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2119.86,2122.952,"--Because it is a patent case and, therefore,--"
1987.87-499,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2122.952,2123.653,That's your position?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2123.653,2126.655,"--Yes, it is."
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.655,2135.601,"It wasn't your position, though, when you got the complaint because, in fact, your answer to the complaint indicated that you didn't think there was a patent issue."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2135.601,2139.164,"I think it's fair to say we didn't think about it at the time, Your Honor."
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.164,2140.996,"Well, that's what... I mean, there you are."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2149.06,2161.098,"Well, we also had... if you're reading our response to paragraph 18, we also denied the allegation which we interpreted in paragraph 18 to be an assertion of patent and trade secret invalidity."
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.141,2165.23,Denying what?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2175.969,2180.521,"I think that the allegations may not match each other, Your Honor."
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2251.237,2254.69,"Well, that's the end of the well-pleaded complaint doctrine then, isn't it?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2254.69,2256.86,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.86,2266.797,We could call it the well-tried case doctrine because whatever comes out automatically is considered to amend the complaint and whatever the case shows is determined by federal jurisdiction.
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2266.797,2279.306,"If it comes up under 1295, only as regards the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction versus another appellate court's jurisdiction, and it's only at that stage that you have a record in between--"
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2279.306,2283.557,Under 1331?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2283.557,2285.2,"--I think it's consistent, Your Honor."
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.903,2346.65,"Do you have any... I mean, looking to other litigation is really just trying to find out what the complaint historically meant."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2375.09,2380.883,"But a case can change, particularly complex litigation, and, therefore, the jurisdictional basis can change."
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.883,2381.564,Yes.
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2386.768,2388.61,"That's one thing, Your Honor."
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2388.61,2394.553,"So, you don't think that whether there's federal jurisdiction or not is fixed when the complaint is filed."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2398.535,2400.277,It is fixed.
1987.87-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2465.34,2476.856,"Well, counsel, aren't there motions that you might have made during the course of the proceedings to force an amendment of the complaint or force a more definite statement?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2476.856,2478.577,Those motions were available to us.
1987.87-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2479.288,2488.764,"And you didn't make them, and, yet, you want to rely on it as though those things had been done, and I'm not sure that's the way the system is supposed to work."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2488.764,2506.086,"Well, I think Rule 15(b) was written precisely for this situation, that where the parties had not recognized or the Court has not recognized the change in the theory between pleading and trial, that one... de facto, it should be recognized and considered an amended pleading."
1987.87-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2521.386,2529.141,Wouldn't damages at the end of the line be calculated on an anti-trust theory no matter what happened to the patent?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2529.141,2529.761,"Well, they could be."
1987.87-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2530.52,2532.964,Wouldn't they have to be?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2532.964,2534.713,Yes.
1987.87-499,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2630.618,2636.131,The Federal Circuit has not granted jurisdiction in any such case or has it?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2636.131,2639.413,"In the Walker Process case, it's never come up."
1987.87-499,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2642.025,2646.238,"And, in fact, the other circuits have retained jurisdiction in themselves, have they not?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2647.879,2657.906,"The closest case... the only case that I'm aware of is the Handgards case, but... I'm sure Your Honor is familiar with that one."
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2750.755,2764.834,"Mr. Radice, could I ask about... I don't understand how you expect your Rule 15(b) argument to work when the proof shows that there is a patent claim the complaint is deemed amended to conform to that proof."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2785.818,2789.672,"If you are on the Seventh Circuit, you don't get the case until the trial is over and a judgment has been written."
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2789.672,2795.185,And it doesn't arise at the District Court level?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2799.337,2805.81,The District Court I do not believe either has the power nor is there a procedure for the District Court to determine the appellate court's jurisdiction.
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2816.959,2823.612,"--You say there's a constantly shifting jurisdictional basis in the District Court, but it doesn't make any difference."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2823.612,2825.445,Not constantly shifting.
1987.87-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2827.506,2830.558,"Well, what if it started in a state court?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2841.904,2842.805,Whether--
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2842.805,2845.197,Doesn't the District Court have to know what law it's going to be governed by?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2859.466,2870.125,"--On the choice of law question, at least the way the law seems to be developing, the Federal Circuit has taken the position that in areas outside its specialty, non-patent areas, it would apply the law of the circuit."
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2883.332,2884.013,Would apply anyway.
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2884.714,2899.376,"Consistent with that principle is that, and I don't know that there has been a holding to this effect, is that if a regional circuit got a patent issue is it should defer, there's a difference, because it has all the precedent."
1987.87-499,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2899.376,2901.036,"Counsel,--"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2901.036,2904.359,"Contrary to the Federal Circuit's precedent on patent law, and that's--"
1987.87-499,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2904.359,2906.068,"--Counsel, I might have missed it."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2911.722,2912.803,--No.
1987.87-499,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2915.254,2917.167,It's easy.
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2918.577,2923.972,--We are defending that the Federal Circuit had jurisdiction and the rational--
1987.87-499,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2923.972,2925.081,That it did not have it?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2925.081,2932.527,"--That it had jurisdiction, but we say the proper rationale for its jurisdiction was best expressed in the Seventh Circuit's decision."
1987.87-499,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2932.527,2936.278,Cross appeal?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2936.278,2940.902,We did not because we did not submit a cross motion.
1987.87-499,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2940.902,2942.171,"So, my question is, you're not defending it?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2942.171,2944.444,We are defending the result.
1987.87-499,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2947.587,2948.106,You defend the judgment.
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2949.157,2950.239,--We are defending the judgment.
1987.87-499,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2966.659,2989.112,"And you must establish both that the... if you're supporting this particular judgement before us now, you have to say that the Federal Circuit did not have jurisdiction of the appeal in the first place, but it was justified in going on to decide the case under the interest of justice?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,2989.112,2989.712,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-499,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3009.608,3012.139,"So, the Seventh Circuit was right on jurisdiction."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3012.139,3012.728,Exactly.
1987.87-499,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3012.728,3019.303,"The Federal Circuit was wrong, but since the Federal Circuit decided it and since you feel it had jurisdiction, then you support the judgment."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3019.303,3020.404,That is precisely our position.
1987.87-499,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3020.404,3024.608,Do we have to rule on both of them?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3024.608,3027.878,I think--
1987.87-499,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3027.878,3029.641,You rely on the Seventh in that.
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3031.811,3040.387,"--I think whichever way you rule, you necessarily rule on the other position because if the Federal Circuit had jurisdiction here, the Seventh--"
1987.87-499,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3040.387,3041.218,Confusion.
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3041.699,3042.237,--No.
1987.87-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3044.32,3051.045,"You want us to say the reasons given by the Seventh Circuit are correct, but the judgment entered by the Federal Circuit was correct."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3051.045,3052.407,--That's correct.
1987.87-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3052.407,3072.56,"You have suggested the case, and I'm curious and I don't know if this is the law, but in your brief, you cite a case in which there was a patent claim asserted in the complaint, and then, during the course of the trial, the patent theory was abandoned, and the Federal Circuit held in that case that it would look at the later... would not look at the original complaint and they declined jurisdiction."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3087.89,3092.484,I believe because there's been several cases on the subject in the Federal Circuit that's inconsistent.
1987.87-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3092.484,3096.508,"Your opponent didn't discuss those cases, as I read the brief."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3096.508,3105.163,"They cited two or three, maybe both of those go the same way, but I think they have been consistent in recognizing that the amendment affects their jurisdiction."
1987.87-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3105.163,3111.547,"What was the... the Atari case, which was heard en banc, was one that also looked at subsequent developments, was it not?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3111.547,3136.273,"Well, it looked at subsequent developments and in Atari, there was an attempt after the decision to separate the copyright case from which there had been a judgment and the patent part of the complaint and the Federal Circuit essentially held that that attempted separation was not affected."
1987.87-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3150.771,3167.254,"But in that case, at least you quote something your brief, that says they looked at the situation at the time of the appeal rather than the time of the complaint, which is also consistent with your view that you start out with a complaint alleging a patent violation and then later amend it to abandon it, they wouldn't have jurisdiction."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3167.254,3175.329,"They did look at subsequent events, and I think that's... I don't think that does violence to the well-pleaded complaint rule, Justice Stevens."
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3204.106,3222.189,"Well, even if you say that you can use it as a practical matter in this area, you certainly couldn't apply the well-pleaded complaint doctrine generally as far as federal versus state jurisdiction goes in that fashion, could you, because then a federal court would not know during the course of a trial whether it had jurisdiction or not?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3227.142,3229.682,I don't think there's been any inconsistency.
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3241.4,3243.743,"--Well, let's leave patent claims out of it."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3260.073,3264.697,I'm saying that that is the most advisable rule to determine appellate jurisdiction.
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.697,3270.141,The well-pleaded complaint rule does not apply to appellate jurisdictions.
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3273.072,3273.773,It does.
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3273.773,3289.452,"And you're asserting that the principle you're now espousing is what is used in determining whether a federal court has jurisdiction, that you look at how the trial goes, and if the decision is ultimately based on a federal question, it had jurisdiction, and if it isn't, it didn't."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3290.754,3294.736,I'm saying it's not something that changes minute-by-minute.
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3299.069,3302.122,--I'm talking generally and never mind the changing.
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3318.34,3326.347,"--The Court tried a federal question case, in this case, a patent question case, yes, we should look to that to determine appellate jurisdiction."
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3326.347,3329.539,"Do you have any cases, aside from this patent area?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3329.539,3331.34,Not specifically.
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3331.34,3333.183,Any case at all that does--
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3333.183,3334.592,By operation of Rule 15(b).
1987.87-499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3334.592,3338.864,--You have cases that you think the case would say that?
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3338.864,3353.365,"The language of Rule 15(b) amends the complaint, but this situation I don't think could come up under normal federal jurisdiction per se because jurisdiction is determined at the outset."
1987.87-499,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3385.066,3393.83,I agree with you that the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction.
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3404.928,3406.758,I do not think so.
1987.87-499,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3414.725,3417.667,"Yes, but we have not had any appellate review of that decision, have we?"
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3417.667,3421.729,Has had... we both have had appellate review in the Federal Circuit.
1987.87-499,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3480.548,3485.452,"Counsel, help is at hand."
1987.87-499,1,16876,anthony_m_radice,,3485.452,3492.416,I think it raises more questions.
1987.87-499,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3492.416,3496.34,"Thank you, Mr. Radice."
1987.87-499,2,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,3498.741,3512.65,"Mr. Chief Justice, U.S. v. Hohri, which was just cited by Mr. Radice, is a case where there was a transfer, but there was a cross petition."
1987.87-499,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3520.305,3525.208,"Mr. Lefstein, let me ask you one more question about the basic issue we're most interested in rather than what we do with the case."
1987.87-499,2,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,3541.27,3543.259,Yes.
1987.87-499,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3543.259,3545.66,How do you reconcile that with the arising under doctrine?
1987.87-499,2,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,3545.66,3550.054,"Well, because the arising under doctrine simply has to do with our--"
1987.87-499,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3550.054,3553.397,Is that the time the complaint was filed it clearly did arise under the patent laws.
1987.87-499,2,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,3553.397,3554.536,--Okay.
1987.87-499,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3556.619,3558.98,"Because you don't discuss that case in your reply brief, I don't think."
1987.87-499,2,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,3558.98,3559.571,No.
1987.87-499,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3588.31,3589.361,"Well, I'm interested in your answer to the theoretical problem."
1987.87-499,2,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,3604.712,3610.483,"Well, I think that they were looking at what happened when the complaint was filed."
1987.87-499,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3610.483,3613.177,But they dismissed the appeal.
1987.87-499,2,41686,stuart_r_lefstein,,3624.383,3630.047,"Well, there's nothing different about our theory than every case."
1987.87-499,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3700.133,3701.495,"Thank you, Mr. Lefstein."
