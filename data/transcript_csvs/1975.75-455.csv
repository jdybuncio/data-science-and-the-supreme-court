1975.75-455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,18.036,"We will hear arguments next in 75-455, Nader against Allegheny Airlines."
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,37.707,40.468,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,88.427,96.384,"Mr. Robertson, this is not relevant to this case but the reason, airlines bump people is because a lot of people who make reservations do not show."
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,100.065,100.576,"Yes, it did Your Honor."
1975.75-455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,100.576,102.746,But the Civil Aeronautics Board--
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,102.746,110.522,Civil Aeronautics Board approved an industry plan for a no-show penalty but the Airlines did not like it and the public apparently did not like it.
1975.75-455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,111.927,114.58,"No-shows, who were penalized do not like."
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,114.58,116.24,If the no-shows were penalized--
1975.75-455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,116.24,121.433,"But I suspect that there were a no-show program penalty,your client would like that."
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,121.433,140.222,"Well, one of the problem with the no-show plan, that was tried and they have never been able to work this out, is that apparently a lot of the no-shows really are not the fault of the passenger and there is apparently a minority of individual passengers who simply neglect to cancel their reservation or do not show up."
1975.75-455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,161.218,162.976,It is enough to spoil your case.
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,162.976,165.626,I do not think so.
1975.75-455,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,334.366,336.987,"Before you get into your argument, could I just pose this question."
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,345.729,348.164,That is correct Your Honor but the District Court--
1975.75-455,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,348.164,356.764,The court followed -- just to get your request in mind that if you should prevail the relief you ask is that the matter be sent back to the Court of Appeals to decide that issue.
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,356.764,357.898,I believe that would be correct Your Honor.
1975.75-455,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,357.898,361.074,I see.
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,361.074,370.17,"The Federal Aviation Act of course is the organic statute that sets forth in considerable detail, the powers that the Civil Aeronautics Board has to regulate the Airlines Industry."
1975.75-455,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,399.176,403.369,(Inaudible) under the federal law?
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,403.369,419.448,"The judgment under the Federal Law was remanded for additional findings, relating to the details of what happened at the boarding gate and we are going to go back to the District Court in due course and try to ascertain what those proper findings should be under the--"
1975.75-455,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,419.448,424.575,Judgment was -- the ruling was not that you could not get a judgment under Federal Law.
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,424.575,426.739,That is right Your Honor.
1975.75-455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,433.206,435.372,(Inaudible) what the facts turn out to be?
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,435.372,436.25,How the facts came out.
1975.75-455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,509.846,515.384,But the Board had the power to order the airline to behave just the way it did here.
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,515.384,525.714,I do not believe that the Board has any such power to authorize any airline to conceal material faction of public or to deceive any passenger.
1975.75-455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,525.714,531.802,They had the power to authorize the airline or order the airline to establish a no-show policy?
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,531.802,532.833,Yes Your Honor.
1975.75-455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,532.833,535.705,Including overbooking?
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,535.705,539.627,"Well, the point is that we are not complaining about overbooking here."
1975.75-455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,543.253,544.511,I understand your complaint.
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,548.763,550.009,Yes.
1975.75-455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,551.666,553.008,(Inaudible)
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,553.008,558.814,There is a plan under which the Board has approved a program that in effect is overbooking.
1975.75-455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,560.964,565.3,And has the Board addressed the question of whether that program should be announced to the public or--
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,565.3,568.495,"Yes, it is announced to the public set forth in the tariffs, Your Honor."
1975.75-455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,568.495,575.052,And so that if anybody read the tariff would you know that you might -- that there might be overbooking?
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,575.052,587.106,"Yes, and furthermore the Board has made clear that the airline has to disclose to the passenger when he gets this kind of reservation that he might be bumped and that is the genius of this."
1975.75-455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,587.106,589.232,"I mean, in addition to the tariff?"
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,589.232,590.137,In addition to the tariff.
1975.75-455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,610.513,622.537,"Well, when he get this compensation and he is bumped, does not the Board require that he be advised that the compensation is in lieu of common law remedies which he might otherwise have?"
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,622.537,630.677,He must be specifically advised to that -- that is specifically set forth in the regulations.
1975.75-455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,646.964,651.561,What specifically -- what misrepresentation was Judge Fay referring to?
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,651.561,656.774,He was referring to the same thing we have been talking about and the Court of Appeals was it talking about.
1975.75-455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,670.61,673.049,"Court of Appeals call that non-representation, I think that--"
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,673.049,673.386,Yes.
1975.75-455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,682.12,696.579,"But what you are saying in affect permeating your whole case is the idea that people who travel on airlines more than, once or twice in their lives do not all ready know all of this as a practical matter, that is--"
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,696.579,698.579,"Yes, that is absolutely right."
1975.75-455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,726.384,732.118,This is something in the nature of an assumption to risk defense.
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,732.118,732.393,Yes.
1975.75-455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,732.508,745.038,"It is something, I had to wait -- I read the papers but I did not know Mr. Nader got bumped until I read the pleadings in this case or until petition for cert, I guess was filed."
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,749.144,750.238,I do not know.
1975.75-455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,753.963,755.877,That is one thing that remains to be tried.
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,758.762,760.617,"Well, I mean--"
1975.75-455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,760.617,764.932,"Undertake to show evidence that, I do not know how they do it but they might--"
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,764.932,768.181,"Well, they did try that in the Court, in the District Court did fight for them."
1975.75-455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,768.181,769.747,A poll of passengers.
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,769.747,782.254,The District Court made an affirmative finding that Mr. Nader's reliance was a reasonable one here that he did expect that this was an assurance of accommodation on the flight and in fact--
1975.75-455,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,782.254,786.517,(Inaudible).
1975.75-455,0,40295,reuben_b_robertson_iii,,786.517,788.431,I do not recall Your Honor. (Voice Overlap)
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1425.747,1429.854,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-455,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1501.702,1503.041,If what?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1503.041,1509.974,If notice is given to the public overbooking is going to have to stop.
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1526.053,1531.507,"Well, if he is approved precisely that kind of a tariff in that Eastern Airlines plan?"
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1531.507,1555.831,"Sir, that is a very special kind of a plan whereby Eastern tells you in advance that you might not and you therefore choose to go out to the airport because you really do not want to get anywhere necessarily at that time and if you do not get that flight, you can get some other flight and you get it free."
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1565.029,1565.701,Reservation?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1565.701,1566.218,That is right.
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1568.765,1570.239,Mr. Nader got in this case?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1570.239,1570.599,That is exactly the --
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1570.599,1572.842,He had a confirmed reservation when he did.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1572.842,1574.055,That is very true sir.
1975.75-455,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1574.055,1582.919,"They also want to conserve themselves to the privilege of not showing up and not being penalized for it and I suppose that is the other side of that coin, is it not?"
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1582.919,1593.209,"Well, I think there is the other side of the coin but I would suggest you that they are precisely the kinds of questions that the CAB has now been struggling with for 20 years."
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1632.931,1648.781,"Well, I am not sure I understand that, you assert that CAB has power to regulate this practice and to insulate the airlines from these sort of actions."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1650.389,1657.674,We say that the CAB has power to regulate both in the area of overbooking and in the area of notice to the public.
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.674,1664.592,"And then, do you think enough has happened so that these kinds of actions may not be maintained."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1664.592,1665.16,"Well, absolutely."
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.563,1683.046,"If all the Court did was to say that, well, the CAB might be able to do that but it has not done it yet and you certainly have not run and driven any holes through the Civil Aeronautics Board or the Civil Aeronautics Act."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1683.046,1685.804,"Well, Mr. Justice, we say two things."
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1685.804,1699.06,"CAB turned around on that sort of an approach -- the CAB could turn around tomorrow and make it clear, if it had the power to do it as you say it does that the airlines must do this and that we are preempting the issue."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1699.06,1701.426,"Well, that was the Court of Appeals is saying here."
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1720.892,1724.699,Does that not read Section 1106 right out of this?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1724.699,1731.401,"Sir, Section 1106 is precisely the language that went way back 1906 in the Texas Pacific case, do you remember?"
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1731.401,1735.393,It came from and maybe boilerplate but it does say something and it must be--
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1735.393,1749.537,And this Court has ruled on a number of occasions that all it means is that all of your remedies are preserved except for those which are in conflict with the agency determination.
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1764.227,1766.551,(Inaudible).
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1766.551,1767.143,Right.
1975.75-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1767.524,1770.357,It is quite a different case than this.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1770.357,1771.157,"Well, no."
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1772.403,1773.169,It in not different case.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1773.169,1780.446,It is not a different case Your Honor and let me make this very clear to you.
1975.75-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1815.03,1817.48,"Well, but that is induced by the Airlines, is it not?"
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1819.302,1822.724,"Sir, only a very small part of it, we say."
1975.75-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1904.351,1907.442,"Mr. Prettyman, let me interrupt you just a minute."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1932.626,1932.831,What he think--
1975.75-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1932.831,1935.535,I think those two could stand consistently with one another.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1935.535,1951.136,"Well, I respectfully disagree Your Honor because I think that what he is saying is that the -- when he called to make a reservation, they failed to give him notice that he might not get on the flight because of an overbooking situation."
1975.75-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.551,2030.335,(Inaudible)
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2030.335,2031.266,Sir?
1975.75-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2031.266,2032.281,How about over -- do they--
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2032.281,2036.334,Overbooking is meaningless until it results in an over sale Your Honor.
1975.75-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2036.334,2045.042,"I know, but do they to tell how -- that does not airline tell the board how it as an airline as calculating its overbookings?"
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2045.042,2045.615,No.
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.164,2052.315,An airlines might be reasonable about it and others might
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2052.315,2056.585,"Well, but the statistics show whether they would be reasonable because if their overbooking is--"
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.585,2059.493,How do you know they are being reasonable unless the Airline tells them.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2059.493,2066.261,"Your Honor because if they have too many over sales, it is an obvious indication that the overbooking is not working."
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2081.016,2083.505,Report every month the fellows who are left at the gate.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2083.505,2084.21,"Yes, sir."
1975.75-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.624,2109.92,"When you say the public be told, you mean a general message or notification of people with reservation."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2109.92,2117.761,I think that the notice would be of the kind that he seeks here and that is when you call up.
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.483,2205.295,(Inaudible).
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2207.24,2219.842,"Sir, what they did was have they, if you look at part 250 in the regulations, they have a detailed plan for what happens when you overbook and have an over sale and the second thing you have--"
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.842,2226.271,No Airlines is in violation of any order of the CAB if it does not overbook.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2226.271,2227.99,You mean that if it says that it is overbooked?
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.99,2229.13,No.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2231.205,2233.278,"No, that is absolutely correct."
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.503,2240.728,"No Airlines is in violation to CAB, any CAB order if it overbooks and tells people it is."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2240.728,2244.848,It may go out of business but it is not -- may not in violation of any CAB order.
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2245.501,2251.458,"So are the CAB left the Airlines on their own in this is respect, did they not?"
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2251.458,2262.909,"Sir, I will tell you this, I think that if tomorrow, an Airline began telling the public that they might not get on to this flights, it is a serious question as to whether the CAB--"
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2262.909,2272.954,"You do not have to tell them, it is just that the -- the opposition's position is that you may have to pay a judgment down there."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2272.954,2283.361,"Well, the point I am trying to make is that you and I may argue about the wisdom of both overbooking and denied boarding conversation and notice."
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.995,2327.368,"Mr. Prettyman, may I just interrupt?"
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2327.368,2327.702,Certainly.
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.702,2334.076,Your whole argument proceeds on the premise as I understand it that overbooking really is at stake in this case.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2342.707,2344.166,They might find that there is no common law--
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2344.166,2346.23,Have you conceded that there is a common law of fraud.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2346.23,2347.339,"No, I am not, conceded this common law of fraud--"
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2347.339,2348.364,Is it not correct.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2357.868,2358.366,Well--
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2358.366,2366.284,"In other words, if you hit on every ticket, you would have one chance out of 10, 000, if you do not get there 15 minutes early, that you may be bumped, something like that."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2371.79,2377.327,"The difficulty Your Honor is that, the primary jurisdiction problems enters the case before that."
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2379.634,2384.291,But does it enter it with respect to the question that we have to decide that was presented by the certiorari petition.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2384.291,2386.707,It certainly enters it in the connection with notice.
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.414,2398.987,"I know he is claiming but you certainly are not admitting that that is the only kind of notice that would be an adequate defense to a Common Law fraud case, are you?"
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2398.987,2400.488,"No, that is true."
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.488,2402.089,Well.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2402.089,2419.35,"But the -- the point I do want to make is that when the first -- when the case first comes up and it is first presented in District Court is at the point where this Court seems to me has said in enumerable cases, cases like Ricky for example."
1975.75-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2434.861,2441.532,"What about the CAB certainly has some authority to regulate safety conditions on airplane, does that mean that before--"
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2441.532,2442.968,That would be the FAA but it --
1975.75-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2442.968,2451.672,"Well, okay the FAA, does that mean that before a passenger can sue an airline as a result of an aviation disaster he has to first present his claim to the CAB?"
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2451.672,2458.056,"No, but that is more or like our priority problem here which is a different problem."
1975.75-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2494.683,2496.514,But that is the Federal Law claim?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2496.514,2497.136,That is right.
1975.75-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2497.136,2508.461,"But I am asking you whether in order to maintain a State Law claim for negligence against an airline as a result of a disaster, you have to first go to the CAB and see if they approve it."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2508.461,2529.859,"Well, you do if the question that is involved is whether a particular safety regulation for example, was in effect or was violated or an issue as to a regulation relating to safety, if as soon as that becomes involved, the whole case does not go to the CAB or in that case the FAA."
1975.75-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2542.524,2544.915,"Is that well established in the case, I have not realize that."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2544.915,2567.255,"Well, sir that is what -- that is what the whole line of primary jurisdiction cases that you have established says and that is not anyone of this cases where you get into an interpretation of a board or agency’s regulations or rules that instead of the Court deciding it, it should be set to the agency if the agency has not here before it decided the question."
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2567.255,2569.497,But are there primary jurisdiction cases involving negligence claims?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2569.497,2571.849,Negligence claims?
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2571.936,2574.265,I am not familiar with it neither.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2574.265,2575.201,Yes sir.
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2575.201,2577.832,Not in anti-trust cases I know that of --.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2577.832,2578.115,Yes.
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.528,2667.237,"Suppose Mr. Prettyman, the -- the claim under federal law, under the Federal statute is sustained eventually and that I suppose the -- would you simply --would it be fair to conclude if that happened that --"
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2667.237,2668.669,"What happened sir, I am sorry I did not hear the--"
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.669,2670.73,That the claim under Federal Law is sustained.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2672.95,2673.972,"Yes, but that has been remanded."
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2673.972,2674.607,I understand.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2703.738,2706.728,"Well, that is precisely whether the Court of Appeals ruled as it did."
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2742.873,2758.683,"Well, maybe it just seems to me that it is an awfully difficult thing to claim that you are protected from a State cause of action, because of a Federal Law that you have violated."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2758.683,2762.097,"Because of a Federal Law that we have violated, well, of course our claim is--"
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2762.097,2764.551,(Inaudible) you have violated the priorities?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2764.551,2765.14,Yes.
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2787.303,2802.996,"In the anti-trust area sometimes, an agency has the power to insulate you from anti-trust judgment as long as you do things in the right way but if you do them on the wrong way or you can get sued under the anti-trust law."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2802.996,2808.138,But the priorities have absolutely nothing to with the notice issue that is in the front of the Court now Your Honor.
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2878.447,2889.363,"Let us assume that what the Court of Appeals did here was correct and that this now goes to CAB and the CAB says no, we have never decided this in the past."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2889.363,2890.824,Right.
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2890.824,2902.953,"But now that you ask us, we think we will probably decide it in the future and we can tell you now that we will hold that not giving notices -- notice is all right."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2907.398,2927.722,"Well, I would take this position Your Honor, that if they say that not because of all of the considerations, the balancing considerations that notice should not be given, that that should strongly influence the Court in deciding that in fact there was no fraudulent misrepresentation back in 1972."
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2927.722,2929.652,(Inaudible)
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2929.652,2944.351,"I would personally think it would be determinative but I concede that the Court would have some role to play because it might decide that, simply because of what the Board is deciding now, it does not necessarily preclude it back several years ago."
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2944.953,2946.026,(Inaudible)
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2946.026,2946.689,Pardon me.
1975.75-455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2946.689,2948.715,Would you have a jury trial?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2948.715,2949.775,"Could have jury trial, sure."
1975.75-455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2949.775,2951.004,(Inaudible)
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2951.004,2951.314,Sir.
1975.75-455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2951.314,2954.418,The judge would -- then the judge would not have much to do with it.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2954.418,2955.568,"Well, I well of course--"
1975.75-455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2955.568,2958.335,Would you think that was a jury question?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2958.335,2961.192,"Of course, I would take the position that this would really be a legal question."
1975.75-455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2961.192,2962.149,Right.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2962.149,2967.978,But let me just -- let me make a one point very strongly here to because I am not sure that I have gotten this across.
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3002.29,3005.956,(Inaudible) had informed to the Court of Appeals?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3005.956,3022.523,"When the Court of Appeals decided the Nader case, the CAB informed the Industry of the result and solicited its views in the light of the ongoing investigation that is going on of this entire business of overbooking practices and notices and so forth."
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3022.523,3026.026,"The CAB has not filed anything here, has it?"
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3026.026,3026.568,"No, not here."
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3027.913,3029.154,(Inaudible)
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3029.154,3029.16,Yes.
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3029.16,3030.649,That is in context with the argument.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3030.649,3034.16,"They filed amicus brief supporting, fully supporting us in the Court of Appeals --"
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.16,3035.29,Saying what?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3035.29,3040.953,Saying that they thought that they had primary jurisdiction in this area.
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3041.167,3043.932,And did they also say that this is what we meant all along?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3043.932,3045.024,"No, no."
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3046.537,3050.109,That they want them -- maybe have a new swing at it.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3050.109,3063.515,"No, they detailed everything that had gone on in this extraordinary number of orders and backing and filling on this entire problem and the regulations that they have and how they worked the denied boarding compensation out in the notice--"
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3063.515,3066.995,Did the court address both the common law issue and the statutory issue?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3066.995,3067.444,"In both, yes sir."
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3067.444,3068.116,In both.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3068.116,3068.861,Yes sir.
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3068.861,3069.605,Is there--
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3069.605,3071.251,And they said they had primary jurisdiction and--
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3071.251,3074.234,"In the Court of Appeals brief in the record, I wonder."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3074.234,3076.075,That can easily be supplied to the Court.
1975.75-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3076.075,3082.124,"Did they complain, what they meant about saying that you could keep your common law remedies if you did not take that denied boarding compensation?"
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3082.124,3082.363,Yes.
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3160.617,3164.076,(Inaudible) indicate what should happen to this case?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3164.076,3166.261,"Yes, it is thought that it should have primary jurisdiction."
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3166.261,3169.618,"To, I mean on the -- to do what?"
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3169.618,3172.869,To decide what the correct practices should be.
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3173.053,3183.117,(Inaudible) indicate that furthermore if we decide the correct practice should be no notice that therefore there is no cause of action in this case.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3183.117,3185.512,"Well, Your Honor, I cannot go that far."
1975.75-455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3227.118,3230.11,"$25,000 is dependent on punitive damage recovery."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3230.11,3230.296,Yes sir.
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3230.296,3235.046,Which is still another hurdle that they -- conceding they are entitled to punitive damages --.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3235.046,3235.604,"No, no."
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3236.204,3237.764,"As they have a $25,000"
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3237.764,3257.426,"I am saying that if you allow them the option of trying for punitive damages and getting this kind of award, you are doing away with overbooking and as I say with great respect you are putting yourselves, I think in the shoes of the CAB because that is a CAB decision and not your decision."
1975.75-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3257.426,3258.115,I have a question.
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3258.115,3258.96,Yes sir.
1975.75-455,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3258.96,3289.482,"Your friend responded, I will not call it a concession but he responded certainly not negatively that if the tickets, the airline ticket on the back said something to the effect -- that there is one chance in a hundred or maybe two chances in hundred if they wanted to be safe that you will not be accommodated as a passenger on the flight covered by this ticket either because of mechanical failure, bad weather or overbooking."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3296.134,3301.572,"Well, I think the answer sir is certainly would do away with a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation."
1975.75-455,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3315.86,3319.819,And the plaintiff in this case whether he had ever done that?
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3319.819,3322.565,He had been bumped twice before.
1975.75-455,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3322.565,3325.579,But he had made multiple reservations --
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3325.579,3327.441,No asked him.
1975.75-455,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3340.753,3347.324,"Assuming that most people read their tickets, I have been traveling on airlines since they began, I have never read a ticket yet, I do not know what is on them."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3347.324,3350.523,I have not either Your Honor.
1975.75-455,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3350.523,3351.416,"Well, very well."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3351.416,3361.117,"But of course the point I think you are trying to make is if you gave people notice, I mean, if you are just going to give them a formal notice to get away from your fraudulent misrepresentation claim that is one thing."
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3381.048,3387.405,"Mr. Prettyman, could you conveniently arrange to have the members of the Courts supplied with the copies of the brief."
1975.75-455,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3387.405,3387.685,Oh! Absolutely.
1975.75-455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3387.685,3389.15,Applied by the CAB in the Court of Appeals.
