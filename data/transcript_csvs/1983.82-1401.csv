1983.82-1401,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.623,We will hear arguments next in Calder and South versus Jones.
1983.82-1401,0,31320,john_g_kester,,22.709,23.694,Thank you.
1983.82-1401,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,97.337,101.85,"Mr. Kester, does the record show why the husband dismissed his--"
1983.82-1401,0,31320,john_g_kester,,101.85,106.457,"That is not in the record, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1983.82-1401,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,284.088,284.791,--Mr. Kester?
1983.82-1401,0,31320,john_g_kester,,284.791,285.166,"--Yes, sir?"
1983.82-1401,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,285.166,287.728,Did you say that the writer never entered California?
1983.82-1401,0,31320,john_g_kester,,287.728,290.195,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-1401,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.986,309.188,"Well, I didn't understand your statement to have been qualified by the phrase, ""in connection with this story""."
1983.82-1401,0,31320,john_g_kester,,309.188,310.171,I am sorry.
1983.82-1401,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,315.842,320.871,Does the record show how he wrote a story without going to California to get his facts?
1983.82-1401,0,31320,john_g_kester,,320.871,326.524,"Yes, sir, there is evidence in the record that he made a number of long distance telephone calls to California."
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,1635.448,1648.146,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think Mr. Kester's presentation is indicative of the briefs that have been filed in terms of the differences in the perception of the facts of this case."
1983.82-1401,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2085.36,2099.932,"Mr. Ablon, what position would a typical California Superior Court of Los Angeles County take so far as who should pay the expenses for a Florida defendant's deposition being taken?"
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,2106.257,2116.706,"--It is my understanding, Your Honor, that it would be required for... we cannot compel even a named defendant to come from Florida to California for their deposition."
1983.82-1401,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2119.049,2120.392,At your expense.
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,2120.392,2121.657,--at our expense.
1983.82-1401,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.781,2123.719,Are taxed.
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,2123.719,2128.763,"--might be taxable, but that would be resolved towards... to the conclusion of the case."
1983.82-1401,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2195.206,2212.574,"I thought he said... he was stating as a matter of fact that if your corporation which employs you is a party to the suit, but you are not, you have a certain detachment that you lose when you are named a defendant yourself."
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,2516.778,2520.917,"--Your Honor, I believe that that would be the case."
1983.82-1401,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2579.378,2590.827,"I suppose if it has a big article about someone in California, you could expect to sell more copies in California when that... in the issue in which that article appears than you might ordinarily."
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,2590.827,2594.98,"I would think so, Your Honor, and I think that is directed in the Church of Scientology case."
1983.82-1401,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2691.27,2709.31,"As a matter of substantive law, and I suppose this would depend on the law of California, ordinarily an agent is not insulated from personal liability because the principal is liable for his conduct also."
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,2710.778,2722.617,"That's correct as a matter of substantive liability, and here we are not... we may not be talking in terms of agency, because of the element of punitive damages which may be interjected."
1983.82-1401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2890.345,2895.141,"You don't think the printer, for example, would be liable?"
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,2897.983,2899.779,"Well, Your Honor, we would certainly--"
1983.82-1401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2899.779,2900.951,Suppose it was printed in Florida.
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,2900.951,2907.714,"--If it were printed in Florida, and assuming that the printer had no knowledge specifically with respect--"
1983.82-1401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.714,2909.338,"Well, he knew exactly what was in the magazine, what was in the paper."
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,2910.448,2920.801,"--I think that is different, because the printer does not have a responsible part in the publication, and certainly in the publication of this particular article."
1983.82-1401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2932.36,2934.328,What about the newsstand man in California?
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,2934.328,2941.215,"--I think, Your Honor, the same would be applicable, and I think that is covered under the substantive law."
1983.82-1401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.52,2971.5,"Well, what about a newspaper in California that repeated the statements in the Enquirer?"
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,2971.5,2976.514,"I think that might be a different situation, Your Honor, and I think the reason for that difference--"
1983.82-1401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2976.514,2977.279,"Well, it would be, wouldn't it?"
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,2977.279,2978.154,--I think so.
1983.82-1401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3191.084,3202.345,"Isn't it a case about the author of a book that he gets published, and the publisher circulates it around the country?"
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,3204.781,3209.28,"--Your Honor, I think that case would be distinguishable because one would have to look at the competence of the book."
1983.82-1401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3213.45,3226.632,"Let's assume a man wrote a... an author wrote a book and had these very allegations in it that are in this case, and he sold it to a publisher, and the publisher sold it wherever he could."
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,3226.632,3240.111,"I think if that author had reason to believe that the publisher would sell it wherever he could, or would sell it specifically to California, and knowing the contents of that book, there would be every reason and certainly no unfairness."
1983.82-1401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3240.111,3242.14,So this case does concern that kind of a person.
1983.82-1401,1,37657,paul_s_ablon,,3242.14,3243.547,"That kind of a person it would, Your Honor."
1983.82-1401,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3257.213,3262.868,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Kester?"
1983.82-1401,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3262.868,3265.007,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1401,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3265.007,3267.445,"Mr. Kester, I assume you will address the effects argument."
1983.82-1401,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3267.445,3269.475,"Yes, sir, Mr. Justice Powell."
1983.82-1401,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3319.047,3324.685,"You are not suggesting that one who knowingly publishes libel doesn't anticipate harm, are you?"
1983.82-1401,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3324.685,3346.412,"--I am saying that metaphorically we can say that a libelous article is launched and causes harm, but the harm is much more difficult to define, and in products liability cases, Mr. Justice Powell, we have a different standard of liability which matches the different standard for jurisdiction."
1983.82-1401,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3346.787,3350.567,But doesn't that cut the other way?
1983.82-1401,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3364.81,3383.974,"--But I would say exactly for the two cases you cite, Mr. Justice Powell, Gertz says that you do not have strict liability in the First Amendment area in libel cases, and yet in products liability cases that is exactly what you have in the law of most states, a very high standard--"
1983.82-1401,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3383.974,3385.849,But not in all states.
1983.82-1401,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3385.849,3393.83,"--In most states, Your Honor, and in the states where those cases have come up, cases which have never been reviewed by this Court, indeed."
1983.82-1401,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3477.951,3494.133,"When an individual, Mr. Kester, when individuals and a corporation with which they have a relationship are joined in the same posture as defendants, do you think that makes possibly some difference on how the individuals are treated?"
1983.82-1401,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3494.133,3499.585,"I think that we have to do exactly what Mr. Grutman said and what this Court has said, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1401,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3539.288,3540.474,"Thank you, counsel."
