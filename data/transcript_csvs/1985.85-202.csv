1985.85-202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.57,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Offshore Logistics, Incorporated v. Tallentire."
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,12.241,20.913,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case arises from the crash of a helicopter on the high seas."
1985.85-202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,209.836,214.805,"Mr. Jones, how far in towards the shore does the DOHSA come?"
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,216.071,217.338,"One marine league, Your Honor."
1985.85-202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.338,218.09,"Well, how far is that?"
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,218.09,223.911,I understand that's just a little bit more than three geographic miles.
1985.85-202,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.962,362.401,"Well, are you saying that would be true even if Congress intended that state remedies apply?"
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,362.401,368.119,"No, Your Honor, I am still operating under the initial assumption that Section 7 is neutral."
1985.85-202,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.538,377.577,"Though certainly it doesn't look very neutral on its face, and I think that's the problem you have along with the legislative history."
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,377.577,387.183,"--Well, our basic submission here is that Section 7 does not command the enforcement of state law on the high seas."
1985.85-202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.187,481.876,"Well, why should we take Representative Goodykoontz's word as opposed to Congressman Mann's word who apparently drafted the thing?"
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,481.876,519.334,"Well, I think that there is a lot to be said about what Representative Mann had in mind, but let me first point out that for 60 years following the enactment of DOHSA, this language of Section 7 has been treated by all leading admiralty commentators as nothing more than a saving clause, as providing nothing more than that state law may be used where federal law, where the federal remedy does not apply."
1985.85-202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,519.334,521.201,Like the saving to suitors clause?
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,521.201,530.908,"Well, the saving to suitors clause basically is a provision that permits the use of a state forum."
1985.85-202,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,653.453,664.761,Would that be true even if he intended to alter the text in the way that his statements indicated?
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,664.761,675.718,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I think no parsing of the floor debate can make crystal clear what either Representative Mann's intention was or the intention of the House as a whole."
1985.85-202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,870.692,879.115,Has it been authoritatively decided whether or not a DOHSA cause of action can be brought in state courts as well as federal?
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,879.115,891.439,"If by that you mean whether this Court has decided it, I don't think the Court has ever had occasion to, but I think it is generally understood that a cause of action can be maintained in state court."
1985.85-202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.538,919.323,Let me ask about the... what is the support for the statement that the remedy was to be exclusive?
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,919.323,925.429,--I'm referring to the committee reports on DOHSA.
1985.85-202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.429,928.298,Is that the part you quote at page 22 of your brief?
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,933.933,936.635,"Actually, the committee report consists of nothing but letters."
1985.85-202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.635,945.058,"So it is not really a statement written by the committee itself; it is something they put in the report that had been written by somebody who submitted information to the committee, is that right?"
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,945.058,952.913,"The committee reports really contain... really are nothing more than three letters, three or four letters, as I recall."
1985.85-202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,952.913,954.729,And this is a quote from one of those letters?
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,954.729,955.562,That's correct.
1985.85-202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.562,962.049,Is there anything that the committee itself wrote that supports the proposition that the remedy was to be exclusive there?
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,962.049,968.053,The committee really said nothing other than that these letters were the basis for its action.
1985.85-202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,968.053,976.308,"That plus whatever the colloquy is on that that has been quoted in some of the papers, and that doesn't really go to the exclusivity point, as I recall it."
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,976.308,983.212,Floor debate did not go to the act at large; it only was focusing on Section 7.
1985.85-202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.181,994.103,"Going back to your original argument, if I may, for a moment, what... you said that if Section 7 were neutral and so forth."
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1005.542,1033.978,"If DOHSA had never been passed at all, we would be left with the position that we were in in 1919 where the Supreme Court could either deny a remedy altogether, as it did in the Harrisburg, or it could recognize a general maritime remedy for wrongful death as it subsequently did in Moragne, and extend that remedy to the high seas as it decided it was precluded from doing in Higginbotham."
1985.85-202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1043.934,1049.171,But you would not say that there could not have been recognition of a state remedy if there had never been a DOHSA?
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1049.171,1050.773,"Oh, no, oh, no."
1985.85-202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1063.68,1067.632,"And in the absence of DOHSA, what would that uniform admiralty rule have been?"
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1069.984,1071.686,"Well, that would have been up to the Supreme Court to determine."
1985.85-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.686,1081.375,"Well, what about the... what about if there weren't a... if DOHSA wasn't on the books now after Moragne?"
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1081.375,1085.261,I assume this Court would extend Moragne to the high seas.
1985.85-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1085.261,1087.446,And preclude state law?
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1087.446,1089.998,I think that would preclude state law.
1985.85-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.998,1092.85,"Well, does it preclude state law in territorial waters now?"
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1092.85,1095.985,Two Courts of Appeals have so held.
1985.85-202,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1097.586,1106.776,"And Moragne apparently would permit the kind of recovery that is being sought here in territorial waters, as I understand it."
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1110.228,1117.715,"Under the subsequent decision in Godet, the Moragne remedy would allow nonpecuniary... recovery of certain nonpecuniary damages."
1985.85-202,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1117.715,1121.786,So whatever result we reach results in some anomalies.
1985.85-202,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1127.69,1128.423,That is correct.
1985.85-202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1391.91,1398.564,Mr. Hanemann?
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,1398.564,1404.635,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1460.821,1483.853,"Mr. Hanemann, in Section 1 of DOHSA, it says the personal representative of the decedent may maintain a suit for damages in the district courts of the United States in admiralty, and as I glance through the statute here... I would be the first to admit I am not an admiralty lawyer... I don't see anything that seems to authorize a suit in state courts under DOHSA."
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,1483.853,1487.055,"Section 1 is permissive, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1511.004,1513.839,Did The Hamilton involved the DOHSA?
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,1513.839,1515.891,"--Oh, The Hamilton was 1907--"
1985.85-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1515.891,1517.01,Before the--
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,1517.01,1518.143,--Thirteen years before DOHSA.
1985.85-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1518.143,1524.514,--So this Court has never held that a state court has jurisdiction over a DOHSA claim.
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,1524.514,1532.351,"No, it has not, but to the best of my knowledge and research, neither has that position ever been advanced to you."
1985.85-202,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1691.82,1706.061,"Mr. Hanemann, how do you account for the fact that other courts have agreed with the Petitioner and that scholarly writers on the subject have generally agreed with the Petitioner all these years?"
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,1706.061,1710.949,"I don't think they ever took a good look at the legislative history or Section 7, Justice O'Connor."
1985.85-202,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1958.744,1978.74,"Well, I suppose that state law applied to accidents on territorial waters has a more local flavor to it than the extension of the application of state law to accidents on the high seas, maybe hundreds or thousands of miles from shore."
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,1978.74,1989.929,"Well, Justice O'Connor, that is not our case, and I don't presume to trace the outer limits of the effect of your decision in this case."
1985.85-202,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2005.64,2013.977,"Well, but if the accident with the same parties had occurred in the Gulf of Aqaba, I assume you would be making the same argument, wouldn't you?"
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2013.977,2035.243,"I might be if the Louisiana connections were there like they are in this case, because you held in The Hamilton that a statute... and this is a quote from Justice Holmes... a statute giving damages, meaning a state statute, giving damages for death caused by a tort might be enforced in a state court even though the tort was committed at sea."
1985.85-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.0,2081.522,"Mr. Hanemann, in fact, in the next sentence in Justice Holmes' opinion, he says insofar as the objection is based on the admiralty clause, it would not seem to matter whether the accident happened near the shore or in mid ocean."
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2085.925,2087.341,And so do I.
1985.85-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.479,2254.935,"But those cases were certainly the legal environment in which the DOHSA was passed, were they not?"
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2254.935,2259.303,--They were more or less in the same timeframe.
1985.85-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2269.944,2275.246,"But when DOHSA was finally passed, Southern Pacific v. Jensen was on the books as good law."
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2275.246,2281.3,"It was on the books, but if it was there as good law, it wasn't there for long because it was--"
1985.85-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2281.3,2287.47,"Well, it doesn't matter whether it was there for long or not because DOHSA was passed at a particular moment in time."
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2287.47,2287.906,--Yes.
1985.85-202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2371.826,2373.677,"May I ask this question, please?"
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2378.479,2381.848,I cannot remember that.
1985.85-202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2391.473,2392.689,How many people were on it?
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2392.689,2396.608,"As memory serves, it was either 12 or 13, and all were killed."
1985.85-202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2396.608,2403.614,Suppose each of the 13 had come from a different state and each state had different laws?
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2412.553,2416.354,It would certainly be as fair as denying them recovery.
1985.85-202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2416.354,2417.956,It would be as fair as what?
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2417.956,2431.098,It would certainly be as fair as denying them recovery for what the petitioner I think somewhat calls sentimental damages.
1985.85-202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2522.041,2528.362,Are you suggesting there could be no difference in the damages recovered in the hypothetical I suggested for--
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2528.362,2528.812,--Well--
1985.85-202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2528.812,2533.916,--Assume one state provided treble damages and the other state did not.
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2540.985,2544.639,"--Yes, there certainly could be a different measure of damages."
1985.85-202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.052,2567.535,You say the clear majority.
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2567.535,2572.456,"--That's what Speiser said, and that's what you said in writing, in the Gaudet decision."
1985.85-202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2572.456,2573.206,Yes.
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2574.758,2576.224,"Yes, it's less than all."
1985.85-202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2577.276,2586.216,"And some of the... if some of these people came from people that didn't provide for these kinds of damages, they wouldn't get them under your rule."
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2586.216,2589.268,"--They can fall back on DOHSA, and they might not get them."
1985.85-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2610.431,2613.616,"In your view, is it a question of the domicile of the individual plaintiff?"
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2613.616,2616.235,"I think no, sir, Justice Rehnquiest."
1985.85-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2630.059,2643.653,"And so, in a case brought in Louisiana, the federal court sitting in Louisiana would apply Louisiana conflicts laws to decide whether a Florida plaintiff would recover under Florida law or, say, Louisiana law?"
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2643.653,2645.588,I think that's correct.
1985.85-202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2727.257,2729.924,"But under a different statute, isn't it?"
1985.85-202,1,19122,charles_hanemann,,2729.924,2733.293,"--Same statute, Louisiana Article 2315."
1985.85-202,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,2994.01,2996.479,"Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.85-202,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3241.353,3243.443,"--Thank you, gentlemen."
