1967.876,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,25.738,"Number 781 -- no, that one is -- number 876, Eddie M. Harrison, Petitioner, versus United States."
1967.876,0,16683,alfred_v_j_prather,,29.628,33.21,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1495.808,1499.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.876,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1643.692,1656.74,"Do you think, Mr. Beytagh that's -- would that be phrased differently if it were said that the government's use of illegally obtained admissions coerced and in that sense compelled him to take a stand?"
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1659.223,1661.431,I don't think there's any substantial difference.
1967.876,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1849.39,1866.708,"Do you agree that the second trial, without the confessions and without the testimony of the defendants, they couldn't have been convicted in the second trial?"
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1866.708,1871.108,I think that -- I think it would have been very difficult to get a conviction.
1967.876,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1873.241,1877.162,Well doesn't that give you a problem as to coercion?
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1885.969,1888.368,"I don't know who admits that, Your Honor."
1967.876,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1889.388,1893.054,I think what you said first comes close to saying it.
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1912.412,1916.13,"Well, that's -- that's his argument."
1967.876,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1932.281,1940.827,And whether or not -- there's no question here that the prosecutor did this deliberately to get him on the stand.
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1942.463,1944.533,"No, I don't think there's anything at all to show that."
1967.876,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2017.258,2023.554,"Excuse me Mr. Beytagh, that's only White and Samson's statements were thrown out of Mallory grounds?"
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2023.554,2024.03,Yes.
1967.876,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2036.342,2039.206,So all of these then went out initially on Mallory grounds?
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2039.206,2039.687,No.
1967.876,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2039.687,2040.062,No?
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2040.062,2040.928,No.
1967.876,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2042.347,2042.711,I see.
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2042.711,2056.359,"His oral statement given at the jail was given -- he was apprised of what White and Samson had said, and asked if he had anything to say."
1967.876,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2130.292,2135.458,"Now at the second trial, was that a ground of objection to the use of the statement?"
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2135.458,2135.751,Yes.
1967.876,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2135.751,2136.301,It was?
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2136.301,2138.631,"Yes, as I understand it, and --"
1967.876,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2138.631,2146.808,Which is to say then I've got -- defense had real confidence as events turned out.
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2152.558,2154.002,I think that's probably so.
1967.876,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2156.097,2157.793,But it took an en banc hearing.
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2161.859,2163.155,"That's right, and I think that cuts both ways."
1967.876,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2178.533,2179.208,Coerced in any way.
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2179.208,2181.699,Like that.
1967.876,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2181.699,2184.782,"Does not on any ground that they were even coerced, was it?"
1967.876,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2184.782,2187.346,"No, no."
1967.876,2,16683,alfred_v_j_prather,,3341.086,3344.425,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
