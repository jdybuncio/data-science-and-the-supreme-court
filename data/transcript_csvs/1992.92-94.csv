1992.92-94,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.109,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-94, Larry Zobrest v. the Catalina Foothills School District."
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,48.493,52.927,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, may it please the Court:"
1992.92-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,159.236,164.431,"Mr. Ball, before you get too far, just clarify one point for me."
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,182.543,183.084,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.331,208.871,1415 is what--
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,208.871,209.572,Yes.
1992.92-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,209.572,215.206,--Let me ask you a different question about what may just positively be prohibited.
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,225.715,236.23,"We have never... in this case because solely the Federal Establishment Clause was raised, we have not in any way gone into the Arizona constitutional question."
1992.92-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,236.23,241.363,And you haven't litigated the legal as distinct from the constitutional issue.
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,241.363,242.344,I'm sorry?
1992.92-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,242.344,252.042,"You haven't litigated the question of legal entitlement, entitlement under the law and the regulations, as distinct from the constitutional issue."
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,252.042,257.603,"Well, we have not litigated it because, in fact, the process had already gone a great distance."
1992.92-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,261.427,263.31,"No, I'm not necessarily faulting you for it."
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,269.314,300.846,"--No, Justice Souter, but I think it's important that I add there the fact that at the time the parents applied for EHA help to the school district, the... Jim was already enrolled at Salpointe Catholic High School, and the issuance of the individualized education program to him took place in the context of the fact that that's where he was and that the sole problem... the sole problem... and this appears in the individualized education report itself."
1992.92-94,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,308.673,322.233,"Have you taken a look at the statutory provision and the regulations here, and are you... would you conclude that they clearly require the provision of the services in private schools?"
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,322.233,323.014,--Yes.
1992.92-94,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,327.846,330.818,Or does it leave it open to the State to decide?
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,330.818,351.525,"--Well, they don't leave the... the statute doesn't leave it open to the State to decide whether private school children will be included, and the statute also provides and the regulations provide that there will be provision made for the education of children enrolled in all private schools."
1992.92-94,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.592,391.967,Did the school district ever raise any objection based on the regulations or the statute?
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,391.967,392.868,None whatever.
1992.92-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,474.573,479.105,"Yes, but... may I just... perhaps it's too minor, but at least they will have him paying his tuition there."
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,482.067,482.227,No.
1992.92-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,485.92,488.123,"No, no, no, but his parents are paying the tuition now."
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,488.123,488.242,"They did, indeed."
1992.92-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,488.242,492.545,But they will not be paying that tuition to the school if he goes to school someplace else.
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,492.545,496.328,The parents will pay the tuition to the school where their child is enrolled.
1992.92-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,496.328,503.041,"That's right, so that if he doesn't get the interpreter, he won't attend the school, and they won't get that particular tuition."
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,509.147,509.676,Absolutely so.
1992.92-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,509.676,512.047,"And if he can't get it here, he'll have to go to school elsewhere."
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,512.047,512.177,Yes.
1992.92-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,514.27,516.78,And the school would lose that amount of tuition.
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,516.78,518.792,The school would lose that amount of tuition--
1992.92-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,518.792,519.693,Maybe that's not significant.
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,519.693,520.164,--for one child.
1992.92-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,520.164,521.563,But they will lose at least that much.
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,521.563,524.626,"With all respect, Your Honor, I think it is not significant."
1992.92-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,524.626,527.37,"Well, it's probably more than the cost of the interpreter, isn't it?"
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,527.37,531.861,"It is more than the cost of the interpreter, but here's a school with many children."
1992.92-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.546,539.287,"And unless the school loses money on each child, which a lot of schools do--"
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,539.287,539.578,--Yes.
1992.92-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,539.578,542.489,--and the deficit made up out of contributions.
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,542.489,544.632,They had no program for the deaf.
1992.92-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,610.818,632.342,"Mr. Ball, isn't there a slightly different argument which has greater strength here, and that is not that the interpreter is going to inject a religious element that is not there, but that the interpreter is, as I understand it, a kind of necessary functionary for the religious message to get through?"
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,659.22,666.396,"Well, in the first place, the interpreter is indeed, a... the window of communication of religion in the schools."
1992.92-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,709.479,712.541,"Yes, but tape recorders, or whatever the equipment--"
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,712.541,712.712,Yes.
1992.92-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,712.712,722.7,"--was in those cases, I suppose didn't acquire any such aura either, and yet their potential use for the purpose of this kind of communication was forbidden."
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,730.567,733.88,"Well, you bring me back to Meek, Justice Souter."
1992.92-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,750.629,756.944,"Well, how about a hearing aid that is only used during school hours when the school's purpose is religious?"
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,760.046,776.058,"Well, in our case it's used... the interpreter is used for the whole educational program, and there we get to the question of whether the fact that he is used for religious purposes, as well as secular purposes, results in a primary effect advancing religion."
1992.92-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,776.058,780.602,"Well, only because the school has secular, as well as religious, purposes."
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,780.602,780.73,Exactly.
1992.92-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,780.73,798.574,"And what I was trying to suggest is that it seems to me that the interpreter here is pretty much in the category not of the hearing aid that's used during all waking hours and outside the school, but in the position of the equipment which is used only during the school, which was the problem in Meek and--"
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,798.574,806.641,"But it was a problem in Meek, if I may say this, only because the... of the massive size of the program."
1992.92-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,864.441,869.786,"--Mr. Ball, you're not really going to try to reconcile all our entanglement cases, are you, or anything?"
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,877.259,878.03,The answer is that--
1992.92-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,878.03,879.452,"Senator Moynihan's question, what about a map and a book?"
1992.92-94,0,43859,william_b_ball,,879.452,882.875,"--The answer is that I will not, Your Honor--"
1992.92-94,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1230.005,1241.821,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1321.337,1325.09,I'm a little concerned about the interpreter here.
1992.92-94,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1328.874,1329.632,--Yes.
1992.92-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1329.632,1350.465,And he is directed to go to a Catholic school and listen to sectarian theology and then impart it to... I assume he has to listen to it and understand it before he can translate it.
1992.92-94,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1352.977,1354.379,He has to understand the words.
1992.92-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.25,1356.851,"Well, he has to listen to it."
1992.92-94,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1356.851,1357.332,--Yes.
1992.92-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.903,1358.053,He has to listen to it.
1992.92-94,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1365.957,1369.721,"Well, of course, he could turn down the assignment for any reason he chose."
1992.92-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.845,1376.396,This is... does the Federal Government let you do that?
1992.92-94,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1377.126,1380.459,"--Well, he... this is a State government, Your Honor."
1992.92-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1380.469,1381.24,A State government.
1992.92-94,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1383.481,1394.21,He could... typically sign language interpreters have many occasions in which they will hear things that they disagree with and will sign them nonetheless.
1992.92-94,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1549.265,1561.303,"Mr. Bryson, may I ask whether it is clear here that the statute and regulations require the State to provide this service?"
1992.92-94,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1561.303,1564.636,"--The statutes and regulations, Your Honor, do not require it."
1992.92-94,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1591.085,1594.147,That would be consistent with the Federal scheme.
1992.92-94,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1594.147,1594.716,That's right.
1992.92-94,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1594.716,1606.233,"And if Arizona's constitution, for example, prohibited the furnishing of a... of services like this, that wouldn't interfere with the Federal scheme at all."
1992.92-94,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1606.233,1610.126,"Well, there's a provision... the short answer is no, it wouldn't."
1992.92-94,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1664.646,1671.32,"Mr. Bryson, may I just keep you interrupted for a moment more and go back to your point on the primary effects test?"
1992.92-94,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1692.205,1692.446,--Yes.
1992.92-94,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1692.446,1703.041,"--that is, that is really the point of the school as they run it... does it make any sense to try to apply a primary effects test here?"
1992.92-94,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1726.436,1737.093,"I think it does, Your Honor, and that is because what we're concerned with is asking... is, does this benefit itself actually have the primary effect of advancing religion?"
1992.92-94,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1749.853,1750.985,There's no question it has a secular function too.
1992.92-94,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1750.985,1751.135,That's right.
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,1857.562,1861.405,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-94,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1886.442,1895.869,--if the money from the school district went directly to the parents to hire a... an interpreter?
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,1895.869,1896.828,"--We would not, Your Honor."
1992.92-94,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1896.828,1897.389,Why not?
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,1897.389,1929.602,"Because this Court's decision in Witters case has indicated that there's a difference... and we think there is a crucial difference... between a public employee, standing as a public employee in the classroom and in... and conveying religious information to James than if the State on a one-time payment pays his family for a service that he needs because in that case, the person in the classroom conveying religious information is a... is the Zobrest's employee, not the school district."
1992.92-94,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1929.602,1951.678,"So, a public... suppose the interpreter, the sign language interpreter, in a public school is paid on a piecework basis and the... and but that same public person is paid by the parents on a piecework basis to go over to the parochial school."
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,1952.66,1969.49,"I'm not sure I understand the question, but I think the critical distinction is, if I understand the question, is... to me is whether the person in the classroom that's transmitting the religious information is or is not a public employee functioning at public expense."
1992.92-94,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.065,2015.592,"Well, what about the school district just giving money to the parochial school to hire a sign language interpreter?"
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,2015.592,2020.193,"--Of course, that's a different scenario between giving money to the school and the parent, but I will address that one."
1992.92-94,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2059.561,2062.672,"Mr. Richardson, what is the Arizona program here?"
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,2073.172,2073.331,Across the board?
1992.92-94,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2087.192,2090.154,What is... what policy are we looking at then?
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,2090.154,2090.705,--We are looking--
1992.92-94,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2090.705,2095.196,"The policy of the school district, this particular school district in Catalina Foothills."
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,2095.196,2101.26,--We're not even looking at a school-wide policy because these things are so... this particular application is so unusual.
1992.92-94,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2120.354,2133.742,But do you... was it conceded below that Arizona and the school district are required to provide an interpreter to a deaf child?
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,2133.742,2138.567,"--We think it is not conceded, and we disagree with respondents in this... in the position--"
1992.92-94,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2138.567,2142.731,Why wasn't that ever raised or discussed or dealt with?
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,2143.89,2146.372,--We'll explain why.
1992.92-94,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2163.886,2167.335,But the respondent never made the statutory argument?
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,2167.335,2169.438,We did not yet in the case.
1992.92-94,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2169.438,2171.799,Or the State constitutional argument.
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,2171.799,2176.101,We did not yet because we can choose to bring a motion for summary judgment on a particular issue.
1992.92-94,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2186.642,2192.994,"Well, counsel, at page 34 of the joint appendix, it recites your opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction."
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,2192.994,2193.405,Yes.
1992.92-94,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2193.405,2209.537,"And it says the district admits that the EHA requires it to provide for James, as part of a free, appropriate public education, the services of a sign language interpreter so long as James is educated in a nonparochial setting."
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,2221.163,2221.333,Okay.
1992.92-94,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2245.641,2255.207,"Well, the Ninth Circuit made a finding that... made a finding error, at least proceeded on the explicit assumption that this was your position."
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,2255.207,2255.928,--My--
1992.92-94,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2255.928,2264.143,And it seems to me that you're putting the Ninth Circuit and this Court in a very difficult position by trying now to tell us that the argument is still open.
1992.92-94,2,32640,john_c_richardson,,2264.143,2268.577,--I understand that the Ninth Circuit made that statement and that surprised me.
1992.92-94,3,43859,william_b_ball,,3626.063,3627.983,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.92-94,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3684.109,3685.481,"Thank you, Mr. Ball."
