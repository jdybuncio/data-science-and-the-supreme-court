1985.84-1667,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.654,"Mr. Coats, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,6.654,9.522,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.84-1667,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,232.6,233.952,Did his candidate win?
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,233.952,237.987,His candidate did win.
1985.84-1667,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,237.987,241.939,How many students are there involved here?
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,241.939,248.276,"Approximately 600, Justice Marshall, in this school setting."
1985.84-1667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,248.276,251.914,What was the grade or age range of the students?
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,251.914,261.202,"It's a school that has sophomores through seniors, so the youngest would be 14, the oldest would be 18, and they would range in there according to their grades."
1985.84-1667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,352.195,354.445,"Mr. Coats, may I ask you a question?"
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,360.183,364.92,"Well, I want to be very clear on what the context is, because I think that's important."
1985.84-1667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,410.616,420.923,"In your view, would it be permissible, given that setting, for the school board to prohibit the discussion of any religious topics during any campaign speech or any prayer activities?"
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,422.875,426.243,Clearly this is not the case of Bender versus Williamsport.
1985.84-1667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,426.243,427.477,"Well, that's really my question."
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,427.477,429.862,And I think it's important to note that.
1985.84-1667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,444.289,444.739,I understand.
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,446.491,448.607,"Well, the answer is it's not the same case at all."
1985.84-1667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.607,460.048,"Well, what is your answer to my question, whether in your view the school board could prohibit during this particular kind of meeting any discussion of religious topics or any prayer activities in support of a candidate?"
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,460.048,462.433,The answer to your question is yes.
1985.84-1667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,462.433,463.266,You think they could?
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,463.266,465.285,I would think they would be compelled to.
1985.84-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,473.391,487.818,"Mr Coats, would it make any difference in your view if the school had tried to discipline the student for activities occurring at lunchtime or on the school premises after school?"
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,487.818,510.664,"I think in the school setting there could be enclaves of privacy, and I think it is important that this case comes up under the disruptive conduct rule of the district, and that one of the things that the district has found in its disruptive conduct rule is that obscene and profane speech is inherently harmful in a school setting."
1985.84-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,523.324,536.632,"Do you think that the school could, for instance, prohibit the use of so-called four letter words at any and all times the students are on school grounds, before, after, during?"
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,536.632,538.417,--As long as it was a school activity.
1985.84-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,554.276,558.128,"Well, is lunchtime a school activity, when the students break for lunch?"
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,558.128,568.353,"They're under the control, and I think that the school has a definite educational interest in maintaining an environment around the school premises free from vulgarities."
1985.84-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,574.673,588.08,Do you think the school could implement its discipline in this case had there been no school regulation at all on the subject?
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,588.08,593.818,"Clearly, I think procedural due process requires us to have regulations in effect."
1985.84-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,606.978,619.285,Do we have to decide in this case whether the rule was sufficiently specific to give notice to Mr. Fraser of what was prohibited?
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,619.285,623.82,"The Ninth Circuit has struck down the rule, claiming it was overbroad and vague."
1985.84-1667,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,751.003,756.157,"As a matter of fact, wasn't that speech given to a teacher the day before?"
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,756.157,760.042,"--The record on that, it was given, he claims, to three teachers."
1985.84-1667,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,795.082,796.901,He wasn't told by the principal?
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,796.901,800.103,"--Well, the principal didn't know he was going to give a speech."
1985.84-1667,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,805.923,810.375,"Well, I know that, but did the teachers have authority to stop him from making the speech?"
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,810.375,811.661,I think the teachers exercised--
1985.84-1667,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,811.661,819.664,"I'm asking you, did they or did they not have authority to stop him from making the speech?"
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,819.664,824.634,"--They would have authority, for example, to demand that he go to the office."
1985.84-1667,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,840.494,852.036,"Well, it seems to me that if a teacher teaching chemistry tells the child, don't go to dance class, that wouldn't be enforceable."
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,858.106,859.14,I think that there is--
1985.84-1667,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,859.14,860.306,Was it just a teacher?
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,860.306,871.763,"--a significant question of prior restraint, and if the teacher, you know, could ask him... I would think that we would be premature there, in that we did not have a proper basis for disciplinary action until after he gave the speech."
1985.84-1667,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,871.763,874.882,I think what I'm getting at... I'm not trying to be mysterious about it.
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,884.405,885.24,Yes.
1985.84-1667,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,886.74,888.375,"Well, that's what I'm trying to get at."
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,888.375,888.942,Okay.
1985.84-1667,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,895.213,897.915,Right.
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,897.915,908.705,The school district did have a duty to these other students to impress upon them that in this educational activity this type of speech wasn't appropriate in any way whatsoever.
1985.84-1667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1084.802,1097.043,"Mr. Coats, may I just ask on the rule, the rule prohibits disruptive... I mean, material and substantial interference with the educational process, including obscene and profane language."
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,1102.097,1102.564,Yes.
1985.84-1667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1116.273,1121.891,"Of course, we're dealing by hypothesis with speech that's non-obscene for constitutional purposes."
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,1121.891,1126.729,The speech does not meet the standard of Miller versus California.
1985.84-1667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1196.408,1197.758,May I just ask this question about it?
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,1214.52,1216.07,Were there prior cases?
1985.84-1667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1216.07,1224.459,"Anything that would fairly... the question is the same thing, I think, maybe Justice O'Connor was driving at, the fair notice to the student as to whether this speech was covered by this word."
1985.84-1667,0,44169,william_a_coats,,1224.459,1240.002,"I think my response to you was that we have no written decisions in construing this, and that to my knowledge this is the first time that the district had construed its own rule where there was a record kept."
1985.84-1667,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1308.898,1322.889,Very well.
1985.84-1667,1,30727,jeffrey_t_haley,,1324.074,1326.443,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1667,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1423.088,1431.86,Does the school have a written rule that one shall not swear in Latin class?
1985.84-1667,1,30727,jeffrey_t_haley,,1431.86,1435.497,The written rule is the same rule that we're talking about here.
1985.84-1667,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1435.497,1436.014,I know.
1985.84-1667,1,30727,jeffrey_t_haley,,1438.114,1439.533,"Yes, it does."
1985.84-1667,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1439.533,1443.418,That one shall not swear in Latin class?
1985.84-1667,1,30727,jeffrey_t_haley,,1443.418,1446.453,The rule does not say one shall not swear in Latin class.
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3240.683,3243.802,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1667,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3441.248,3443.7,They were passed out to the students?
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3443.7,3446.568,It's available in the school for students to take.
1985.84-1667,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3446.568,3456.108,I know also that a $2 million portrait is also available to me if I put up $2 million for it.
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3460.226,3462.245,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I don't--"
1985.84-1667,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3462.245,3463.295,Yes or no?
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3463.295,3470.35,"--It was available to the students in the office, where they could pick it up without cost and where it was available to them."
1985.84-1667,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3472.969,3475.419,But you had to go to the office to get it?
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3475.419,3479.206,"You would have to go to the office to get it, is my understanding."
1985.84-1667,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3543.899,3548.184,What is a teacher gave this speech at an assembly like this?
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3550.72,3559.908,"--Your Honor, I think if a teacher gave that speech at a school assembly, it would be a proper basis for disciplining that teacher and it would be--"
1985.84-1667,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3559.908,3565.812,"Could he be discharged under the sufficient cause rule, do you think?"
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3565.812,3570.93,"--I would have some question of whether, if it was a first offense and there was no prior offense, whether we would--"
1985.84-1667,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3570.93,3574.566,Assume it was a first offense and he just thought it would be a bright idea and a real clever speech.
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3574.566,3580.42,--The reason why it's difficult for me to respond yes or no is that it is a sufficient cause standard.
1985.84-1667,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3591.943,3602.151,"If the nature of the penalty makes a difference, would you suggest that perhaps in this context maybe you could have called the student in and given him a severe lecture, but maybe not deprive him of the right to graduate?"
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3604.035,3605.42,We didn't deprive him of the right to graduate.
1985.84-1667,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3605.42,3607.822,"Well, I suppose you could have, though, couldn't you?"
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3607.822,3609.339,"Yes, we could."
1985.84-1667,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3623.915,3629.985,"If you're right, and you may well be, under this rule he could have been expelled from school and there'd be no constitutional objection?"
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3629.985,3631.587,--I don't think it's a First Amendment issue.
1985.84-1667,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3637.741,3641.526,But one of the elements of the crime is the fact that it is speech?
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3641.526,3652.584,"--There's no question he's being punished for his speech here, and that that, you know, whether or not we can regulate that speech is clearly a First Amendment issue."
1985.84-1667,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3735.488,3737.357,Your time has expired now.
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3737.357,3738.14,Thank you.
1985.84-1667,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3738.14,3740.726,Some of the Justices may be interested in seeing that booklet.
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3742.059,3742.609,Indeed.
1985.84-1667,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3744.344,3745.311,"It is an exhibit, too?"
1985.84-1667,2,44169,william_a_coats,,3745.311,3748.73,"It's Exhibit B in the record, but I will leave a copy for the Court gladly."
1985.84-1667,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3749.28,3749.73,"Very well, gentlemen."
