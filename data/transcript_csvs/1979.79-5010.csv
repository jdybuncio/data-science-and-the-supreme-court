1979.79-5010,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.574,We'll hear argument first this morning in Bifulco against the United States.
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,12.987,16.445,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-5010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,166.298,180.988,Mr. Barrett I think it's -- in your legislative history discussion you will also take up the time sequence at which the statute was drafted and the time at which special parole was introduced as a concept under the statute.
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,180.988,184.039,Yes I will Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1979.79-5010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,578.168,606.359,"Well, is it fair to infer from your argument that before Congress introduced the concept to the special parole into this rewriting of the drug law, 846 clearly manifested the intent that one who was -- attempted or conspired to violate the law should be punished in the same manner as the one who committed the substantive offense."
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,606.359,607.397,I don't think so.
1979.79-5010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,715.998,726.051,"Well, it could have just dropped 846 and punished on the general conspiracy statute if it wanted to do that in the --"
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,726.051,730.57,The general conspiracy statute would have required a specific term of five years.
1979.79-5010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,800.887,807.447,But of course you have to prove more than just the Congress didn't mandate equality.
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,812.731,829.629,"Well, let me -- let me say this, the -- the suggestion that you've made is that in the initial bills the -- before special parole is added there happened to be this relationship say that -- that the same kind of term was specified."
1979.79-5010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.732,882.34,"Well, why -- why couldn't you equally well say that Congress had thought in 1840s -- in 846, it had made attempt or conspiracy punishable in the same -- up to the same manner as it had the substantive offenses and there was simply no need to tinker with it."
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,882.34,885.876,I'm -- I'm not sure I'm following the thrust of your question.
1979.79-5010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,885.876,903.536,Well that 8 -- 846 was already in -- in existence saying that an attempt or conspiracy could be punished in a manner not to exceed that which could have -- substantive offense could be punished for.
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,903.536,904.453,Right.
1979.79-5010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,904.453,909.741,And after -- then came the special parole terms.
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,909.741,910.022,Right.
1979.79-5010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,910.022,924.079,"And wouldn't it be a permissible inference that Congress simply thought, well, we've already said in 846 that attempt and conspiracy are punishable in the same way 846 is, why fool around with it?"
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,924.079,924.385,Okay.
1979.79-5010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1057.725,1061.534,"But 845 was a substantive offense, wasn't it?"
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1061.534,1072.016,"Yes, but I -- I -- I'm not sure that that really makes much distinction -- difference in that the -- the key similarity between 845 and 846 is they both use reference."
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1088.409,1090.031,Mr. Barrett isn't there this difference?
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1100.671,1101.158,I don't think --
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1101.158,1104.535,So they had to refer to it specifically.
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1106.753,1107.937,(Voice Overlap) I -- I --
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1107.937,1114.3,"-- said that when you sell to a young person well you get twice as long a special parole term, so how could they have done without --"
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1114.3,1132.612,"Well, the -- the statute has provided -- Section 845 has provided, would very well easily have been interpreted twice the special parole because of the fact that it originally provided for a term of imprisonment or fine or both up to twice that authorized."
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.302,1133.323,Well but --
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1133.323,1135.302,-- if they were going to double the special parole term.
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1139.233,1144.368,"I was going to say, I'm a little puzzled by it anyway, because I thought -- I didn't think there was a maximum limit on the special parole term anyway."
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1144.368,1145.262,That's right.
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1145.262,1152.756,"And, so one short of -- I wonder of what they really -- what the really means is that the minimum special parole term should be twice as long."
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1153.046,1153.508,There is a mandatory minimum.
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1153.508,1154.453,-- make any sense.
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1154.453,1156.93,No there is a mandatory minimum of special parole.
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1156.93,1160.059,So doesn't -- isn't the effect of this to double the mandatory minimum?
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1160.059,1160.674,Yes.
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1166.867,1171.339,"I'm trying to remember, is there in substantive offenses, is there a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment?"
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1171.339,1171.997,Yes.
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.174,1178.361,Well then see -- then you did have to deal separately with the special parole term.
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1178.361,1188.972,"Not really, if you said that the -- a person who was subject -- who had violated the distribution to minor section is subject to twice the punishment applicable in the object defense."
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1188.972,1191.759,"But in the object defense, there's no ceiling anyway, was there?"
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1193.403,1195.5,But twice this -- twice the punishment.
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1217.515,1218.307,Right.
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1218.307,1219.858,-- and still no maximum.
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1219.858,1226.094,It would seem to me in drafting there would be more occasions to spell it out in 845 than there is in 846.
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1227.77,1228.212,Yes.
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1232.555,1240.553,"May I ask you another related question, because the -- the text of the -- the entire text to the statute isn't in front of me which I can't find it."
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1245.726,1246.965,No.
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1246.965,1247.977,"There is not I see, okay."
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1247.977,1249.147,Okay.
1979.79-5010,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1309.528,1314.778,"Well, then perhaps you explained it, and I just didn't get."
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1333.435,1341.576,"Twice the mandatory minimum in which special parole is always provided as a mandatory minimum term, always."
1979.79-5010,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1355.594,1356.672,Special parole?
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1356.672,1357.168,Right.
1979.79-5010,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1357.168,1359.94,And so it's twice than the minimum under 845?
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1359.94,1360.645,Right.
1979.79-5010,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1360.645,1362.108,I see.
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1362.108,1362.639,I -- I (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1362.639,1363.796,May ask you another question just to help me --
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1363.796,1364.17,Sure.
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.17,1366.105,-- sort this thing out.
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1379.897,1380.247,Yes.
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.281,1387.796,"Then in other words that authority would be encompassed under 846 and in other word, that would be just generally included (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1387.796,1388.668,I would think that -- it's in first (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1388.668,1393.0,-- imprisonment -- fine -- imprisonment or fine that would include prohibition in (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1393.0,1393.355,Yes.
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1393.355,1397.083,"Why would it include prohibition but not parole, special parole?"
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1397.083,1410.054,"Because I think that that is at 18 U.S.C. 3651 the probation statute provides that a term imprisonment may be probated, but parole is a -- is a different thing in probation."
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1410.054,1410.512,I see.
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1410.512,1416.305,"And my -- my special (Voice Overlap) -- that's the really three concepts here, the probation, there's parole, and the special parole."
1979.79-5010,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1418.499,1420.897,And special parole is peculiar to this legislation isn't it?
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1420.897,1421.197,Yes.
1979.79-5010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1463.497,1465.958,Could you call it imprisonment?
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1465.958,1472.214,"You could call it as potential imprisonment in that -- in that if it's revoked it's imprisonment, but you can't call it imprisonment, no certainly not."
1979.79-5010,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1499.323,1502.186,What's the difference between special parole and regular parole?
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1502.186,1503.74,Okay.
1979.79-5010,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1521.692,1525.951,I know that as a matter of the term and I'm talking about does he report to his parole officer (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1525.951,1533.057,"Oh, (Voice Overlap) The -- the statute doesn't specific, my -- my understanding is that -- yes."
1979.79-5010,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1537.049,1538.586,"Well, that's why I want to know, what the difference?"
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1541.831,1548.625,"I don't -- I don't -- I don't -- well, it's not specified in the -- the statute -- my understanding is that not subject to the way the parole officer wants set it up."
1979.79-5010,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1554.733,1557.126,"So the word, “special” means what?"
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1557.126,1558.891,Special means different --
1979.79-5010,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1558.891,1559.512,I -- [Attempt to Laughter]
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1559.512,1564.756,-- what extra.
1979.79-5010,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1765.222,1779.625,Do you think the doctrine of lenity applies with the monolithic uniform sense to drug crimes and all other crimes or do you think there is a difference?
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1779.625,1783.246,I don't there's difference Mr. Chief Justice on the basis of the crime.
1979.79-5010,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1783.461,1783.803,(Inaudible)
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1783.803,1786.45,"No, I don't -- I -- I think it's with in this Court discretion."
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1812.581,1819.701,"Mr. Barrett before you sit down, could you tell me this, it's your view that the special parole term is not authorized at all."
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1833.04,1838.433,I've never seen expressed the view that special parole is anything but mandatory.
1979.79-5010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1838.433,1839.565,It would -- if it applies (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-5010,0,41070,steven_lloyd_barrett,,1839.565,1844.416,"If it applies, it applies only mandatorily as -- with -- with imprisonment."
1979.79-5010,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1849.034,1852.773,Very well.
1979.79-5010,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1854.311,1857.913,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1979.79-5010,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2689.183,2689.793,Mr. Dalton --
1979.79-5010,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,2689.793,2690.127,Yes.
1979.79-5010,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.127,2697.395,-- do you agree that the -- in a conspiracy case the -- the special parole term must be imposed?
1979.79-5010,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,2697.395,2698.046,Yes.
1979.79-5010,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2706.104,2713.527,And it's a -- do you agree with your brother that that's been a view of a every court that has agreed with your position?
1979.79-5010,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,2713.527,2714.361,"Yes, it has."
1979.79-5010,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2717.859,2722.094,"And your position has been unanimously endorsed in the circuits, hasn't it?"
1979.79-5010,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,2722.094,2724.231,With exception of the -- the Third Circuit --
1979.79-5010,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2724.231,2724.65,(Inaudible)
1979.79-5010,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,2724.65,2726.832,-- no the Third Circuit in fact in that case --
1979.79-5010,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2726.832,2728.505,And then as the District Court --
1979.79-5010,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,2728.505,2729.156,-- in California which --
1979.79-5010,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2729.156,2730.566,-- of California (Inaudible)
1979.79-5010,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,2730.566,2731.788,Exactly which did not go to Ninth Circuit --
1979.79-5010,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2731.788,2733.81,"It is not, and the Ninth Circuit has rule (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-5010,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,2733.81,2737.114,That's correct.
