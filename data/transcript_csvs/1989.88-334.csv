1989.88-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.037,"We'll hear argument now in Number 88-334, John S. Lytle v. Household Manufacturing, Inc.--"
1989.88-334,0,32543,judith_reed,,10.438,13.53,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,96.496,103.752,"Ms. Reed, these were findings in connection, of the sort that are ordinarily made in connection with a bench trial, findings of fact?"
1989.88-334,0,32543,judith_reed,,103.752,104.614,The findings on Title VII.
1989.88-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,198.243,201.755,Interlocutory appeal under 1292(b) by certification?
1989.88-334,0,32543,judith_reed,,201.755,213.844,"--Well, either that or because it now fell within the Cohen doctrine, because it would be effectively unreviewable after trial, which is what we say the import of the Fourth Circuit's holding is."
1989.88-334,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,213.844,217.076,I just want to make sure I under... you said it is likely that it would not have been dismissed?
1989.88-334,0,32543,judith_reed,,217.076,232.565,"I... we believe that under the prevailing view of the law, had he attempted to take an interlocutory appeal, that appeal would probably have been dismissed because it was thought the jury trial orders were not appealable until the conclusion of the trial."
1989.88-334,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,232.565,233.546,I see.
1989.88-334,0,32543,judith_reed,,233.546,244.573,"Now, Petitioner certainly could have proceeded by mandamus, but he was not required to do so at peril of forfeiting his right to ever appeal the denial of the jury trial."
1989.88-334,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,528.052,534.817,"Well, in this... in this case the judge didn't rule on the... on the question of the right to jury trial."
1989.88-334,0,32543,judith_reed,,575.162,581.027,"--Well, if you are referring to Parklane, it is a very different case, Justice Kennedy."
1989.88-334,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,594.878,595.929,But you see my point.
1989.88-334,0,32543,judith_reed,,600.481,608.027,"--The judge... we contend the judge erred, and indeed all parties agree that the district judge erred in dismissing the 1981 claims."
1989.88-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,672.89,678.394,"You mean you can appeal, you can appeal from the judgment entered against you and assign that as a ground of error."
1989.88-334,0,32543,judith_reed,,678.394,679.115,--Absolutely.
1989.88-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,679.115,679.623,Yes.
1989.88-334,0,32543,judith_reed,,679.623,689.861,"That would be our position, that after the conclusion, after final judgment was entered on direct appeal, you could appeal any of the errors that you contend were made, including the error denying the jury trial."
1989.88-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,705.99,707.893,"Thank you, Ms. Reed."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,712.335,716.789,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,823.759,828.831,This is a ground that you think you are entitled to press as a respondent?
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,828.831,838.619,"We do, Your Honor, because we feel like we have raised the issue below, and that's what we intend to argue, and that--"
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,838.619,839.819,"But you, did you--"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,839.819,841.502,--certainly records adequately developed--
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,841.502,843.912,--Have you cross-petitioned?
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,843.912,846.093,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,846.093,852.378,"Well, isn't this different relief than you... than you got below?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,852.378,868.068,"Well, this is... of course Patterson was decided after that, but it is our position that we adequately... raised these issues, as far as the coverage of Section 1981, so that we can make this argument at this stage."
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,868.068,870.89,You argued it before the Fourth Circuit?
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,870.89,881.216,We argued before the Fourth Circuit and in the district court that... that the retaliation claim... it's a little bit different argument with both claims.
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.132,889.911,"Well, had Patterson been decided then?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,889.911,891.273,Patterson hadn't been decided then.
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,891.273,892.864,But you nevertheless were arguing that point?
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,892.864,905.362,"We were arguing the point, and what our position here today is is that we have developed the record on that and that we have adequately raised Pat... the issues that are covered by Patterson--"
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,905.362,908.304,And the court of appeals rejected that.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,908.304,911.486,"--Well, the court of appeals did not rule on that."
1989.88-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.657,936.754,Would the relief you get under... under your Patterson theory be precisely the same as the relief that you are seeking to defend?
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,936.754,944.758,"That's... well, the relief from the standpoint of Section 1981 not covering discharge and retaliation would be the same."
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,944.758,952.224,"Well, what was... the court of appeals ruled on collateral estoppel, didn't it?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,952.224,953.203,That is correct.
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.203,958.326,"Well, that certainly is different than saying 1981 doesn't cover this."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,958.326,964.511,"Well, we would contend, Your Honor, that as--"
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,964.511,970.965,"It may be in result... it may be in result that you, that there just isn't any 1981 claim for one reason or another."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,973.477,982.542,"--Well, we would contend, Your Honor, that as an appellee we would have the right to defend on any matter that was raised in the record."
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.542,985.464,As long as it doesn't give you more relief than you would have had.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,985.464,990.059,"Well, I think the relief would be the same."
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,991.288,991.849,All right.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,992.961,1011.323,"--The additional... the additional point is that... this consideration of an appellee relying on matters that are developed in the record, or raised in the record, is even stronger when there is an intervening decision like the Patterson case."
1989.88-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1011.323,1015.826,Wouldn't you have to amend to get under Patterson?
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1015.826,1020.19,Amend?
1989.88-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1020.747,1023.771,"Your pleadings, your original pleadings."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1026.992,1043.664,"Well, we feel that we would have a right to present the issue at this point in time to the Supreme Court because we've raised the issue below and because the record is adequately developed to consider it, without any amendment."
1989.88-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1043.664,1047.548,But you didn't raise the Patterson issue.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1047.548,1048.326,"Well, we didn't raise the Patterson issue--"
1989.88-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1048.326,1048.677,xxx.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1048.677,1049.448,--per se.
1989.88-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1049.448,1050.289,I see.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1051.999,1068.46,"But we took the position that Section 1981 could not be added to Title VII claims in this case for both discharge and retaliation, and the Section 1981 claims were dismissed based on that argument."
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1068.46,1076.015,"The certiorari papers in this case were filed before we heard and decided Patterson on rehearing, weren't they?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1076.015,1077.255,That is correct.
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1162.012,1177.903,We granted certiorari on the question of whether the violation of the Seventh Amendment was... at what time it should be reviewed on the question presented by the petitioner's question.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1193.965,1201.549,"Well, the point... the reason not to reach that question is because it, you have to consider a constitutional question there."
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1201.549,1202.931,What is the constitutional question?
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1202.931,1205.973,The constitutional question is the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1216.358,1225.584,"But I... the Seventh Amendment, obviously, is a provision of the Constitution, and it guarantees the right to jury trial in a civil case."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1236.952,1244.248,"Well, that is the view that we've taken, and that's the grounds for the Court considering."
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1255.494,1263.101,"Well, was there ever a denial of the motion for new trial, in so many words?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1267.343,1270.044,There was... what there was--
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1270.044,1271.726,All there was was a dismissal.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1271.726,1277.39,"--a dismissal of the Section 1981 claim, which carried with it the right to a jury trial."
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1277.39,1292.831,"Even if you are right about the, this being a constitutional claim that the petitioner has raised, I don't think that the avoidance of constitutional claims is something that we pay much attention to and a question where we have granted certiorari on the question."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1312.703,1328.684,"Well, we have the additional course, Your Honor, we feel like we have developed the issue and that the... the record is adequately developed."
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1332.387,1335.148,You certainly have a right to present them.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1346.307,1356.074,"Well, the additional basis would be the argument that we have with the avoidance of deciding the... a question with constitutional dimensions to it."
1989.88-334,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1356.074,1370.003,"Mr. Dennard, the petitioner argues in a brief that he was wrongfully denied a promotion, discriminatorily denied."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1375.288,1384.942,"Under... of course, under the reasoning in Patterson, some promotion decisions would be subject to coverage."
1989.88-334,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1497.68,1517.692,"I wonder if it wouldn't be advisable to let that question, the extent to which Patterson governs these particular claims, go back to the lower courts in the first instance and just deal with the question we thought we were going to deal with on certiorari."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1517.692,1532.073,"Well, that... Your Honor, we would say that we feel that we have adequately developed these issues along, that would give us a right to have that considered at this point in time."
1989.88-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1532.073,1544.64,"I guess your point is that we have no power to reverse the lower court and to remand it, if... if in fact the Patterson issue should be resolved your way."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1544.64,1552.015,"Well, the... the question of collateral estoppel doesn't even come into play unless you assume that, the error in the case."
1989.88-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1552.015,1562.213,"We certainly don't have to reach Patterson, you would acknowledge this, if we... if we... we don't have to reach Patterson if we find for you on the other point, on the jury trial point."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1568.377,1573.208,"Well, in that situation you would have to consider the constitutional question and consider the--"
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.208,1576.411,"Well, but aren't you defending the court of appeals' judgment or not?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1576.411,1577.012,--We are.
1989.88-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1577.934,1583.146,"It seems to me you have two points, and you are not... you are not separating them."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1608.262,1611.095,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1611.095,1613.447,Let me just test that out.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1631.43,1633.202,I believe you have power to do that.
1989.88-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1723.07,1735.688,"xxx this 1981 suit and the court, for some reason or another, denied a jury trial and then tried the 1981 suit itself."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1735.688,1738.821,"--That would... we would submit that would be a different situation, Your Honor."
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1738.821,1740.931,"Well, but then on appeal the--"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1740.931,1745.115,"On appeal then that could be reversed, but that is not our situation."
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.115,1746.196,--Why isn't it?
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1746.196,1754.912,Because our situation is the situation where you have Section 1981 claims combined with Title VII claims.
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.897,1772.053,"Well, you don't claim that the... you don't claim that the correctness of the dismissal of the 1981 suit wasn't appealable?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1772.053,1779.827,--We don't claim; we realize that--
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.827,1781.599,That is reviewable in that case... in this case.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1785.651,1786.783,--That is correct.
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.783,1788.633,And it was all part of one suit.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1788.633,1791.574,But it's still a different situation--
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1791.574,1793.627,"It isn't... wasn't two different suits, though, was it?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1793.627,1795.839,"--No, not two different suits, but it is--"
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1795.839,1798.65,"And Parklane was two different suits, wasn't it?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1798.65,1800.31,--Parklane was two different suits.
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1823.219,1839.779,"But you say because there were two... because there were two counts in the... two counts in this complaint, collateral estoppel applies, whereas if it had just been a 1981 suit which was lost, then--"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1839.779,1852.878,"--If it was just a 1981 suit and the court proceeded to just try that case before the court, without a jury trial, then that would be a direct violation of the right to a jury trial, and it would be subject to--"
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.878,1865.416,"--Well, I know, but in the court of appeals the court says well, we agree, the trial judge arrived at exactly the right conclusions on the facts of the case, but we have to reverse."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,1870.581,1877.914,"--Well, that's the only... the distinction we have is that we have two different claims involved."
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2007.491,2023.05,"Do you think that would be the routine result if... suppose the trial judge here said... said well, I think you state a good cause of action in both 1981 and 19... and Title VII."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2024.973,2027.765,"--Well, that wouldn't be our case."
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.765,2030.195,"Well, I know, but what if, what if he had said that?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2031.796,2032.567,I believe it would.
1989.88-334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2032.567,2034.888,Then it would not be collateral estoppel.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2034.888,2039.012,Because it violated the Beacon principle.
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2065.056,2068.54,"Well, what do you mean by a good-faith dismissal?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2079.166,2096.306,"Well, the Petitioner claims, I think, that the judges, district court judges, would be inclined to dismiss legal claims based on administrative and personal convenience, which we're distinguishing it certainly from that situation."
1989.88-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2096.306,2103.002,You're really arguing for something of an extension of that language in Parklane.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2134.833,2135.584,That is correct.
1989.88-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.584,2139.266,"But that is an extension of Parklane, of even the dictum in Parklane."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2139.266,2144.81,"Well, we agree that it is not, you know, directly within Parklane, that it's... but within the rationale of Parklane."
1989.88-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.061,2173.628,The only thing that makes that... that argument difficult is... and the Court keeps pressing you on this... I don't see why it wouldn't be just as true if the lower court erroneously denied a jury trial.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2184.367,2189.039,"--Well, that would fly right in the face of several decisions that... that [inaudible]."
1989.88-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.039,2195.614,"--Well, so did this dismissal, which is why it was reversed."
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2195.614,2214.768,"To conclude on Parklane, our position would be that in Parklane the court found that the defendants had a full and fair opportunity to litigate their claims in the prior lawsuit, and that they were therefore collaterally estopped from relitigating factual issues in a second lawsuit."
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2299.742,2312.201,"But, under Rule 41, the trier of fact is entitled to weigh the credibility of the witnesses and make those sort of determinations that the trier isn't entitled to make under Rule 50, isn't it?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2312.201,2325.751,"We recognize that there is a difference in those standards, and... but our position would be that... that we met the directed verdict standard in... by what the judge really did."
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.016,2338.31,"Well, this was after a bench trial on the Title VII action?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2338.31,2339.131,That's correct.
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2339.131,2344.505,"Well, why, why would a district court be saying that as a matter of law?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2344.505,2347.497,"Well, he didn't... the district court didn't say that, Your Honor, we say--"
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2347.497,2348.168,That's the kind of--
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2348.168,2351.251,--that the evidence that was presented would meet that standard.
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2351.251,2355.995,"--Well, but you... the district court wasn't engaged in that sort of an inquiry, was it?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2355.995,2357.076,That is correct.
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.076,2368.463,"So you are asking us now to reweigh the evidence and to... or to weigh the evidence, decide that you should have gotten a motion for a... for dismissal or summary judgment?"
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2368.463,2381.141,"Well that, you know, even the circuits courts, like Hussein, that apply the opposite rule in this situation, would look at the evidence to determine if it would have in fact gone to the jury."
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2383.584,2386.266,But we don't ordinarily make that sort of determination here.
1989.88-334,1,26905,h_lane_dennard_jr,,2390.117,2390.648,--No.
1989.88-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2396.562,2399.223,"Thank you, Mr. Dennard."
1989.88-334,2,32543,judith_reed,,2402.045,2412.373,Respondent urges that this Court avoid a constitutional issue by deciding on the Patterson grounds.
1989.88-334,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2452.211,2471.341,"Excuse me, you wouldn't feel free to argue if we came out the wrong way on the jury trial thing, that by denying you either interlocutory appeal or vindication here we have denied you your constitutional right to a jury trial?"
1989.88-334,2,32543,judith_reed,,2474.043,2478.167,"Well, oh... the constitutional right to a jury trial is implicated here."
1989.88-334,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2486.241,2490.555,"Well, no... I mean, suppose we said collateral estoppel is perfectly fine."
1989.88-334,2,32543,judith_reed,,2513.229,2520.905,"--Well, I think what the court did constitutes a violation of the Seventh Amendment, don't get me wrong."
1989.88-334,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2652.363,2654.567,"Thank you, Ms. Reed."
1989.88-334,2,32543,judith_reed,,2654.567,2655.258,Thank you.
1989.88-334,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2655.258,2655.839,The case is submitted.
