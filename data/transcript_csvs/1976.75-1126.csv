1976.75-1126,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,92.772,"We will hear arguments next in 1126 and 1385, Trans World Airlines and the related case."
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,98.593,102.096,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1126,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,330.006,331.989,To find another job with the same employer?
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,331.989,333.506,"Yes, with the same employer."
1976.75-1126,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,333.506,334.987,Thank you.
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,334.987,347.315,"Hardison was generally able to avoid Saturday work from April, the time he first met with Mr. Kussman, through March, 1969 or up to March, 1969."
1976.75-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,510.151,515.133,"Mr. Feldmiller, before he leave that meeting, was their discussion of that meeting of the possible swap?"
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,515.133,523.308,"Yes, there was a discussion of general swaps; the change of jobs, perhaps in going back to his earlier section."
1976.75-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.308,537.407,Would you explain to me why the swap was not feasible and the reason I asked that question is apparently it must have been assumed when the company indicated willingness to consider giving him his special holidays that they probably betrayed why could never have been swapped yet.
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,537.407,550.873,"Well, the basic difference between the holiday situation, the seven holiday situations and the swap on the Saturday is governed by the realities, I think, of the situation."
1976.75-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,575.404,580.64,What the work there -- I think Judge Webster said there are about 200 people who could have done the work.
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,580.64,593.021,There may have been more than 200 people who could have done the work but none of those people were available within the terms of the collective bargaining agreement because the collective bargaining agreement did not provide for just mere a swaps between employees.
1976.75-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.021,594.198,Did it prohibit swaps?
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,594.198,604.95,"Yes sir, every time Mr. Justice Stevens, there is an opening in the job that opening had to be subjected to the bidding rights of all other employees."
1976.75-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,604.95,615.065,"Well, I understand but why could not -- supposing he had said, I have got a friend that will fill in for me and then the answer would be well, he cannot unless he open the job for bidding, why could not that have been done?"
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,615.065,629.731,TWA was willing to do that and the union was willing to do that but apparently the union did not believe that the bidding would have been available or would have rendered Hardison any relief.
1976.75-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,633.409,634.55,What happens in the company?
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,643.137,652.81,"Seniority in this situation, this distinguishes the case for many of the other cases that have been decided, under the terms of this seniority agreement…."
1976.75-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,652.81,656.854,What provision in the collective bargaining agreement forecloses the swap?
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,656.854,666.332,"That would be the provision that all jobs, all shift assignments are governed by the seniority rights of all employees that would appear…"
1976.75-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.332,674.711,"If I understand all that means is, to find a candidate for a swap, before it can be effectuated, you have got to say, is anybody with more seniority want to do it."
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,676.896,687.866,"Well, I do not think, I do not think that that was not tried in the sense that TWA authorize that to be done; it is the union steward that does this."
1976.75-1126,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,795.245,800.582,Mr. Feldmiller getting back again to the factual framework of this case.
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,811.66,812.785,Yes sir.
1976.75-1126,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,812.785,824.139,"What provision has the company and or the union made, if any, to accommodate the religious views of those who observed the Sabbath on Sunday?"
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,824.139,831.825,"The people who had observed the Sabbath on Sunday, Mr. Justice Brennan, would have been treated exactly like Mr. Hardison was."
1976.75-1126,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,848.279,850.825,Does the record show anything on this subject?
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,850.825,852.446,"No, it does not except..."
1976.75-1126,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,852.446,855.784,Of accommodation of those employees who observe the Sabbath on Sunday?
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,855.784,857.037,"No, it does not."
1976.75-1126,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,857.037,858.055,No?
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,858.055,861.804,Except the fact that they would have been treated exactly the same.
1976.75-1126,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,865.243,866.922,But the record just contains nothing on this.
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,866.922,869.882,No.
1976.75-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,937.977,941.292,But did it have all of the evidence and all of the stipulation?
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,941.292,951.357,"Yes, did not have all of the evidence; it had all of the stipulations many of which Judge Oliver found to be irrelevant and it had a great deal of the testimony."
1976.75-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,952.549,955.73,Everything that the parties thought the Court needed to pass on the case.
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,955.73,962.543,There were some things according to the Federal Rules that were not placed in the record that were important but...
1976.75-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.543,963.684,That nobody had filed them up to Court of Appeals.
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,963.684,970.408,"They did not call upon the Court of Appeals nor the parties, called upon the District Court to apparently send off the rest of the record."
1976.75-1126,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,984.849,986.265,"Well, resume there at 1 o'clock."
1976.75-1126,0,25284,george_e_feldmiller,,986.265,1011.295,Thank you.
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1014.942,1020.493,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-1126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1101.413,1109.691,But Mr. Ratner did not that testimony related to more or less permanent to exchange of jobs as oppose to I cannot work this Friday as there is somebody I can trade with.
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1109.691,1133.787,"The difference is between,(a) I cannot work this Friday which is treated as an emergency situation and which sometimes has worked out and the recurrent or permanent situation which is clear must be handled by the bidding procedure."
1976.75-1126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1206.368,1209.715,The record tell us how they are going to solve the holiday problem.
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1209.715,1216.869,"The record does not tell us how they were going to solve the problem except that they did solve the holiday problem well, in a sense it tells us."
1976.75-1126,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1231.943,1234.199,I thought it was volunteer situation.
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1234.199,1237.1,I am sorry.
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1237.1,1237.591,No.
1976.75-1126,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1237.591,1241.612,If somebody voluntarily gave up or was persuaded to.
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1241.612,1250.793,"Well they were persuaded or induced by extra payments to come in and work on a holiday, he would have gotten extra pay for working on a holiday."
1976.75-1126,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1250.793,1260.963,"What would happen if, two men one Saturday, one on Sunday and they agree that anytime comes up we will switch."
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1260.963,1274.816,"No that cannot be done, you are violating the seniority rights of all the people with seniority over both of the swap."
1976.75-1126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.816,1281.525,"Let me just follow up with one other question, if someone senior objected to that then it would be to swap with somebody else would."
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1281.525,1306.86,No it would not be.
1976.75-1126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1306.86,1310.568,"He says, well I get the toothache and has to got to the dentist it is got to be an emergency."
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1310.568,1319.077,No the fellow who has got toothache and has to go to the dentist is probably going to get sick leave.
1976.75-1126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1319.077,1325.047,"His counsin comes in from out of town that is once in a long time, it has to see in that one day and trade with somebody, you just cannot do that."
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1325.047,1341.374,"Your Honor the one day temporary situation is handled intelligently, sensibly, regularly in this planet was handled for Hardison."
1976.75-1126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1341.374,1348.225,He would not comply with the rules.
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1348.225,1361.559,"Well a three week period of time is more than the company properly felt could be treated as an emergency under the collective bargaining agreement, they were right."
1976.75-1126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1361.559,1376.959,"Well do you think Mr. Ratner that the statute that the Court of Appeals relied on here, permits no adjustment whatever of rights under the collective bargaining agreement."
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1376.959,1393.071,"What do you mean requires, obliteration of rights under a collective bargaining."
1976.75-1126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1393.071,1401.918,"But your response to the questions by Justice Stevens, Justice Marshall has been primarily, it seems to me that there were just now way to do this under the collective bargaining agreement."
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1401.918,1402.337,Right.
1976.75-1126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1402.337,1406.255,As if that were a total and definitive answer in this context.
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1406.255,1545.154,"It is a total and definitive answer in this context only to the questions that I understood Mr. Justice Stevens to be asking, which was, was there a way to accommodate this man by swapping shifts which would not have violated the collective bargaining agreement to which my answer is no."
1976.75-1126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1545.154,1568.143,"You say then the Congress could not by law provide that and an a employer had to adjust for a person who was a member of a religion which prevented him from working on Saturday, but unless it also require such adjustment for someone whose son was playing football or basketball and could not work on Saturday for the same day."
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1568.143,1607.991,"I say that Your Honor, yes that is why our position, I say that if we come to that, if the Court has to come to that, I see no escape from holding that such a statute violates the Establishments Clause."
1976.75-1126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1607.991,1631.475,Let me just finish the thought and then I will leave the point.
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1631.475,1633.292,"Yes Your Honor, that is what I am telling."
1976.75-1126,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1633.292,1638.267,Well It cannot be done if it conflicts with the seniority rights of someone.
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1638.267,1639.89,That is standards that of someone --
1976.75-1126,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1639.89,1642.101,If someone who complaints about it?
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1642.101,1698.725,"Well, the union is there to see to it that the seniority rights of nobody in the plant are taken away from them whether they complaint about it or not, they are to be given the opportunity to exercise their rights under that agreement, if that union does not do that, it is not performing its duty of fair representation."
1976.75-1126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.725,1709.594,"But that is like Robinson-Patman Act conflicts with the Sherman Act, we have that both in the antitrust section of the Code, they both been enacted by Congress even if they do conflict."
1976.75-1126,1,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1709.594,1758.577,"Well, it is possible to read the statute, this statute that is conflicting with the whole rest of Title VII as compelling discrimination on the face of retention of 703(j) which says you shall not prefer any employees because of their among other things religion, you shall not give them a preference, of course Congress could have left that, it could have left 703 unchanged, it could have left as it did 701(a) unchanged with thoughts only about discrimination."
1976.75-1126,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1758.577,1761.773,Mr. Pickett.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,1761.773,1836.149,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1976.75-1126,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1836.149,1846.698,"If they allow Hardison on religious grounds to work four day a week, can they deny four day a week to any other employee?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,1846.698,1853.833,"Deny a request for a four day week, the statute does not address, yes they can."
1976.75-1126,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1853.833,1855.919,They deny it to others.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,1855.919,1936.644,"Yes, that is correct."
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1936.644,1941.213,Put in another way.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,1941.213,1951.844,"The record is absent as to that because this was the first time, this had ever came up Mr. Justice Marshall in TWA’s history at the Kansas City."
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1951.844,1955.068,Well how did they discriminate against him?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,1955.068,1957.584,"How they discriminated against Mr. Hardison, my client?"
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1957.584,1958.274,Uh-huh.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,1958.274,1973.231,"Well, they discriminated against him in a number of ways."
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1973.231,1980.771,And what did Hardison asked for?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,1980.771,1995.193,"Let him work his job, that he was assigned to drive a train and pick up parts and take back used parts, as long as it would not cause him to do his job for TWA and violate his Sabbath, which he had sincere beliefs that he could not violate."
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1995.193,1999.11,And who else has that right at TWA other than him?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,1999.11,2002.276,Any other employee this was the first one.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2002.276,2003.907,Well how about the atheist?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2003.907,2007.218,"Well, the atheist likewise is statute."
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2007.218,2009.653,"I guess he could take off any day, he wanted."
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2009.653,2032.861,"No Your Honor, sincerely Atheism is also encompassed I believe in the Young decision, which does in fact cover persons who in fact have no religion."
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2032.861,2036.634,"I still -- thank you, you are on the point of preference, you want some…"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2036.634,2038.803,It is a neutral application Your Honor.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2038.803,2044.871,"How can it be neutral when he says I want something nobody else has, how is that neutral?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2044.871,2047.889,He does not want something anyone else has.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2047.889,2052.788,"Well he wants Saturday off, does anybody else have Saturday off?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2052.788,2054.572,If they sought…
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2054.572,2059.688,Does anybody else in this record have Saturday off?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2059.688,2068.164,"Those persons who are members of the seniority provisions, who in fact been through Saturday off, those persons that amorphous group that the union says with…"
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2068.164,2075.801,But anybody in his category?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2075.801,2078.053,He had Saturday off for…
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2078.053,2079.818,But he had seniority preference too.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2079.818,2081.219,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2081.219,2084.034,And he surrendered that voluntarily.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2084.034,2086.442,No he did not surrender that.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2086.442,2088.571,He did not surrendered seniority?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2088.571,2099.638,"He did not surrender it, he in fact by way of application of his going to building number two found that he was in less seniority, yes."
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2099.638,2101.567,"Well, didn't he know it, before he went there?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2101.567,2102.774,Yes by all means.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2102.774,2105.003,"Well, then he surrendered it, did not?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2105.003,2107.005,"If you want to use surrender yes, but…"
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2107.005,2110.07,"Well, what word do you like, I will use whatever word you want?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2110.07,2132.271,Alright.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2132.271,2134.224,You could have ignored the agreement?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2134.224,2135.846,"By all means Your Honor, Mr. Justice."
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2135.846,2138.309,The employer could have ignored the agreement.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2138.309,2142.439,"And still met the burden imposed on yet by the statute, yes."
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2142.439,2144.756,What would the union be doing?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2144.756,2147.649,The union was agreeable to four days off.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2147.649,2152.293,Was the union agreeable to waive -- were the union… listen to me.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2152.293,2153.255,I am Your Honor.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2153.255,2161.652,"The Union agreed that TWA could ignore its bargaining agreement, and you know that…?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2161.652,2162.953,"No, never did they say that."
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2162.953,2163.946,I do not think so.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2163.946,2188.169,"They had no objection to Mr. Hardison working four days however, TWA did have the objection."
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2188.169,2189.472,I heard what u say.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2189.472,2214.405,"Mr. Justice Stevens asked in his question, the union relief committee was available in this instance at the same day that this case was tried there was Mr. Libby whose wife was off because she was ill."
1976.75-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2214.405,2217.361,But did he ask the union relief committee to do anything?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2217.361,2221.278,"He did not know of the union relief committee, the record reflects Your Honor."
1976.75-1126,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2221.278,2235.13,"Well, it is one thing to give a person relief for an emergency on one or two occasions it is another thing to try to adjust a plant operation to no work on Saturday at anytime, is it not?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2235.13,2240.025,"Yes but that was, that is not the facts in this case."
1976.75-1126,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2240.025,2243.603,"It is a fact that they made a number of adjustments for him, did they not?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2243.603,2245.234,"No, absolutely not."
1976.75-1126,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2245.234,2249.013,"Well, then I read a different record from the one that you are talking about."
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2249.013,2312.693,What did TWA do?
1976.75-1126,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2312.693,2316.878,Did he ask to use the grievance procedure?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2316.878,2332.139,"He did not file a grievance after the discharge hearing in which the union told him, all we can do is plead for leniency, Mr. Chief Justice he did not file a grievance, no."
1976.75-1126,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.139,2347.992,"Would you suggest that if all an employer could do to make an accommodation would be to breach the collective bargaining contract, what do you think the statute would require that and would take precedence over the contract?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2347.992,2354.279,"Although we do not have to reach in this case, yes I would as Franks echoes that also with the footnote."
1976.75-1126,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2354.279,2369.259,"And if the employer goes to the union to workout in accommodation, the union says no that collective bargaining contract requires something else."
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2369.259,2375.736,I am saying yes they must because the law directs that the employer must make a reasonable accommodation.
1976.75-1126,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.736,2378.078,Now you do not think that was the case here?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2378.078,2379.687,Absolutely not.
1976.75-1126,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2379.687,2383.649,Do you think that union’s position is that it is the case here?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2383.649,2471.121,"No, it is not because they did not disagree with TWA."
1976.75-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2471.121,2471.81,"Mr. Pickett, let me just ask one more question."
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2471.81,2475.767,Yes Mr. Justice Stevens.
1976.75-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2475.767,2492.559,"Is it your view that the company or the union or both could have accommodated your client without imposing any addition cost on the company and without violating the collective bargaining agreement, or was one of those two things essentially?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2492.559,2499.591,Just two questions.
1976.75-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.591,2501.678,What do you mean you mean overtime?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2501.678,2506.098,"Supervisor covering calling, can somebody stay afterwards."
1976.75-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2506.098,2514.725,"Is it essential that there be cost assumed such as overtime supervisory covering, or one day the job not met or something like that?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2514.725,2515.225,I cannot say for sure.
1976.75-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.225,2518.743,I mean in principles it is quite a different case if you assume that and if you assume the cost?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2518.743,2535.709,"I could not say that might occur because in your hypothetical situation early in your questions to Mr. Feldmiller, if in fact they would have posted the job then nobody might have bid on it and in fact he could have be able to work within the collective bargaining agreement and there would have been no cost to anyone."
1976.75-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.709,2538.987,Their answer to that as I understand is he did not request that.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2538.987,2546.137,"That is correct because it was not open, I also remember him responding to you in that regard."
1976.75-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2546.137,2557.584,"Well then on the basis of what he did is it correct that there was not way to oblige him without either the company assuming some abnormal cost or violating the agreement, one of those two?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2557.584,2576.293,That is correct.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2576.293,2582.559,The difference is that the Sabbath comes up every week and an emergency does not.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2582.559,2582.983,It was an emergency.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2582.983,2584.05,Isn't that the difference?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2584.05,2587.998,"Yes, it is an emergency from my client Mr. Justice Marshall by all means."
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2587.998,2590.325,But it was not his first Sabbath.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2590.325,2590.806,Pardon.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2590.806,2595.284,It was not his first Sabbath either.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2595.284,2596.844,He never had been compelled to work.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2596.844,2598.26,He had Sabbaths before?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2598.26,2600.403,Yes he had Mr. Justice Marshall.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2600.403,2602.253,He knew it was coming.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2602.253,2603.151,No that he did -- well he knew the Sabbath is coming.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2603.151,2605.189,He did not know the Sabbath is coming?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2605.189,2676.557,"Yes, but he did not know that he was going to be compelled by where the collective bargaining agreement provision."
1976.75-1126,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2676.557,2682.808,"Could he have challenged these, raised these problems in the grievance procedure under the collective bargaining contract?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2682.808,2750.226,"I would imagine he most certainly could he did not know too much and he followed the unions, lead as to what they suggested regarding leniency."
1976.75-1126,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2750.226,2753.057,But he did have at oral even seven witnesses orally.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2753.057,2790.493,"That is correct, that is correct, absolutely."
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2790.493,2798.275,"You did say TWA did nothing, who was the man that wrote the letter and said, you come in and let us talk this over?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2798.275,2799.358,Mr. Kussman.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2799.358,2801.03,He works for whom?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2801.03,2801.779,TWA.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2801.779,2803.513,Thank you.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2803.513,2809.921,That was not an affirmative enough statement writing a letter in my judgment and Judge Webster.
1976.75-1126,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2809.921,2817.279,Wouldn't you think more accurate to say TWA did not do enough than to say the TWA did nothing.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2817.279,2982.798,"I understand, of any substance they did nothing."
1976.75-1126,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2982.798,2996.56,"If a supermarket chain had a fixed policy of not hiring any Sabbatarians in a supermarket, would they be violating some federal statute?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,2996.56,3021.071,"Yes, they would."
1976.75-1126,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3021.071,3041.988,Well let us take it one more step then.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3041.988,3055.841,"Here in Washington, and it would be a private employer with a requisite number of employees, they would be violating, now, Section 703(j), I believe, the reasonable accommodation provisions."
1976.75-1126,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3055.841,3083.951,"So that if they try to have some adjustment from their own point of view to the necessities of running a supermarket store on Saturday, on Sunday, which they all do now I understand because they all operate on Saturday and Sunday, the two busiest days of the week."
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3083.951,3094.724,"It would have to determine upon the facts of each case, what is reasonable."
1976.75-1126,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3094.724,3109.579,"The purpose of the supermarket is perfectly obvious that they want to have enough clerks on Saturday and Sunday, who take care of the overwhelming number of shoppers, who do their shopping on Saturday and Sunday."
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3109.579,3138.827,"I think the federal law’s congressional dictate supersedes their sole need if that is it because the second step of course one that District Court looks at is whether or not there is an undue hardship, and one does not get to a hardship being undue, or less than that until something besides a letter requesting a meeting is in fact participated in."
1976.75-1126,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3138.827,3160.034,"One thing we think, what is your attitude, what is the employer suppose to say to the -- say ten people come in and say we do not want to work on Saturday, we want to go to the football game and watch our children play, but we will work on Sunday and you let these religious practitioners off on Saturday, now let us off, what does he suppose to say them?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3160.034,3163.203,"Again, they are not covered by the statute, and secondly the sincerity..."
1976.75-1126,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3163.203,3177.604,I do not realize that.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3177.604,3182.288,I respectfully disagreed; there was a benefit.
1976.75-1126,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.288,3187.297,You do not think it is a benefit if they can get off on Saturday and see their children play?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3187.297,3190.848,"I thought you are referring to the religion, of course, I am getting a benefit."
1976.75-1126,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3190.848,3195.595,"Well, why is not that a benefit there I mean they are getting off on Saturday to practice their religion."
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3195.595,3205.356,This is basically a society in which we observe the Sabbath on Sunday and it is a neutral policy that Congress chose to in fact effect…
1976.75-1126,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3205.356,3215.637,"Not neutral as between people who want to see their kids play football on Saturday and people who want to observe the Sabbath on Saturday, it is not neutral on that respect surely."
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3215.637,3217.562,"I would concur with you, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1976.75-1126,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3217.562,3227.105,"Well, at least there are some people that the employer is require to laid off on Saturday and other people that he is not required to laid off on Saturday."
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3227.105,3230.754,"For religious purposes, if in fact the Congress -- the answer is yes."
1976.75-1126,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3230.754,3237.97,The answer is yes.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3237.97,3239.486,Depending on the circumstances…
1976.75-1126,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3239.486,3246.549,"Well, there is not any circumstances as I understand your position, no circumstances at all."
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3246.549,3267.351,"If TWA had only three people who in fact could have done this particular job and in fact would have shown that it would hamper them tremendously, in that particular aspect I would say they would not have had to accommodate him because it would have been an undue hardship and in fact they would not have violated the law."
1976.75-1126,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3267.351,3274.189,"So, if it costs them a little bit, it is all right, but if it costs them a lot, it is not all right."
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3274.189,3281.011,There is a reasonableness test which one has to be determined by the District Court and I think Franks versus Bowman that goes at.
1976.75-1126,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3281.011,3293.762,Would you say that the District Court review and EEOC review and Court of Appeals' review and review by this Court in this government entanglement with religion in the sense that it was used in law.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3293.762,3298.736,No.
1976.75-1126,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3298.736,3344.742,"Hypothetical, let us assume that the Worldwide Church of God -- and this is hypothetical."
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3344.742,3375.08,"Taking your hypothetical aftereffects of this case, no I would not, because the law addresses itself to the purpose of employment security purging interstate commerce with those things that are impermissible in, in fact, protecting employment security, and the benefit, if any, which is incidental to the person, is to the person, not to any religious groups and he cannot be credited with what his Church may or may not say over the radio."
1976.75-1126,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3375.08,3390.932,"But if the Church membership, where I substantially augmented by the popular appeal that its members would not have to work on Saturdays."
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3390.932,3391.892,"No, I do not."
1976.75-1126,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3391.892,3393.499,You do not?
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3393.499,3394.611,Pardon.
1976.75-1126,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3394.611,3410.219,"You do not even if membership say it would increase by significant numbers, a million people who have responded to an intensive radio campaign, join our church, you will not have to work on Saturday?"
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3410.219,3430.221,"I, at that point, would say the District Court under the Rule 52 in determining the credibility and the sincerity of the individual would be able to determine that factor, which would of course kick off any reasonable accommodation if a person just joined for six months."
1976.75-1126,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3430.221,3431.123,Very well Mr. Pickett.
1976.75-1126,2,45847,william_f_pickett,,3431.123,3433.677,I appreciate the Court's time.
1976.75-1126,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3433.677,3440.625,Mr. Lewin we will start two minutes of your time for your presentation.
1976.75-1126,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,3440.625,3852.725,Thank you very much Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1126,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3852.725,3856.95,"But your friend, well he said that that violate the federal law."
1976.75-1126,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,3856.95,3887.697,"I think the courts would recognize that, Your Honor that that is precisely what the undue hardship provision provides."
1976.75-1126,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3887.697,3903.741,"Well Mr. Lewin we do recognize that with the bargaining agreement the employer is not free to follow the law and ignore the agreement, is he?"
1976.75-1126,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,3903.741,3916.251,"He may have trouble but if that union gives him trouble, he can take them to court because we think they cannot prevent him from following the law."
1976.75-1126,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3916.251,3933.148,"I think that what the law says that whatever you can do without interfering with agreements and other things, you must do."
1976.75-1126,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,3933.148,3934.857,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall…"
1976.75-1126,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3934.857,3939.221,Don’t you think that the agreement is a part of the reasonable?
1976.75-1126,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,3939.221,3940.918,"An agreement is part of the reasonable sir, yes."
1976.75-1126,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3940.918,3941.688,I thought...
1976.75-1126,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,3941.688,3956.633,"We agreed with that, but we think the union speaks here of rights as if the rights grow out to the union and the employees against the whole world, an employer could not sell the Brooklyn Bridge in his collective bargaining agreement and then have his employees or his union say, we have rights to the Brooklyn Bridge because you have put it into the agreement."
1976.75-1126,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3956.633,3958.808,Well TWA does not own it.
1976.75-1126,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,3958.808,3959.525,Pardon.
1976.75-1126,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3959.525,3961.11,TWA does not own the Brooklyn Bridge.
1976.75-1126,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,3961.11,3968.322,"Well, that is exactly it and they do not own Hardison’s right to an accommodation under the federal statute."
1976.75-1126,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3968.322,3975.533,They also have an agreement with the union and they cannot ignore it.
1976.75-1126,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,3975.533,3978.042,We are not suggesting they ignore it but the agreement with the union…
1976.75-1126,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3978.042,3982.035,That is what I thought you were saying that the union agreement had nothing to do with that.
1976.75-1126,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,3982.035,4009.08,"Well, we say the union agreement cannot overwrite the statute because whatever the employer can assign away and that is all that the union agreement is."
1976.75-1126,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4009.08,4025.298,"I suppose that for the shop agreement it would no defense in right to work stick on a complaint by someone who choose to join the union, even though the whole shop agreement if it is signed by both union and employee."
1976.75-1126,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,4025.298,4058.531,"Absolutely, and we submit that in the union collective bargaining agreement that said the employer may not hire female employees would not be a defense."
1976.75-1126,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4058.531,4066.639,"To a degree they are contracted away by the very clause in the statute relating to business necessity and reasonableness, are they not?"
1976.75-1126,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,4066.639,4077.522,"To that extent, Mr. Hardison’s right is limited, yes."
1976.75-1126,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4077.522,4088.133,"Therefore, it follows that the Free Exercise Clause in your position is not an absolute guarantee; it is a conditional guarantee."
1976.75-1126,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,4088.133,4108.158,"It is conditional and it depends on an evaluation of very circumstance and we argue in our brief, I think, extensively and we submit on that brief that it is proper for Congress in order to implement the Free Exercise Clause against private parties to enact the statute such as this, to protect religion."
1976.75-1126,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4108.158,4115.728,Do you have some rebuttal.
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4115.728,4347.756,"In view of the shortness of time remaining, I am going to have to rely principally on my Reply Brief, which does to suppose I think of most the contention that Your Honors have heard, but I want to make several points."
1976.75-1126,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4347.756,4354.327,"Excuses me, Mr. Ratner, before you sit down, I have assumed TWA has got a computer."
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4354.327,4354.946,Yes sir.
1976.75-1126,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4354.946,4356.555,I am assuming they do.
1976.75-1126,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4356.555,4359.864,And they have it in employment office.
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4359.864,4360.235,That I am sure it has.
1976.75-1126,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4360.235,4378.231,"Couldn't they have in the computer the number of men who would prefer to work on Sundays, rather than Saturday, the number who would prefer to work on Saturdays rather than Sunday? So all you have to do would be push a button and you will find that number."
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4378.231,4384.901,"The answer to that is Your Honor, I do not know."
1976.75-1126,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4384.901,4386.114,You do not know anything about computer?
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4386.114,4393.774,I do not know anything about whether they could that; I do know that they probably have not asked anybody about what their preferences are.
1976.75-1126,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4393.774,4396.665,Assuming that a computer could do that.
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4396.665,4397.657,"A computer could do it, presumably."
1976.75-1126,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4397.657,4401.737,"Then when they make up their job schedules, would not it be rather easy?"
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4401.737,4407.305,"Well, it would be impossible without violating seniority."
1976.75-1126,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4407.305,4411.804,"Well, couldn't the computer had the seniority in that?"
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4411.804,4420.994,"If they ran the posting system, the job bidding system by computer, they would run it by computer, it might be another way out of it, but it does not change the legal problem I think it changed the practice problem."
1976.75-1126,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4420.994,4443.19,"Well, Mr. Ratner I ask your colleague on the other side whether the collective bargaining contract was implicated here at all."
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4443.19,4459.655,"With two exceptions, the company could have held employees overtime paid them overtime that would not have bothered this."
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4459.655,4463.167,"Well, it would have destroyed the company, I mean it would have been a substantial burden on them."
1976.75-1126,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4463.167,4464.661,"What, the four day week thing?"
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4464.661,4465.141,Sure.
1976.75-1126,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4465.141,4465.598,Why?
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4465.598,4473.616,"Well, it would have required them to make some kind of arrangement about paying somebody else to cover for them possibly, I do not know."
1976.75-1126,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4473.616,4475.099,"Double time, Time and a half?"
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4475.099,4478.824,"Time and half, yeah."
1976.75-1126,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4478.824,4481.907,But otherwise except for those two things you say the…
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4481.907,4495.481,"Well I am saying that those are two what are called accommodations, but as far as I know could have been made without violating the collective bargaining agreements, those involved the tax on the company and it is my submission that is just…"
1976.75-1126,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4495.481,4509.789,"The position on the other side must worry you sufficiently that here you are, I mean is there position broader than that, I guess their position is that even if it did trample on the collective bargaining contract that is irrelevant."
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4509.789,4514.362,"Yeah, that is right and that is what really worries me, that is why I am here of course that is why I am here."
1976.75-1126,4,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4514.362,4537.376,"Mr. Ratner, I asked this only because of something in your brief, do you think that this Court in General Electric against Gilbert cut back a bit on Duke Power against Griggs? Page 17"
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4537.376,4540.541,I prefer not to answer that question.
1976.75-1126,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4540.541,4573.174,Mr. Ratner let me ask you one question if I may?
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4573.174,4603.781,Well I think that any indication that he would like to be accommodated that he would like to have something done so that we would not have to work on the Sabbath is enough to trigger a constitutionally construed obligation under this statute for a company to see if something can be done reasonably to accommodate you.
1976.75-1126,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4603.781,4612.271,Would the reasonableness of the company’s reaction depend in part on the intensity of the belief?
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4612.271,4634.12,"The last point I made was that it would depend in part on the intensity of the belief and the nature of the practice and how important it is in the hierarchy of that religion and how important in the hierarchy of that individual’s observance of it, and I suggested Your Honor that is a very reason why the statute can not conceivably stand because that is the worst entanglement that ever was with religion."
1976.75-1126,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4634.12,4647.989,"Mr. Ratner there was really a simple answer to Justice Blackmun’s question that I wrote, the Chief Justice wrote to the Griggs against Duke Power and he had joined without reservation in the General Electric case."
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4647.989,4650.883,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice I appreciate you are getting me off the spot.
1976.75-1126,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4650.883,4656.216,Perhaps because he agreed to the cutting back provision.
1976.75-1126,4,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,4656.216,4657.927,Thank you.
1976.75-1126,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4657.927,4660.86,Thank You gentleman.
