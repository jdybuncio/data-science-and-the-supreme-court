1983.82-1845,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.325,We will arguments first this morning in Colorado against Nunez.
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,13.574,18.181,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.315,155.828,"Mr. Bernard, do you think that the Colorado court based its holding on federal law?"
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,155.828,159.343,"I certainly do, Justice O'Connor, and for the following reasons:"
1983.82-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.44,201.887,"Well, on that point, I think Dailey states that in Colorado the rule is that a defendant is entitled to a veracity hearing once he shows a good faith basis for believing the material in the affidavit was inaccurate."
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,205.886,211.088,"Your Honor, I would like to say so, but I don't believe that I can, because there is an indication--"
1983.82-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.088,212.853,"Well, no, it is not."
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,212.853,215.648,--There is an indication clearly that it was based upon the Colorado Constitution.
1983.82-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.24,223.738,The Roviaro-McCray issue?
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,223.738,224.629,--That is correct.
1983.82-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.785,234.219,On that you think the Colorado law is the same as or based on federal law on that aspect of the question?
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,234.219,234.734,Yes.
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,302.192,303.268,Excuse me.
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,308.922,310.297,"That is correct, Justice Marshall."
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,310.297,311.437,"And, you didn't ask for it?"
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,311.437,312.468,"No, we did not."
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,312.468,313.281,Why?
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,313.281,316.498,We were concerned for the informant's safety.
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,316.498,318.435,In an in camera?
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,318.435,319.294,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.151,373.162,Do you think the federal Constitution imposes some limits on how liberal a state's rule of evidence can be on that point?
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,373.162,379.957,"--Your Honor, I believe that this goes to a question of Fourth Amendment interpretation and the exclusionary rule."
1983.82-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,413.693,419.645,Do you think the Fourth Amendment forbids the disclosure of an informant's name?
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,419.645,420.035,Yes.
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,461.002,478.121,"How will you get to the veracity if you don't admit who the person is, if you don't have an in camera investigation?"
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,487.18,494.661,"Well, Justice Marshall, first of all, I do not believe that the purpose of using confidential informants is to hide the truth."
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,499.987,509.233,"Well, what remedy does the defense counsel have if the government says we have this information, but we won't tell you where we got it from?"
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,509.233,514.762,"--First, the defense counsel could strenuously cross examine the affiant himself."
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,516.465,518.856,Whom I assume also is very capable.
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,518.856,521.041,--Pardon me?
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,521.041,522.244,He is very capable.
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,524.321,526.632,The affiant?
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,526.632,527.976,"The officer, yes."
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,527.976,529.585,I would hope that the officer--
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,529.585,530.6,He is a well trained person?
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,530.6,531.022,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,531.022,534.27,"So, if you can't break him down, then you lose."
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,534.27,536.097,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,536.691,537.535,What else can you do?
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,537.535,540.69,--There are alternative forms of information.
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,565.291,568.82,"But, why can't you have the in camera hearing?"
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,568.82,571.351,An in camera hearing--
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,571.351,573.849,Is there somebody in there that you don't trust?
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,573.849,575.754,--No.
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,575.754,577.597,"Because if you say so, I will ask you to name them."
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,577.597,578.175,No.
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,578.175,581.876,"Well, why can't you have an in camera hearing?"
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,581.876,585.048,"Because an in camera hearing, we feel, has certain threats."
1983.82-1845,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,601.619,613.598,If I assume that correct and I also assume that on the same facts an informant would not hesitate to lie because nothing could be done about it.
1983.82-1845,0,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,613.598,619.986,"--Justice Marshall, I submit that there is always the possibility that an informant may lie and I think that is undeniable."
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1412.837,1415.944,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1450.947,1455.523,What is the purpose of that veracity hearing as you call it out there?
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1455.523,1457.21,--In Colorado?
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1457.21,1458.052,Yes.
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1458.052,1468.033,"Well, the purpose of the veracity hearing at this point in time under Colorado law is to see if the affiant either committed perjury or reckless disregard of the truth."
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1470.0,1472.0,Let's put that in concrete terms.
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1479.794,1490.727,"--One, does the information even exist; and, two, if the informant does exist, did he actually relate to the affiant what the affiant placed in the affidavit."
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1490.727,1493.663,"Now, that doesn't tell me much in concrete terms."
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1501.863,1506.893,In the affidavit there is certain information allegedly stated by an informant.
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1506.893,1507.706,What was it?
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1507.706,1516.92,It was that on a certain date that the informant was in the home of the defendant and observed the defendant engaged in certain conduct.
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1516.92,1518.357,"And, what was the conduct?"
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1518.357,1520.231,The conduct was packaging heroin.
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1520.231,1523.791,"And, what happened when they made the search?"
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1523.791,1525.041,They did find heroin.
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1525.041,1530.695,Does that have any bearing on whether he was telling the truth?
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1530.695,1543.113,"Obviously, it would have some bearing, Chief Justice, however, there are other possible sources of information that could have lead to the conclusion that Mr. Nunez had heroin which didn't come through an informant."
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1548.642,1549.157,"Now, let me see."
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1565.869,1566.181,That is correct.
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1566.181,1568.898,And then he gave that information to the police?
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1568.898,1569.929,That is correct.
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1569.929,1577.473,"And, they put that in whatever form is required in Colorado law to get a warrant to search the house, is that right?"
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1577.473,1577.911,Correct.
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1577.911,1581.738,"And then the police took that warrant and went and searched the house, is that right?"
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1581.738,1582.018,Correct.
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1582.018,1587.516,"And then they found the packages exactly as the informant said they would, is that right?"
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1587.516,1590.811,"Very close to how he said they would be, that is correct."
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1590.811,1592.733,What is the problem about his veracity then?
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1592.733,1606.023,The problem about his veracity is that the defendant testified that the informant could not have done what it was alleged he had done in the affidavit because on those dates in question the defendant had not been in his home.
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1634.95,1656.832,"What if the informant had said to the police that he had been in the home of this man on a day within recent weeks or months, and he could not remember the day or the week, but that he distinctly saw him putting narcotics in packages on that day unnamed?"
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1667.733,1671.748,--That would create a different problem of proof.
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1671.748,1677.417,Would it be sufficient to issue a warrant if the informant could not fix the date?
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1677.417,1682.134,That would be up to the magistrate to determine if that was sufficient to establish probable cause.
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1719.698,1727.568,Who was it that had to decide whether the defendant here was telling the truth when he said he was out on a fishing trip on that day?
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1727.568,1728.427,The trial court judge.
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1728.427,1730.114,Without a jury?
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1730.114,1731.223,Without a jury.
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1731.223,1737.237,"And, is that an in camera proceeding in Colorado or is it an open hearing?"
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1737.237,1746.593,"Well, the first stage where the defendant must meet his burden of showing good faith basis and fact... the affidavit contains inaccuracies... is an opening hearing."
1983.82-1845,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1759.415,1785.436,"Mr. Stern, do you think that applying the standard and the balancing explained in the Roviaro opinion under the federal standard for when an informant's identity will be disclosed, that the disclosure would have been ordered in this case applying that standard?"
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1785.436,1789.06,"Applying that standard, I believe it would nave been."
1983.82-1845,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1789.06,1791.808,There would have been disclosure?
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1791.808,1792.214,There would have been disclosure.
1983.82-1845,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1792.214,1796.104,Do you think the Colorado court applied that standard?
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1796.104,1797.197,I do not.
1983.82-1845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1861.608,1873.837,"Well, this chronology doesn't lead, I would think, to the necessary conclusion that there is not a federal basis for the Supreme Court of Colorado's decision."
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1878.368,1880.382,My response is twofold.
1983.82-1845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1895.094,1921.224,"Well, let me put this question... Supposing that the District Court in Adams County says I am going to order the disclosure of this informant pursuant to Roviaro, which I think as being on us, the no suppression, but, in like Hickman against Hiller where someone has to go to jail in order to raise a question in Appellate Court, the District Court says, no, we won't disclose, but I am going to appeal to the Supreme Court of Colorado."
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1931.767,1932.517,Absolutely.
1983.82-1845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1932.517,1934.391,You just say that is not what happened here.
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,1934.391,1941.7,"That is absolutely not what happened, because, again, if you look at the four corners of the Nunez opinion, they don't mention a single federal case or federal authority."
1983.82-1845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2094.248,2099.293,Do you think Roviaro is itself a decision which construes the federal Constitution?
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,2099.293,2109.196,"Roviaro is... This Court, as I understand it, is acting in a supervisory capacity dealing with an evidentiary matter based upon federal common law."
1983.82-1845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2109.196,2111.726,"But, McCray, of course, would be construing the Constitution."
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,2111.726,2112.257,Absolutely.
1983.82-1845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2148.446,2153.069,"Well, it can be more favorable to the defendant, criminal defendant in that area."
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,2155.021,2169.499,"Well, the only way, in my opinion, that the United States Constitution would get involved in this question would be if the Colorado Supreme Court interpreted the common law informant's privilege in such a way that it infringed upon defendant's rights."
1983.82-1845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2273.817,2282.422,"--Of course, if you are right, whether this is quite a sensible opinion of the Supreme Court... We can think they are bananas if we want to, but if it is the state ground, it is none of our business."
1983.82-1845,1,33993,kenneth_h_stern,,2282.422,2283.515,--That is true.
1983.82-1845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2305.131,2308.443,"Do you have any thing further, Mr. Bernard?"
1983.82-1845,2,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,2308.443,2313.504,"Just one, Mr. Chief Justice, just one point."
1983.82-1845,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.425,2393.346,May I interrupt you right there?
1983.82-1845,2,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,2398.812,2400.437,"No, however--"
1983.82-1845,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.437,2405.793,"Then, what is the relevance of the Colorado Supreme Court's reference to Roviaro?"
1983.82-1845,2,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,2405.793,2408.558,--Roviaro talks about the privilege in a general sense.
1983.82-1845,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2424.756,2434.315,"Doesn't the citation of Roviaro, which is a non-constitutional case, by the Colorado Supreme Court suggest that they thought they had a non-constitutional issue before them?"
1983.82-1845,2,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,2434.315,2436.735,"I don't think it is that clear, Your Honor."
1983.82-1845,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2437.595,2441.576,"But, to the extent that Roviaro sheds any light on the matter, it would point in that direction, wouldn't it?"
1983.82-1845,2,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,2441.576,2446.495,"--Well, there was also the reference to Franks versus Delaware which is obviously a constitutional issue."
1983.82-1845,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.495,2453.213,"Yes, but the earlier Colorado cases did precede Franks against Delaware, didn't they?"
1983.82-1845,2,41031,steven_leon_bernard,,2453.213,2453.681,"Yes, they did."
1983.82-1845,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2479.529,2484.949,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
