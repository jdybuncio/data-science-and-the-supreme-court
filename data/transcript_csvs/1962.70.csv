1962.70,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5940.0,5942.891,You are wasting time now.
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,5942.891,5944.713,"Well, I appreciate it."
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5978.606,5981.239,Fired from what?
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,5981.239,5990.943,That he was fired from his job as Manager of the Nazareth Property at Nazareth Pennsylvania.
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6021.786,6023.391,On what page it is?
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6023.391,6052.992,That is on page 249 of the record if the Court pleases.
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6137.128,6139.713,Why?
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6139.713,6140.23,I beg your pardon sir?
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6140.23,6143.278,Why did they not find it in the matter of interest?
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6143.278,6154.06,"They did not find -- they found that it did not apply, because they were not the persons who were intended by that statute."
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6170.609,6172.717,Why?
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6172.717,6216.088,"Well, sir why I should say is this. Section 249 -- well, first Fried was -- Fried's duties as Manager out in the field are roughly to collect rents, to see to the joint advertising, look after the disposal of garbage, to negotiate the leases of stalls, although, he had no authority to conclude the leases and no authority to sign checks."
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6262.001,6266.937,"Well, I suggest before you get to that, that's first time I've known exactly what happened."
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6271.686,6274.801,"They were fired in the January 4th 1960, yes."
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6274.801,6277.281,January 4th 1960.
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6279.672,6283.331,The Court of Appeals granted a stay.
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6286.589,6290.614,"The Court of Appeals granted a stay and let them stay in their jobs, did they?"
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6290.614,6299.441,"The District Court stay -- let them stay in their jobs, but without compensation, it directed that the compensation be impounded and it was --"
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6299.441,6300.489,And it had been done.
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6300.489,6306.169,And it was impounded upon the decision of the Court of Appeals why the money was refunded.
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6306.169,6310.331,They continued the work up till the Court of Appeals passed on it?
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6310.331,6311.007,And are still engaged --
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6311.007,6318.993,And the money was impounded and the money is there and that what's that stayed in this particular branch of the lawsuit?
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6318.993,6326.171,"Well there's a great deal of more at stake, that's what I should say in this --"
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6326.171,6328.526,I mean the financial part of it.
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6332.362,6359.59,"One thing that the petitioners asked for and they didn't get was a recoupment of all of the moneys that these men had earned in the -- well it's now nine years, seven years then, that this case had been going through the this reorganization proceeding."
1962.70,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6374.141,6385.45,[Inaudible]
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6385.45,6386.794,"If the Court pleases, yes."
1962.70,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6386.794,6389.551,And there is no money impounded now?
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6389.551,6391.389,So there is no money impounded now?
1962.70,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6391.389,6395.55,[Inaudible]
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6395.55,6398.49,Pursuant to the result achieved in the Court of Appeals.
1962.70,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6398.49,6416.176,[Inaudible]
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6416.176,6438.753,"If you were to hold not only that the Court below was right in removing or severing them from the operation, but if you were to also hold that the Court should have granted a recoupment which it did not then you would have the --"
1962.70,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6438.753,6450.61,[Inaudible]
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6450.61,6461.745,"Well I don't think that was a law until Your Honor expressed it, I don't think that was the law that they were required to be removed by 249 and that's what I'm trying to argue sir."
1962.70,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6461.745,6474.86,[Inaudible]
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6474.86,6478.299,"I think so, and I think logically you should."
1962.70,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6481.897,6486.26,As the petitioners have [Inaudible] all along.
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6486.26,6487.809,Now if the Court pleases --
1962.70,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6487.809,6496.125,[Inaudible]
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6496.125,6503.738,"I say that because certainly Fried was not a representative of anybody, he didn't represent anybody."
1962.70,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6503.738,6507.467,[Inaudible]
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6507.467,6508.53,[Inaudible]
1962.70,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6508.53,6512.44,[Inaudible]
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6512.44,6515.379,No the court didn't report to continue.
1962.70,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6515.379,6531.512,"The Court could have, [Inaudible] is that correct?"
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6531.512,6554.491,"The petitioner asked for that and the Court's order was that if the petition was granted, my contention is that, that didn't make Fried a de facto trustee, to use the language here, that Fried continued to be what he was before the petition for reorganization was filed."
1962.70,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6562.38,6564.627,Held accountable to [Inaudible]
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6564.627,6569.703,"And accountable to Weinstein as President of the cooperation, right."
1962.70,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6569.703,6571.753,Accountable to the Court.
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6571.753,6575.257,And in turn accountable of the Court.
1962.70,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6575.257,6591.498,"You a problem in Court, under the supervision of the Court and [Inaudible]"
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6591.498,6602.833,"Well I assume that if Your Honor is reaching the word fiduciary, which is the only word that you can play with there."
1962.70,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6602.833,6610.965,Wouldn't you agree that the fact that you [Inaudible]
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6610.965,6611.867,I should say so.
1962.70,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6624.378,6627.549,[Inaudible]
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6627.549,6632.742,I don't hear Your Honor's characterization but --
1962.70,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6632.742,6638.925,[Inaudible]
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6638.925,6642.638,I can see that Fried had a responsible position.
1962.70,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6719.461,6733.67,[Inaudible]
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6733.67,6762.054,"I take it that to correct me or was the purpose for the enactment of any penal statutes, but my point is that this is a penal statute and a very severe one and therefore, one that calls for strict constructions and applying strict instructions, if I may, you have these differentiations."
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6824.191,6825.991,Was this one the President?
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6825.991,6826.458,Pardon me?
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6826.458,6828.759,Was one of them the President of the company --?
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6828.759,6835.062,"Yes, yes Mr. Weinstein was the President of the company, but take even the President on his salary."
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6854.108,6862.375,"I must confess, I'm asking you these questions, because I had assumed [Inaudible] that's why I won't be arguing."
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6869.476,6871.322,Well --
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6871.322,6878.201,"I had assumed that up till now, up to this case."
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6878.201,6888.568,The Court Of Appeals did not think so and since I see my time has expired and --
1962.70,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6888.568,6891.013,You may answer Justice Black's question.
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6891.013,6892.728,I wish you would.
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6896.37,6907.651,"Well, I say this, that Weinstein no more than Fried were included in any of these sections in Article XIII."
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6937.545,6940.311,"[Inaudible] found out, but I do want you to answer it?"
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6940.311,6940.982,And then the nature of --
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6940.982,6957.269,"Assume that United States Steel or one of those big companies put through a proceeding like this, do you mean that the President of the company would be free under this statute to deal in the stocks of the company while it was in process of reorganization?"
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6957.269,6963.432,"Well, I hope I won't offend if answer that question with a question."
1962.70,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6963.432,6972.042,Well I -- you can ask â€“ I pointed this to your associate [Inaudible] most important thing in the case?
1962.70,2,27153,harold_harper,,6972.042,6973.58,I might answer the question with a question.
1962.70,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7039.491,7041.122,Mr. Robbins.
1962.70,3,36567,melvin_lloyd_robbins,,7041.122,7043.693,Yes sir.
1962.70,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7086.768,7089.239,[Inaudible]
1962.70,3,36567,melvin_lloyd_robbins,,7089.239,7090.826,Yes.
1962.70,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7090.826,7102.034,[Inaudible]
1962.70,3,36567,melvin_lloyd_robbins,,7102.034,7104.553,"In a word, yes."
1962.70,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7108.256,7109.187,[Inaudible]
1962.70,3,36567,melvin_lloyd_robbins,,7109.187,7117.318,Okay.
