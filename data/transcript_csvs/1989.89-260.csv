1989.89-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.106,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-260, Idaho against Laura Lee Wright."
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,23.28,26.298,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1989.89-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,96.295,102.049,"General Jones, may I ask, initially there were two counts, were there not?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,102.049,103.983,Yes.
1989.89-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,103.983,110.387,"And the conviction under the first count was reversed, was it?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,110.387,118.077,The conviction for the lewd conduct with the younger daughter was reversed.
1989.89-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,118.077,118.343,Yes.
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,118.343,125.414,"The conviction for lewd conduct with the older daughter, the five-and-a-half-year old, was not appealed from."
1989.89-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,125.414,138.289,"Well, at some stage, and I'm not quite clear from the record when, the second count was dismissed, was it not?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,138.289,143.025,"No, Your Honor, the second count was not dismissed."
1989.89-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,162.254,164.122,"And that's before us, is it?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,164.122,169.426,That is the count that is before the Court at this point.
1989.89-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,169.426,179.032,"Now, was there a dismissal on the... by the local prosecutor after the remand from the Supreme Court of Idaho, and then that dismissal was vacated?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,179.032,180.918,"Oh, I see what you're getting at."
1989.89-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,217.074,221.645,Well was that... was on that motion to reinstate the count two?
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,221.645,223.111,--That is correct.
1989.89-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,236.737,244.741,"Well, didn't the trial court dismiss that count, though, before we granted certiorari?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,244.741,249.128,--The count was dismissed before cert. was granted.
1989.89-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,249.128,249.678,Yes.
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,249.678,255.949,And it was after cert. was granted that we found out that the charge had been dismissed.
1989.89-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,262.805,265.388,"Well, he had authority to do what he did, did he not?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,266.423,268.523,"Yes, he had the authority to do that."
1989.89-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,268.523,273.91,"--Well, what... what was left of the case when the count was dismissed?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,273.91,276.362,"Well, we... we went into the--"
1989.89-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,276.362,284.885,"I mean this all happened while cert. was pending, but before we had acted on the petition for certiorari, did it not?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,284.885,285.535,--Let's see.
1989.89-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,301.263,302.347,Yes.
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,302.347,302.913,Right.
1989.89-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,302.913,313.07,"What was the case that was here while the count was dismissed, before it was reinstated?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,313.07,342.424,"We believe that... that, while there was still the ability to go into the court to seek reconsideration of the dismissal order, and while we were operating under the inadvertent impression that the case was still pending, that the dismissal was not final."
1989.89-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.424,345.876,Sort of a contingent future case or controversy in a way.
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,347.292,348.008,I--
1989.89-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,348.008,354.564,"The case is presently pending for retrial in the Idaho District Court, depending on the outcome of the case here?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,354.564,355.381,--That is correct.
1989.89-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,356.031,361.051,"And when you filed your petition, the... the count was still--"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,361.051,364.42,The count was still pending at the time we filed our petition.
1989.89-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,364.42,368.305,--Exactly And... and at the time the response to the petition was filed?
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,368.305,369.824,There was no response.
1989.89-260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,399.26,405.08,Was the dismissal with the understanding that a new trial would follow?
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,406.214,414.686,"The dismissal was without prejudice, which would have given the prosecutor, had it wished, the ability to go ahead and--"
1989.89-260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,414.686,418.638,Even though the case had proceeded to judgment?
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,418.638,419.59,--That is correct.
1989.89-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,451.209,456.513,"Unless there are further questions from the Court, why don't you proceed to the merits of the case, Mr. Jones?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,456.513,458.715,"Thanks, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,514.301,524.073,"xxx... as the case comes to us, are we... must we assume that these witnesses were unavailable?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,524.073,527.193,"I'm going to cover that, Justice White."
1989.89-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,527.193,527.576,Are you going to get to that?
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,528.478,537.417,"Because... in fact, I was doing a little bit of quick research during the previous argument."
1989.89-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,659.946,668.552,Why was she... why was she unavailable for... for testifying in trial?
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,668.552,698.238,"The trial judge, in the presence of the attorneys and the parties conducted... but out of the presence of the jury, conducted a voir dire examination and asked the young girl, Kathy, the... three years old at that time, a number of questions, and at the time of trial he determined that she was not capable of communicating with the jury and made that determination under Idaho law--"
1989.89-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.238,702.559,You mean that child was just an incompetent witness?
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,703.259,705.594,--The child was not incompetent.
1989.89-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,720.603,729.459,"Well, isn't that tantamount to, quote, ""incompetence of a witness"" as that term is normally understood?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,729.459,734.494,"--Well, under Idaho law there are two parts of incompetence."
1989.89-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,745.569,752.04,But either one means that the witness is not able to be called as a witness in a trial.
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,752.04,753.241,That would be correct.
1989.89-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,753.241,763.597,"And we take the case on that assumption, that this young child had been determined not to be someone who could be called to testify at trial?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,763.597,765.715,"At that time, that's correct."
1989.89-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,765.715,784.761,"But you're making the argument that that same child at an earlier time, outside the courtroom setting, would be competent, in effect, and that her testimony should come in under some hearsay exception?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,784.761,785.796,"Right, the judge was making--"
1989.89-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,785.796,786.296,Is that right?
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,787.413,787.813,--That's correct.
1989.89-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,788.415,808.392,"Now, have most courts held that if a witness is found to be incompetent that the only kind of out-of-court statements that could come in would be what we call the excited utterance, or res gestae statements?"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,808.392,837.411,"Most of the courts have dealt with those kinds of statements, but there have been two circuit decisions... Nelson against Farrey and U.S. against Dorian, Seventh and Eighth Circuit cases, where a child has not come in, been essentially determined incompetent to testify in the courtroom setting, but their hearsay statements were admitted as being reliable at the time that they were made."
1989.89-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,837.411,853.107,Competence was... based on... was it based on the fact that testifying in the presence of the defendant would render... that she just would be incapable of doing that in the presence of the defendant?
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,853.107,856.559,"The Court didn't specifically say, in the presence of the defendant."
1989.89-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,867.867,879.84,Do you suppose he would have come out if... if... if the... if... would that child have been competent to testify under the Maryland procedure?
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,879.84,881.44,--It's a possibility.
1989.89-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,907.492,911.944,"Yes, but that... and that's what incompetence to testify usually means."
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,927.905,946.033,"--Well, it does to a degree, because here we were looking at a particular statement made by this child in an interview session between the child and a pediatrician, and we were not looking at the total range of everything that the child said."
1989.89-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,946.033,947.569,"No, I'm not talking about at that stage."
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,976.152,983.575,"Well, the court found that the child would not be competent to relate facts in the courtroom setting."
1989.89-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.575,985.242,Just in the courtroom setting?
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,986.027,987.36,In the courtroom setting.
1989.89-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.36,991.312,"--Well, that's not really incompetence as I normally understand it, incompetence to testify."
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,991.312,1010.059,"The judge did, however, look very carefully at all circumstances surrounding the making of the statement to the pediatrician, and he said this statement, when considering it in the totality of the circumstances, is a reliable statement and should be let in."
1989.89-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1078.786,1093.713,"And the... the Idaho Supreme Court proceeded on the basis that... that if the procedures they thought should have been followed had been followed, that the statements perhaps could be admitted--"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,1093.713,1094.513,"--Certainly, if it had--"
1989.89-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1094.513,1099.617,--So they didn't... they didn't decide on the basis that that... of incompetency?
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,1099.617,1099.933,--No.
1989.89-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.569,1104.271,"And that's the decision we're reviewing, is--"
1989.89-260,0,31187,james_thomas_jones,,1104.271,1104.721,--Right.
1989.89-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1131.171,1132.621,"--Very well, General Jones."
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1140.61,1144.079,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1202.05,1207.588,But it... it's not what we'd call an excited utterance or a res gestae--
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1207.588,1207.921,--No.
1989.89-260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1262.906,1270.745,"--Mr. Bryson, what you refer to as these... this corroboration resembles to a certain extent a harmless error analysis."
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1270.745,1275.233,"Well, there is... there is a certain degree of... of parallelism."
1989.89-260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1287.373,1288.756,Didn't prove much.
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1288.756,1296.562,"--It didn't prove much, I guess is the point, and I think Justice Blackmun wrote a separate opinion in that case pointing out and relying on the harmless error factor."
1989.89-260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1322.178,1332.319,"Well, do you... do you think here that the out-of-court statements fall within the state's residual hearsay exception?"
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1332.319,1340.258,"I think they... the out-of-court statement fell... the state did hold in the other case, the Giles case, that it fell within the state's residual hearsay exception."
1989.89-260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1344.777,1355.601,And would you take the position that anytime it falls within such an exception that it automatically can come in under the confrontation... despite the confrontation clause?
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1355.601,1357.451,"--Your Honor, the way--"
1989.89-260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1357.451,1362.505,Is it a firmly rooted exception if it's in the residual exception category?
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1362.505,1371.444,"--Your Honor, my answer to that question is that the residual exceptions are written in order to try to incorporate this Court's confrontation clause jurisprudence."
1989.89-260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1411.104,1417.425,"Well, what... what's the effect of the finding that the witness is incompetent to testify?"
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1417.425,1430.299,"Well, Your Honor, I think where the finding is... and by the way, the finding in this case was... was not objected to by... indeed, both sides concurred that the witness was incapable of testifying in court."
1989.89-260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1541.656,1548.826,"Mr. Bryson, I'm sorry to interrupt again and to ask a question on this, but it troubles me, and I'm going to do it anyway."
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1563.32,1585.935,If the... if the trial court finds that the witness is truly incapable of observing... let's take it out of the child area and say this is the person of such low mental capacity that the person is... the trial judge's judgment is that person is incapable of making observations and reporting them to anyone in any context.
1989.89-260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1598.993,1602.145,And do we know for sure what the finding was here?
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1602.145,1602.745,Yes.
1989.89-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.81,1626.762,What page is that [inaudible] on?
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1626.762,1634.999,"--I think it's JA 39, I believe, is the place where the actual finding is made, the unobjected-to finding, on the top of the right-hand side, I think."
1989.89-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.672,1671.041,Did it say automatically--
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1671.041,1671.441,No.
1989.89-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.441,1672.674,--or was it just one of the factors?
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1684.515,1685.717,I think those are two different things.
1989.89-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.822,1696.822,"Well, no, but he was looking for child abuse."
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1696.822,1703.845,"He certainly was, just as a doctor would look for evidence of whatever particular malady the person... the patient came to him complaining of."
1989.89-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1707.63,1717.82,"Oh, it's a lot more reliable if the child blurts out something relating to sex abuse in a... in a conversation that had nothing to do with that subject, where the doctor was trying to find something else."
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1717.82,1718.438,--That... that--
1989.89-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1718.438,1721.39,"And she said, you know, daddy... daddy did something else to me."
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1722.79,1735.899,"--That would be very reliable, but you're going to have a lot of cases in which a child will be taken to a doctor for a question of whether this... there's evidence of child abuse where the doctor knows that there is a suggestion of child abuse."
1989.89-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.899,1736.383,That's right.
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1736.383,1737.916,"And the medical exception, and I would... I would--"
1989.89-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1737.916,1748.624,"But without saying that that disqualifies it automatically, don't you agree that that renders it less reliable than the same information elicited in the different context?"
1989.89-260,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1748.624,1755.278,"--Well, it... to the extent that if it's blurted out in the context where no questions on that subject had been asked at all, I would think it would be extremely reliable."
1989.89-260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1767.903,1769.455,"Thank you, Mr. Bryson."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,1774.774,1778.226,May it please the Court:
1989.89-260,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.151,1869.653,"We haven't... we have used language like that, though."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,1882.211,1888.548,--If it is corroboration surrounding the circumstance of the making of the statement.
1989.89-260,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.634,1953.157,So you say there's a difference between the kind of indicia of reliability which attend the exception itself and corroboration by just other accumulated evidence?
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,1953.157,1954.926,"Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-260,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2029.64,2033.961,"It's not an easy set of opinions to figure out, Mr. Kehne."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2033.961,2034.778,I agree with that.
1989.89-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.11,2078.907,"Do you disagree with what the court seems to have indicated, that if... that if these deficiencies hadn't existed, if there had to have been videotape, no leading questions and no preconception, that the statement could have been admitted?"
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2078.907,2084.643,"No, I don't disagree that if there had been all those I would have no problem with them letting this statement in."
1989.89-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2091.731,2101.336,What would... what would the presence of those... what would the presence of those procedures have done that would make you say it would be all right?
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2101.336,2101.772,--All right--
1989.89-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.772,2103.522,"It would... really just reliability, isn't it?"
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2103.522,2107.324,"--It... it's just reliability, that... that we could see--"
1989.89-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.324,2111.144,And we do judge this case on the basis that the witness is unavailable?
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2111.144,2112.128,"--Yes, we do."
1989.89-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2112.128,2112.828,Um-hum.
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2112.828,2120.4,"But it's reliability that comes from the circumstances in which the statement was made, as opposed to corroboration by other witnesses."
1989.89-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.519,2139.795,"So you say that even if this... you say that as long as there was a... that the... that there was this indicia of reliability... sufficient indicia of reliability, that the confrontation clause would not be violated by admitting the testimony?"
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2139.795,2145.032,"--That is my opinion, and I believe that is what the Idaho Supreme Court said, contrary to what the Attorney--"
1989.89-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2145.032,2150.603,Even though... even though it would be sort of a new sort of a holding?
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2150.603,2157.49,"--It would be an expansion of an exception to the confrontation clause, yes."
1989.89-260,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2176.854,2190.996,"Mr. Kehne, anybody who's tried lawsuits knows that you have to lead to a certain extent to get the witness to focus on, you know, what... what's the subject of the inquiry, rather than whether it's raining or sunny outside."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2190.996,2199.067,"--I agree with that completely, and I believe the Idaho Supreme Court does, too, that it is okay to use sparing, judicious use of leading questions."
1989.89-260,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2230.371,2233.59,"Of course, you could have cross-examined the doctor here."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2233.59,2234.023,No.
1989.89-260,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2265.978,2279.221,"But you could ask him why he used these leading questions, and you could also argue to the jury, perhaps not as effectively as with a videotape, that this is something that can produce untruthful answers."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2279.221,2279.771,That's right.
1989.89-260,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.148,2297.266,"Well, of course a video--"
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2297.266,2297.833,"Well, of course we haven't."
1989.89-260,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2297.833,2307.388,"--A videotape wouldn't show you that either, unless it's a very unusual videotape, maybe a split screen with one half of it on the questioner and the other half on the child."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2314.477,2318.596,"Well, that's exactly how we do it in Idaho now, is a split screen, where both--"
1989.89-260,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.596,2322.298,With one showing the questioner and the other half showing the--
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2322.298,2322.865,--Yes.
1989.89-260,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2322.865,2323.917,--the person being interrogated?
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2323.917,2324.983,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-260,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2334.789,2336.775,Excuse me.
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2339.677,2341.978,In our local community.
1989.89-260,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2374.033,2381.854,"--Well, Mr. Kehne, it obviously is desirable, if... if the testimony can be obtained that way."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2386.84,2388.192,"Absolutely, I do."
1989.89-260,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2388.192,2395.863,Despite any other indicia of reliability that a particular case might pose?
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2395.863,2397.465,"Excuse me, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-260,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2420.913,2433.054,"And in examining children I think almost all states and the Federal Rules as well would allow the use of leading questions in examining child witnesses, would they not?"
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2433.054,2434.488,"--Yes, they would."
1989.89-260,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2508.352,2526.598,"So you take the position that if a child witness is unable to testify in a courtroom in the presence of a defendant, that it depends on the totality of the circumstances whether the out-of-court statements may come in?"
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2526.598,2528.1,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-260,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2538.372,2538.741,Mr. Kehne--
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2538.741,2541.61,--and that's how I see the holding below.
1989.89-260,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.11,2553.417,"--Mr. Kehne, what happens if you... you have this... this videotape and the child does indeed say this but the defendant says the child hasn't been with me for a year now."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2597.077,2604.35,"In our jurisdiction, the trial courts are pretty nice and kind about giving us access to victims for things such as that."
1989.89-260,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2639.939,2647.027,How can you say that there's any inherent indicia of reliability and yet at the same time say what you've just told me?
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2659.551,2673.077,"If we have the record of the first time it came out or at least the first time that somebody tried to interrogate the child about it, then we can get to the basis of it."
1989.89-260,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2681.016,2683.985,"Well, I wouldn't like to be a defendant in such... in such circumstances."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2705.132,2715.404,"Justice Scalia, you're pointing up another possibility not presented by this case, and I don't know if this is where you were going, but I... I believe the Court should leave this possibility open."
1989.89-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2798.927,2805.914,"xxx bit more than just the inability to testify in a courtroom, isn't it?"
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2805.914,2811.068,That is the record in the case before the Court.
1989.89-260,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2811.068,2820.341,"Well, Mr. Kehne, the finding of the court that we have here is basically the statement by the court:"
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2849.693,2860.834,"The finding is, and amply supported by the record, that child cannot respond to simple questions with simple answers."
1989.89-260,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2860.834,2867.738,So you disagree with the characterization of that finding by counsel on the other side?
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2867.738,2868.722,I certainly do.
1989.89-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2872.808,2888.151,"I thought you had settled that we... just to the contrary earlier in your argument, that both sides had agreed that this person was unavailable but not that the witness was incompetent in the technical sense?"
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2888.151,2890.187,"The word ""competence"" wasn't used."
1989.89-260,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2910.766,2922.222,Was this... was it the same judge who conducted the voir dire of the child in person and who later admitted the declaration of the doctor... the declaration to the doctor?
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2922.222,2924.091,"It was, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-260,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2924.091,2933.447,"So, at the time the trial judge admitted the declaration, he must not have felt that this witness was... or the declarant was incompetent?"
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2933.447,2936.049,It's... it's hard to tell that.
1989.89-260,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2936.049,2948.69,"Well, you know, I would think it would be a very strange judge who would admit a statement to a doctor by a witness whom he regarded as incompetent or by a declarant whom he regarded as incompetent."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,2948.69,2954.879,"Well, if a child is incompetent at one time, that doesn't necessarily mean she's incompetent at another time."
1989.89-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3000.658,3002.11,May I ask you a question?
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3029.094,3033.379,"Well, I... first of all, I don't think that would be allowable under Idaho law."
1989.89-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3044.437,3046.972,"Well, that's done all the time with a lot of hearsay statements."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3046.972,3048.189,It... it is.
1989.89-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3059.83,3062.982,"But, see, the witness being confronted, then, would be the doctor, not the child."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3084.662,3085.347,"--Yes, I would."
1989.89-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3094.636,3101.107,"But the issue, I suppose, is which is the witness that the defendant has the right to confront, the doctor or the child?"
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3101.107,3101.424,Right.
1989.89-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3105.292,3106.428,"Well, they're both saying he's guilty."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3106.428,3107.394,"Well, that's true."
1989.89-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.394,3108.713,"The doctor says it, too."
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3108.713,3109.43,That's true.
1989.89-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3116.716,3117.485,Yes.
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3122.52,3124.889,"No, sir, I did not."
1989.89-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3124.889,3127.091,What sentence did the defendant get?
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3127.091,3128.674,20 years on each count.
1989.89-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3128.674,3129.043,On each.
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3130.143,3130.876,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.876,3135.613,What interest does the defendant have in the outcome of this appeal?
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3135.613,3141.101,She is filing a petition for post-conviction relief on the other count.
1989.89-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3264.713,3267.867,xxx.
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3271.319,3272.402,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3272.402,3283.293,"And did you make the suggestions that... of what might... what might be required, the videotaping, the--"
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3283.293,3288.447,"Yes, yes."
1989.89-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3370.065,3379.671,--[inaudible] insist on there being a trial run before they... with the defendant in the room?
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3379.671,3380.79,I'm not sure I understand.
1989.89-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3381.573,3388.711,"Well, you don't think that the defendant... that... you wouldn't say the defendant had to be present at the interview?"
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3388.711,3389.913,"No, because it's impractical."
1989.89-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3402.286,3422.617,"But you don't... you don't... you wouldn't insist... you wouldn't insist that after that, that you actually have the... a pretrial confrontation between the victim and the defendant to see if the defendant... to see if the victim really is unavailable to testify?"
1989.89-260,2,39677,rolf_michael_kehne,,3422.617,3424.236,--If that's what we're relying on.
1989.89-260,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3446.082,3447.715,"Thank you, Mr. Kehne."
1989.89-260,3,31187,james_thomas_jones,,3450.567,3453.319,"Thanks, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-260,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3563.642,3565.126,"Thank you, General Jones."
