1959.321,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,12.308,"Number 321, Sun Oil Company, Petitioner, versus Federal Power Commission."
1959.321,0,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,13.805,18.688,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.321,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,104.997,109.318,"Could you tell us again just to know where the first order, the letter order rejected?"
1959.321,0,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,109.318,115.631,Rejected the submittal by Sun of -- of a new contract as a -- as an initial rate schedule.
1959.321,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,115.631,120.932,Upon the basis that -- this -- the -- the gases already being sold under an existing contract --
1959.321,0,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,120.932,121.38,That's right.
1959.321,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,121.38,122.738,-- which had been approved.
1959.321,0,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,122.738,143.405,"The Power Commission in rejecting the submittal of that contract as an initial rate schedule said that in view of an earlier sale accomplished by an earlier contract, the new contract can only be changed in rate schedule and would have to be resubmitted as a change in rate schedule under Section 4 (d) of the Act if it were be considered at all by the Power Commission."
1959.321,1,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,3053.269,3057.69,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,6674.165,6676.285,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6766.452,6785.536,"What do you say to the suggestion that after all the bite of -- of a regulatory system is its effective administration and if it takes five minutes to exert power that may, in the end, reach the same result, that's a very different thing from being able to have a control that you can exercise PDQ."
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,6785.536,6788.799,"Yes, sir."
1959.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6820.33,6837.285,"I -- I understand the -- your suggestion that if, under the Gas Act, you have a right to have this treated as a new contract with all of the machinery or the -- the procedure of 5 (a), you have a right to stand on that."
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,6844.441,6846.062,"Exactly, exactly."
1959.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6846.062,6860.157,But may or may not or does not the difference in the operation of different sections of the Act bare on how the different sections of the Act should be construed.
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,6860.157,6863.891,"Oh, I suppose that's possible."
1959.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6863.891,6864.567,It's more than possible.
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,6866.667,6872.538,"I -- I will leave and concede the pertinence of the matter, except under the circumstances of this case."
1959.321,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6959.158,6960.973,"Or it could refuse the certificate, I suppose."
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,6961.071,6961.555,"I beg your pardon, sir."
1959.321,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6961.555,6962.749,It could refuse the certificate.
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,6962.749,6972.177,It could refuse the certificate if it is decided as a result of the hearing that the -- that the certificate would not be in the public interest and then leave the applicant to do with that -- what he chooses.
1959.321,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6972.177,6973.41,Yes.
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,6973.41,6977.874,He can go home or he can go home and come back later with another certificate application --
1959.321,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6977.874,6978.314,Yes.
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,6978.314,6979.735,-- that might better please the Commission.
1959.321,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6979.735,6984.073,You mean it can refuse the certificate if it found that the rate was too high?
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,6984.073,6984.818,"I beg you pardon, Your Honor."
1959.321,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6984.818,6989.364,You mean it could refuse the certificate if it found the rate was too high or too low?
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,6989.364,6992.889,"Yes, I think the Commission has that within its power."
1959.321,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6992.889,6995.779,Then you wouldn't have the right to -- to contract.
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,7007.477,7011.228,"Well, I -- I think that it is subject to the conditioning power."
1959.321,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7011.228,7011.891,Where is it?
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,7021.428,7024.963,A -- are we talking about rates or are we talking about the term of the service?
1959.321,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7024.963,7027.281,"Well, I am talking now about both."
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,7027.281,7027.427,Well --
1959.321,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7027.427,7031.063,I -- I had not understood until now.
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,7042.699,7057.777,"Well, I think there is some relief available if -- if you want to use the term “relief” to the extent that the Court expressed in the CATCO decision under Section 7 (e) of the Act, the conditioning power that appears at the end of 7 (e)."
1959.321,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7060.227,7060.347,61.
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,7060.347,7064.523,"-- 60 -- oh, at the top page 62."
1959.321,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7074.189,7079.711,Suppose that fixed the term of a -- change a rate?
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,7084.208,7088.616,"Oh, I think the company could refuse the condition certificate."
1959.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7120.622,7126.429,"Well, the certificate is conditioned on satisfying the public interest, isn't it?"
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,7126.429,7127.254,"Yes, sir."
1959.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7127.254,7134.637,"And the decisions of this Court have given what -- what is relevant to determining the public interest, pretty broad power, exactly."
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,7134.637,7136.406,"Yes, sir."
1959.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7136.845,7152.905,"And I should think -- I should think either a bloated -- what the Commission -- they use a bloated rate, excessive rate or too long a duration for the changes of the reasonably expected changes in this domain."
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,7174.456,7178.718,You say our contract from -- from our point of view would not be outside the public interest?
1959.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7178.718,7179.083,No.
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,7188.365,7188.898,"Yes, sir."
1959.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7188.898,7203.72,You were right starting from your -- I should think if you had a new contract imposing a 30-year term and the Commission made out a case thereon (Inaudible) about these things that that is -- that puts also some difficulties of regulatory process.
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,7212.952,7214.859,"Well, its power in that respect is broad."
1959.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7215.011,7216.087,"Very broad, isn't it?"
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,7216.087,7218.402,It's very broad.I have difficulty conceiving.
1959.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7242.815,7244.416,All I'm saying is time.
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,7248.273,7248.64,[Laughs]
1959.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7248.64,7252.739,-- at least once in 18 years.
1959.321,2,34582,leo_j_hoffman,,7252.739,7264.203,This case in Mr. Wahrenbrock's argument particularly boils itself down to this continuing service doctrine which is repeated time and time again.
