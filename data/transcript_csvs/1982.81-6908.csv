1982.81-6908,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.295,We will hear arguments next in Elwood Barclay against Florida.
1982.81-6908,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,50.355,66.692,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I represent the petitioner, Elwood Barclay, who is here on a writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida which on direct appeal affirmed his murder conviction and a death sentence."
1982.81-6908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,648.597,652.205,Does that... Do you feel that is a totally unreasonable finding on the part of the judge?
1982.81-6908,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,652.205,654.033,"--I do, Your Honor."
1982.81-6908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,665.137,670.822,Let me suggest my own thought that occurs to me.
1982.81-6908,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,693.47,698.983,"--Well, but a single victim who... and they were looking for one alone."
1982.81-6908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,704.309,704.872,Well--
1982.81-6908,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,704.872,706.481,"Well, in--"
1982.81-6908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.613,736.031,--You feel that the Florida law wasn't designed to produce a great number of people even though they might have been individually isolated or by themselves?
1982.81-6908,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,736.031,738.937,I argue on both parts.
1982.81-6908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,757.618,770.424,"Mr. Nabrit, the Florida Supreme Court, though, obviously found that as a matter of Florida law it met their statutory aggravating circumstance on that fourth factor."
1982.81-6908,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,770.424,772.393,"That's correct, and our argument--"
1982.81-6908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,772.393,778.046,"So you are not asking us to say that the Florida law is something else, are you?"
1982.81-6908,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,778.046,791.853,"--No, my argument is that the... my argument is a federal constitutional one, that there is really no evidence of the offense or the statute is construed in such a way that it is vague and overbroad."
1982.81-6908,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,858.684,863.121,"When they came upon the victim, was the victim alone or accompanied by others?"
1982.81-6908,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,863.121,863.918,Alone.
1982.81-6908,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,865.385,867.791,Suppose there were two people there.
1982.81-6908,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,879.833,887.175,"Well, the... well, I mean, there are... I... perhaps not."
1982.81-6908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.594,1130.653,"Mr. Nabrit, may I ask this one question?"
1982.81-6908,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1146.648,1168.935,"We take the latter position, Your Honor, but our argument is that there is a constitutional violation based on the fact that even if only some of them are outside the statute, that that violates the Eighth Amendment, but we do take the latter position."
1982.81-6908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.866,1192.551,"I take it if the Florida Supreme Court agreed with your view that there were no statutory aggravating circumstances, they also would have set aside the death penalty."
1982.81-6908,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1192.551,1193.316,That's correct.
1982.81-6908,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1193.316,1194.05,Yes.
1982.81-6908,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1219.336,1221.945,"No, I think it is different."
1982.81-6908,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1625.923,1632.14,"Mr. Nabrit, before you sit down, do you have any special comment about Lewis against the state?"
1982.81-6908,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1632.14,1634.233,"Well, Your Honor, we--"
1982.81-6908,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1634.233,1640.418,"The reason I ask this is that your opponent doesn't cite it at all, and you cite it profusely."
1982.81-6908,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1643.088,1645.024,"--Well, that's right."
1982.81-6908,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1689.381,1693.239,Maybe you will explain why--
1982.81-6908,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1693.239,1699.784,Mr. Allbritton.
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1699.784,1728.553,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the state of Florida has never claimed that defendants in her courts receive a perfect trial, but only a fair one, and as of this date, approximately 1:35 p.m., that is all the Constitution requires."
1982.81-6908,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2052.454,2084.051,"--Mr. Allbritton, do you plan to address the Lewis case, as Justice Blackmun inquired about, which appeared to hold that if a jury found that the defendant should be sentenced to life, that was treated as a mitigating circumstance then, and required a different action when it was challenged by the defendant?"
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2084.051,2091.204,Only to the extent that I don't believe in the Lewis case that the Florida Supreme Court so held.
1982.81-6908,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.905,2350.255,"But isn't there another possibility, because I thought when you answered Justice O'Connor you said that it is possible to read the Lewis case, I guess it is, as saying that when the jury recommends life sentence rather than death, that that may be viewed as a mitigating circumstance which imposes a burden on being sure that the aggravating outweigh."
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2353.567,2355.661,May be.
1982.81-6908,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.026,2377.181,--Then how do you explain Lewis?
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2377.181,2382.648,"Just the way I did to Justice O'Connor, that I don't believe, and I don't read the case--"
1982.81-6908,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2382.648,2396.347,"You said to her, if I recall, that that may mean that the aggravating outweighed that mitigating circumstance, but then you have just now told us that you can't engage in weighing when there are some non-statutory aggravating circumstances."
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2398.377,2405.39,"--I'm not sure I understand you, and I submit to you, sir, I don't... I'm not sure you understood what I said."
1982.81-6908,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2410.731,2412.589,"May I ask you again, then?"
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2412.589,2412.964,Sure.
1982.81-6908,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2412.964,2414.182,How do you explain Lewis?
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2414.182,2431.942,"Lewis, as I understand it, there is language in it which would indicate that a jury advisory can be viewed if the trial judge so desires as a mitigating factor."
1982.81-6908,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.803,2470.098,It's entirely a matter within the discretion of the trial judge whether or not to view it as a mitigating factor under your submission?
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2470.098,2475.97,"That's correct, because he is the sentencing authority under Florida law."
1982.81-6908,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2941.425,2953.282,"Mr. Allbritton, would you characterize the Florida scheme as a threshold scheme like that of Georgia, or a balancing scheme?"
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2955.514,2956.436,It's both.
1982.81-6908,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3000.668,3015.333,"Under the Florida scheme, if the trial judge found no mitigating circumstances, and found one or more aggravating circumstances, is the trial judge required to impose the death penalty?"
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3015.333,3016.005,"Oh, no."
1982.81-6908,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3017.333,3019.55,So he just balances all the facts--
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3019.55,3019.972,Yes.
1982.81-6908,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3019.972,3020.66,--in your scheme.
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3020.66,3022.175,"No, absolutely, he is not."
1982.81-6908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3031.844,3042.59,"But if he finds some aggravating factors, he may impose the death penalty, even though some of his aggravating factors may be set aside on appeal?"
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3042.59,3046.855,As long as there are no mitigating.
1982.81-6908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3046.855,3047.074,Right.
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3047.074,3062.396,"But under the Elledge case, the Supreme Court will not permit, Justice White, a non-statutory aggravating factor to offset any mitigating factor in the weighing process."
1982.81-6908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3063.409,3081.856,"Well, assuming no mitigating factors at all, in Florida, I take it your submission is that the judge may consider in deciding whether to impose the death penalty statutory as well as non-statutory mitigating circumstances."
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3081.856,3083.199,"No, sir."
1982.81-6908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3090.789,3091.429,Yes.
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3091.429,3101.332,"--in February and March, 1975, non-statutory aggravating factors had not been withdrawn from use by the Florida Supreme Court."
1982.81-6908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3106.845,3107.423,That may be.
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3115.17,3116.17,"Yes, it was."
1982.81-6908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3117.842,3120.622,So we should judge this case as though it still was the law.
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3121.481,3130.508,"You can if you want to, but if you apply the law as it is now, you are still going to come to the same conclusion."
1982.81-6908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3130.508,3132.289,"Because of harmless error, or what?"
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3132.289,3133.086,Harmless error.
1982.81-6908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3133.601,3139.553,"Well, that isn't the... is that the basis for the judgment below?"
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3139.553,3144.582,"It's been referred to as the harmless error, yes."
1982.81-6908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3160.621,3166.369,What is the purpose of withdrawing the use of non-statutory aggravating circumstances as--
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3166.369,3166.9,--I don't know.
1982.81-6908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3166.9,3167.994,--as factors then?
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3170.977,3173.57,"Not under all cases, no."
1982.81-6908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3176.647,3177.725,"Well, how do you know this one is one of them?"
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3177.725,3178.442,--I beg your pardon?
1982.81-6908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3178.442,3183.722,"How would you know that this one is one of them, if you applied the current Florida law?"
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3183.722,3188.595,Because there was no mitigating factors to be offset--
1982.81-6908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3188.595,3189.564,"Well, I understand that."
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3189.564,3191.969,--by the non-statutory aggravating factor.
1982.81-6908,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3192.625,3198.341,Unless Lewis required that the jury recommendation be considered as a mitigating factor.
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3198.341,3205.244,"Let's assume you do that, that it requires that."
1982.81-6908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3232.202,3232.968,Mr. Allbritton?
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3232.968,3233.374,Sir?
1982.81-6908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3233.374,3235.841,Didn't Proffit say that the judge had to use
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3243.494,3245.119,That's what he does.
1982.81-6908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3245.54,3246.462,Isn't that what he said?
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3246.462,3247.056,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-6908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3247.056,3249.492,"Now, where can you get harmless error under that rule?"
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3249.492,3252.428,"Well, because harmless error is used in everything."
1982.81-6908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3255.224,3256.989,"If you are going to be objective, how can you make a harmless error?"
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3256.989,3265.767,"--Justice Marshall, if you take out harmless error, you are requiring the trial to be perfect, and none of them are."
1982.81-6908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3286.432,3288.338,"And if you don't make it, it's harmless?"
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3288.338,3289.868,"It's... Yes, sir, it certainly is."
1982.81-6908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3299.332,3301.176,--You have about three minutes left.
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3301.176,3301.519,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-6908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3348.329,3349.235,You are rowing upstream.
1982.81-6908,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3350.204,3351.172,I know it.
1982.81-6908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3413.256,3415.489,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Nabrit?"
1982.81-6908,2,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,3415.489,3417.816,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-6908,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3674.277,3674.371,"Thank you, gentlemen."
