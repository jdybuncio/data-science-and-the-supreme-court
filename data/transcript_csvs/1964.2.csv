1964.2,2,30616,jack_greenberg,,4858.975,4860.111,Then it wouldn't apply.
1964.2,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4860.111,4881.021,"Do I understand you to say that if a state have a statute, if construed, meaning that a man cannot trespass on their whole premises, cannot trespass on the part of the premises against the owner's consent, then it would be invalid (Inaudible) or part of the premises?"

1964.2,2,30616,jack_greenberg,,4906.339,4909.894,-- the only reason it was construed that way I think --
1964.2,2,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,4909.894,4913.969,Was this vagueness argument raised in the state court?
1964.2,2,30616,jack_greenberg,,4913.969,4918.201,It was not raised in precisely this form however its implicit that -- there was a lot of --

1964.2,2,30616,jack_greenberg,,4919.851,4936.944,"Well, there was claim of vagueness in connection with the multiplicity and just the open-end quality of the statutes that were used in the trial court, when the prosecutor was asked under what provision is this being brought."

1964.2,2,30616,jack_greenberg,,5146.623,5147.758,I'm arguing why --
1964.2,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5147.758,5150.21,I understand you making an argument on the constitution.
1964.2,2,30616,jack_greenberg,,5156.572,5157.585,Oh no.
1964.2,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5158.351,5161.163,Justified as inspecting?
1964.2,2,30616,jack_greenberg,,5161.163,5172.381,"No, but I would say that under these circumstances that I would hope that this Court would be slow to conclude that Congress intended such a result to come about."

1964.2,3,19602,constance_baker_motley,,5391.732,5409.972,"Well, I think there is indication in the legislative history of this Act that many members of the Congress view this right as existing at least on moral ground than what they were tending to do by this Act was to secure it from denial by individuals and by the state."
1964.2,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5409.972,5412.8,"But I suppose the law became effective when it was passed, and this was for --"
1964.2,3,19602,constance_baker_motley,,5412.8,5413.06,Yes.
1964.2,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5413.06,5422.879,-- the right of -- to the right that has created by 201 and 202 that right's origin is with the passage of the Act.
1964.2,3,19602,constance_baker_motley,,5422.879,5424.713,"Well, what happened on there --"
1964.2,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5424.713,5442.233,"I understand you have it -- I understand that you have a constitutional argument also you might turn to, but insofar as the Act is concerned and if the language, Section 203, it says -- it refers to the right through privileges secured by Section 201 and 202."
1964.2,3,19602,constance_baker_motley,,5449.307,5479.729,"Well, the security of the right, if I can put it that way, I -- as I say I think that there was some notion in the Congress that these rights were existing but not specifically secured by national legislation and they were attempting by this Act to put protections in the form of the federal statute around these rights which they assume that every citizen had or people in the nation assumed without anyone having previously said so."
1964.2,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5479.729,5485.954,"Am I correct in it about the (Inaudible) -- to the history of that word, secured in 203?"

1964.2,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5486.419,5490.864,Is it -- there a history to the word secured in 203?
1964.2,3,19602,constance_baker_motley,,5491.433,5491.761,Yes.

1964.2,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5499.438,5499.532,And that --
1964.2,3,19602,constance_baker_motley,,5499.532,5499.778,The --
1964.2,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5499.778,5502.574,Is that -- do you suggest for the reason that --
1964.2,3,19602,constance_baker_motley,,5502.574,5502.922,Yes.
1964.2,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5502.922,5504.265,-- they thought there was a right.
1964.2,3,19602,constance_baker_motley,,5504.265,5504.531,"Yes, that's right."
1964.2,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5504.531,5504.696,"But it needed federal protection, is that it?"
1964.2,3,19602,constance_baker_motley,,5504.696,5507.312,That's right.
1964.2,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5550.466,5572.937,"Well, then I suppose if we -- if your preemption or your federal supremacy argument to abate these actions is to succeed then, I suppose you are saying that the Court must decide whether there was a right to servicing these establishments prior to the passage of the Act."
1964.2,3,19602,constance_baker_motley,,5572.937,5574.09,No.
1964.2,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5574.09,5580.733,"Well, otherwise Section 203 doesn't reach your argument."
1964.2,3,19602,constance_baker_motley,,5581.006,5581.732,Well --
1964.2,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5581.732,5590.791,-- says no one will interfere with the -- or try to punish anyone for exercising the rights secured by 201 or 202.
1964.2,3,19602,constance_baker_motley,,5609.522,5618.565,"The -- if I can handle the question, these defendants were exercising a right now secured by this Act."
1964.2,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5628.565,5644.442,"You say the Act says that you shall not punish anyone for excer -- for doing an act which before the statute he had no right to do but which after the statute he has a right to do it, that's the meaning of 203?"
1964.2,3,19602,constance_baker_motley,,5644.442,5646.584,"Yes, I would say so."
1964.2,4,31603,jack_l_lessenberry,,8070.823,8072.261,May it please the Court.

1964.2,5,19602,constance_baker_motley,,11423.273,11442.94,"Well, I was simply pointing out that the -- there were some questions from the Court as to what time elapsed before the manager returned on the question of whether they were leaving the store as the officers came in whether they left the lunch counter."
1964.2,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,11450.792,11456.44,Is that on the premise that it would -- there's no evidence to show that they left --
1964.2,5,19602,constance_baker_motley,,11456.44,11457.657,That they refused --

1964.2,5,19602,constance_baker_motley,,11458.725,11458.772,That's right --
1964.2,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,11458.772,11459.855,-- refused to leave after --
1964.2,5,19602,constance_baker_motley,,11459.855,11459.987,That's right.
1964.2,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,11459.987,11460.847,-- being directed to do so --
1964.2,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,11460.847,11462.568,"That's right, on that question."
1964.2,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,11462.568,11464.23,Is that a (Inaudible) rule argument?
1964.2,5,19602,constance_baker_motley,,11464.23,11465.456,Yes.
1964.2,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,11466.635,11471.96,"Now, is there any evidence to the contrary of that to which you --"
1964.2,5,19602,constance_baker_motley,,11471.96,11484.741,"No, there is no evidence to the contrary, that is there's no evidence that they just stayed there and persisted and would not leave the place altogether."
1964.2,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,11526.292,11551.365,Do you think the record justifies an argument along the lines that was made that there was evidence to show that despite the fact that it might have been racial discrimination the real reason they were ordered out was because they were in numbers and at a place that interfered with the business quite apart from their race?
1964.2,5,19602,constance_baker_motley,,11551.365,11553.781,"No sir, there's nothing in the record at all --"
1964.2,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,11553.781,11554.524,Do you think there's no --
1964.2,5,19602,constance_baker_motley,,11554.524,11554.578,-- to indicate that --
