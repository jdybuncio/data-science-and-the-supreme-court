2019.18-725,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.64,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-725, Barton versus Barr. Mr. Unikowsky."
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,6.64,42.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question before the Court today is, what does it mean for an offense to render an alien inadmissible for purposes of the stop-time rule? The Court should hold that an offense renders an alien inadmissible if the immigration judge finds that the offense renders the alien inadmissible at the removal hearing that precipitates the need to apply the stop-time rule. If the Court disagrees with that and agrees with the Eleventh Circuit that inadmissible is a status, it should hold that an alien acquires that status when the alien is capable of being charged with inadmissibility. In this case, neither condition is satisfied."
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,186.16,187.88,"That's not quite true, though."
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,195.36,196.24,"Yes, that's correct."
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,196.24,206.56,And then there are some that are ordered -- who are found inadmissible or removable not on the basis of a crime at all.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,206.56,208.48,"So that's true, but in --"
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,208.48,213.96,So you have two classes of people that aren't covered by the way you're reading admissibility now.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,213.96,217.08,"No, but there's still a threshold finding of inadmissibility or removability."
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,228.16,228.36,But --
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,228.36,240.64,"Mr. Unikowsky, could I -- could I possibly get an argument off the table? Do you really want to argue that the concept of inadmissibility is not a status?"
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,240.64,244.36,I think that the word varies depending on the context in which it's being used.
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,245.04,245.12,Okay.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,253.4,255.28,I think that it can -- the word can mean two things.
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,279.36,284.76,Give me a -- give me an example in ordinary speech where inadmissibility is not a status.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,289.56,289.8,Yeah.
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,289.8,294.44,Somebody is in Europe and is going to buy a ticket to come to the United States.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,301.76,302.0,So I --
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,302.0,313.4,"-- or at the time when the person gets on a bus in Central America to come to the southern border, or if evidence is inadmissible, it's inadmissible before the attorney tries to admit it at trial, right?"
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,313.4,322.76,"That -- so that's true, but it seems to me that when you're using the word in the context of talking about the removal proceeding itself, what you really mean is inadmissible at that proceeding."
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,325.36,325.6,Okay.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,326.08,326.28,Yeah.
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,326.28,328.4,-- that -- that's the -- what I want to get off the table.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,340.76,348.56,"I mean, I'm comfortable calling it a status if we define the relevant status as status of inadmissible at that proceeding, as opposed to status of theoretically --"
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,348.56,348.6,Okay.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,369.88,406.16,"So I think it's for many of the same reasons why we agree with the adjacent statute that that is so. So, first of all, just contextually, it seems to me it's quite natural when at step one of the proceeding there's an adjudication. Maybe it's conceded, but there's some kind of adjudication that the alien is, in fact, inadmissible or removable. And then the next step, the immigration judge is asked to decide, does this offense render the alien inadmissible or removable? I just think it's natural to talk about what just happened, rather than this new proceeding that imagines what would have happened if the person had left and tried to come back. I also think that the -- the opening stanza of the cancellation of removal statute is actually quite good for us."
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,422.88,437.96,Do you dispute the fact that there are other provisions in the immigration laws in which inadmissibility is assessed at a time other than when an alien is seeking admission to the country?
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,437.96,444.56,"So I -- yes, I do. And let me walk through all of those because I don't -- it's almost like the exception that proves the rule in the cases that the government addresses."
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,453.84,465.44,"Well, I mean, when you say it's a constructive admission, ""constructive"" is a word that lawyers use in an effort to show that something that is not something else actually is that other thing, right?"
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,465.44,489.4,"Yeah, but the point is you're -- you're trying to get into a new status, which is sort of like trying to get into a new country, like the status is as if you're being admitted into a new -- it's not like a latent -- the government says that in 1996 this like latent status was conferred on him that just stuck with him for all these years, which is different from when you're affirmatively seeking eligibility for a new status, which is kind of like affirmatively seeking eligibility to enter the country. So I think that's just conceptually different."
2019.18-725,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,498.2,498.76,When -- when --
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,498.76,501.48,The government also has --
2019.18-725,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,501.48,511.8,-- when can an LPR fit -- fit that status? You say if he leaves the country for more -- more than 180 days.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,511.8,513.12,Yes.
2019.18-725,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,513.12,527.44,What other sit -- in what other situations can a lawfully permanent resident be subject to the status of ineligibility?
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,527.44,528.6,So there's --
2019.18-725,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,528.6,529.12,Inadmissibility?
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,529.12,530.04,I'm sorry.
2019.18-725,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,553.04,555.96,But what else besides leaving the country and coming back?
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,555.96,559.68,"So leaving for 180 days, abandonment of the status."
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,567.12,575.0,Could you go back and finish your answer to Justice Alito? I understand he asked about the other provisions --
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,575.0,575.4,Yes.
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,575.4,578.68,-- that refer just to a status.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,578.68,578.84,Yeah.
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,578.84,580.6,"And you mentioned the first one, and --"
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,580.6,580.96,Right.
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,580.96,582.24,-- that seems somewhat logical.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,583.12,608.4,"So I think that the only other ones are these two, for these very narrow classes for temporary aliens, like certain entrance before 1982 and something about special agricultural workers. And, actually, those provisions in the -- in the sections talking about adjustment of status for those people, it also says that if they're inadmissible, they also have to leave. Their status is terminated. Those statutes were enacted many years -- I think in the '80s, many years before IIRARA."
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,654.48,669.32,But the point -- the point of the overall provision is to allow cancellation of removal for those who've been in the U.S. for a long time and have had clean records.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,671.84,674.2,"Well, clean -- it doesn't have to be completely clean --"
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,674.2,674.4,Right.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,674.4,674.76,-- but yes.
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,674.76,675.56,But generally clean.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,675.56,675.76,Yes.
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,676.12,676.92,Okay.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,682.76,683.56,Yes.
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,683.56,719.16,"And then it excludes, arguably, two more categories, those who have the list of crimes that make you deportable or the list of crimes that make you admissible. So those are the three categories that seem to suggest if -- if those have been committed within the first seven years for those latter two, right? The aggravated felony at any time, but deportable crimes, seven years, the -- the inadmissible crimes, seven years. Why isn't that the overall structure to look at that makes you ineligible for cancellation of removal, if you understand the structure?"
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,719.16,721.72,"Well, I -- I think the structure has a different conclusion."
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,738.92,739.12,Right.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,745.64,746.2,Yes.
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,746.2,775.64,"Now the question, are you eligible for cancellation of that removal, and the two things that Congress said we should -- that IJs should look at are, have you been here for a sufficient period of time and have you not committed certain crimes: aggravated felonies, deportable offenses within seven years, inadmissible offenses within seven years. If you've committed anything within those three categories, you're no longer going to be eligible for cancellation of removal."
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,775.64,825.48,"See, I'm not sure that's the right way to read the statute because what it says is, to -- to stop the clock, it's got to be a crime referred to in 1182, that's the inadmissibility list, and then that renders you inadmissible or removable. So the way I -- I look at that is that the first part of that referred to in 1182, that's the category of crimes that's capable of stopping the clock. And then there's the second part of the statute, which has what we see as, okay, not only does it have to be on this list of crimes, that's the first part, but it has to have this particular type of consequence, which is rendering you inadmissible or -- or removable. And, in fact, that leads to an argument we make about -- about surplusage, that it makes more sense to view the statute that way than the government's way because, under the government's position, at least until it filed its brief in this case, it conceded that the removable portion of the statute was total surplusage."
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,825.48,833.4,"The only way it can keep to its current position is by disavowing a BIA precedent, Garcia, correct?"
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,833.4,833.88,That's correct.
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,901.52,906.0,"You make a -- before you get to that, you make a fleeting reference to Chevron in your reply brief."
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,912.12,912.44,On the --
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,912.44,913.16,-- on anything --
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,913.16,913.52,Yes.
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,913.6,915.44,-- or just on the decision that you like?
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,915.44,919.44,"Just on the decision that we like, Your Honor. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,919.44,920.0,"Well, that's what --"
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,920.0,920.56,So --
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,920.56,921.52,-- the government is doing.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,921.52,921.8,Yes.
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,922.08,923.32,It likes this decision --
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,923.32,923.56,I have a -- I have a --
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,923.56,924.12,-- but it doesn't like Garcia.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,924.12,926.04,"-- I have a principal reason for that, Your Honor."
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,926.4,927.16,I'm sure. (Laughter.)
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,927.16,930.44,-- the government expressly waives Chevron deference --
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,930.44,930.88,Uh-huh.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,930.88,934.52,"-- on the quest -- on this Jurado case, and so that's -- that's good for us."
2019.18-725,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,952.4,977.88,"Well, what about the simple, but it has a certain appeal, argument the government is making, this is a very dense statute, that if we ask why would Congress -- why wouldn't Congress want the clock to stop when an alien has committed a qualifying offense showing that he has abused the hospitality of the United States?"
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,977.88,978.12,Yeah.
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1043.76,1045.0,I'm not really understanding that.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1045.0,1045.24,Yes.
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1045.24,1048.2,So there's a serious offense that makes you deportable.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1048.2,1048.72,Yes.
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1048.72,1049.2,Okay.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1051.8,1053.08,Yes.
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1053.08,1081.8,"-- of removal? And in looking at that, any blemish, even if it doesn't rise to the level of something that might have made you deportable, is a problem, Congress suggested, by broadening the list of things that could make you ineligible for cancellation of removal beyond those things that just make you deportable in the first instance. Why isn't that a better way to look at it?"
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1081.8,1082.84,Because it didn't do that.
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1094.84,1097.04,They don't on their own --
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1097.04,1097.32,But you don't --
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1097.32,1098.68,-- but if you have something else --
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1098.68,1103.24,"No, but the scheme is it's not like it's an aggravating characteristic based on other things."
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1156.88,1158.16,"Well, it's because the timing --"
2019.18-725,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1158.16,1158.36,Mister --
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1158.36,1159.44,-- it was because of the timing.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1159.44,1163.88,"No, but that's actually not the case because both those convictions -- it's the same day and the same incident."
2019.18-725,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1170.44,1189.84,"Well, why do you think, Mr. Unikowsky, if -- if -- if you're right that this statute is set up to look to the proceeding that's just happened, whether it's the inadmissibility proceeding or the deportability proceeding, why is it that it's -- that the statute is written just in terms of the inadmissibility grounds? Like --"
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1189.84,1190.2,So that --
2019.18-725,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1190.2,1201.0,"-- well, why wouldn't you have something where the inadmissibility people have admissibility grounds and the deportability people have deportability grounds if there's this basic dichotomy in the statute?"
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1201.0,1203.16,"It's a little hard to explain, Your Honor."
2019.18-725,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1227.8,1242.44,"I guess my -- my thinking, though, is that it's -- it's a puzzle. It's a puzzle for both sides, but it's a little bit more of a puzzle for you because you emphasize so much the way the statute separates out two different classes of people."
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1242.44,1246.4,"Well, that's true, but, I mean, the -- it's the second -- I mean, the second half of the statute that -- that does that."
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1324.44,1329.72,Could you tell me why you didn't rely on Lara-Terrazas?
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1329.72,1330.36,"On what, Your Honor?"
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1330.36,1339.88,Lara-Terrazas. The Capitol Area Immigration Rights Coalition said the BIA read this provision pretty much as your second alternative previously.
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1339.88,1347.8,"Well, I mean, I think that -- so we think the BIA has not decided the -- on the second question, so the -- Jurado clearly is inconsistent with our -- our -- our first --"
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1347.8,1351.16,"No, but Lara-Terrazas appears to have held exactly as you wanted."
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1351.16,1354.84,I -- I -- I don't think that's a published decision that specifically resolved the question.
2019.18-725,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1354.84,1359.76,"Well, maybe not specifically, but the government's relying on unpublished opinions too."
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1359.76,1365.68,"Yeah, I mean, we -- we -- I mean, there's a published decision -- I mean, obviously, in this case, there's an unpublished decision rejecting my -- my client's claim."
2019.18-725,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1419.2,1429.56,What do you do with the government's argument that it would have been very easy for Congress to write the statute to link the stop-time offense to the offense charged in the removal proceeding?
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1429.56,1431.76,"I mean, I think the statute could have been clearer both ways."
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1505.4,1511.28,Why would the -- why would the good time rule clearly resolve this -- never mind.
2019.18-725,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1511.28,1512.56,Finish.
2019.18-725,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1512.56,1519.6,"Oh, why would it clearly resolve this -- this question? It doesn't say whether seeking admission or not. It says whether inadmissible or not."
2019.18-725,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1519.6,1523.72,"Yeah, so it doesn't matter -- so we don't think Petitioner is inadmissible."
2019.18-725,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1535.56,1536.48,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Liu."
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1536.48,1542.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statutory text alone is enough to resolve this case."
2019.18-725,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1689.56,1698.64,"Well, your -- your friend on the other side, of course, cites statutes that are to the opposite effect in terms of how the term is used."
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1703.56,1705.6,"I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.18-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1776.92,1777.36,All right.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1918.52,1924.4,"When Congress wanted to make A and B an either/or, it said so expressly in the Act, so --"
2019.18-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1924.4,1938.24,"I know, but I can't think -- that isn't going to be an answer because they'd say, sometimes they do say A/B, sometimes they don't say A/B, it wasn't a genius who drafted this and he forgot the A and the B and he -- but he did put in the or."
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1942.8,1946.44,"My next point is I think -- well, I guess two points."
2019.18-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1961.72,1966.88,"Well, you're talking about the ones who are the -- the -- the under 18 and the -- and the -- there's an -- I -- I think I got that argument."
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1966.88,1967.24,Okay.
2019.18-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1967.24,1969.4,And I can think that if -- I think I have it.
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1970.12,1970.28,Okay.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1971.08,1976.8,"Even if you don't buy that, I don't think surplusage should be the be all, end all in interpreting this statute."
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1983.36,1986.64,"But, Mr. -- Mr. Liu, this is more than your typical case of surplusage."
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2026.8,2028.76,"I -- I don't think so, Justice Kagan."
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2038.2,2040.68,But by doing what? You said by saying either/or.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2048.28,2049.6,It's much more explicit than that.
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2083.08,2083.96,"Well, it's how --"
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2083.96,2084.6,-- either/or.
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2084.6,2107.4,"-- explicit Congress could be, and, sure, that might be a model of legislative drafting which we can all assume this statute is not. But this statute does very clearly use the disjunctive as to two large clauses, one of which talks about inadmissible aliens and the other of which talks about removable or deportable, whatever word you want, aliens."
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2107.4,2126.04,And I think Congress was also clear in the cross-reference to -- to Section 1182(a)(2) and the renders inadmissible clause that any alien who is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude is inadmissible. There are many ways Congress could have written that provision to get to the result Petitioner would like us to get to.
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2145.68,2148.88,Go back to the point that the Chief Justice made.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2231.44,2232.64,"Well, I -- I -- I --"
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2232.64,2241.6,"Especially when the structure of the very next provision, the mandatory detention section, is talking also about removability?"
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2241.6,2243.8,I -- I want to be very clear.
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2259.64,2261.72,There is a consequence.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2261.72,2263.08,-- attaches some additionals.
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2263.08,2264.56,There is a consequence.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2274.64,2283.4,"But the -- but the consequence here, which is termination of the period of continuous residence, is tied only to the status of inadmissibility."
2019.18-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2303.0,2318.84,"I -- I accept that you can read the word ""inadmissible"" -- I'm not saying you have to, but you could say this individual in front of us, he's not inadmissible. It's -- he's been admitted."
2019.18-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2331.6,2333.6,Now that's a possible reading of it.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2380.84,2381.4,Yeah.
2019.18-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2381.4,2382.36,-- that traditional history.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2387.04,2387.12,This --
2019.18-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2387.12,2387.8,-- what's bothering me.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2387.8,2389.4,-- this is what we think Congress was thinking.
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2436.64,2436.84,But --
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2436.84,2437.32,And so --
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2437.32,2446.92,"-- why wouldn't you just say, you know, a person convicted of an offense listed in the following sections? You don't need all this hullabaloo about people being rendered inadmissible --"
2019.18-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2446.92,2447.48,That's the point.
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2447.48,2456.44,-- and people being rendered deportable unless you're talking about some kind of proceeding in which people have been rendered inadmissible or people have been rendered deportable.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2462.64,2470.44,"Well, because I think, as -- as I was saying, Congress -- Congress did start out with the set of offenses it thought would generally be serious enough."
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2486.76,2487.88,"Yeah, but the exceptions --"
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2487.88,2488.64,"-- petty offenses, that wouldn't be --"
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2488.64,2496.6,"-- I mean, the idea that the exceptions would be picked up somehow if you just said listed in the -- it doesn't transform an exception."
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2503.28,2505.92,"Well, I think that is what the ""referred to"" clause."
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2521.4,2521.8,"Yeah, and --"
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2521.8,2522.28,-- to those provisions.
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2522.28,2540.72,-- I guess it seems really counterintuitive to me that Congress could have -- could have sort of looked down the road and said some insane judge is going to pick up these exceptions and transform them into actual grounds for disqualifying somebody from removal.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2543.92,2544.16,No --
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2544.16,2547.04,-- all this statutory language to do that.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2547.04,2552.88,"No, that -- that's my point, Justice Kagan, is that because of those exceptions, that's why you need the renders --"
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2552.88,2553.6,"Yes, that's your --"
2019.18-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2553.6,2554.08,If you --
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2554.08,2554.44,-- point --
2019.18-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2554.44,2555.52,"Look, if --"
2019.18-725,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2555.52,2572.36,"Can I take you back to Justice Breyer's intriguing question about the meaning of inadmissibility? The -- the Eleventh Circuit had some very colorful examples about status and words that end in a-b-l-e or i-b-l-e, and one of them had to do with rotten fish."
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2598.36,2602.48,"No, no, you wouldn't, because the fish has the status of being inedible, whether someone has --"
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2602.48,2602.72,No --
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2602.72,2603.0,-- eaten it --
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2603.0,2603.52,"-- but, Mr. Liu --"
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2603.52,2604.88,-- or is trying to eat it or not.
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2604.88,2611.4,-- this -- this really is dependent on context because you wouldn't say is car is immovable if the car has just been moved.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2641.24,2648.88,"And I -- and I don't think it's an embarrassment for our position that, under our view, the ""renders removable"" clause has only a modest role to play."
2019.18-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2691.64,2700.04,"I -- I -- before you leave this -- I -- I'll think about the fish. I'm not sure I got the fish, but I'll -- I'll think about the fish. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2700.04,2705.44,"But -- but I'm back in what in heaven's name is that clause doing there? You know, the second clause."
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2705.44,2706.08,Right.
2019.18-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2706.08,2707.8,"If you're right, okay."
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2787.24,2809.6,"But we know Congress wasn't working at that level of granularity, because when it came to 1227(a)(4), there was nothing in 20 -- 1227(a)(4) that's referred to in Section 1182. I think the only way to understand what Congress was thinking is to think of what Congress was thinking at a more general level. And the more general level is we have these offenses referred to in 1182(a)(2)."
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2916.0,2934.84,"I know that everybody -- I think Justice Kavanaugh and you seem to think that these minor offenses, like a person who possesses a small amount of marijuana, can -- that can make you inadmissible but not deportable because there's an exception under deportability."
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3013.12,3024.56,I think it has to do with the very narrow issue in front of this Court. No one -- no one thinks that a marijuana possession conviction alone can render an LPR removable.
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3046.56,3046.76,But --
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3046.76,3047.68,-- and our answer is simply --
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3047.68,3066.96,"-- the -- the problem really is, no, it's not so simple because they didn't or wouldn't have to worry about a small amount of marijuana generally, even an admission of it without a criminal conviction, and so why should the time stop under those circumstances?"
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3066.96,3067.36,"Well, there --"
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3067.36,3071.8,Other than your strange reading of -- of this provision.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3071.8,3074.8,"Well, I think the text does favor us."
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3076.96,3080.84,"If it doesn't, where do we end up? If it's ambiguous --"
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3080.84,3082.68,If it --
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3082.68,3084.36,-- where do we end up?
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3084.36,3095.72,"If it's ambiguous, I think there would have to be some grievous ambiguity for the Court even -- to even care about that. I think the traditional tools of construction continue --"
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3095.72,3096.28,How about --
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3096.28,3098.52,-- continue to apply.
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3098.52,3099.64,-- if it's in equipoise?
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3099.64,3106.92,"If it's in equipoise, I still think the Court's duty should be to reach what it believes to be the best reading of the statute."
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3107.96,3112.24,And so by ignoring surplusage completely?
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3112.24,3112.6,No.
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3116.4,3121.52,He is a lot less. He gives meaning to everything except the reference to 1227(a)(4).
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3126.6,3127.08,Yes.
2019.18-725,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3127.32,3128.08,I forgot that.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3130.0,3139.08,"Well, since the stop-time rule was enacted in 1996, all the way until 2004, 1227(a)(4) was an empty category."

2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3194.68,3194.96,Right.
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3237.72,3238.04,"I mean, it --"
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3238.04,3238.4,-- from the text --
2019.18-725,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3238.4,3249.68,"-- just is a kind of odd thing to say when we know the alien has been admitted and could be -- you know, could live here indefinitely if he hadn't gotten into other trouble, right?"
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3249.68,3249.92,I don't --

2019.18-725,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3308.64,3308.96,Yeah.
2019.18-725,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3308.96,3309.88,-- for deportability.
