1985.84-1362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,69.285,"Mr. Emge, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1985.84-1362,0,33816,kirk_j_emge,,69.285,71.862,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.84-1362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,126.419,144.598,"Mr. Emge, with respect to the case that was just argued before your case, will your case be a live case in the event that the Court of Appeals' judgment were, in the earlier case, was reversed and in the case that it was affirmed?"
1985.84-1362,0,33816,kirk_j_emge,,144.598,156.204,"The district court order in our case indicates that if the Fourth Circuit decision is reversed that the judgment would be entered in favor of the defendants in that case, which is the Maryland commission."
1985.84-1362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,777.905,783.636,"Well, that would make some sense if... perhaps more sense if it were an argument advanced by the FCC."
1985.84-1362,0,33816,kirk_j_emge,,786.837,808.221,"--Well, the FCC is supporting the opponents in this case, and I agree that perhaps if the agency thought about maintaining its prerogatives under the Act, and the prerogative being it has the sole responsibility for enforcing the provisions of the Communications Act, perhaps they would take a different position."
1985.84-1362,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,880.737,892.795,"May I ask you, insofar as the proceeding is against the commission itself... and I gather the individual commissioners are sued as well... do you make any Eleventh Amendment argument?"
1985.84-1362,0,33816,kirk_j_emge,,892.795,896.31,"We have not made an Eleventh Amendment argument, and we're not making one."
1985.84-1362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1113.892,1120.155,Mr. Stroud.
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,1120.155,1123.201,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1282.699,1284.668,Were they sued in their individual capacities?
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,1284.668,1286.463,"--Yes, they can be, Your Honor."
1985.84-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.463,1287.401,But were they?
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,1291.039,1294.039,"They were sued as individual members of the commission, Your Honor."
1985.84-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1298.24,1299.958,"No, I'm not asking that."
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,1308.439,1312.64,"It's not the same, Your Honor, under the doctrine of Ex Parte Young."
1985.84-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.297,1315.17,"Well, for Eleventh Amendment purposes I agree it's different."
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,1315.17,1315.654,--Yes.
1985.84-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1315.654,1322.168,"For statutory construction purposes, wouldn't you normally... you couldn't get damages against these people individually, could you?"
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,1322.168,1323.683,"We're not seeking damages, Your Honor."
1985.84-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.315,1360.464,"Well, my questions really are not intended to raise the Eleventh Amendment problem, but the statutory definition that you referred to of ""person"" does not include official commissions as an example of a commission, and there is a separate... I mean of a person."
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,1363.76,1366.838,"You are right, Your Honor, it does not include them."
1985.84-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2096.12,2108.959,"How about your opponents' contention that if the argument requires a great deal of tailoring, or the order requires a great deal of tailoring or work by the federal court, perhaps it ought not be enforced by private parties?"
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,2108.959,2119.268,"Your Honor, I am not making the argument that every order or every piece of paper that is denominated by the FCC as an order need be enforced under Section 401(b)."
1985.84-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2161.329,2170.232,"May I ask, in this case we have kind of a frontal assault on the FCC's order to the Maryland commission."
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,2188.724,2193.145,"The review of any order of the FCC, if in fact--"
1985.84-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2193.145,2208.638,"Well, I mean it actually would me a Maryland commission would enter an order on some kind of a depreciation schedule, and then the utility would say, well, that really doesn't comply with in all respects with the preemption order, the depreciation order of the commission, the FCC."
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,2214.244,2220.039,--I could get review of that situation certainly before the <FCC> [= FCC].
1985.84-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.039,2222.367,"No, I mean in a federal court, under 401."
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,2227.802,2229.316,As opposed to one piece of it?
1985.84-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.316,2231.363,As opposed to just one application.
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,2240.984,2263.241,"Justice, I would have to say this, that the FCC's orders are intended to be binding until they are reviewed and reversed, and if indeed an order is executory and meets all of the criteria that I mentioned before and is served on the commission and it elects to disobey that order--"
1985.84-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2263.241,2269.457,"Oh, no, I'm assuming a case in which the commission says, we're trying to obey it, but we think it means something else than you."
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,2270.285,2271.221,"--Oh, fine, okay."
1985.84-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2289.746,2291.917,"--It's in good faith, it's just wrong, under your view."
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,2291.917,2296.4,"--Well, if it's just wrong I would think that we wouldn't want to go to district court on that."
1985.84-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2296.945,2298.663,Do you think you could go to district court?
1985.84-1362,1,21515,d_michael_stroud,,2299.195,2305.02,"--Well, if you have... let me assume the underlying points again."
1985.84-1362,2,32879,jack_d_smith,,2376.709,2380.771,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1362,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2671.826,2683.118,"May I ask, then, Mr. Smith, if the order had had the label ""rule"" on it instead of being called an order, and then the preemption order had been called an interpretation or something, the same argument would apply?"
1985.84-1362,2,32879,jack_d_smith,,2683.118,2684.913,The order--
1985.84-1362,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2684.913,2687.053,The fact that it's called an order doesn't really make any difference?
1985.84-1362,2,32879,jack_d_smith,,2687.053,2689.147,"--No, it doesn't as far as we're concerned."
1985.84-1362,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.479,2876.009,"What would you say, Mr. Smith, to the question I asked Mr. Stroud?"
1985.84-1362,2,32879,jack_d_smith,,2882.102,2890.535,"--I would hope that we... in the Common Carrier Bureau we have an accounting and audits division, and they're always free to talk with people about the meaning of the orders, and they would work that out."
1985.84-1362,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2890.535,2891.16,I'm not interested in what you'd hope.
1985.84-1362,2,32879,jack_d_smith,,2892.472,2900.312,"If we found that they were acting inconsistent with our decision and they had violated the decision, yes, it would be in the district court."
1985.84-1362,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2900.312,2906.638,"If you found what... well, supposing that the private party goes directly to the federal court without asking you."
1985.84-1362,2,32879,jack_d_smith,,2906.638,2907.138,Your first question--
1985.84-1362,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2907.138,2909.308,"The jurisdiction doesn't depend on what you find, does it?"
1985.84-1362,2,32879,jack_d_smith,,2909.308,2914.54,"--Your first question is one if there is ambiguity, if there is ambiguity about whether they have violated it or not."
1985.84-1362,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2914.54,2916.728,Or there's a dispute between one side and the commission.
1985.84-1362,2,32879,jack_d_smith,,2916.728,2926.332,"The answer would be it would probably in the district court, and the district court would say: Gee, this looks very complicated to me; FCC, I'm going to defer this to you under primary jurisdiction."
1985.84-1362,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2926.332,2928.582,But your answer is there would be federal jurisdiction?
1985.84-1362,2,32879,jack_d_smith,,2928.582,2929.363,"Yes, sir, exactly."
1985.84-1362,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2929.363,2935.298,And does the FCC have declaratory... does it issue declaratory orders?
1985.84-1362,2,32879,jack_d_smith,,2947.214,2947.558,Exactly.
1985.84-1362,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2957.414,2961.414,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Emge?"
1985.84-1362,3,33816,kirk_j_emge,,2961.414,2963.177,"Just briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1362,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3247.157,3248.657,"Thank you, gentlemen."
