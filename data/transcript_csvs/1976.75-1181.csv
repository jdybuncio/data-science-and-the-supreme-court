1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,56.794,We will hear arguments next in 1181 Batterton against Francis.
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,58.967,60.937,"Thank you, Mister Chief Justice."
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,685.69,694.07,"Now, you have told us that the dictionary meaning of the word unemployment is basically, irrelevant, is that it?"
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,694.07,695.776,We think it is not the test for term.
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,695.776,697.037,It is not dispositive.
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,697.037,698.26,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,698.26,711.116,"But you would concede, I suppose that it is relevant, if it is said that in looking at the regulations, you have to, they have some rational relationship to the word unemployment."
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,711.116,712.459,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,719.449,721.122,-- in defining the word unemployment.
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,721.122,722.873,That is correct.
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,722.873,728.711,But I just want to be sure you do not say that the statutory phrase is irrelevant.
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,728.711,729.373,"No, we think."
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,729.373,731.35,It all depends on what the regulation says.
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,731.35,734.921,And we would not contend that HEW could not look at the dictionary meaning when it --
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,734.921,748.274,"Well, you must not look at the ordinary meaning of the word and then defining by regulation, what it means as in giving a precise regulatory definition."
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,748.274,751.716,That is correct.
1976.75-1181,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1121.891,1127.082,"It seems the statute does not introduce that element that you just mentioned, though no fault of their own."
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,1134.919,1137.506,You are correct Mr. Justice Stewart that it does not use that phrase.
1976.75-1181,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1137.506,1138.097,What?
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,1138.097,1148.664,"The statute, but it does not, in other ways may clear that persons who through their own conduct are not active, for example, not actively seeking employment are not entitled to benefits."
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1148.664,1158.506,"There are other forms of welfare benefits to take care of the needy children, needy people besides just the ones we are talking about here."
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,1158.506,1162.303,"Well, that is correct, if you are talking about the medical assistance, in addressing this --"
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1162.303,1163.731,But this is AFDC-UF?
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,1163.731,1165.85,Right.
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1170.777,1172.755,This was designed to assist children.
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,1172.755,1173.353,That is correct.
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1173.353,1174.009,Is it not?
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,1174.009,1175.093,That is right.
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1185.205,1186.459,"No, I understand that"
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,1186.459,1186.673,But.Mr.
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1186.673,1189.61,The question is whether this regulation is permissible.
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,1189.61,1196.052,"That is correct, and we think that, when you look at total statutory framework, there is a requirement for job registration."
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1199.718,1201.238,This is statutory or?
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,1201.238,1204.403,These are all statutory and they are contained in Section 407.
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1216.039,1218.72,The states are not compelled to participate in this program.
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,1218.72,1228.516,"That is correct, Your Honor and 24 states had not participated although, a few have, because of the recent economic conditions in last few years, three have joined the program."
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1228.516,1238.826,"So, then no states the families and the children of those families in these circumstances depend upon other."
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,1238.826,1239.458,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1262.351,1274.097,"And the flexibility to permit variations from state to state were contemplated by Congress to take into account different forms of industry and occupation among other things, were they not?"
1976.75-1181,0,32568,joel_j_rabin,,1274.097,1274.935,We think so.
1976.75-1181,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1548.788,1553.661,Very well.
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1554.865,1558.781,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-1181,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1724.172,1730.808,Is your quarrel with the mechanism or with the substance of it?
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1730.808,1731.986,I am not--.
1976.75-1181,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1731.986,1745.257,Suppose the State of Maryland had enacted its eligibility qualifications in precisely the same terms but in a separate statute or regulation.
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1750.11,1755.96,Objection to the definition itself or my objection to what is that issue on this case?
1976.75-1181,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1757.192,1759.624,The two are quite similar.
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1759.624,1766.228,"Well, I do not think that issue in this case is part of the HEW regulation dealing with strikers, per se."
1976.75-1181,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1859.277,1874.236,"But the statute in question was enacted to give the Secretary authority to make rules relating to supplementing state unemployment compensation plans, was it not?"
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1874.236,1882.726,"Your Honor, I remember nothing in the legislative history which has that concept."
1976.75-1181,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1882.726,1900.606,"In other words, you do not think that any of this statutory language or can be related to disqualifications in state plans by virtue of the fact that the Federal Legislation had in mind the State Plan?"
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1900.606,1901.94,State Welfare plan or Unemployment Insurance.
1976.75-1181,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1901.94,1904.511,"No, State Unemployment Compensation Plan."
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1904.511,1909.893,"The Act did have in mind, the State Unemployment Compensation Plans to very large extent."
1976.75-1181,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1909.893,1911.102,"Well, mention those."
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1911.102,1913.533,Five or six times in this specific Section of the act.
1976.75-1181,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1913.533,1928.189,"Well, as you are aware and as I am sure your opponents are aware, that typical State Unemployment Compensation Plan provides four or five disqualifications and that serve in the kind of labor dispute type that you have been talking about."
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1928.189,1929.074,That is correct.
1976.75-1181,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1929.074,1946.329,"Is it not at least inferable that Congress, when they used the term 'unemployment' was using it in the term, in the sense that unemployment is that term be used to be define eligibility for State Unemployment Compensation?"
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1946.329,1948.496,"Well, that is possible explanation."
1976.75-1181,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1952.529,1954.182,If that is possible explanations.
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1958.25,1961.181,"I do to think so, Your Honor, because it is such unusual explanation."
1976.75-1181,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2039.946,2046.03,"Why did they authorize the Secretary, then to make regulations defining the term?"
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2046.03,2060.799,"It is my guess, Your Honor that the primary motivation was the legislative history shows, for example, Arizona at one point in time had 16 families in this program, neighboring Utah or Colorado, I forgot which, had 1,200 or 1,600 something like that."
1976.75-1181,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2071.306,2073.869,Do you mean that in an absolute sense?
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2073.869,2077.994,"I am sure, not in an absolute sense but in a much better sense than what existed at that point of time."
1976.75-1181,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2077.994,2084.195,The Congress wanted to have it; absolutely uniform that would have done all the defining itself would it not?
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2084.195,2086.61,That would have one way of accomplish the task.
1976.75-1181,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2087.661,2094.733,"But they very carefully refrained from doing that and explained that they wanted to leave the States, some flexibility?"
1976.75-1181,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2094.733,2110.659,"Well, not that they wanted to leave the states flexibility but they wanted to leave the definition of unemployment to the Secretary, who would be in better position to define, normally we would think, what unemployment actually means and my guess is that they would want the Secretary to define in terms of hours, as the Secretary originally did."
1976.75-1181,2,32568,joel_j_rabin,,2631.366,2635.093,"Just a few remarks, Mr. Chief Justice."
1976.75-1181,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2855.941,2856.823,Thank you gentlemen.
