2018.17-949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.76,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-949, Sturgeon versus Frost. Mr. Findley."
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,6.76,7.48,Thank you.
2018.17-949,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,50.48,59.84,"I'm sorry, but ANILCA in many places puts statutory duties on the government, on the Park Service."
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,127.0,165.56,"ANILCA, as this Court recognized in the first decision, specifically invoked the Organic Act and said these parks shall be managed in accord with the Organic Act and in accord with the provisions of ANILCA. And this Court recognized that ANILCA carries many provisions specifically modifying the Park Service's Organic Act authority, Section 103(c) being one of them. To your question, how can the Park Service fulfill its duties: In understanding ANILCA and so understanding the debate about ANILCA, it was very important what land went into conservation system units, but it was equally important what land did not get included within conservation system units. ANILCA was not just a park enabling statute."
2018.17-949,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,172.08,183.4,"You haven't answered my question. Under your theory, the state manages all navigable waters between federal lands or between state lands."
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,185.32,185.44,Yes.
2018.17-949,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,185.44,197.6,-- in terms of the territorial lands. How does the Park Service engage in its statutory obligations if it can't do what you say?
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,197.6,204.56,"The Park Service, for all those purposes, it can regulate submerged lands and waters where title did not pass to the state at statehood."
2018.17-949,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,208.24,210.56,There's no public waters.
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,215.32,218.56,Only navigable waters where title to the submerged lands passed at statehood.
2018.17-949,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,218.56,219.04,All right.
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,234.6,239.44,"It cannot do that work on any of the specific navigable waters, but it can protect the watershed."
2018.17-949,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,268.92,274.2,Does it make any difference that a park is designated as a wild and scenic river?
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,274.2,275.48,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
2018.17-949,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,295.84,297.0,That's a quite extreme --
2018.17-949,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,297.0,312.04,"And you don't think it makes any difference if there are public lands on both sides of a river? In other words, both banks of a river are public lands, but still the federal government cannot regulate the river running through those lands?"
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,312.04,313.8,The federal government may.
2018.17-949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,352.4,357.76,So an agency like EPA is -- is fully empowered to regulate the waters?
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,357.76,360.32,"Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly right."
2018.17-949,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,372.56,378.72,"What does that do to your federalism argument? Because, at various times in your brief, you press federalism concerns."
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,386.8,400.08,"When it comes to interpreting the Organic Act, against Section 103(c), those aren't necessarily implicated, although, as this Court recognized in the first decision, the state's power over its navigable waters does raise significant issues of state sovereignty."
2018.17-949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,444.16,446.6,So you just -- it -- it -- you just don't like the Park Service.
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,452.84,456.76,"It's not that we don't like the Park Service, as it -- it's that layer of regulation -- (Laughter.)"
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,456.76,459.56,-- that was not supposed to apply on top.
2018.17-949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,462.48,470.0,Which sentence of Section 3103(c) do you think wins this case for you?
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,470.0,478.84,"The second sentence does the most work, but the second sentence needs to be read in conjunction with all three sentences and in conjunction with the context of the statute."
2018.17-949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,478.84,479.28,All right.
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,490.76,491.64,Thank you.
2018.17-949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,503.2,504.76,It's not a portion of the park?
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,504.76,505.64,It's not a portion of the park.
2018.17-949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,510.36,516.36,"Yeah, and -- and, you know, whether something can be within a unit but not be a portion of the unit is kind of a nice question."
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,522.12,526.16,"I -- I would agree, but the Court doesn't need to reach that issue."
2018.17-949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,535.96,536.76,Right.
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,536.76,540.92,They shall not be subject to regulations applicable solely to public lands within the units.
2018.17-949,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,554.28,555.08,"Well, how does it do that?"
2018.17-949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,555.08,555.2,All right.
2018.17-949,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,556.08,556.32,I'm sorry.
2018.17-949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,556.32,559.84,If I can just ask one more question related to this.
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,585.12,586.88,The -- there are two parts to that.
2018.17-949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,593.2,594.04,Right.
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,594.04,609.4,"In terms of having title to water, this Court has, in U.S. v. California, and PPL Montana, certainly suggested with very strong language that, with the Submerged Lands Act, with title to the submerged lands, and with ownership and control of all the resources within there, that is effectively title to the waters."
2018.17-949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,609.4,611.28,"No, I mean as to the public lands."
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,625.64,626.52,That is definitely right.
2018.17-949,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,628.64,629.64,Could I ask you to go back to the --
2018.17-949,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,629.64,632.04,The state doesn't have title --
2018.17-949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,632.04,633.16,Justice Kagan?
2018.17-949,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,633.16,668.12,"Could I ask you to go back to the applicable -- regulations applicable solely to public lands? And you suggested that that language is what distinguishes Park Service regulations from, let's say, EPA regulations. But, when I read that language, ""regulations applicable solely to public lands,"" it seems to be making a distinction between regulations that apply solely, exclusively to public lands and those that apply more broadly to both public and private lands. That seems to be the distinction this makes on its face."
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,676.24,676.76,Yes.
2018.17-949,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,704.04,704.28,But -- but -- but --
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,704.28,704.56,Go ahead.
2018.17-949,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,704.56,719.56,"But I guess solely to public lands, is like if you take out the -- if you take out the word ""solely,"" this -- this is saying solely to public lands as compared to what, as compared to -- to public lands and something else, meaning non-public lands."
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,728.92,732.84,The sentence needs to have meaning beyond articulating what is already true.
2018.17-949,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,786.72,811.08,"I -- I understand what -- I think it's a good point, the point you make about, look, if it were public lands versus public and non-public lands, this would not be doing very much. But I guess what I want to know from you is, like, why pick this language to convey what you want to convey? I mean, how do I have to manipulate this language to get it to mean what you want it to mean?"
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,811.08,813.84,I can't answer why Congress chose those specific words.
2018.17-949,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,813.84,828.52,"But, I mean, what -- what -- what could you do to this language to make it more like what you're suggesting it means? Because I look at this language, it just doesn't say -- it's just not anywhere close to what you're saying it means."
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,828.52,829.52,"I mean, we believe the --"
2018.17-949,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,829.52,830.72,But maybe I'm wrong about that.
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,832.88,839.0,"If the language weren't read in context with all three sentences, and read in context with the statute, the meaning becomes clearer."
2018.17-949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,880.24,885.12,Did the -- the Park Service had no -- no regulatory authority over these areas prior to ANILCA or --
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,885.12,886.8,None.
2018.17-949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,889.72,904.76,"Well, I mean, that seems the question to me, that -- that the Park Service has a reg, I imagine, that says no bonfires in Yellowstone, within the boundaries of Yellowstone."
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,918.08,919.0,"Oh, okay."
2018.17-949,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,924.24,924.8,Thank you.
2018.17-949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,924.8,927.04,Good -- good choice.
2018.17-949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,932.2,932.76,Ms. Botstein.
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,932.76,939.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Understanding ANILCA requires understanding remote Alaska."
2018.17-949,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,978.68,1002.84,"Well, ""commandeer"" is strong language, but what -- what do you say for the -- the Park Service's argument that, with respect to their reserved water rights and so on, that you would be creating a checkerboard sort of situation where the Park Service has authority with respect to some areas but not others along -- along the river?"
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1002.84,1007.68,It is true that within these park areas there are areas of mixed jurisdiction.
2018.17-949,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1031.48,1037.92,"But what authority would you say that the Park Service has? I mean, you're asserting authority with respect to the river."
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1048.52,1086.0,"What Congress did was mandated cooperative management as a primary management tool in these parks, so -- and this gets back to the first question from the Court. Justice Sotomayor asked how can the Park Service fulfill its statutory mission if it doesn't have title to all the lands and the waters. What Congress said is you work together and create a management plan for each area, identify areas of concern on public and non-public land, and work with landowners and the State of Alaska to try to cooperatively resolve those conflicts because Congress knew it wasn't giving sole and exclusive jurisdiction to the federal government. If there's any doubt about that, Your Honor --"
2018.17-949,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1086.0,1088.88,I don't think you've answered my question.
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1127.56,1142.12,"No, Your Honor, because the statutory mission is limited to regulation on the public lands, on the federal lands. Congress reserved state lands, non-public lands to Alaska, private landowners, or native corporations."
2018.17-949,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1143.16,1145.2,"I -- I'm sorry, just that's not true."
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1149.72,1150.24,Yes.
2018.17-949,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1150.24,1158.12,And your position or your co-counsel's position is that all of these rivers belong to the state?
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1158.12,1166.32,"The navigable rivers that were state -- that were not federal owner -- in ownership that passed to the state under the Submerged Lands Act, yes."
2018.17-949,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1166.32,1172.08,"Well, we have a problem with whether you can own navigable waters, but that's a different issue."
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1172.08,1228.92,"What Congress did, Your Honor, was said -- you know, when Congress names the rivers as part of a watershed, in part what it's saying is, on the public lands, your statutory mission is to regulate in a way that protects these watersheds, protects access to the watersheds, protects the watersheds, but, at the same time, it is the state that has jurisdiction over the water themselves. And if there's any doubt about this, if you look through Title 16, when Congress created different national parks, it used vastly different jurisdictional language. When Congress created Yellowstone, which Justice Breyer mentioned, this is what it said: The Yellowstone National Park, as its boundaries now are defined or as they may hereinafter be defined or extended, shall be under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. That's a very clear statement that says we drew a circle and everything within it is federal; the Park Service can manage it."
2018.17-949,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1265.92,1280.04,I'm having a hard time accepting your position in this case with your position that the Katie John decisions should be retained.
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1288.88,1307.52,"Your Honor, giving effect to Congress's intent in ANILCA does -- may require preserving the rural subsistence priority in Title 8 of the legislation, even if it does require a different statutory definition. Now no party has challenged the current federal subsistence management -- subsistence regulations."
2018.17-949,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1361.12,1361.4,One could --
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1361.4,1362.4,-- in accordance with Congress's intent.
2018.17-949,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1362.4,1371.8,"-- if one defines them the same, but not in accordance with your views, but in accordance with the government's current view, and the Katie law decisions view --"
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1371.8,1372.44,The statute --
2018.17-949,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1372.44,1373.84,-- then you don't win here.
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1373.84,1376.88,The statute does contain one definition.
2018.17-949,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1392.6,1403.52,So why isn't an -- all of the references to the government's control of rivers in this Act a similar statement of purpose?
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1403.52,1413.32,"Because those need to be read in the context of 103(c), which doesn't say the federal government can come in and regulate these rivers if we don't compel and ask them to do that."
2018.17-949,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1413.32,1423.8,"Or regulate subsistence living, but you're arguing that the purpose of the statute is reflected in its structure and words."
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1444.76,1455.6,"Your Honor, the statutory duties that the Park Service is given, is delegated to regulate for non-subsistence purposes, is limited by Section 103(c) --"
2018.17-949,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1455.6,1456.36,You agree --
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1456.36,1458.48,-- and that is a meaningful restriction.
2018.17-949,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1458.48,1462.76,"You agree with the Katie John decisions, correct?"
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1462.76,1466.56,We are not challenging the federal subsistence management regulations that were mentioned.
2018.17-949,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1466.56,1472.16,Do you -- do you -- does the State of Alaska agree with those decisions?
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1472.16,1522.0,"Your Honor, the reasoning of those decisions may be appropriate to -- for the limited purpose of effectuating Title 8 but should not be expanded to change the federal reserved water rights doctrine throughout the circuit for all purposes. And, certainly, Congress had good reasons for treating Alaska differently than other states in the main body of the statute because this comes back to the Congress's special solicitude for Alaska and its uniqueness, which are concerns this Court spoke about in its 2016 opinion. This is not a situation where we're talking about tourists who might be disturbing a wilderness area."
2018.17-949,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1539.56,1539.92,Sure.
2018.17-949,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1539.92,1549.16,These are exactly the reasons that states were given control of their submerged lands under the Submerged Lands Act. And Congress wanted to effectuate those purposes in this statute.
2018.17-949,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1549.72,1557.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler."
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1557.08,1617.56,"Mr. Chief Justice -- excuse me -- and may it please the Court: I'd like to identify at the outset two statutes that have not been discussed which we think are very important to understand the provisions of ANILCA at issue here. The first is a general statute enacted in 1976 and added to the Park Service's general authorities, which is reproduced in our -- in our brief at page 8a, and it says the Secretary, under such terms and conditions, et cetera, will have the authority to issue regulations concerning boating and other activities on or relating to water located within system units. That is a general authority, contrary to Petitioner's argument, that specifically delegates to the Park Service, along with the Coast Guard, power to regulate navigable waters in the national park system. So the question here is whether that was somehow abrogated when it comes to Alaska. And I think the answer to that question is in another provision that -- that is not mentioned."
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1617.56,1619.56,"Mr. Kneedler, before we get to the abrogation question --"
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1619.56,1619.8,Yes.
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1619.8,1626.76,-- I'd just like to understand your argument on the terms of -- of the '76 Act itself a little bit better.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1696.04,1696.32,Okay.
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1703.4,1703.84,No.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1705.24,1705.48,Yeah.
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1706.16,1708.8,-- you even qualify under this statute before we get to abrogation.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1708.8,1709.28,Yes.
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1716.84,1723.52,"Within the outer boundaries but -- but not necessarily from -- we know from ANILCA, within the unit itself."
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1723.52,1725.72,"Well, that goes directly to the --"
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1725.72,1726.16,Okay.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1739.24,1749.92,"Well, non-navigable waters -- I mean, first of all, we're talking in -- in this instance about a -- a river that runs through federal lands on both sides."
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1758.92,1759.12,Okay.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1761.48,1765.68,"Well, it would -- it would affect the non-navigable waters within the area."
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1770.36,1772.04,That's not -- I guess that doesn't help me either.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1785.04,1806.2,"Well, it -- it has -- it has -- a hovercraft could have -- they're very loud, they're unsightly, and I don't -- I don't read this to say that the effect has to be on the water. The purpose of giving the regulation, regulatory authority to the Park Service is to enable it to fulfill the purposes of the park as a whole, not just the waters."
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1806.2,1811.68,Do we know from the record that the hovercraft could be heard within the system unit itself?
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1811.68,1812.24,"Well, there were --"
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1812.24,1812.8,Let alone seen.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1812.8,1816.76,-- there were federal lands on -- on both sides of the -- of the -- of the water.
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1819.56,1820.2,Okay.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1820.2,1866.64,"-- be heard on the lands. But if I could go to the second statutory provision I wanted -- wanted to cite, this is in 410hh-2 that we cite in our brief, again, against the backdrop of the 1976 statute, it says ""the Secretary shall administer the lands, waters, and interests therein added to existing areas or established by the foregoing sections of ANILCA"" -- the one that lists the parks -- ""in accordance with the Organic Act as amended and supplemented."" In other words, in accordance with the general authorities, which includes the 1976 Act. This provision, far from abrogating the Secretary's authority, confirms that with respect to the waters that were added to the -- to the parks, to the park system --"
2018.17-949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1866.64,1867.16,Okay.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1867.56,1870.4,-- the Secretary can invoke the 1976 Act.
2018.17-949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1870.4,1882.8,"So your point here, which we'll hear something about probably on rebuttal, is that there's some other statutes here that, whatever it says in -- in 103(c), give direct authority to the Secretary to do this."
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2021.52,2049.4,"There are a number of answers to that, and there -- there are several respects in which 103(c), the second sentence, is inapplicable. Perhaps the most basic is the fact that 103(c), that second sentence, refers to -- excuse me -- refers to land -- no lands which have been conveyed to a state. The -- the Submerged Lands Act conveyed to the state only submerged lands and interests in waters."
2018.17-949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2058.8,2060.44,I got that one.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2067.44,2069.88,"No, Justice, if I could just finish my point."
2018.17-949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2069.88,2070.2,I'm not --
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2070.2,2105.72,"No, that -- that's -- that's critical to the point I was making before, that the 1976 Act is one of general applicability, specifically giving the Secretary the authority to regulate waters, including navigable waters. And the other statute I mentioned specifically says that the Secretary may regulate the waters added to these park units according to the general authorities, which includes the '76 Act, and that ties directly to the fact that the waters, the navigable waters, were not conveyed to the state, and, therefore, the Secretary's regulatory authority over such waters is not -- is not affected at all by the --"
2018.17-949,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2105.72,2105.8,Can --
2018.17-949,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2105.8,2106.32,Who has title to --
2018.17-949,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2106.32,2124.04,"Can I ask the question in reverse? What can't you do? Under your reading of this statute, what sorts of regulations can't you pass? Because, if you can identify a permissible and impermissible, you're giving meaning to this."
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2127.76,2135.96,And I -- I think it may be useful to distinguish two different types of -- of non -- of -- of land not owned by the United States.
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2180.2,2180.72,"But, Mr. Kneedler --"
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2180.72,2181.64,-- of navigable waters --
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2181.64,2187.0,-- I haven't yet heard an answer to Justice Sotomayor's question when it comes to water.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2193.48,2193.96,No.
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2198.28,2198.76,Right.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2209.76,2210.12,"Well, it --"
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2210.12,2211.2,-- so where is the limit?
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2211.2,2221.36,"It's -- it's well -- it's well established under -- under the navigational servitude and -- and, in fact, the Submerged Lands Act preserves to Congress the ability to regulate in the interest of commerce."
2018.17-949,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2221.36,2223.32,"So it's plenary -- it's plenary then, right?"
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2223.32,2242.76,"I -- I -- I -- it's -- it's pretty close to plenary, but this Court has recognized that there is -- but the Secretary hasn't exercised it to that degree, but -- but the -- this Court has recognized in cases involving navigable water that the fact that the state owns the submerged lands does not interfere with Congress's ability to regulate the waters themselves."
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2242.76,2243.52,"Well, but that's -- the --"
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2243.52,2244.88,"The Clean Water Act, for example."
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2244.88,2255.48,"The navigational servitude, I mean, that's really about if Alaska decided to, you know, build a bridge across the river and things like that. I don't know that it reaches as far to justify any type of regulation on -- on the water."
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2255.48,2262.52,"Well, Congress regulates, again, outside of parks, regulates extensively navigable waters for dredging and filling, for --"
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2262.52,2263.92,It regulates navigable waters.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2264.52,2266.36,"-- the Clean Water Act, for pollution."
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2266.36,2267.44,"No, no, all sorts of things."
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2288.24,2288.44,"Well, the --"
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2288.44,2296.2,"And while -- while you may think a hovercraft is unsightly, I mean, if you're trying to get from point A to point B, it's pretty beautiful. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2296.2,2322.08,"Well, there are -- there are -- there are a number of instances within the Act in which Congress has specifically required the Secretary to accommodate, to take into account what's different about Alaska, by requiring them to accommodate methods of transportation like air. We mentioned boating. The fact that the Secretary is -- is permitted to regulate boating only subject -- only reasonably means that he can regulate boating, means the National Park Service can regulate boating --"
2018.17-949,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2322.08,2322.76,So am I to --
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2322.76,2324.44,-- on -- on waters within the park.
2018.17-949,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2324.44,2355.04,"Can I summarize what I think you said? Are you saying that 103(c) basically, because of the navigational servitude, the other regulations you've pointed to, doesn't permit the government to regulate activities on the territorial lands or -- or on the submerged lands, but it does give it basically plenary authority over navigable waters?"
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2355.04,2356.6,I -- I hesitate to say plenary.
2018.17-949,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2366.88,2382.44,"So you're basically saying, whatever the regulations were under the Organic Act or even under this Act, and charging you with taking care of certain parks, that the navigable waters are part of that charge?"
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2382.44,2382.96,Yes.
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2438.96,2439.12,So your -- you think --
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2439.12,2441.28,The Park Service has not done more than that.
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2441.28,2449.0,"So -- so you think the state's argument works with respect to solid land, land land?"
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2449.0,2450.16,"Well, there is --"
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2450.16,2458.92,It's -- it's only because you don't think that water is included in public lands that their argument doesn't work?
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2458.92,2460.92,"No, their -- well, it's because --"
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2460.92,2462.16,It's only because it is water?
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2462.16,2464.2,Water -- water was not conveyed to the state.
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2484.04,2507.24,"But that's -- that's the -- that's one of your arguments that causes me concern, because you're saying that if the regulation applies to the -- the private or state land, then it is not a regulation solely applicable to public land and, therefore, it's not covered. But the -- the sentence is obviously designed to protect the state, the natives, and the private landholders against the federal government or the Park Service to whatever extent we can debate."
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2513.16,2525.24,"Well, I'm not saying -- I'm not -- in fact, I would disclaim the proposition that the Park Service could treat them as -- as -- as -- the same way it treats regular Park Service lands."
2018.17-949,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2537.88,2553.04,"But, if I understand your view, Mr. Kneedler, what you're saying this means is that non-public lands shall not be subject to regulations that are applicable only to public lands. And you don't need a statute to tell you that."
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2562.56,2589.96,"Well, I -- I think the purpose of the statute -- and, again, I think this comes through in the legislative history that -- that is cited on the other side -- the native groups were concerned, and as was the state, that because large tracts of land that they had selected were going to be included within the -- in the -- within the outer boundaries, that they were not going to be -- that they would be treated just like -- they wanted assurance that they wouldn't be treated just like Park Service. And that's what this did."
2018.17-949,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2606.36,2628.84,"But just on the face of things, Mr. Kneedler, if -- if the Park Service issues a regulation and the regulation says this applies only to public lands within a park, right, and you're not a public land within a park, you're a private land within a park, what kind of assurance do you need? It's like you know that you're not a public land, so it doesn't matter that you're in the park."
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2639.36,2641.08,"With all respect, I don't think that's correct."
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2674.2,2675.32,But you're not taking --
2018.17-949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2675.32,2676.16,Though I think there are --
2018.17-949,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2676.16,2677.72,Can I ask a question about --
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2677.72,2679.76,-- adequate account of -- of the third sentence.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2715.44,2717.28,"No, I -- I don't think so at all."
2018.17-949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2730.84,2741.76,"If you -- let me go back to this question because this is obviously the question that's bothering some of us, okay? And it seems to me you sort of answered it both ways."
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2821.76,2823.12,"No, I -- I think it's -- (Laughter.)"
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2823.12,2847.8,"-- I think it's basically correct, but there is the category of regulations that are not applicable solely to public lands because -- because they have been made applicable to inholdings within the Park Service. Whether or not that's valid in any particular case is a different matter, but there are three, as I mentioned, that were done pursuant to statutory authorization, and those, I think, must be valid because Congress has authorized them."
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2847.8,2848.12,"Counsel, I think --"
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2848.12,2849.56,But that is not really involved here.
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2851.84,2853.84,"Counsel, Justice Alito has been trying to ask a question."
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2853.84,2855.72,I'm sorry. (Laughter.)
2018.17-949,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2855.72,2861.96,"Thank you, Chief Justice. I just wanted to ask you a question about implied reserved water rights."
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2875.8,2894.48,"Well, in the 1999 regulations that Congress allowed to go into effect, the -- the Park Service by rule identified the Park Service units or the areas added or expanded by ANILCA in which there were reserved water rights."
2018.17-949,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2942.96,2948.16,So what has been reserved -- what has been reserved here is plenary authority for the federal government --
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2948.16,2948.4,No.
2018.17-949,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2948.4,2950.88,-- to regulate the navigable waters?
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2950.88,2971.8,"The -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the extent of the -- of the -- and -- and the -- the Ninth Circuit's opinion in Katie John III makes this clear, the extent or even, frankly, the existence at a particular location of a reserved water right has not been decided. If -- if there's an adjudication down the road that the reserved water right does not extend to some stretch or another area, that could be resolved."
2018.17-949,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2982.36,3000.24,"Well, no, I wasn't asking about the geographical limits of it. I'm asking about the regulatory limits. As to water for which there is a reserved right, the federal government, the Park Service can do -- can regulate completely, as it -- is that right?"
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3000.24,3026.04,"I -- I wouldn't -- I -- I -- I think within the national park system it overlaps with the 1976 statute that I -- that I mentioned, which I -- I think directly -- you don't have to go through the reserved water rights approach to get there -- within national parks, the -- the -- Katie John's subsistence use could have been satisfied by relying on the 1976 Act and not relying on reserved water rights. And all we have here are navigable waters within national parks."
2018.17-949,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3031.92,3046.92,"Well, could I just slip in one more question since you referred to Katie -- to Katie John, and I'll ask you the same question that was asked of counsel for Alaska. If we were to rule against you here, would that necessarily mean that the Katie John decision was incorrect?"
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3046.92,3088.16,"I -- I would certainly hope not, but -- but, I mean, I think Petitioners have a different -- Petitioner and the State have a difficult argument because Katie John and the regulations implementing it, once the Congress specifically allowed to go into effect with full acknowledge that Katie John was out there, it turns on the definition of public lands, which is a term that runs throughout the Act, which is, we think, a good reason why -- why it should be upheld. At the very least, Katie John demonstrates the importance of federal regulation of waters within these areas, in that instance for -- for subsistence uses. If I could just finish the answer about sentence 3 of -- of 103 -- 103(c)."
2018.17-949,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3155.32,3170.2,"But there's nothing that says that the Park Service has plenary authority over all the navigable rivers within the conservation system unit, nor is there any indication by any member of Congress of such a authority?"
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3170.2,3178.12,"Well, I mean, putting to one side whatever we might mean by plenary, the 1976 Act specifically gives the parks --"
2018.17-949,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3178.12,3178.88,But this would have been a --
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3178.88,3179.56,-- authority over water.
2018.17-949,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3179.56,3180.12,Sorry to interrupt.
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3192.36,3194.32,I -- I -- to the contrary.
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3242.56,3263.76,"Well, but, I mean, the waters are very important to Alaskan way of life in the way they aren't elsewhere. And I -- I guess the argument on the other side, it would be pretty extraordinary if you go to the trouble to say you only can regulate lands with respect to which you have title, and you say from that you get the authority over the rivers, even though title in the submerged lands is in the state?"
2018.17-949,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3263.76,3268.56,"Well, our argument doesn't depend on the title question or -- or control over navigable waters."
2018.17-949,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3361.08,3365.6,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Findley."
2018.17-949,3,62648,matthew_t_findley,,3365.6,3373.72,"Yes, thank you. Counsel several times cited the provision of ANILCA, saying these parks and preserves shall be governed in accord to the Organic Act."
2018.17-949,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3406.36,3408.88,The problem is you don't have title to the water.
2018.17-949,3,62648,matthew_t_findley,,3479.12,3486.8,What matters here is that the United States does not have title to those waters and does not have title to the submerged lands.
2018.17-949,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3645.08,3646.12,"Thank you, counsel."
