2009.08-1402,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.357,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1402, Berghuis v. Smith."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,7.714,17.209,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is really a case about the law of habeas corpus for this murder conviction that was obtained in the Michigan courts."
2009.08-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,119.73,127.994,"The -- I don't know if this is relevant or how to use it, but years ago, I took a course in this kind of thing at the Kennedy School."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,174.986,175.626,Well--
2009.08-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,175.626,181.42,"On the other hand, that isn't what they testified to, so I guess you're going to tell me just ignore it and forget it."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,181.42,193.915,"--Well, if you're looking at the Michigan Supreme Court decision, I think it's important to note that it's not just that it would have to be incorrect; it would have to be objectively unreasonable under the AEDPA standard, that what's at issue here is did the Michigan Supreme Court unreasonably apply--"
2009.08-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,193.915,201.976,"Well, you know, maybe it's the only way to do it, that the statistician stays with these urns, which I guess they have computer programs for."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,201.976,203.383,--Well--
2009.08-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,203.383,210.721,"I -- I don't know, in other words, and maybe I should just -- I hate to write something, like, saying 2 and 2 is 6."
2009.08-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,210.721,213.513,But we don't have any urns here.
2009.08-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,213.954,214.329,No.
2009.08-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,217.951,222.872,I think your point was that Duren was quite different in the numbers--
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,222.872,223.621,--Yes.
2009.08-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,223.621,237.366,"--starting out with women 54 percent of the population, and then dwindled to 14.5 percent of the -- of the jurors, available jurors."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,237.366,238.052,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-1402,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,238.052,244.534,"I guess the point is, just following up, it's not that you're going to say 2 plus 2 is 6."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,250.047,250.593,Right.
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,275.815,281.013,May I interrupt with this question that goes both to what Justice Ginsburg asked and the other?
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,297.291,304.536,"--Well, the -- in my view, this Court really didn't provide guidance in Duren about how this should be measured."
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.346,321.655,"But isn't it perfectly obvious that you're going to have dramatic differences where you only have a very small percentage, as in -- in Grand Rapids, for example, and where you have a major percentage as you did in Duren."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,321.655,322.669,"Well, I think that's right."
2009.08-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,345.706,359.763,"But -- but I suppose the thrust of Justice Stevens's question was that if you have a very small population that we are concerned with, then the disparity can be very substantial, especially if you use the comparative disparity."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,359.763,360.481,--That's right.
2009.08-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,360.98,366.947,"And I think -- at least, I was interested in that aspect of his question."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,366.947,378.174,"--Well, as kind of the first matter, it seems like this Court doesn't have to really reach that hard question, insofar as the Michigan Supreme Court's decision is entitled to deference under AEDPA, meaning--"
2009.08-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,378.174,379.442,"Yes, but we have a halfhour."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,379.832,380.331,--Okay.
2009.08-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,397.669,400.165,But you -- but your test is 10 percent.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,406.789,407.647,--7.28.
2009.08-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,407.647,408.318,--It's under 10 percent.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,416.768,420.847,The 10 percent test is not really necessarily tied to the absolute disparity.
2009.08-1402,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,433.404,456.675,"You would suggest that in a population that has 9 percent of any group, protected group, that if they didn't have one person serve on a jury per year of that group, that that would not -- under an absolute disparity test using the 10 percent figure, that would not give rise to any kind of suspicion?"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,456.675,457.799,--That's right.
2009.08-1402,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,459.249,461.433,It would not meet the Duren's second prong.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,461.433,461.791,--That's right.
2009.08-1402,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,462.544,463.776,Does that make any sense to you?
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,463.776,468.683,--It reflects the actual practice of the courts because of the -- if you look at the--
2009.08-1402,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,468.683,481.363,"Well, I don't think that -- that any court has suggested that the complete absence of the protected group in that kind of number wouldn't give rise to a fair representation claim."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,489.389,495.246,"--Well, the -- it seems -- looking at what the Federal courts have done, they've all -- they've generally used multiple tests."
2009.08-1402,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,504.179,505.025,I don't.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,527.202,529.358,I -- I understand that point.
2009.08-1402,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,545.318,553.738,"Well, I agree that if a protected group is 1 percent of the population, that it's not likely that their absence is going to give rise to any flags."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,553.738,554.471,Right.
2009.08-1402,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,554.471,555.267,But I think there is a difference.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,573.697,589.423,"Well -- and one of the concerns I have is I -- for example, I know in Kent County that if you look at the other distinct groups-you look at the 1990 census for Kent County, it was comprised of 2 point -- 2.9 percent Latino-Americans, 1.1 percent Asian-Americans, and 0.6 percent Native Americans."
2009.08-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.488,621.862,What's wrong--
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,621.862,622.47,What's missing -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.47,622.767,--Yes.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,623.547,625.454,What's wrong with what?
2009.08-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,625.454,626.358,With a rule?
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,640.9,641.899,That what was I--
2009.08-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,641.899,642.354,Yes--
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,642.354,644.366,--That has been the practice of the courts below.
2009.08-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,686.508,686.836,I don't know.
2009.08-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.647,728.693,"--That's why Las Vegas makes a profit, right?"
2009.08-1402,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,731.162,739.172,"Well, it does depend, doesn't it, on the size of the -- the urn?"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,751.307,752.231,--I think that's right.
2009.08-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,790.2,796.432,"--Are you -- are you saying that systematic exclusion -- and we are assuming good faith, no intent to discriminate--"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,796.432,796.588,Right.
2009.08-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,796.588,803.631,--that systematic exclusion is always proven or disproven by statistics?
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,803.631,804.224,No.
2009.08-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,807.74,808.067,Well--
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,808.067,809.253,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,809.253,810.973,"--And I'll -- I'll allow you to answer, of course, but--"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,810.973,811.16,Please.
2009.08-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,811.16,816.015,"--If not, how do we show systematic exclusion?"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,818.592,826.247,"The Duren case involved a categorical distinction, meaning women were exempted in a different way than men."
2009.08-1402,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,845.051,881.492,"The statistical issue is very interesting, but I -- I wonder, if we were not looking at this through AEDPA, why we -- why a court should necessarily have to start with the question -- with the elements of the prima facie -- with the question of whether there is unconstitutional underrepresentation, when in the end, as I understand Duren, the defendant has to identify some aspect of the jury selection process that has a disproportionate impact on the group involved and is unreasonable?"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,944.168,958.897,"--I think that may be the easiest way to resolve this case, because under the third prong, the Michigan Supreme Court on the question of jury assignment concluded that Mr. Smith had failed to factually show that there was any underrepresentation that arose from that process."
2009.08-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,958.897,966.236,"Didn't the Michigan Supreme Court do essentially what Justice Alito suggested, that they said: We'll give you the benefit of the doubt, go on to the third."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,981.744,1000.193,"The -- the information that Mr. Smith's expert provided is he -- he had -- there are two jury terms that were described, one for 6 months, in which this juror assignment to the local courts first occurred, and then 1 year for the following year, in which the jury assignment did not send them to the local courts first."
2009.08-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1066.179,1068.18,That -- that's in the -- in the circuit court.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1071.927,1072.832,--No.
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1113.313,1119.263,"But isn't it possible -- it's awfully hard to get these percentages when you get small numbers, as you do."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1137.084,1137.365,No.
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.799,1144.376,Right.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1144.376,1147.22,"And the districts are the local courts, and they are misdemeanor courts."
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1147.22,1153.544,But -- but there's a much higher percentage of African-Americans in Grand Rapids than there is in the county as a whole.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1153.544,1153.887,That's right.
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1172.865,1178.255,"But -- but the jurors that served on the district court, were they -- were they taken from the entire county, too, or just from Grand Rapids?"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1178.255,1186.811,"--No, they were -- all of the -- all of the district courts -- Grand Rapids, Rockford, all of these small municipalities -- drew from the circuit court pool."
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.811,1193.152,So the district court jurors could -- could include as many jurors who are not from Grand Rapids as they could from Grand Rapids?
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1193.152,1193.214,Exactly.
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.214,1193.386,I see.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1193.386,1194.727,"In other words, the proof--"
2009.08-1402,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1194.727,1195.164,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1196.322,1196.587,--That's all right.
2009.08-1402,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1196.587,1197.679,I thought it was the other way around.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1206.707,1208.193,"It does take Grand Rapids people, that's right."
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1215.719,1217.719,"I -- apparently, we were not communicating correctly."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1217.719,1221.419,All of the jurors from the entire county are drawn into one pool.
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1221.419,1222.105,Right.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1222.105,1228.041,And then the -- the local courts can identify those people that came from within their jurisdiction and draw them out.
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.041,1228.665,So the--
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1228.665,1229.382,Everyone does it.
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1229.382,1237.084,"--So the jurors who served on the district court were primarily from Grand Rapids, rather than Kent County as a whole?"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1237.084,1243.315,The -- there's no information to -- in the record--
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1243.315,1243.97,"Well, let me just ask you--"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1243.97,1244.453,--that indicates that.
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1244.453,1245.377,--a factual question.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1249.968,1251.999,No.
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1255.653,1268.849,"So, then, inevitably, if you give the district court jurors first, a pool of African-American jurors are going to be larger serving in the district court than in the -- in the felony court."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1268.849,1272.398,It all depends on the local courts and their usage of jurors.
2009.08-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1289.375,1289.609,Okay.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1302.619,1303.758,That would be the argument.
2009.08-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1303.758,1304.35,--That could be.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1322.842,1326.234,"Well, there wasn't really testimony whether it was good or bad."
2009.08-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1342.132,1342.678,Are you--
2009.08-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1342.678,1348.77,Do you have to be a -- a resident of the district in order to serve as a juror in the district court?
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1348.77,1349.191,Yes.
2009.08-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1349.191,1350.049,You have to be?
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1350.049,1350.693,That's right.
2009.08-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.693,1366.59,"So then if this system were not in effect, and if Grand Rapids had to take white jurors from other counties as opposed to a larger percentage of black jurors from Grand Rapids, then you'd have a claim in Grand Rapids, wouldn't you?"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1366.59,1368.06,It would create a problem in Grand Rapids.
2009.08-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.404,1374.495,"Well, you -- you'd have a jury pool in Grand Rapids that wouldn't reflect the larger number of blacks in Grand Rapids."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1374.495,1375.415,That's exactly right.
2009.08-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.415,1376.853,"So you're damned if you do and damned if you don't, right?"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1376.853,1378.179,I think that's right.
2009.08-1402,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1378.179,1389.427,So -- so do we have any evidence in the record that -- I gather this whole claim depends upon Grand Rapids having more need for jurors per capita than anywhere else?
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1389.427,1389.848,That's exactly right.
2009.08-1402,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1389.848,1392.988,So do we have any evidence in the record that that's the case?
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1392.988,1395.986,Nothing other than the anecdotal testimony.
2009.08-1402,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1405.139,1408.513,"I would suppose that's something we can find out pretty easily, right?"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1414.665,1415.102,--That's right.
2009.08-1402,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1415.102,1417.29,--compare it to how many jurors Rockland needs.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1417.29,1418.241,Right.
2009.08-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1439.108,1439.389,Let me get that.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1455.49,1457.74,"It would have to be significant, and I don't think there's--"
2009.08-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1457.74,1460.473,"Well, yes -- no, that's -- it's a hypothetical."
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1460.473,1460.879,"--Oh, if the--"
2009.08-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1460.879,1467.301,"Routinely results in significant underrepresentation, then that is automatically systematic exclusion?"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1467.301,1469.282,--Not -- not under my reading of Duren.
2009.08-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1472.546,1482.513,"And then they would not have -- have gone on to the systemic issue, because the disparity was so marked, just on the -- just on the numbers?"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1482.513,1485.808,"--Well, I -- I don't think the numbers were sufficient to justify--"
2009.08-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1485.808,1489.056,"I mean, isn't the -- I'm trying to think about the third prong of -- of--"
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1489.056,1489.29,--Right.
2009.08-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1489.29,1491.4,--of Duren.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1499.835,1501.441,And that's the argument being raised by Mr. Smith.
2009.08-1402,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1608.569,1611.24,But concluding that it's systematic doesn't mean that the defendant wins.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1619.612,1620.127,--That's true.
2009.08-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1659.286,1662.14,One point of information: What is the Michigan ID?
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1662.14,1668.75,"--Oh, what happens if you don't have it -- some people don't have a right to a driver's license, so you can still obtain an identification card even if you are not able to drive."
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.011,1682.698,Let me ask this factual question: Am I correct in understanding that Michigan in fact has changed the practice with regard to giving priority to--
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1682.698,1683.01,--That's right.
2009.08-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.01,1683.431,--Yes.
2009.08-1402,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,1683.431,1684.102,That's right.
2009.08-1402,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1684.102,1685.397,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,1692.022,1692.661,Okay.
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1725.335,1730.99,"If you had a community with one African-American, your argument would be the same, if that's the disparity?"
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,1734.363,1757.135,"Well, I think that certainly if you adopt the Petitioner's test for 60 percent of the country, Duren would not apply regarding African -- Americans; 90 percent of the country, wouldn't apply to Hispanics; and Duren protections would never apply to Native Americans anywhere."
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1757.135,1765.554,I guess I'm -- I guess I'm echoing Justice Stevens's question of whether or not this type of statistical analysis really works when you're dealing with relatively small numbers.
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,1765.554,1775.409,"Well, I would make this observation: That in Duren v. Missouri, on page 366, the Court stated,"
2009.08-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1795.947,1798.852,"Yes, but there you were dealing with an express exemption."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,1837.119,1848.849,"Well, first of all, that's completely correct; however, the rule in Duren, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that the numbers alone prove systematic."
2009.08-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1850.989,1852.066,Where did the Court say that?
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,1852.066,1854.05,--On page 366.
2009.08-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.918,1870.604,Excuse me.
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,1879.959,1881.273,--It did.
2009.08-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.273,1894.874,"And the third one was that you had to establish -- after having already established the disparity, you had to establish that there was a selection process which caused the disparity."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,1903.091,1917.382,"Well, Justice Scalia, my reading of Duren does indeed include that third test, but the problem is, is that Duren puts the burden of proof on that test on the State."
2009.08-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1931.174,1936.264,"Oh, that was after -- that was after showing the systematic factors."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,1990.866,2003.032,"--Well, we did show a number of systematic factors, but if you look at Duren itself, on page 366 it says, the numbers alone proved it."
2009.08-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.717,2008.604,How do you reconcile that with the third test?
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2016.057,2033.519,"--Well, I believe that we met the three-prong test, but I feel that it is an error in reading Duren to say anything other than that: The State must show how this came about, not the defendant."
2009.08-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2033.519,2034.58,Where does it say that?
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2034.58,2034.923,"--did show it, and--"
2009.08-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2034.923,2037.407,Where does it say that?
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2037.407,2043.669,--It says that at pages 368 to 369.
2009.08-1402,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2048.091,2061.35,"It says that the State has to show that it has a reason, a good reason, for -- the aspect of the selection process that has been identified as causing the disparity."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2086.856,2091.368,"--Well, I would read one sentence from Duren, if I could:"
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2120.56,2131.572,Do I understand your siphoning theory to depend upon Grand Rapids drawing a disproportionate number of jurors from the pool?
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2131.572,2132.726,That is--
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2132.726,2136.493,"That results in fewer minorities going up to the county court, right?"
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2136.493,2137.179,--That's right.
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2147.627,2148.317,Removed from the county--
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2148.317,2149.378,--from the overall pool.
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2149.378,2158.062,--Where -- where in the record is it established that Grand Rapids had a disproportionate need for jurors from the pool?
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2158.062,2161.232,I don't believe either side established that.
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2161.232,2173.242,"Well, if it's -- if your theory depends upon Grand Rapids drawing a disproportionate number and it is not in the record that Grand Rapids drew a disproportionate number, I think that means you lose."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2173.242,2205.885,"Well, I would respectfully disagree with the Court because it is not necessary, in our view, that each specific item that led to underrepresentation be, itself, something that's unconstitutional, but rather, the collective nature of it, that 15 out of 17 months persistently and repeatedly came up with substantial underrepresentation."
2009.08-1402,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2208.727,2217.38,"But that's the only factor that the Sixth Circuit identified as illegitimate, was this -- was this siphoning system."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2217.38,2218.975,"Well, I feel that--"
2009.08-1402,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2218.975,2220.005,"It rejected everything else, didn't it?"
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2220.005,2222.645,--I feel that there are a number of factors.
2009.08-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2230.156,2232.858,"Now, why is it -- I'm just not clear in my mind."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2272.953,2274.107,"Well, the record showed--"
2009.08-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.107,2274.669,Right.
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2274.669,2290.806,--that the people who were actually showing up for the jury panels at circuit court were very heavily overrepresented in the rural areas of Kent County and heavily underrepresented--
2009.08-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.806,2294.505,"Well, but -- but that's just the explanation of the problem that we're seeing."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2294.505,2294.536,--Right.
2009.08-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2294.708,2308.794,"The problem we're seeing is that if Grand Rapids has a higher juror utilization rate and they have a higher minority population, then you will end up with the leftover juries having a lower minority population."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2337.439,2337.657,--Yes.
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2361.958,2362.13,Of course.
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2371.676,2372.909,Well--
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2372.909,2386.264,"Your -- your theory depends upon Grand Rapids drawing not just a proportional number, if it's contributing 30 percent and it draws 30 percent; your theory depends upon Grand Rapids contributing 30 percent to the pool and drawing 40 percent."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2386.264,2418.486,"--Well, I guess I would simply say that the court administrator testified and the district judge found that they had substantial underrepresentation that was very noticeable, very visible, a severe problem, and after my client's trial, they -- they concluded that the best way of dealing with this was to end the siphoning process, which they did."
2009.08-1402,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2418.486,2419.126,"And so, what -- what did it result in?"
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2441.364,2442.082,"Well, I--"
2009.08-1402,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2442.082,2444.878,What's -- what's unreasonable about that argument?
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2444.878,2446.316,"--Well, I have two answers to that."
2009.08-1402,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2464.653,2475.15,"You can't -- you are comparing apples and oranges, because your pre-spike was over a year and your post-spike was over 6 months."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2479.35,2480.083,Okay.
2009.08-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2519.148,2522.286,"Well, I wouldn't say that, but I still haven't -- I will try again."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2567.579,2567.969,--Okay.
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2612.872,2613.668,How is that?
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2622.695,2634.55,"Well, the statistics showed, for example, that African-Americans had a much higher rate of not having an automobile."
2009.08-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2676.876,2677.986,May I stop you there for a moment?
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2709.425,2718.156,"--No doubt that that's true, and I am not saying that it is wrong to give real hardship exemptions."
2009.08-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2718.936,2722.094,But this -- he wasn't talking about individual cases.
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2722.094,2733.366,"--Well, in this case, one of the things that happened is that, if somebody didn't-simply didn't show up, that's it."
2009.08-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2762.384,2762.54,Let me just--
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2762.54,2766.01,"--tell the courts what to do, shouldn't the courts tell the police what to do?"
2009.08-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2766.01,2768.287,--Let me make sure I understand your position.
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2790.483,2797.885,"If you find that it is persistent, month in and month out--"
2009.08-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2797.885,2798.419,It is.
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2798.777,2808.663,--then you have a problem because society benefits when jurors are drawn from the broadest spectrum of the system.
2009.08-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2808.663,2809.022,--I didn't--
2009.08-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2809.022,2809.396,"Well, that's policy."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2813.815,2814.626,Well--
2009.08-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2814.626,2817.406,"--But is it unconstitutional, is what I'm trying to find out."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2823.985,2851.16,"--Well, overall, there's nothing wrong with granting excuses for genuine hardship; however, when you have this factor and factor 2 and factor 3 and factor 4, and they persistently come up with all-white juries, that's what Richard Hillary testified to, 98 percent of the time, nothing, but all-white juries."
2009.08-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2852.315,2861.747,Is there -- is there a Federal district that corresponds to this Kent County?
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2871.136,2897.627,"--Well, there is the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan that covers a very large amount of territory, and, frankly, I have not studied their statistics, but I know, from personal knowledge, that the African American population in the Western District of Michigan would be smaller than in Kent County or in the city of Grand Rapids, where--"
2009.08-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2897.627,2905.745,But you don't have -- you don't have comparable -- comparable records for what was going on in the -- in the district court?
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2905.745,2910.195,"--Well, if you mean the United States District Court--"
2009.08-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2910.195,2910.382,Yes.
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2910.382,2914.929,"--No, I -- I have not studied that situation, and--"
2009.08-1402,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2914.929,2919.145,Are there -- are there courts that you know of that do what you are suggesting needs to be done?
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,2941.386,2949.178,"--I don't know of a court that arrests people, and I -- in this case, it wasn't a question of arresting."
2009.08-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.25,2981.305,"Mr. Sterling, I don't -- you seem to acknowledge that, to make your case, you have to show that Grand Rapids district drew from the pool a disproportionate number of people."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,3013.106,3028.319,"In order to solve this problem, all that Kent County would have to do is to, if you take people to district court, put back the ones that aren't being used."
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3038.719,3042.423,"Your answer to Justice Scalia's question is -- is no, right?"
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,3068.865,3072.785,"That is what's happening, but I don't believe--"

2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,3078.143,3091.763,"--We know that the -- as soon as they stopped doing it, this created a substantial increase in the number of African-Americans on the juries, and I think that that's--"
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3091.763,3092.434,At the county level?
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,3092.434,3093.557,--At the county level.
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3093.557,3093.807,Yes.
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,3099.928,3100.646,Yes.
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3100.646,3101.992,Where is that in the record?
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,3101.992,3102.273,Okay.
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3139.821,3140.211,Help me--
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,3140.211,3142.601,"--not a problem, but it happens every month."
2009.08-1402,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3142.601,3144.083,--Help me -- help me with the math.

2009.08-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3177.743,3186.849,"Can we go back to your point about -- that there was a big change when the draw came from the circuit first, before the districts."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,3199.312,3218.053,"--But it's a step in the right direction, and what we want to do is we want to promote more minority participation on jurors -- juries, instead of creating a rule that tells court administrators all over the country, the heat's off, you don't have to do anything."
2009.08-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3218.053,3219.819,But a step -- a step in the right direction is not enough.
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,3240.233,3259.551,"Well, one element of the entire system might be insignificant, but you are talking about numerous elements that went together, and Duren says they have to show what caused the underrepresentation."
2009.08-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3259.551,3267.206,I still don't -- I don't understand this problem of -- of you have to show that they took back more than they contributed.

2009.08-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3320.154,3320.856,Exactly.
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,3320.856,3324.136,--and the circuit is acquired from all the districts of the county.
2009.08-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3324.136,3324.417,Exactly.

2009.08-1402,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3359.434,3360.167,Isn't that the case--
2009.08-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3360.167,3360.966,So what if--
2009.08-1402,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3360.966,3379.396,"--If -- if Grand -- if Grand Rapids uses a disproportionate number of jurors in its district courts, then you are going to have this problem -- the only way to fix the problem would be to have a separate jury system for the district courts."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,3406.618,3414.023,I think that we should allow a great deal of flexibility to local court administrators.
2009.08-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3427.36,3427.828,--All right.
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,3428.249,3437.135,--can do to -- to get an appropriate representation of minorities without using racial classifications.
2009.08-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3437.135,3438.263,That was a question of what was permitted.
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,3458.88,3462.128,"Well, I admit that it is a different setting."
2009.08-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3477.932,3482.884,"--What about the -- the more I listen, the more I think you think there are a lot of things people could do."
2009.08-1402,1,31604,james_sterling_lawrence,,3520.261,3533.286,"Well, you are certainly correct, and I would simply say that the people of Grand Rapids looked up at the juries; 98 percent of the time they saw nothing but white faces."
