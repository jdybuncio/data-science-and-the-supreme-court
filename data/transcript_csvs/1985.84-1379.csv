1985.84-1379,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,94.572,"Mr. Horan, I think you may proceed when you're ready."
1985.84-1379,0,20968,dennis_j_horan,,94.572,98.606,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.84-1379,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,223.077,227.549,"Mr. Horan, again a matter of curiosity."
1985.84-1379,0,20968,dennis_j_horan,,233.853,238.297,"Pardon me, Judge?"
1985.84-1379,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,238.297,242.259,One of your original plaintiffs was named Campbell.
1985.84-1379,0,20968,dennis_j_horan,,242.259,242.81,Campbell.
1985.84-1379,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,247.962,252.136,But you don't even name him here as an Appellant.
1985.84-1379,0,20968,dennis_j_horan,,252.136,252.847,Yes.
1985.84-1379,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,270.157,271.787,Are you representing him?
1985.84-1379,0,20968,dennis_j_horan,,271.787,272.508,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1379,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,272.508,281.124,Was he on the notice of appeal?
1985.84-1379,0,20968,dennis_j_horan,,281.124,281.544,"I'd have to check the notice of appeal, Your Honor."
1985.84-1379,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,282.095,285.278,"Well, my whole point is, how can he be here if he's not on the notice of appeal?"
1985.84-1379,0,20968,dennis_j_horan,,285.278,292.251,"If he's not on the notice of appeal, then he is not a party before this court."
1985.84-1379,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,292.251,294.344,"Well, how can he be before this Court?"
1985.84-1379,0,20968,dennis_j_horan,,294.344,295.593,"I corrected, Your Honor."
1985.84-1379,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,300.018,303.05,"Well, how can you... he is not a party before this Court?"
1985.84-1379,0,20968,dennis_j_horan,,303.05,304.169,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1379,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,304.169,304.99,Thank you.
1985.84-1379,0,20968,dennis_j_horan,,304.99,310.182,"The judgment, however, is joint and several against all three of the individuals that I represent."
1985.84-1379,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,310.182,313.695,Are you still representing him here?
1985.84-1379,0,20968,dennis_j_horan,,313.695,317.127,He is not a party before this Court.
1985.84-1379,1,38956,r_peter_carey,,1905.885,1926.932,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.84-1379,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.729,2043.219,"Well, Mr. Carey, what about our case of Singleton against Wulff, decided in 1976, where a majority of the Court held that doctors could raise not only their own rights, but the rights of their patients?"
1985.84-1379,1,38956,r_peter_carey,,2043.219,2044.03,Yes.
1985.84-1379,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.595,2075.229,"Yes, but doesn't he alleged similar financial interests to those of the doctors in Singleton?"
1985.84-1379,1,38956,r_peter_carey,,2075.229,2083.665,The financial interests that are alleged by Dr. Diamond are extremely attenuated.
1985.84-1379,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2131.346,2146.106,"May I ask, on the standing question, how can you consistently take the position here that there's no... you really don't have an adversary, and yet if what your opponent told us is correct, you asked for $100,000 from him in the district court on the ground that he was your adversary?"
1985.84-1379,1,38956,r_peter_carey,,2147.698,2151.338,--I might say I'd like to know how he can have it both ways.
1985.84-1379,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2185.552,2194.919,"Well, would you not agree that as a normal proposition, if he has no standing to litigate, which I understand to be your position, you certainly shouldn't have standing to get fees from him?"
1985.84-1379,1,38956,r_peter_carey,,2194.919,2197.5,"No, I think that's not quite right."
1985.84-1379,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2209.338,2215.202,"You're going to get... presumably, if you win you get some kind of an injunction against the State of Illinois enforcing the statute."
1985.84-1379,1,38956,r_peter_carey,,2217.092,2222.815,"No, I'm not, and in fact that's exactly the argument they are making to the district court at this very time."
1985.84-1379,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2254.118,2255.647,May I inquire.
1985.84-1379,1,38956,r_peter_carey,,2266.523,2267.354,"--No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1379,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2273.098,2273.909,I see.
1985.84-1379,1,38956,r_peter_carey,,2273.909,2275.529,And the State is not before this Court.
1985.84-1379,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2410.58,2419.196,"Mr. Carey, your opponent says that the statute doesn't define either Stilbestrol or IUD as one of these devices."
1985.84-1379,1,38956,r_peter_carey,,2419.196,2427.409,"He is correct in the sense that the statute does not say, when we use IUD's and DES."
1985.84-1379,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.592,2448.985,Is there a finding to that effect?
1985.84-1379,1,38956,r_peter_carey,,2448.985,2459.972,"I believe that the district court did find that, yes, and that the Seventh Circuit agreed with that."
1985.84-1379,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3067.417,3070.493,"Thank you, gentlemen."
