1991.90-1599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"We'll hear argument next in 90-1599, United States v. Frank Dennis Felix."
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,11.422,14.558,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1991.90-1599,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,194.458,198.912,But intent was an essential element of that offense for which he was being prosecuted--
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,198.912,199.312,That's correct.
1991.90-1599,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,199.312,200.595,--And this was shown to prove the intent.
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,200.595,204.016,This was one of the pieces of evidence that was introduced to prove the intent.
1991.90-1599,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,327.978,346.872,"Under a strict application of Grady would the case have been... would the prosecution have been invalid if in the indictment, in the charging papers for the Missouri attempt, they had alleged the Beggs operation?"
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,346.872,347.239,No.
1991.90-1599,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,377.843,388.766,"Well, suppose in the attempted prosecution they had treated the Beggs operation as the exclusive evidence of the intent... it's a little bit hard to work with the hypothetical for a point."
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,388.766,389.468,I understand.
1991.90-1599,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,389.468,390.968,Would that have made a difference?
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,393.253,410.882,"It is an element, but even if the Beggs evidence had been the only evidence that had been available to the prosecution to prove the intent in the Missouri case... it's a little hard to imagine that, because the intent could be inferred from the activities themselves, almost certainly."
1991.90-1599,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,426.224,427.593,"Well, but you're proving intent."
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,427.593,428.059,--You are.
1991.90-1599,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,428.059,443.519,"And the way Grady reads, as I understand it, it takes elements of the crime in a not a very academic or formalistic way, and intent is really more of an element than... I really think than what we are dealing with in Grady."
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,443.519,455.411,"Well, you are definitely proving intent, but what's important is you are not... you're not in effect reprosecuting him for something for which he has been prosecuted before."
1991.90-1599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,462.064,462.497,Mr. Bryson--
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,466.801,467.268,That's right.
1991.90-1599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,467.268,472.288,"The two crimes involved in Grady against Corbin were not of that nature, were they?"
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,472.288,472.738,No.
1991.90-1599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,472.738,475.824,So that Grady against Corbin's holding does not apply to this situation.
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,475.824,478.026,"No, we think the holding does not apply."
1991.90-1599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,481.478,484.013,"I take it that's dicta, then, if it's not the holding."
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,484.013,484.73,--It's not the holding.
1991.90-1599,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,485.396,487.465,"Well, the Court thought it was the holding, Mr. Bryson, didn't it?"
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,489.065,503.824,"There was a dissent by Judge Anderson, and we believe that Judge Anderson's analysis of Grady against Corbin is very insightful and we think that his analysis is the correct approach to the application of Grady in this case."
1991.90-1599,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.824,508.378,"Mr. Bryson, here's what Grady thought it was holding, anyway."
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,536.981,539.115,"I don't think, Your Honor, that it does squarely fit this case."
1991.90-1599,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.561,561.53,"That's what the dissent in the case said, and the majority did not deny that it was doing it."
1991.90-1599,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,561.53,562.846,"--Well, I think that the majority did--"
1991.90-1599,1,40953,scott_m_anderson,,1644.665,1648.802,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1657.158,1658.775,Why... what--
1991.90-1599,1,40953,scott_m_anderson,,1658.775,1666.781,"What I meant to say by that, Your Honor, or Mr. Chief Justice, is that the law of double jeopardy has changed slowly, and in recognition to some--"
1991.90-1599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1666.781,1670.733,"--It changed rather dramatically in Grady against Corbin, didn't it?"
1991.90-1599,1,40953,scott_m_anderson,,1670.733,1672.002,--It did.
1991.90-1599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1672.002,1678.921,You think that that's an example of the Court being reluctant to change the constitutional law relating to the protection of defendants?
1991.90-1599,1,40953,scott_m_anderson,,1678.921,1679.272,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1727.754,1742.348,"Would you agree with the Solicitor General when he says that for a hundred years, being considerably longer than 15 years, the... we have distinguished between substantive offenses and conspiracies... we regard them as separate?"
1991.90-1599,1,40953,scott_m_anderson,,1742.348,1749.768,"I would, Your Honor, except that not... that is not so in the case of successive prosecutions."
1991.90-1599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1809.99,1814.527,You feel that responds to the question about what the cases of this Court held for a hundred years?
1991.90-1599,1,40953,scott_m_anderson,,1814.527,1815.344,"--Yes, sir, I do."
1991.90-1599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1815.344,1818.412,"You... well, why... I mean, I would not--"
1991.90-1599,1,40953,scott_m_anderson,,1818.412,1830.47,I have no quarrel with the Attorney General and the Solicitor's opinion that the cases in this Court authorize in the case of a single trial the conviction for both an attempt and a conspiracy.
1991.90-1599,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2089.656,2110.737,"--Well, Mr. Anderson, in the Missouri indictment I guess the defendant was charged with attempting to manufacture the drug during some dates in August--"
1991.90-1599,1,40953,scott_m_anderson,,2110.737,2111.422,--That's correct.
1991.90-1599,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2111.422,2128.698,--And the prosecutor used similar acts evidence to help prove intent based on what occurred earlier in Missouri at a different period in time.
1991.90-1599,1,40953,scott_m_anderson,,2129.55,2130.45,"No, ma'am."
1991.90-1599,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3234.047,3235.614,"I have nothing further, Your Honor."
1991.90-1599,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3235.614,3236.047,Very well.
