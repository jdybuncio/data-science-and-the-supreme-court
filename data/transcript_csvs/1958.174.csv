1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,35.871,43.633,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please."
1958.174,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,346.639,347.921,Where is that?
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,347.921,357.787,"Page 22 of the record, Mr. Justice Black."
1958.174,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,585.046,588.943,(Inaudible)
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,588.943,592.676,"These -- these are statutory provisions, Your Honor."
1958.174,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,592.676,593.401,(Inaudible)
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,593.401,602.456,"I'd say under the statute, under -- for example, the Income Tax Law under the 20 -- under the Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 106."
1958.174,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,607.015,609.458,(Inaudible)
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,609.458,622.119,"No, the Fair Labor Standards Act doesn't contain the provision, but it has been interpreted that these are not the standard wages, the -- the administrator has -- has so interpreted it."
1958.174,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,645.613,659.28,(Inaudible)
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,659.28,662.897,"Yes, I think that is so, but on this --"
1958.174,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,662.897,665.783,(Inaudible)
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,665.783,667.384,That is -- that is right.
1958.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,668.253,676.936,"I suppose, Mr. Davis, bargaining on something like this would be mandatory under the obligation of the --"
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,676.936,677.061,"Yes, its is --"
1958.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,677.061,677.593,-- National Labor Relations.
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,677.593,679.579,-- it is clear that it would be mandatory.
1958.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,730.484,745.452,"Well, would there be any relevance in our consideration on how they answer this question that sometimes, perhaps even in this case, provisions of this kind compromise wage demands."
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,745.452,747.116,"Well, yes."
1958.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,771.155,785.503,"No, what I had in mind was and I write sometimes to be the demand of X cents per hour increase which is resolved by an agreemen to this kind in lieu of a cents per hour increase?"
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,785.503,786.306,That's right.
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,814.261,821.096,"Would you say that abolishing the act, has been interpreted or specifically deals with these problems?"
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,821.096,822.184,"No, it's been interpreted, Your Honor."
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,822.184,823.096,Interpreted.
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,827.553,828.672,That's right.
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,828.672,828.697,And in both -- and --
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,828.697,831.475,"And the Fair Labor Standards Act is by regulation, I think in --"
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,831.475,834.01,"Yes, was by regulation."
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,837.892,838.081,Yes.
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,840.031,854.563,And both interpretations are as it weren't -- both interpretations implicitly are not taking what might be called the literal or latitude (Inaudible) view.
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,854.563,855.324,That -- well --
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,855.324,857.723,"That is correct, isn't it?"
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,862.841,864.523,It would make larger -- higher wages.
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,864.523,865.41,It would make higher wages.
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,865.421,866.883,And more over time or higher percentage --
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,866.883,867.968,That's what I'm saying.
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,867.968,868.693,That's right.
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,868.74,874.775,So that so far as any general talk about things should be construed infavorably.
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,877.886,879.72,That is right.
1958.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,933.635,952.578,"But tell me though, Mr. Davis, if this debt isn't paid through the funds, I take it that it will have some effect perhaps more, but some effect, will it not, on the benefits payable or to the affected employee and are eligible to see those."
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,952.578,960.14,I think it -- I think we must assume that it will be a detriment to these -- to these employees if they will have less protection from the welfare fund.
1958.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,960.14,965.692,"So now, is there any concept of payments of this kind?"
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,968.792,969.4,"Well, there are --"
1958.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,969.4,969.891,(Voice Overlap) --
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,969.891,971.559,There are with pensions.
1958.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,978.41,980.462,"Well, what kind -- what -- what is the assignment?"
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,980.462,1004.958,"Well, it's actually -- welfare plans and this is pretty much the standard -- in some respects, the standard plan, is for group life insurance, sick benefits, hospitalization, surgery benefits, and sometimes insurance to pay them while they're out of work, while they're sick."
1958.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1016.96,1027.164,"And of course, the -- the beneficiaries of this plan included not only the -- the employees of the bankrupt but many, many other people, isn't that true?"
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1027.164,1027.678,That is true.
1958.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1045.486,1045.762,But --
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1045.762,1061.341,"It was -- it was -- there were -- the -- the employees of the Bellevue Stratford and -- and book binders, had just as much interest in these payments by the Embassy Restaurant, as the pastry cook and the onion peeler in -- in the --"
1958.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1061.341,1061.46,In the Embassy.
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1061.46,1062.963,-- in the Embassy Restaurant itself.
1958.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1062.963,1072.371,"So to that extent, too, you -- could you not distinguish this from the policy behind giving a priority to wage payments."
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1076.025,1076.494,That's right.
1958.174,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1084.041,1087.222,The -- the employees of the union.
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1087.222,1089.223,"Well, the union, too, are included in this."
1958.174,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1094.998,1095.645,I'm just asking.
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1095.985,1097.787,"They are included, yes."
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1122.52,1129.939,"Mr. Davis, may I ask you, perhaps two general questions?"
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1162.286,1163.978,That's right.
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1163.978,1180.232,"Then one can say, “Well, this ought to be what is called liberally construed,” and you bring forth other cognate statutes, which in practice could have been construed to include this (Inaudible), but that's on the other side."
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1209.056,1209.355,Well --
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1209.355,1212.151,"If you tell me that, I know how to answer your problem."
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1212.151,1218.727,"Well, I -- I think that -- I think that two ways that we have to approach the -- this interpretation."
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1245.772,1249.037,"On the other hand, other consideration of Justice Brennan."
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1249.037,1249.478,That's right.
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1251.111,1254.131,"(Voice Overlap) wages, that's the form of wages."
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1254.131,1258.868,We say that they're bargained for and they take the place of wages and that way is on the other side.
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1389.98,1391.708,So that even if --
1958.174,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1391.708,1407.889,"I'm just going to say that that indicates that -- that Congres is less favorable to these plans or -- or on the other hand, they just wants to see that the -- that the plans serves the purposes designed for and what's that regulation on."
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1407.889,1409.612,"Well, I think that's -- I think that's right."
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1444.546,1447.043,Are you suggesting that we might make a distinction?
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1453.811,1454.003,No.
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1518.4,1526.781,"And those are the considerations, I was wondering if you would illumin that -- that Judge Hallanan set forth in his opinion in the District Court."
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1536.437,1537.556,That's -- that's right.
1958.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1551.597,1552.733,That's an impossible way --
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1552.733,1554.079,It's a difficult one.
1958.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1596.967,1631.375,"Well, Mr. Davis, do you suppose if this came within -- in this instance, wages that to those plans that some employers have usually not for workers who are members of labor organizations but for executive and other personnel under which the employer voluntarily supports programs of this kind , would they also have to come within the sweep of wages for the -- in the event the employer then would think (Voice Overlap) --"
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1631.375,1644.408,"I would think they would be even closer -- even more closely wages than this, Your Honor, because they would be cases where at least the benefits would be going specifically to employees of this -- of this employer."
1958.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1644.408,1657.548,"And not -- there, and those instances of course is -- is not -- nothing that in that type of employer ordinarily that involves the National Labor Relations Act to -- in the other statues (Voice Overlap) --"
1958.174,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1657.548,1659.641,I think that's right.
1958.174,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1663.729,1667.006,Mr. Markowitz.
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,1667.006,1669.681,May it please the Court.
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1770.425,1772.382,What if -- may I ask you this point?
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,1783.574,1785.78,"No, sir."
1958.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1915.796,1919.961,We can agree that it's a part of their compensation.
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,1929.014,1930.701,"Statute uses the term wages, sir."
1958.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1935.991,1937.889,"Well tell me, Mr. Markowitz."
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,1971.978,1973.198,"Yes, sir."
1958.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2066.435,2067.103,I beg your pardon.
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2067.103,2067.563,Excuse me.
1958.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2067.563,2068.036,I think it's --
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2068.036,2076.686,The employees have given up their right to receive sick leave directly in return for the employer contribution to the welfare fund.
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2076.686,2082.051,"And you (Inaudible) would be logical, can be logical in the sense that abrstractly logical."
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2090.053,2090.309,"Yes, sir."
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2090.309,2094.623,"Now, can you translate the value of those extra holidays in dollars and cents --"
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2094.623,2094.672,"Yes, sir."
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2094.672,2095.585,-- they just want to be?
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2095.585,2096.272,"Yes, sir, directly."
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2096.272,2096.35,Can you?
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2096.35,2100.059,And it's done consistently by employers in collective bargaining.
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2100.059,2109.512,"I -- I mean, but -- if it is done if they figure it out, but they say, “We just want Columbus day and Kosciusko day and so on.”"
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2111.811,2112.283,"Yes, sir."
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2124.722,2128.727,"Yes, if he -- if he assured it is to be paid."
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2137.57,2139.523,Well they have a right to ask that just as they ask for more vacation.
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2139.523,2144.507,"Yes, but would it then translate the value of that holiday for which the employer doesn't pay?"
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2144.507,2148.041,"The employer does pay, sir because it's a paid holiday."
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2149.652,2150.962,"I mean, and --"
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2150.962,2150.996,-- the employer pays.
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2150.996,2153.504,I knew some holidays that are not paid.
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2153.504,2153.666,"Well, I don't --"
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2153.666,2154.227,They were --
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2154.227,2155.961,-- I don't know of any such holidays -- [Laughs]
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2155.961,2156.648,Do they want --
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2156.648,2158.189,"-- that are not paid, sir in collective bargaining."
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2158.189,2160.761,They want -- they want to be free on certain days.
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2163.617,2165.774,While you -- that that maybe where the sick leave.
1958.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2174.42,2180.067,"No, what I'm talking about -- taking an equivalent example would be shorter working hours, wouldn't it be?"
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2180.067,2180.924,"Yes, sir."
1958.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2183.992,2187.013,"Which you might make through the necessity of more employees, doesn't it?"
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2187.013,2187.47,Yes.
1958.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2187.47,2187.863,For example the --
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2187.863,2189.273,Yes.
1958.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2189.273,2200.538,"I don't know anything about except from what I read from papers but the airplane pilots want a maximum of 75 hours a month instead of 85, which would mean that perhaps hiring more pilots."
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2205.916,2206.976,"Oh, yes."
1958.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2206.976,2211.077,"-- be measurable from the point of view of the -- it wouldn't be wages to the employee, would it?"
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2211.077,2211.76,"Well, decreased working hours --"
1958.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2211.76,2213.124,That increases.
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2213.124,2221.519,"-- can't be compensated except in the increase in the hourly rate to the employer for the time which is worth, assuming the same take home pay is involved."
1958.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2221.519,2224.096,That's Mr. Justice Frankfurter's example really in -- on paid holidays --
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2224.096,2225.091,"Well, there's no -- there's no --"
1958.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2225.091,2226.3,"-- in short, of working hours."
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2226.3,2234.04,"Well, there's no compensation I suppose that can be given for a holiday which is not paid for."
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2237.936,2239.581,But there's benefit involved?
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2239.581,2242.599,"Well, I don't know that there's benefit sir if there's no pay."
1958.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2242.599,2243.505,Why would this --
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2243.505,2244.172,But --
1958.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2244.172,2263.073,"I think there are a number of employers who provide recreational facilities in camps, in that sort of thing for their employees that the employees use without cost to themselves but the expense of the employer."
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2283.794,2284.797,"I don't think so, sir."
1958.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2290.474,2290.674,"Well, I -- I'm thinking -- thinking that the --"
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2290.674,2294.488,They're not -- they're not -- they don't arise out of the employer-employee relationships.
1958.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2294.488,2294.693,"Well, I'm suggesting they do."
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2294.693,2297.137,There's no relation to compensation for services rendered.
1958.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2297.137,2298.416,I'm suggesting they do.
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2306.646,2307.926,For the men themselves.
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2307.926,2308.365,"Well, yes."
1958.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2334.914,2336.851,Suppose he gets so much?
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2336.851,2338.78,"Well, that's a form of compensation, certainly."
1958.174,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2343.901,2345.553,But he was the caterer.
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2350.075,2361.383,"The -- if the employee, he also cater -- I suspect not, because that's not -- that's not part of the compensation of the employee."
1958.174,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2364.891,2365.135,You think [Laughs]
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2365.135,2367.214,Now (Inaudible) --
1958.174,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2367.214,2371.139,-- they included on the compensation (Inaudible)
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2371.139,2379.231,"Well, I just -- there's no question but that compensation may achieve many forms and can perhaps be expanded."
1958.174,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2491.123,2500.3,"I suggest, it merely showed the Congress in the great enactments have addressed itself directly to that question, and you're trying to prove it here argumentatively."
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2500.3,2522.77,"Well, by analogy perhaps except in the recent welfare fund and Pension Fund Disclosure Act which was passed and approved last August, the legislative history of that statute shows without a doubt that Congress recognized that welfare fund contributions are part of the compensation to employees that they are part of the wages which employees earned."
1958.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2679.106,2694.293,"Suppose the (Inaudible) but there's no indication, is there, in this record as to how many beneficiaries they were of this welfare fund and how many employees of this bankcrupt if there are?"
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2694.293,2697.834,"I don't -- I don't think the record gives any indication, sir, of that fact."
1958.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2705.123,2707.402,"But there are many, many restaurants in Philadelphia."
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2707.402,2709.211,Pardon?
1958.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2709.211,2710.602,There are good many of those in Philadelphia.
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2710.602,2712.269,"Yes, sir, there are."
1958.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2712.269,2725.766,"And -- so presumably, the -- the benefit accruing to the former employees of this bankrupt corporaton would be diluted by maybe one to ten or (Voice Overlap) --"
1958.174,1,39978,richard_h_markowitz,,2725.766,2737.717,Well there's no question about it because the eligibility rules of the welfare fund may -- may make the determination in the receipt of benefits dependent upon the receipt of contributions for so many hours of employment.
1958.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2796.768,2803.818,Mr. Davis.
1958.174,2,30073,john_f_davis,,2803.818,2807.099,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may -- if the Court please."
1958.174,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2890.864,2900.907,"Well, this is the part (Inaudible) those things are paid whether or not the expense of supplying it."
1958.174,2,30073,john_f_davis,,2902.769,2903.249,That's right.
1958.174,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2903.249,2904.958,Into the locker then eat the meals?
1958.174,2,30073,john_f_davis,,2904.958,2905.758,That -- that is right.
1958.174,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2905.758,2907.012,4(Inaudible)
1958.174,2,30073,john_f_davis,,2907.012,2907.714,Yes of course.
1958.174,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2929.814,2930.9,"Well, I think --"
1958.174,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2930.9,2942.864,What do you say to the suggestion -- the sole argument is that wages must be read to equal compensation in the priority statute.
1958.174,2,30073,john_f_davis,,2952.027,2954.091,"Well, I don't think it has received that gloss."

1958.174,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3009.308,3010.592,"Very well, Mr. Davis."
