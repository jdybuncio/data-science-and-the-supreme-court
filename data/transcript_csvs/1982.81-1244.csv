1982.81-1244,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.634,We will hear arguments next in Hensley against Eckerhart.
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,95.944,97.146,Thank you.
1982.81-1244,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,239.979,247.568,Would that cover frivolous claims made if they showed they spent the time on them?
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,247.568,249.444,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,274.104,277.559,Would you give me an example of those you regarded as frivolous?
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,277.559,279.369,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,307.842,310.124,Any other claims besides that one?
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,310.124,320.758,"I think with respect to the mail policy, the fact that the mail policy of the forensic unit was amended in 1977... That was during the duration of the lawsuit."
1982.81-1244,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,334.52,342.455,"I take it you are conceding at this point, however, that frivolity had not been attained up to trial."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,342.455,348.888,"--Well, with respect to a couple of those issues, I think they become frivolous by the time the trial occurred."
1982.81-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,350.386,353.261,They must have known what their experts were going to testify to.
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,353.261,354.309,--That is my position.
1982.81-1244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.993,363.192,How about the dismissal of Count 2 of the original complaint?
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,380.624,386.825,The district court accepted a voluntary dismissal after a substantial number of hours had been spent by both sides.
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,430.9,431.761,"Excuse me, counsel."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,448.877,450.409,--I think because--
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,450.409,451.973,Wouldn't he have to?
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,451.973,453.127,--I think he should.
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,454.847,455.58,That's what I thought.
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,457.702,459.718,--I don't think so.
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,459.718,463.672,Suppose while he's working on Point 2 he finds an answer to Point 3?
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,463.672,467.528,"That will often occur, and I think--"
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,467.528,469.338,And you have to keep books on that.
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,472.386,478.992,"--I have not seen any books like that in the Eighth Circuit, because he's going to get compensated no matter what he spent his time on."
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,478.992,490.785,"My question was, have you seen any books that lawyers keep that they are working on Point 1 of Section C of Point 3 in the brief?"
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,490.785,499.687,I think they should be required as a general matter to indicate what specific area of their lawsuit time is being expended on as they keep their records.
1982.81-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,514.758,521.457,"But the district judge did find... I don't know just what he did, but he said,"
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,544.715,558.039,"I think he looked pretty closely to the records, Your Honor, but it was in the context of his attempting to follow a previous Eighth Circuit precedent which he believed foreclosed him from reducing the fee because of unsuccessful claims."
1982.81-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,561.334,563.814,Does he say that he didn't think he had the authority to reduce it?
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,577.592,597.147,"Well, I think when he addressed that issue he cited directly language from opinions out of the Eighth Circuit, and somewhat dissimilar cases, but the language clearly indicated a position of the Eighth Circuit that all hours were to be compensated, and I believe that the opinion read as a whole indicates that he was following that precedent."
1982.81-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,597.147,609.298,"I have read its, and I just didn't get that out of it, to be honest with you, that he was under the impression the Eighth Circuit required compensation for all hours regardless of how useless the lawyer's time might have been."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,611.735,614.874,"I think it's a fair reading in this regard, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,653.047,661.606,Is there any... What is the Eighth Circuit precedent that most clearly states what you say their view of the law is on this?
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,661.606,672.24,"The most clear Eighth Circuit precedent is Brown versus Bathke, which involves what I think creates a distinction which should be made."
1982.81-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,688.33,688.673,Right.
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,693.902,694.514,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.514,696.09,"Yes, he does, I see, on Page A-11."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,696.09,715.801,"Again with respect to the issues which were litigated in the case, pursuant to local rules, counsel on the morning the trial of this case began agreed there were 24 issues, substantial claims which remained to be litigated in the case."
1982.81-1244,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,723.346,724.984,Mr. Boicourt--
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,724.984,725.874,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,725.874,738.84,"--should we really look, though, at the ultimate relief sought in the broad terms of the complaint, or at a pretrial order list of issues in seeing if the attorneys' fees allowed were reasonable?"
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,738.84,748.554,"What I was attempting to do, Your Honor, is demonstrate... I think on the face of the opinion of the court on the merits, the district court, it is clear that there were some substantial failures."
1982.81-1244,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,909.251,930.571,"Do you think that the statute prohibits giving attorneys' fees for the so-called catalytic results if the lawsuit is filed and relates to several claims, and before it comes to trial the defendants change the practice, and it isn't necessary to go to trial on it?"
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,936.21,938.179,"--Yes, I believe they can, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1038.575,1046.292,Is there anything in this judge's opinion that said he paid him for working on frivolous matters?
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1046.292,1049.712,"--No, there is nothing in the decision of the judge that says that."
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1049.712,1051.495,"Well, where do you get your basis for your argument?"
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1051.495,1058.787,I suggest to the Court that there were some issues that at the time of trial had become frivolous.
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1078.608,1081.278,Did the judge say he paid them for the lost ones?
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1081.278,1082.09,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1088.571,1093.024,"My question was, did the judge say, I am paying you for the lost ones?"
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1093.024,1093.929,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1097.504,1113.091,Can anyone looking at the record of the time identify accurately the items for which you say no fee should be allowed?
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1113.091,1124.415,"I think in this particular case because time records were not kept which were in any way related to various claims of the course of the lawsuit, it would be difficult for anyone to do that except the trial judge."
1982.81-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.628,1143.051,Has the issue come up in other circuits?
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1143.051,1145.001,"--Yes, Your Honor, there has."
1982.81-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.858,1150.295,What have other circuits said?
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1150.295,1152.842,"Well, that's interesting."
1982.81-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1181.095,1189.436,"So there are express examples of courts paring down, sorting the case out as between what is won and what has been lost."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1189.436,1190.246,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.164,1215.706,So that if there has been part won and part lost and the district court doesn't go through that process in the circuits that agree with you they set it aside and tell him to do it.
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1215.706,1216.818,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1218.253,1227.296,"I understand you to say you are not limiting this to frivolous claims, that your emphasis is on successful claims."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1227.296,1227.764,Successful--
1982.81-1244,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1227.764,1229.016,The claims on which relief was granted.
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1229.016,1230.295,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1248.225,1263.436,"What would you say the position is that if somebody claims they denied their civil rights, and they bring a lawsuit, and the other side gives in immediately?"
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1266.202,1267.75,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1267.75,1269.279,Completely so?
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1269.279,1274.417,"If he gives up completely with respect to all claims, yes."
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1274.417,1278.601,"Well, then, if he goes to trial, then you have to prorate it."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1283.024,1284.599,If the--
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1284.599,1292.535,"Because I am warning you, my next question is, if you give up halfway through, will you split it in half?"
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1292.535,1309.123,"--Any time remedial action, whether ordered by the court or voluntary on behalf of defendant is the direct result of the lawsuit, the hours expended in establishing that relief should be compensated."
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1310.277,1313.4,"Well, how do you know it is brought on by the lawsuit or not?"
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1313.4,1316.352,"Well, that is--"
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1316.352,1322.382,I have seen cases settled on the day of trial that have been in preparation for six years.
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1331.737,1338.143,"--Yes, if the preparation was reasonably related to the matter of their successes, I would allow the compensation."
1982.81-1244,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1338.143,1339.734,But you wouldn't after trial.
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1339.734,1341.953,"Not if they lost, no."
1982.81-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1352.229,1356.041,"May I ask you, I have got the Brown opinion in front of me."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1371.94,1372.829,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1372.829,1373.754,And you don't question that.
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1391.168,1394.011,"Yes, as it is implied for a multiple claim case."
1982.81-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1395.945,1405.3,"Even though it was a reasonable... the reasonable work of a lawyer who was conscientiously trying to represent his client, for which he would normally be paid by a private client."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1407.8,1409.722,--That is correct in the multiple claim case.
1982.81-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1411.785,1416.11,"Well, the test is reasonably calculated to advance a client's interests."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1416.11,1420.891,"And again, that case involves the alternative legal theory situation."
1982.81-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1436.04,1441.351,"Well, but the court says it should not be denied solely because that claim did not provide the precise basis for the relief granted."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1450.051,1462.998,That would not be the case only if the plaintiff could demonstrate his burden of proof that the time spent was reasonably related to securing the actual relief awarded.
1982.81-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1462.998,1466.496,"Well, I'm not sure you've answered my question."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1477.071,1479.617,"In the multiple claim situation, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1707.989,1722.81,"Well, I take it your position is that the trial judge has no discretion to pay... to award fees on a single issue claim that could have been a separate lawsuit on which there is a loss."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1722.81,1726.979,--I think it would be an abuse of discretion for him to award a claim--
1982.81-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1726.979,1727.529,"Yes, so I have no discretion."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1727.529,1727.981,--Excuse me.
1982.81-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1727.981,1735.103,His discretion is just to award a reasonable fee on issues that... on which the plaintiff prevails.
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1735.103,1739.54,But that is where he can actually exercise his discretion to make that determination.
1982.81-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1739.54,1739.93,I understand.
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1750.489,1752.798,Unless he can show that the hours spent--
1982.81-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.798,1753.437,Yes.
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1753.437,1756.907,--were reasonably related to the actual relief ultimately granted--
1982.81-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1756.907,1766.559,"That is impossible in the examples you gave us, these single-issue claims, these claims that could have been single-issue lawsuits."
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1766.559,1775.446,"--I don't think it would be possible for them to claim, yes, that their proof or that their time expended on the mail policy had anything to do with whether or not there was sufficient privacy--"
1982.81-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1775.446,1780.649,So your position is that the judge had absolutely no discretion to award any fees with respect to that claim.
1982.81-1244,0,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1780.649,1782.318,--That is correct.
1982.81-1244,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1790.378,1804.746,"Mr. Eichner, let me see if I can clarify some of these things for myself with a hypothetical."
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,1846.823,1874.529,"The answer to that question, Mr. Chief Justice, depends on whether we are talking about a situation such as we had here, where there was one overall broad claim, that is, a constitutional right to treatment, and the specific aspects under that broad claim, and those subparts being related to each other in part and parcel of the same claim, or were they perhaps three totally separate claims which didn't necessarily relate to each other."
1982.81-1244,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1874.529,1882.199,"Well, let's assume at least, whether they are totally separate or not, that they are readily identifiable, or not readily, but reasonably identifiable."
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,1882.199,1889.963,"Well, I... I have to repeat that it comes back to what extent those claims relate to each other or not."
1982.81-1244,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1904.52,1916.046,"Let's help it out by saying the complaint has Count 1, Count 2, Count 3, and that their interrelationship is limited to the fact that they involve the same people and the same institutions."
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,1916.046,1925.214,"--Well, again, it is going to be a factual determination by the district court to what extent do those varying claims relate to each other."
1982.81-1244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1925.214,1932.179,"How about Count 2 of the original complaint, the involuntary servitude count?"
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,1942.174,1948.471,"That was... I believe you are referring to Count 3, which was the uncompensated labor, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1948.471,1954.122,"It says... at least where I am looking at the Joint Appendix on Page 4, it says Count 2."
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,1955.513,1962.181,"In any case, the uncompensated labor claim was a separate claim."
1982.81-1244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2006.009,2011.21,"--But here you received some compensation for work on Count 2, did you not?"
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2032.623,2033.371,That is correct.
1982.81-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2033.371,2036.62,Maybe that's where the confusion is on Counts 2 and 3.
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2036.62,2045.694,"Well, the specific answer to Justice Rehnquist's question is yes, there was time on the uncompensated labor claim which was after 1975."
1982.81-1244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2057.973,2070.795,"But if you agree that was severable, and you took a voluntary dismissal of it, how under your own theory of how the fee statute should be administered were you entitled to be paid for that particular item of work?"
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2070.795,2076.558,Because it is an incorrect understanding that we were wholly unsuccessful on that.
1982.81-1244,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2104.343,2104.764,Counsel?
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2104.764,2105.204,Yes.
1982.81-1244,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2105.204,2108.889,I will put an easy question to you that may clarify your position.
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2131.097,2153.745,"I don't wish to or intend to duck the question, but quite honestly, I am unfamiliar enough with prison litigation to know which... how much those... the preparation, trying, and litigating of those claims would necessarily relate to each other, and I... I would have to come back to, that's the real issue, how much do those two interrelate."
1982.81-1244,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2170.443,2173.114,Have you read our opinion on Romeo last term?
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2173.114,2175.613,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2175.613,2181.97,Do you think the lawyers in that case should win 100 percent on everything they claimed?
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2204.442,2205.803,Your Honor--
1982.81-1244,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2205.803,2207.847,--Do you want to answer that?
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2207.847,2209.302,--Yes and no.
1982.81-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.343,2292.31,"Do you think the court, the district court in this case went through this catechism that you just--"
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2292.31,2293.343,"Yes, Justice White."
1982.81-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2293.343,2296.17,--Where do you find that in its opinion?
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2296.17,2302.464,The district court began with an analysis of whether or not plaintiffs were a prevailing party within the meaning of the statute.
1982.81-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2302.464,2324.938,"Well, sure they did, and then I take it that they said as long as the party receives some of the relief requested, the status as a prevailing party will not be jeopardized, and then they just... and rejects the suggestion that he should put aside any of these claims."
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2328.548,2332.795,"Yes, implicitly, Your Honor, because--"
1982.81-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.795,2333.871,Implicitly?
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2335.949,2360.625,"--I would like to explain the answer to you, which is that in the portion of the fee decision where the district court examined the amount of the fee after finding the prevailing party issue, the district court said, defendants have argued for a mathematical mechanical approach, which fails to take into account the interrelatedness and interconnection of the various claims."
1982.81-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2361.3,2362.798,"--That may well be true, but--"
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2362.798,2363.484,--by--
1982.81-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2363.484,2368.186,--the court didn't go on and say that these are interrelated claims.
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2368.186,2382.245,"--By rejecting an approach which doesn't take into account the fact that the claims are interrelated and interdependent, I would submit that it is clear that the court was doing... was finding that they did interrelate and interconnect."
1982.81-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2575.898,2579.508,That is certainly a different test than you suggest to us.
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2579.508,2581.802,"I think it is the same test, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2591.581,2605.433,"Well, that isn't what... I thought you said you were only supposed to award fees for time spent on successful claims and on other claims that are interconnected or interrelated."
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2605.433,2608.572,--What I said is that--
1982.81-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2608.572,2618.429,That's quite a different test than awarding time spent that is reasonably calculated to advance a client's interests.
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2618.429,2630.564,"--Once somebody is found to be a prevailing party, they are entitled for all time reasonably expended, and that three-part explanation that I did in answer to your question was what goes into a finding of what time is reasonably expended."
1982.81-1244,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2630.564,2633.329,Counsel?
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2633.329,2634.218,Yes.
1982.81-1244,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2634.218,2646.447,"In this case, you requested an enhancement fee over and above the multiplication results that hourly rates would provide."
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2663.661,2667.049,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2667.689,2669.564,"Do you think it ought to go only up, but not down?"
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2669.564,2688.82,"--I believe the district court found that the reason for not awarding an enhancement factor was that the same factors and considerations as the Johnson factors which go to enhancement were already taken into account in the reasonable fees, so that there was no reason to repeat those same factors and award upwards."
1982.81-1244,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2688.82,2689.791,Suppose--
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2689.791,2694.349,"This case, I don't believe presents the issue of enhancement of fees."
1982.81-1244,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2694.349,2696.428,--You would never discount.
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2733.649,2739.692,The limit of the fee would be whatever hourly rate you were asking for for those number of hours.
1982.81-1244,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2739.692,2746.127,"Right, that would be $10,000 in this case, and you've won a victory that was probably worth millions of dollars, perhaps?"
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2746.127,2752.748,"Yes, because it relates to... the method of awarding fees relates to the number of hours, and I don't think--"
1982.81-1244,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2752.748,2755.341,You are saying results are of no importance.
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2755.341,2756.796,--The results are important.
1982.81-1244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2764.338,2769.508,"Well, Mr. Eichner, what was it you were awarded in this case, something like $130,000?"
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2769.508,2771.224,"$133,000, Your Honor."
1982.81-1244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2771.224,2794.937,"Well, what if, as Justice Powell has hypothesized, the defendant agreed to do, right after you had filed the complaint and the memorandum of authorities in opposition to a summary judgment, because the counsel for the state was so impressed by your arguments, he said, well, I'll give you A, B, C, and D, which turns out to be exactly what you ultimately got after years of litigation?"
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2804.994,2807.696,"Well, I come back to the same point."
1982.81-1244,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2894.69,2896.441,"Mr. Eichner, can I interrupt you with a question?"
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2913.639,2919.073,--I think the process is generally the same.
1982.81-1244,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2945.638,2950.434,But do you think that the award given in this case was more liberal than would have been appropriate in any other kind of litigation?
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2950.434,2953.309,"No, I don't believe that the award in this case was more liberal at all."
1982.81-1244,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2955.885,2961.758,I frankly don't see much difference between the Johnson factors and factors I run into in countless other situations.
1982.81-1244,1,41269,stanley_j_eichner,,2961.758,2980.484,"No, there is... there is a difference of views within the circuits between the so-called Johnson factors and the Loadstar analysis, and various courts have been critical of the Johnson factors because they find them not that precise and hard to work with, and they have gone to a Loadstar analysis."
1982.81-1244,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3386.895,3388.533,"Thank you, Mr. Eichner."
1982.81-1244,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3390.892,3393.719,I have a question that is tangential.
1982.81-1244,2,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,3410.478,3414.819,I'm not sure I really researched that subject.
1982.81-1244,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3417.318,3417.926,That's all right.
1982.81-1244,2,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,3420.879,3428.174,I want to briefly discuss the matter of legislative history which has been discussed by my opponent this morning.
1982.81-1244,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3546.517,3547.406,"Thank you, gentlemen."
