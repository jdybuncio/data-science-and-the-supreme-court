1959.58,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.322,"Number 58, Albert H. Grisham, Petitioner, versus Charles R. Hagan, Warden."
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,11.322,12.217,Mr. Chief Justice --
1959.58,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,12.217,13.477,Mr. Kalp.
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,13.477,16.117,-- may it please the Court.
1959.58,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,190.911,204.935,Is your jurisdictional question here any different at all from Reid versus Covert except in that case the defendant was -- the defendant in this case is civilian employee?
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,204.935,210.552,Our contention is that there is absolutely no other distinction factually.
1959.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,454.189,462.797,"Would you mind if it doesn't take more than a minute or two to explain the six-year delay, the six-year period?"
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,462.797,468.867,"Well, if the Court please, a good portion of that time of course --"
1959.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,468.867,471.634,We would -- we would -- (Voice overlap) when he was under the --
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,471.634,475.577,He was sentenced in March of 1953.
1959.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,478.49,480.099,Go on from there –
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,480.099,480.841,Pardon?
1959.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,480.841,481.258,Go on –
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,481.258,492.534,"Well, a good portion of the time was used up in exhausting his administrative remedies under Uniform Code of Military Justice, his appeal to the -- to higher authority and to the Court of military field and so on."
1959.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,492.534,497.126,"But, when was the -- when was the final approval of the sentence (Inaudible) was approved."
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,497.126,498.691,I can't tell you the exact data.
1959.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,613.718,620.222,The argument wasn't dependent likewise but it was in like dependents.
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,620.222,624.626,That's very true.
1959.58,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,855.682,862.196,"Excuse me, I understand you to say (Inaudible)"
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,862.196,864.132,"That's my understanding of the law, yes, Your Honor."
1959.58,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,864.132,868.757,Not (Inaudible)
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,868.757,890.77,"Well, of course the Article 2 (11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice purports to give that authority to if it's constitutionally does give that authority to the military in time of war and peace I assume, but that's the question at issue here as I understand it."
1959.58,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1091.897,1107.234,"Mr. Kalp, earlier in your argument, you seem to emphasize the -- the occupation of this -- the specific occupation of this man that he was an accountant and emphasized the fact that that was not a traditionally military occupation."
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,1117.283,1145.502,"I don't think any logical distinction of that kind could be drawn although if we are going to say that this is analogous to a due process case, as I understood Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Frankfurter in saying in the Covert opinion that the various factors had to be balanced as you would in the due process case and it might make a difference, yes, it seemed to me."
1959.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1145.502,1174.218,(Inaudible)
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,1174.218,1178.661,I can't answer that question Mr. Justice Frankfurter.
1959.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1183.608,1197.527,I asked this because (Inaudible)
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,1197.527,1198.779,That's correct and that's our contention --
1959.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1198.779,1199.218,I know.
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,1205.503,1211.482,There is one other thing I would like to say and that is to this order of the method of trial.
1959.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1310.303,1312.291,(Inaudible) are we questionable?
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,1312.291,1318.459,They are turning over our request and as I say reluctantly and with the specific provision that is not the constituted precedence.
1959.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1318.459,1327.96,As far as (Inaudible)
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,1327.96,1331.399,"Well, except in the field and in time of war."
1959.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1331.399,1333.992,(Inaudible)
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,1333.992,1335.512,Which is (Inaudible)
1959.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1335.512,1337.968,(Inaudible)
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,1337.968,1338.344,They're not.
1959.58,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1338.631,1340.37,(Inaudible)
1959.58,0,19343,charles_wolfe_kalp,,1340.37,1349.552,Of course it would be closer to military if he -- if he had killed an officer and an enlisted man who was actually in the -- in the military service.
1959.58,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1356.391,1358.005,Mr. Davis.
1959.58,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1358.005,1363.034,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.58,2,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,5173.887,5182.002,"If the Court please, Mr. Kalp has asked me to reply on behalf of the petitioner and I have entered my appearance (Inaudible)."
1959.58,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5193.486,5197.845,"We will finish, we will finish."
1959.58,2,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,5197.845,5200.16,Very well.
1959.58,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5669.092,5670.23,I'm just going to refresh my recollection.
1959.58,2,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,5670.23,5671.826,Yes.
