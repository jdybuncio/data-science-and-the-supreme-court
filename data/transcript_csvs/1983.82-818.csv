1983.82-818,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.227,"We will hear arguments next in National Labor Relations Board against Bildisco and Bildisco, and Local 408, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, against National Labor Relations Board."
1983.82-818,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,93.21,157.715,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the consolidated cases involving the same Chapter 11 debtor in possession, the Court of Appeals in this case prescribed a standard to be used by a bankruptcy court in determining whether to approve an application to reject a collective bargaining agreement as an executory contract, and how that approval of such rejection operates retroactively to deprive employees of rights under the contract during the entire post-bankruptcy petition period, and thus to deprive the National Labor Relations Board of authority to remedy as an unfair labor practice the debtor in possession's unilateral departure from the contractually prescribed terms and conditions of employment during the post-petition, pre-rejection period."
1983.82-818,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,252.521,267.015,"Mr. Wallace, is it so much a conflict between two statutes as a problem of executory contracts of a different character, one with a supplier, perhaps, and one with an employee?"
1983.82-818,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,270.653,301.3,"Well, the Labor Act does say that there cannot be midterm rejection or modification, termination or modification of a labor contract, of a collective bargaining agreement, unless both parties agree pursuant to prescribed procedures, and yet there is reason to think that the authority of the bankruptcy court to set aside executory contracts does extend to collective bargaining agreements."
1983.82-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,338.891,342.311,How did Congress indicate that awareness?
1983.82-818,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,342.311,351.685,"In legislative history of prior amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, but not in the legislative history of the code itself, but because the same Committees dealt with--"
1983.82-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,351.685,357.008,"Well, then, what is it you rely on to say that they implicitly ratified a court of appeals decision?"
1983.82-818,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,357.008,363.477,"--Well, just the general principle that Congress is presumed to be aware of how the law has developed, but--"
1983.82-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,363.477,365.1,"Now, wait a minute, Mr. Wallace."
1983.82-818,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,377.391,400.757,"--Well, we relied basically on the Lorillard case, which refers to that principle, but our main argument is that in any event, the Second Circuit's resolution is the proper one, regardless of whether it can be said that Congress implicitly ratified it, and under that standard--"
1983.82-818,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,400.757,410.708,"We really have three separate standards expressed by the courts of appeals, don't we, this one, the Nigra case, and the Eleventh, and--"
1983.82-818,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,410.708,411.145,--Yes.
1983.82-818,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,411.145,414.347,--whatever... Brada Miller.
1983.82-818,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,414.347,418.047,"Brada Miller is what we have been calling it, which is--"
1983.82-818,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,418.047,424.435,And you go for the allowance standard way back by Judge Moore a number of years ago?
1983.82-818,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,424.435,430.65,"--Well, and Judge Mansfield's opinion in REA Express for the Second Circuit."
1983.82-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,673.988,701.911,"Mr. Wallace, if it is legitimate for a company to file a bankruptcy petition because executory contracts are making successful continuation of the business impossible, is it permissible for a company to file a bankruptcy petition for the express purpose of freeing itself from an executory collective bargaining agreement that it feels is making it impossible?"
1983.82-818,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,701.911,703.627,I see nothing improper about that.
1983.82-818,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,722.15,737.096,"Mr. Wallace, at one page in your brief, you state that CA2 standard was... that a showing of will fail must be made by the debtor."
1983.82-818,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,743.924,744.938,Not really.
1983.82-818,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,744.938,745.484,Not really?
1983.82-818,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,745.484,746.502,It is a predictive matter.
1983.82-818,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,860.344,866.56,Very well.
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,869.512,896.126,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I adopt the position of the Solicitor General with respect to the standard issue, and instead I would move on to the subject of 8(D), which is the requirement in the National Labor Relations Act which compels a party seeking to modify or terminate a contract to give notice to and to negotiate with the other party."
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1001.451,1007.34,"You think, though, that they must comply literally with all the requirements of 8(D)?"
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1007.34,1015.65,"I think in terms of the policy considerations here, because there are multiple requirements, I don't think so, Justice White."
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.65,1018.118,"Well, then, what is the issue, 8(D) or not?"
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1018.118,1018.836,I think... I think--
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.836,1021.195,Or just notice and reasonable amount of bargaining?
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1021.679,1022.712,"--No, it is in negotiations."
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1049.045,1061.492,"Well, they don't have to... you know, a lot of bargaining goes on for a long time, and if it is going to go on for a long time, the company may... you may not have to bargain any more."
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1061.492,1064.288,"--Your Honor, I can appreciate the concern about time."
1983.82-818,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1079.017,1083.202,"No, but I gather, Mr. Zazzali, you would require them to bargain to impasse, would you not?"
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1083.202,1084.528,"Yes, but impasse--"
1983.82-818,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1084.528,1085.997,That can be a long time.
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1085.997,1087.152,--It can be--
1983.82-818,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1087.152,1094.323,"I gather your position is, they must bargain to impasse before the debtor in possession may seek rejection."
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1094.323,1111.706,"--That's correct, but given the exigencies of the particular situation, that is, bankruptcy, and given the responsibility of both parties and, we hope, the maturity of both parties, impasse can be in two weeks, it can be achieved in two days, it can be achieved in two hours."
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.706,1113.532,"It could be achieved in six months, too."
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1114.093,1125.324,"That's correct, but I think it is appropriate for the bankruptcy court in a proper exercise of its discretion to perhaps order an expedited negotiation schedule."
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1126.073,1142.255,"If the union has notice, and surely it would, of an application to reject the collective bargaining agreement, the union could certainly participate in the hearing, couldn't it?"
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1142.255,1148.362,"--It could, Your Honor, but that is something considerably different than negotiations."
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.019,1150.596,That may be.
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1173.994,1174.914,--Because I don't--
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.914,1190.656,"Because if the court were going to conclude that, yes, the company would or would be likely to fail unless there were modifications, why would you have to go off and negotiate some more about it?"
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1190.656,1206.964,"--Because as we understand the bankruptcy court's determination, it is an all or none decision by the bankruptcy court to terminate or not to terminate, to reject all parts of that collective agreement or none at all, to reject the non-monetary as well as the monetary benefits."
1983.82-818,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1206.964,1219.567,"Well, does that requirement, does that suggest that even if they arrived at an agreement, even if they did, the bankruptcy court could still perhaps even sui sponte direct rejection?"
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1219.567,1227.673,"I can conceive of that happening, but of course, sui sponte, the court in an exercise of its discretion... it might well be an abuse of discretion--"
1983.82-818,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1227.673,1230.189,"The court, in other words, would not be concluded by the agreement?"
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1230.189,1242.465,"--Absolutely not, but going back to Justice White's inquiry, it's too late by the time we get to bankruptcy court to have a hearing on rejection to negotiate out the problems."
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1251.96,1255.412,They would in a sense be negotiating before the bankruptcy court--
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1255.412,1256.66,--I would--
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1256.66,1259.377,--with somebody there refereeing the struggle.
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1259.377,1264.86,--I would not encourage the bankruptcy court to play an active role in the negotiations.
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1273.559,1280.181,What is your view if the bankruptcy court... say the bankruptcy court accepted everything you suggest.
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1297.861,1299.285,"I, although--"
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1299.285,1300.267,Or do you know?
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1300.267,1302.455,--I think there should be negotiations.
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.889,1316.322,"But... The collective bargaining contract has been rejected, but that doesn't mean that you don't represent the majority of the employees, does it?"
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1316.322,1328.333,"You are correct, Your Honor, but on a practical level, to obtain anything of consequence in the post-rejection period simply, according to the experiential data, are not going to happen."
1983.82-818,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1427.287,1429.536,May I just be sure I understand your position?
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1437.473,1465.583,"I think that literally it all should apply, but I think in a... since we are seeking an accommodation of the two statutes, and since I think that reconciliation is in the public interest, I think both statutes have to bend to meet that public interest, and therefore literally I don't think we have to accept all the requirements of 8(D), but simply the guts to get those parties together."
1983.82-818,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1465.583,1468.489,"Well, in other words, I think what you are saying is, no, it doesn't apply."
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1469.316,1469.94,I would--
1983.82-818,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.94,1471.238,--It may be excused in certain circumstances.
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1471.238,1477.485,--I think the public interest would tolerate something less than total compliance.
1983.82-818,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1477.485,1483.249,"Well, what you are saying, a court does not have to apply the 60-day notice requirement in all cases?"
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1483.249,1486.213,"I would think... yes, Your Honor, I would--"
1983.82-818,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.213,1502.474,"It seems to me, then, that you are really not arguing that 8(D) applies, but rather, that you are arguing that the extent to which there has been pretermination negotiation and notice and bargaining is a part of a standard that should be applied by the bankruptcy judge in deciding whether or not to approve rejection."
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1502.474,1505.518,"--Respectfully, Justice Stevens, I am not arguing that."
1983.82-818,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1514.187,1518.543,It is a per se requirement that requires a modest rewriting of the statute.
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1518.543,1530.558,"It might require, in Justice Frankfurter's phrase, rather some elucidating litigation in order to attempt to reconcile these differences."
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1548.44,1553.483,"Of course, the court below really held that the trustee or the debtor in possession was a separate entity."
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1553.483,1555.39,"Yes, which I think is--"
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1555.39,1556.654,And you haven't addressed that.
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1560.374,1562.23,"--If you agree, Your Honor."
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1567.494,1568.368,"Well, we haven't yet."
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1568.368,1569.198,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.364,1581.287,"Nevertheless, that was the ground for the court of appeals judgment, wasn't it?"
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1581.287,1592.185,"--That's correct, and the Eleventh Circuit roundly disagrees with that, saying that this is at best a new juridical entity rather than a new entity."
1983.82-818,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1597.216,1601.51,"When you say commentators, Mr. Zazzali, who are you referring to?"
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1601.51,1609.633,"--I think, for example, the article by Countryman quoted in a number of the briefs, and I think the Michigan Law Review article."
1983.82-818,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1609.633,1613.321,"Was that an article, or was it written by students?"
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1613.321,1618.441,I think the Countryman article was written by a law professor.
1983.82-818,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1618.441,1620.364,How about the Michigan Law Review?
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1620.364,1622.13,"That I am honestly not sure of, Your Honor."
1983.82-818,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1622.13,1624.002,You commend it to us anyway?
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1624.002,1642.759,"Well, I do think that I commend the conclusion to you that the new entity theory does not stand for the simple reason that it makes no sense, as the Eleventh Circuit said, to say that a new entity is bound by an old contract."
1983.82-818,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1753.076,1763.85,Are you suggesting that there is any diminution of the right to strike if the contract is cancelled by the bankruptcy process?
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1763.85,1765.913,"Not at all, clearly, and that's the problem."
1983.82-818,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1768.35,1769.758,They are just where they were before the contract.
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1769.758,1770.382,--That's correct.
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.832,1787.921,"Well, if they are where they were before the contract was entered into, they were... they represented a majority of the employees, then I suppose they could get an order to bargain."
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1787.921,1791.091,--That's one of the questions before this Court.
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1792.308,1795.447,"No, I don't know whether it is... this is after rejection."
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1806.491,1807.583,"--That's correct, but--"
1983.82-818,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.583,1817.316,"And if the debtor in possession refused to bargain with the majority representative of its employees, I would suppose it would commit an unfair labor practice, wouldn't it?"
1983.82-818,1,33736,james_r_zazzali,,1817.316,1833.714,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but keep in mind that the contract has not only been rejected, but every part of that contract is being rejected, including seniority provisions, and therefore what will happen is what is happening, according to the documented cases, and employees are being laid off and the union is losing its majority."
1983.82-818,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1846.489,1849.35,Mr. Zackin?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,1849.35,1860.718,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, although it may be somewhat unusual, I think it appropriate to begin with a discussion of what this case is not about."
1983.82-818,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1913.977,1932.379,"May I ask... This is following up on Justice O'Connor's question... if the sole purpose of a bankruptcy petition was to escape a labor contract which the company honestly believed would cause bankruptcy, cause insolvency and a failure, is that bad faith?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,1932.379,1935.081,"No, I don't think that is bad faith, Justice Stevens."
1983.82-818,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1935.752,1936.345,What is bad faith?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,1936.345,1938.47,--I do not think it is bad faith.
1983.82-818,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1938.938,1943.279,"But what does the concept of bad faith embody, then, insofar as it is related to labor relations?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,1943.279,1954.664,"--I think that if it is found by a bankruptcy court that a company can continue to pay its obligations as they become due and still honor its union contract, but nevertheless--"
1983.82-818,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.664,1956.161,Then they wouldn't be bankrupt.
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,1956.161,1976.419,"--Well, that's correct, Justice Rehnquist, and if they tried to use Chapter 11 merely to increase their profits by rejecting the union contract, that would constitute bad faith, and I think in that situation not only would the application to reject the contract be denied, but the case itself, the Chapter 11 case, should be thrown out of bankruptcy court."
1983.82-818,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1976.419,1978.591,"You couldn't use Chapter 11, could you?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,1978.591,1981.383,You should not be permitted to use Chapter 11.
1983.82-818,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1981.383,1986.913,"Well, I mean, normally, without the union being involved, if you aren't broke, you can't use Chapter 11."
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,1986.913,1988.602,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-818,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1992.786,2019.427,"Well, is there something over and above the good faith requirement that extends across the board to consideration of executory contracts by the debtor in possession that applies to labor contracts in particular, or is a labor contract protected by no more than the requirement of good faith that you have just spoken of, which I think extends across the board in executory contracts?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2019.427,2022.941,"I believe that it does extend across the board, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-818,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2061.986,2073.17,"Of course, if one looks at the National Labor Relations Act, there is no indication that Congress thought an employee was going into bankruptcy at midterm and rejecting the contract."
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2073.17,2109.997,"That's correct, Justice Rehnquist, but I think it is important to note that Congress in enacting the Bankruptcy Code did provide for one specific exception with respect to the rejection of labor agreements, and that is Section 1167 of the Bankruptcy Code, which applies to collective bargaining agreements negotiated under the Railway Labor Act, and in that case Congress saw fit to say to the bankruptcy courts, you may not, you may not modify or terminate this contract except if the debtor complies with the midterm modification requirements in the Railway Labor Act."
1983.82-818,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2114.852,2122.336,Was that because common carriers' responsibilities to the public as a whole are different from perhaps a building contractor?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2122.336,2125.006,"I think that's correct, Chief Justice."
1983.82-818,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2138.702,2144.762,"Well, it isn't so much a question of the employees being protected as the traveling public being protected--"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2144.762,2145.795,I think that's--
1983.82-818,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2145.795,2147.027,--by continued service.
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2147.027,2149.074,--I think that's true.
1983.82-818,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2167.238,2177.529,"Mr. Zackin, what in your view is the underlying purpose of the Bankruptcy Act itself?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2182.481,2200.879,"I think that the underlying purpose of at least Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act as expressed by Congress is to promote the reorganization of distressed business entities as an alternative to liquidation, and that policy is found--"
1983.82-818,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2200.879,2201.959,To what end?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2206.315,2209.766,"--All... both, and... both, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2270.665,2274.491,So you do defend... you do defend the theory of the court of appeals?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2274.491,2293.579,"--I very definitely defend that theory, and both based on the new entity theory, which was discussed, and also, even if one rejects that theory, I think as the Eleventh Circuit did in Brada Miller, one still can reach precisely the same conclusions as the Third Circuit."
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2293.579,2299.451,What do you think the Eleventh Circuit standard is for rejection?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2299.451,2306.697,I think the Eleventh Circuit standard is very similar if not identical to the standard that the court below voiced.
1983.82-818,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2325.0,2327.266,Do you think the same of the Second Circuit standard?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2327.266,2330.748,"No, I think the Second Circuit standard is different."
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.263,2345.884,"Well, under the Second Circuit standard, which would either require a showing at the threshold that you will fail or you are likely to fail... Is that it?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2345.884,2346.789,--Yes.
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.789,2350.021,"Under that standard, how do you understand it?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2380.978,2389.55,"That is precisely the way I read the Second Circuit standard, and precisely what I believe that the petitioners here are urging to this Court."
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2389.55,2399.938,"Would it be inconsistent with the Second Circuit standard if the court said, well, this company is going to fail unless something is done about its executory contracts?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2414.386,2417.072,I think that if the Second Circuit--
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.072,2421.959,Would that be inconsistent with the Eleventh Circuit standard?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2421.959,2425.098,--I think that would be more consistent with the Eleventh Circuit standard.
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.123,2494.93,"Well, your preference isn't an outright affirmance, but your next vote is for the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, I take it."
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2494.93,2523.56,"I think that it is interesting what the... as I read the Eleventh Circuit decision in Brada Miller, they began with a criticism of the so-called new entity theory, but they wound up adopting, as I read it, almost verbatim the test espoused by the... or formulated by the Third Circuit, which is the balancing approach, as well as the Third Circuit's conclusion that a debtor in possession need not comply with Section 8(D) of the National Labor Relations Act."
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.838,2530.259,"Yes, but if it is a new entity, why is there any need for rejection?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2530.259,2535.431,"Well, I think the reason is that that's the scheme that Congress has set up."
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2540.769,2545.125,"I know, but there isn't any theory under the labor law, is there?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2550.42,2552.464,"--Well, there is still--"
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.464,2552.936,Is there?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2552.936,2553.856,"--Yes, there is."
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2554.605,2555.779,Strictly under labor law?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2555.779,2563.663,I think that there... the pre-bankruptcy contract continues to survive.
1983.82-818,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2563.663,2566.989,Something like the successor entity theory or something?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2566.989,2570.425,I think that that's a very apt analogy which has been made by several of the circuits.
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2570.425,2571.501,"Well, then, it is not a new entity theory, is it?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2574.141,2579.468,I think that as I read... as I read--
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2579.468,2584.748,"Which wouldn't really be bound then by 8(D), if it is just a successor entity rather than a separate one."
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2584.748,2601.13,--The reason that a new entity is still required to reject or assume a contract even though it is not a party to the contract is because Section 365 requires that debtors in possession take that action.
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.686,2625.104,"Well, you have to have the new entity theory in order to be able to make changes in the collective bargaining contract without getting in trouble with the Labor Board, I take it."
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2625.104,2627.947,Not necessarily.
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2627.947,2630.929,"But that is close, though, isn't it?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2630.929,2632.743,It would certainly help.
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.743,2633.725,Yes.
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2634.802,2657.294,"But what the Third Circuit also said, and which we also agree with, is that once a collective bargaining agreement is rejected, the rejection relates back to the date on which the Chapter 11 petition was filed, so that in our case, we obtained bankruptcy court permission to reject in December."
1983.82-818,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2698.278,2707.196,"May I ask, and this is prompted by Mr. Wallace's closing remarks, what standard applies to the compensation of the employees during that interval?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2709.474,2725.017,"--I think that if the contract is rejected, then the employees are entitled to the reasonable value of their services which they render in that interim period, and I think that that is not a difficult calculation to make."
1983.82-818,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2751.943,2761.656,"Would you agree that the contracts, the collective bargaining agreement is strong evidence of the reasonable value?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2761.656,2782.024,"I think it may be in certain instances, but it also may not be indicative if in fact the economic situation of the employer has changed, has deteriorated to the point where he can no longer legitimately pay the compensation required in the collective bargaining agreement."
1983.82-818,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2782.024,2787.039,"Well, would there be any room for any bargaining over what is reasonable value under your approach?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2787.039,2800.844,"I think that if we got to the point where the labor agreement is rejected, there would be bargaining in the sense of there may be settlement discussions."
1983.82-818,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2816.511,2820.072,What about the hiatus that would occur as here?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2832.66,2846.186,"I think it is important to note that under the Third Circuit's test, the debtor in possession, although a new entity, is still an employer, subject to the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act."
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.641,2876.295,But you say the employer meanwhile has the right unilaterally to lower the wages.
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2876.295,2879.84,"--I think much like a successor, Justice White."
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.782,2919.279,"But ordinarily, outside of bankruptcy, a successor employer can't unilaterally modify the wages."
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2919.279,2949.531,"Well, I think that... I think that this case, as I read it, as I read what this Court did in the Byrnes case, said that a successor is not necessarily bound by the terms and conditions of its predecessor's contract, and is free to set the terms and conditions of employment initially, which again is not to say that it doesn't have the obligation to bargain in good faith."
1983.82-818,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2949.531,2956.637,"Mr. Zackin, how many employees does the debtor now have?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2956.637,2959.619,"Now, Your Honor, there are ten employees."
1983.82-818,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2959.619,2963.055,"At the time the petition was filed, there were three?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2963.574,2964.136,At the time--
1983.82-818,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2964.136,2964.869,"No, there were 18?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2964.869,2969.196,--There were 18 at the time that the Chapter 11 petition was filed.
1983.82-818,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2991.498,2994.559,Is the company still operating?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,2994.559,2995.795,The company has been reorganized.
1983.82-818,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3015.753,3037.543,"Mr. Zackin, going back to the standard again that should be employed, does it make any sense in your view for the Court to consider requiring whatever the proof be to be made by clear and convincing evidence?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3044.04,3047.21,"I don't believe so, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-818,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3220.406,3239.148,"Mr. Zackin, do courts in trying to treat the relationships between another executory contractor whose contract has been rejected or accepted go into elaborate analysis about whether the debtor in possession is a new entity?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3239.148,3252.219,"No, Justice Rehnquist, they don't, although I think the new entity theory is certainly consistent with the whole concept of rejection of contracts."
1983.82-818,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3256.251,3276.338,"For analytical purposes, which should the debtor in possession be treated any differently if it is a collective bargaining contract that has been rejected than if it is an executory contract to supply widgets that has been rejected?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3276.338,3295.375,"--I think that because the courts have fashioned the business judgment test to apply to other types of executory contracts, there was really no reason to elaborate a theory as to why that standard was appropriate."
1983.82-818,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3356.133,3372.718,"Mr. Zackin, on this new entity point, one, the employees, and two, the union, what happens to that entity once you go into bankruptcy, Chapter 11, I mean?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3372.718,3388.447,"The union remains as the bargaining unit for the employees, assuming that the majority of the debtors' employees are still members of that union."
1983.82-818,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3401.909,3403.785,But there is no contract?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3403.785,3416.03,"But there is... the way I would view it, there is a contract in existence which is... the enforcement of which is suspended."
1983.82-818,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3419.778,3421.184,The payment is suspended.
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3421.184,3422.9,--Pardon me?
1983.82-818,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3422.9,3425.009,The payment is suspended.
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3425.009,3428.133,"Well, the payment under the terms of the contract is suspended."
1983.82-818,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3428.133,3434.646,"I am talking about for most employees, payment of wages is rather important."
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3434.646,3435.754,Of course it is.
1983.82-818,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3451.905,3454.28,I thought you said he could also bargain for a new contract.
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3454.28,3459.372,"The debtor in possession and the union can bargain for a new contract, yes."
1983.82-818,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3468.084,3472.147,Doesn't that mean that the old contract goes out ahead of time?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3472.147,3480.566,"I think that it does mean that at least for the period of time the company is in Chapter 11, yes."
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3480.566,3486.938,"Could I ask you, was... the petition for reorganization, I gather, was approved?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3486.938,3487.703,"Yes, it was."
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3487.703,3499.994,"And under the new bankruptcy law, I suppose, you still have to make a showing under Chapter 11 like you did under Chapter 10, that you cannot... at least that you cannot pay your debts as they mature?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3499.994,3507.196,"There really is no... as I read the Bankruptcy Code, no explicit requirement that you must show that."
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3507.196,3508.959,"There was, wasn't there?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3508.959,3509.898,"There was, you are correct--"
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3509.898,3510.584,Under Chapter 10.
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3510.584,3511.006,--under Chapter 10.
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3511.006,3514.519,So you don't have to make any showing that you are in financial trouble?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3514.519,3520.595,"Only, I think, in terms of the good faith requirements which are--"
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3520.595,3521.25,About what?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3521.25,3534.59,"--Well, that the motives... I believe the way the courts have defined good faith is that the motives in filing were legitimate business purposes in seeking to reorganize a failing business."
1983.82-818,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3534.59,3537.292,How do you know... What is the standard for a failing business?
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3537.292,3542.338,"I think that Justice White points out that you are not able to meet your debts as they become due, and--"
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3542.338,3544.507,"You have to make some kind of a showing like that, don't you?"
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3544.507,3545.321,--Yes.
1983.82-818,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3555.94,3564.593,"Well, if there is a... If you can't pay your debts as they mature, I suppose that means all your debts."
1983.82-818,2,33732,jack_m_zackin,,3564.593,3574.982,"I think it must apply across the board, and I think if you meet that test, if you can't pay your debts as they mature, you are certainly an eligible candidate for Chapter 11."
1983.82-818,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3651.466,3652.948,Very well.
