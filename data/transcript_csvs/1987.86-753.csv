1987.86-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,3.046,We will hear argument.
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,13.402,15.666,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1987.86-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,136.882,143.707,"Is there not some problem with the ""just compensation"" clause applying at all to this case?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,148.659,151.705,"There had been a taking of money, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,245.025,247.635,But that is a very hypothetical situation.
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,254.039,254.507,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,254.507,260.036,Is there any guarantee that that is how a hearing officer would handle that sort of an inquiry?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,260.036,273.092,"It is our position, Your Honor, that the lack of validity of this provision appears on the face of the ordinance and an application would not do anything to assist this Court in resolving this dispute."
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,298.301,300.41,Who do you represent?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,300.41,314.544,"We represent Mr. Richard Pennell who is a property owner of an apartment house and, more importantly, the Tri-County Apartment Owners Association, that is an unincorporated association of rental property owners."
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,314.544,333.614,"But surely the ordinance is not unconstitutional with respect to those groups of people... or let us assume that example of yours, I suppose that if the landlord could collect the $400, it is not... the ordinance is not unconstitutional as applied to him?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,333.614,334.271,That is correct.
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,334.271,338.551,And it is only those landlords with hardship tenants?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,338.551,338.832,Correct.
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,338.832,349.624,"Well, do we have, I suppose by... saying among your association members there are some landlords of hardship tenants?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,349.624,350.734,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,358.997,368.681,"But even with respect to landlords with hardship tenants, the hearing officer is not obliged to reduce the rent below $400?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,368.681,369.79,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,369.79,372.523,So that how do we know that he ever would?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,372.523,378.395,Because there is no constitutional way that the hearing officer could even consider tenant hardship.
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,379.519,380.519,I know that is your position.
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,382.316,385.22,There is no way that this can be applied constitutionally.
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,390.14,400.901,"Well, you just answered to the contrary in your example, if the landlord is allowed to collect $400, there would be no problem."
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,400.901,403.807,"That is correct, Your Honor, but this ordinance goes one step further."
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,403.807,414.194,"But even if the landlord had a hardship tenant, if the hearing officer allowed the $400, the statute would not be unconstitutionally applied to him."
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,414.194,415.849,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,415.849,427.437,"In fact, taking it one step further, Mr. Miller, as I understand the supreme court of California's Opinion, the minimum that you can get has always got to give you a fair return on your investment."
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,427.437,428.468,That is the interpretation.
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,428.468,436.808,"So that if they decided in your case that $375 would not give you a fair return, then he would not be permitted to give the $375?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,436.808,437.589,That is correct your Honor.
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,437.589,437.979,Yes.
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,437.979,458.565,"But I think that I can show the Court that even though the $375 in my example is an otherwise... it meets the constitutional minimum rent, I believe I can show this Court that the city does not have the power or the authority to take away from us that increase that otherwise be determined to be reasonable."
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,458.565,467.202,"What if I did it in reverse and said that if you had $375 as a reasonable return, that if you had tenants who are multi-millionaires, you can charge them an extra $10?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,467.202,469.404,"I think you would come out with the same result, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,469.404,470.185,That would be unconstitutional too?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,470.185,474.809,"For the wrong reason: the City of San Jose could say that,"
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,488.991,492.037,"What constitutional provision would my hypothetical violate if they said,"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,500.751,501.079,Yes.
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,501.079,503.828,What portion of the Constitution would that violate?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,503.828,510.061,"I believe that would violate the ""just compensation"" clause under the same reasoning that we presented here, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,517.837,521.384,It is a legitimate consideration in establishing income tax rates.
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,521.384,528.038,"--Yes, Your Honor, we do have income tax rates that are based upon wealth."
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,528.038,530.537,"Dentists sometimes take into account the wealth of their patients, I think."
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,531.957,534.207,"There is a substantial difference, however."
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,534.207,536.16,What is the difference constitutionally?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,536.16,542.031,Constitutionally what you have is a charge that is applied to everyone and is being applied equally.
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,594.885,600.82,What about a state law that required lawyers to devote ten percent of their time to public service?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,600.82,604.132,"Yes, Your Honor, in California we had such an ordinance."
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,604.132,605.521,This was unconstitutional.
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,605.521,619.595,"This was held invalid in the Cunningham case under the ""equal protection"" clause, that a lawyer that was providing goods and services to the public cannot be required to provide pro bono services in civil suits, and in civil suits we have the public defender."
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.888,629.262,Did you make this very argument before the California supreme court?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,629.262,631.23,Which argument?
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,631.23,633.807,"On the ""just compensation"" clause?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,633.807,634.01,Yes.
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.307,646.74,Because I do not... they recite that you concede that you do not rely on confiscatory rents.
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,646.74,650.739,"Well, Your Honor, we made two arguments before the California supreme court."
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.896,692.175,Is that position in your brief filed with the California supreme court?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,692.175,695.095,--That we are... that even if we are receiving minimum rent?
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.093,703.591,So they necessarily rejected that when they--
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,703.591,704.966,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.966,709.511,--Even if they did not seem to in their Opinion?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,709.511,710.871,"Well, they did in that--"
1987.86-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.871,713.12,"They just talked about ""equal protection""."
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,713.12,715.321,"--Yes, they talked about ""equal protection""."
1987.86-753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,755.304,783.262,"Mr. Miller, before you go on, just one more question on the standing: is it the case that a landlord who has a hardship tenant and wants to sell his property, the purchaser from him would be subject to the same ability of the California authorities to require the charging of a lower rent?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,783.262,783.95,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.95,785.792,He does not sell out from under that provision?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,785.792,786.042,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,786.042,795.961,So the asserted authority by the State of California does amount to in effect a sort of cloud on his title to the premises?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,795.961,797.21,"It definitely does, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,797.21,806.05,"It is an asserted ability of California to require that those premises, at least as long as this occupant is in them, will bring less income?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,806.05,807.144,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.144,813.126,And might that affect the sale price that an individual is able to get for a unit that has a hardship tenant?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,813.126,814.094,It definitely will.
1987.86-753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.995,835.725,And that cloud is effective whether or not you know in advance whether in fact the hearing officer will reduce it?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,853.547,853.766,Yes ma'am.
1987.86-753,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,853.766,855.047,He cannot be evicted?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,855.047,855.563,That is correct.
1987.86-753,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,856.03,860.388,Notwithstanding the existence of a leasehold period that has expired?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,860.388,860.966,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,879.207,884.457,"Are you arguing, then, this is like a physical taking or is it a regulatory taking?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,884.457,886.408,"It has an aspect of physical, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,886.408,887.502,"Well, which is it?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,888.735,890.095,"We consider it as a hybrid, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.92,944.853,"The majority of the supreme court of California, in answering one of your contentions, said that the"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,956.396,961.707,"I agree, Your Honor, but make sure we define what we are talking about."
1987.86-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,984.368,990.07,But would that not be very much what they were doing if they regulated only low rent housing?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,990.07,990.679,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1015.794,1018.669,Why is one permissible and another not in your view?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1018.669,1027.647,"Because you cannot regulate... establish, price regulation based upon the consumer's ability to pay, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1053.467,1058.839,You can tell the grocer that he has to raise the price of his milk above what he wants to charge?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1058.839,1059.105,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1061.026,1066.008,"If you could require him to raise it, why can you not require him to lower it?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1066.008,1077.878,"The justification for Nebbia v. Bordens, that line of cases, Your Honor, gave a justification for a general regulation just as you have a justification for a general rent control ordinance."
1987.86-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1095.746,1099.042,"But what if the legislature, the city council, says,"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1112.568,1114.129,"And I would say that would be unconstitutional, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1115.333,1116.394,"No, you would not."
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1119.346,1120.956,--I misunderstand the question.
1987.86-753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.596,1127.391,I understood your position to be that the state could not require a lower price across the board.
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1127.391,1128.279,"--Yes, they can."
1987.86-753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1128.279,1133.325,Not conditional upon what the economic status of the particular purchaser is.
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1133.325,1134.918,"Thank you, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1136.901,1138.323,I am not so sure you did.
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1144.539,1159.487,"I do believe, Your Honor, that because of market conditions the grocer is able to charge... because of market conditions, the groceryman was able to charge let us say $1.80 for his milk and that was an unreasonable price because of market conditions, that the state could come in and say"
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1246.981,1250.027,"Mr. Miller, what about rate regulation?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1262.476,1270.036,"Yes, Your Honor, in fact, I think there are some rate regulations that have done something similar to that."
1987.86-753,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1270.036,1271.222,What is the difference?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1271.222,1274.658,The difference is you are taking it and applying it across all the consumers.
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.658,1283.67,"No, well, all the consumers... all the consumers who are less able to pay large sums of money for their utility bills."
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1283.67,1294.228,"In the rate cases, Your Honor, with either working with a utility, which is a monopoly, or if you are talking about a gas rate case, which is a near-monopoly, you have a situation where you do not have normal market forces operating."
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.596,1315.562,But by hypothesis it is not spread out over everyone.
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1323.856,1331.479,"--Yes, I agree, Your Honor, except with the utility, one supplier is supplying thousands of people."
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1331.479,1338.102,"Well, one landlord is renting apartments to thousands of tenants, and some of them are better able to pay than others."
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1340.663,1344.754,"But keep in mind, Your Honor, this ordinance is not based upon an ability to pay."
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1344.754,1350.299,But you are saying it is constitutionally impermissible to take ability to pay into account?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1350.299,1350.831,That is correct.
1987.86-753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1351.315,1365.871,"But you would not contend that it was unconstitutional in the rate regulation context to take ability to pay into account, say, as a class, homeowners are less able to pay than factory owners, is that constitutionally impermissible?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1365.871,1366.856,"No it is not, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1369.229,1373.618,"Mr. Miller, you can make a utility give its services for free, can you not?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1382.241,1383.224,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1384.567,1389.331,"But that would be a ""taking"" for a private person would it not, to require it give it away for free?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1389.331,1390.253,"--That is a distinction, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1399.842,1405.324,Is there anything in your argument that would not knock out rent control as such?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1405.324,1405.824,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1425.786,1427.284,"It involves rent, does it not?"
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1427.284,1428.847,"Yes, it is a rent-control ordinance."
1987.86-753,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1428.847,1431.955,But if it involves rent it controls rent.
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1431.955,1436.796,"Yes, but it is controlling it for the wrong reason and on the wrong basis."
1987.86-753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.234,1475.218,How do you know you can be sure?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1481.294,1482.106,"--And it will, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.106,1485.621,So I am not sure you are right there and people will follow it for that reason.
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1485.621,1499.192,"All right, Your Honor, the next step is in California, every rent control ordinance that I am aware of... and there are between 40 and 50, all provide that the hearing officer can take into consideration ""any relevant factor""."
1987.86-753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1519.06,1521.575,You are just saying they may be doing it already?
1987.86-753,0,27573,harry_d_miller,,1521.575,1531.602,"We hope not, but one last point, if the Court please: we are not only challenging this ordinance under the ""just compensation"" clause, but also under the ""equal protection"" clause."
1987.86-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1606.118,1608.836,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,1611.054,1617.552,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1765.351,1799.182,"But you take the position that it is perfectly valid for the city to require a landlord with let us say ten units to perhaps be asked to allow a particular income, a low-income tenant, to remain indefinitely in the premises at a rent which is lower than the reasonable rent that has been allowed for other tenants generally in the same building, is that right?"
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,1799.182,1802.649,"The ordinance... yes, essentially, with some exceptions."
1987.86-753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1806.678,1808.35,But it could work that way?
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,1808.35,1810.146,--To the extent that your question is
1987.86-753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1819.908,1827.435,At the end of a term he cannot and might have to keep this person indefinitely who happens to be a hardship tenant?
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,1827.435,1834.495,He can evict the tenant for any reason other than the evasion of the rent control ordinance.
1987.86-753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1837.057,1843.46,"Well, that does seem to be requiring the landlord to assume a public burden, does it not?"
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,1843.46,1858.892,"It does not to me, because he continues... I think that the problem is the assumption that there is a reasonable rent and he is not entitled to that reasonable rent."
1987.86-753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1892.503,1902.718,Could the city require grocers to sell to hardship people at a lower price than to others?
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,1902.718,1908.215,"The answer to that I think is ""yes"", if there is a proper purpose."
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.604,1963.724,"Ms. Gallo, what about seeing this problem of the hardship tenants and to meet that same problem the State of California passed a law that said that,"
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,1976.485,1981.186,I do not see that in that situation there is a connection.
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.186,1986.653,"So we are just quibbling about whether the connection is close enough, is that right?"
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,1986.653,1990.587,I think that very much at the heart of the argument is--
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.587,2000.303,"There has to be a relationship between the person you are putting the burden on and the nature of the hardship, is there not?"
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,2000.303,2009.566,--There has to be a rational relationship between the purpose of the regulation and the person who is being regulated.
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.566,2010.626,"Well, no."
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,2020.077,2022.295,"Well, I think we are saying the same thing."
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.386,2043.224,"You could protect them against excessive rents in a lot of ways such as making their next-door neighbor who is well-off, make up the difference, and you say that would be no-good?"
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,2043.224,2049.253,Because I do not think that there is a rational connection with the next-door neighbor.
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.253,2064.684,"And you think it is a rational connection that I happen to be the landlord who rented to let us say an affluent person who loses a lot of money in the stork market and and whose income goes below $34,000."
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,2069.308,2075.134,I do not think that you are responsible for his hardship.
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2117.132,2140.451,"What troubles me is that with respect to all landlords, with respect to all rent control in general, you can easily say that the reason for the inability of the public at-large to get affordable housing is the fact that all landlords are charging too much money taking advantage of a temporary shortage or whatever other rationale you might want to use."
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,2164.018,2180.857,I think the connection is with the effect of letting the landlord take the maximum rent... we are allowing the landlord to have a rent that is well-above what is constitutionally mandated.
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2200.332,2203.096,He is not taking advantage of the housing shortage any more.
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,2223.386,2241.347,"I do not think so because what you are assuming is that we are allowing the landlords in the case of non-hardship tenants to take what is the reasonable rent, and I do not think that there is such a thing as ""the reasonable rent""."
1987.86-753,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.415,2440.736,"But absent the ordinance the hearing officer would... the landlord, might be able to charge what the market might permit him to charge a lot more than the hearing officer would allow him after passing all these things through."
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,2440.736,2442.251,That is correct.
1987.86-753,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.514,2455.073,So it keeps rents generally down below what they would be if there were a free market?
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,2455.073,2456.292,--That is correct.
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.633,2584.553,"I presume if they could do this for hardship tenants they could do it for, let us say, the elderly?"
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,2590.051,2593.846,For the elderly if there were circumstances... a totality of circumstance.
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2593.846,2597.235,For police officers who are notoriously ill-paid?
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,2610.621,2613.432,I do not think that that would be all right because I do not--
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2613.432,2613.698,Why?
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,2620.664,2626.722,--I think that the purpose here is not to give money to the tenants.
1987.86-753,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2652.542,2665.848,"Well, but certainly the ordinance also relieves any urge that the municipality might have to subsidize the low-income people?"
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,2670.425,2689.026,I think that the city has a wide variety of programs that are possible and our city is perhaps in the forefront of a variety of programs that go to providing affordable housing for tenants.
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2832.858,2833.655,You keep saying that.
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,2861.348,2865.766,--I think you have both ends of the test.
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2906.61,2907.813,That may be.
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,2916.309,2920.23,"I think that there are two tests, and I think that we meet them both."
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3023.797,3024.219,Excuse me.
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,3059.86,3073.87,"--Depending on the circumstances of the tenant, I do not see that the hearing officer takes the other factors and balances them and then comes up with what is a reasonable rent."
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3073.87,3074.199,But that is a poverty factor.
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,3078.665,3084.647,It is the determinant of how far we will allow him to gouge.
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3100.016,3124.755,"The California supreme court, as I understand it, had found it unconstitutional for California... I guess it was a state law... to require children to pay the expenses of care for their impoverished parents in mental institutions?"
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,3127.083,3127.691,That is correct.
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3127.691,3129.457,Do you disagree with that Decision?
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,3129.457,3137.344,"I do not disagree with that Decision, but I agree with the California supreme court that that Decision is not applicable here."
1987.86-753,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3192.946,3203.615,"Ms. Gallo, before you sit down, I want to be sure... are you continuing to raise any issue about the standing of Pennell?"
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,3203.615,3210.142,I have very mixed feelings about the standing of Mr. Pennell.
1987.86-753,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3251.095,3252.407,What if we thought it was necessary?
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,3253.438,3258.092,Then I would urge you not to find that there is standing for the Association.
1987.86-753,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3265.105,3272.462,What you are really saying is that they should not be able to attack the ordinance on its face?
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,3272.462,3272.929,That is correct.
1987.86-753,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3272.929,3275.414,They should be... wait until there is an applied--
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,3275.414,3276.475,That is correct.
1987.86-753,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3276.475,3282.802,--Did Mr. Pennell ever claim to have a hardship tenant?
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,3282.802,3287.532,Nowhere in the Record did Mr. Pennell claim to have a hardship tenant.
1987.86-753,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3287.532,3294.952,"So as far as he is concerned, I suppose you would have the same argument: he is not entitled to attack the ordinance on its face?"
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,3294.952,3302.448,"I think that our ""standing"" argument is very much a species of our ""ripeness"" argument."
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3353.491,3361.8,What if the ordinance says that the landlord can charge a higher rent unless the landlord is Black?
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,3361.8,3366.47,That is an unconstitutional purpose.
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3366.47,3367.876,"Why would you not say,"
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,3375.717,3384.416,I would allow a facial challenge in that situation but not under the taking clause.
1987.86-753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3391.007,3393.537,"Well, is not an ""equal protection"" argument being made here?"
1987.86-753,1,30570,joan_gallo,,3393.537,3401.628,"The ""equal protection"" argument is being made here but the gravamen, I think as the Appellant said, is the ""taking"" argument."
1987.86-753,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3402.58,3403.314,"Thank you very much, Ms. Gallo."
1987.86-753,2,27573,harry_d_miller,,3405.688,3407.595,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-753,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3434.381,3447.094,But do we have anybody in front of us who is a landlord of property with a hardship tenant who would benefit from this statute?
1987.86-753,2,27573,harry_d_miller,,3447.094,3447.5,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3453.388,3455.919,"Well, there are no allegations that I have seen that say,"
1987.86-753,2,27573,harry_d_miller,,3460.152,3464.306,We allege that we have... represent owners who are subject to the ordinance.
1987.86-753,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3470.068,3477.722,"Being ""generally subject to it"" is not the same as ""having units with hardship tenants"", though, is it?"
1987.86-753,2,27573,harry_d_miller,,3482.939,3492.42,"That is true, Your Honor, but of all the hardship tenants in the City of San Jose, we necessarily have many of them since we are the suppliers of housing in the City of San Jose."
1987.86-753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3495.497,3513.395,"Yes, but if even a landlord with a hardship tenant, if the hearing officer in your example you used before, said a reasonable rate would normally be $400, and you have a hardship tenant, he could still leave it at $400."
1987.86-753,2,27573,harry_d_miller,,3513.395,3514.208,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3514.208,3518.363,"And that would be a constitutional application, you told me before."
1987.86-753,2,27573,harry_d_miller,,3518.363,3518.581,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3518.581,3524.235,So you cannot say that this ordinance is incapable of constitutional application.
1987.86-753,2,27573,harry_d_miller,,3524.235,3529.921,It is if he is ever at any time going to consider the hardship of the tenant in making his decision.
1987.86-753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3545.351,3554.894,"Yes, but I take it your only ground for saying that, I suppose is that it is just unconstitutional under this ordinance to take wealth into consideration."
1987.86-753,2,27573,harry_d_miller,,3554.894,3555.113,Correct.
1987.86-753,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3557.035,3565.469,Even though the consideration of poverty never leads to anyone's rent being changed in a particular case?
1987.86-753,2,27573,harry_d_miller,,3565.469,3567.124,"It may not, Your Honor, I agree with that."
1987.86-753,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3574.388,3578.729,"Well, suppose... that you came up to this Court with a tactical case that had happened."
1987.86-753,2,27573,harry_d_miller,,3597.206,3602.782,--Not unless you say the hearing officer... just the fact that the hearing officer could--
1987.86-753,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3602.782,3604.016,But it passes through his mind?
1987.86-753,2,27573,harry_d_miller,,3604.016,3609.654,--could have took wealth into consideration and it did not make any difference to him.
1987.86-753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3609.654,3618.728,"But just the fact that that factor may be taken into consideration invalidates this ordinance on its face, is that it?"
1987.86-753,2,27573,harry_d_miller,,3618.728,3621.446,"The problem is that there have been many times that we may not even know, Your Honor."
1987.86-753,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3623.085,3629.817,"Mr. Miller, is that all... are there not a lot of existing ordinances out there that permit any variety of factors to be taken into account?"
1987.86-753,2,27573,harry_d_miller,,3634.613,3639.47,"--If they are sub rosa applying the standard, that would be correct."
1987.86-753,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3639.47,3644.843,And that would make the ordinance on its face unconstitutional because they are permitted sub rosa to do that.
1987.86-753,2,27573,harry_d_miller,,3644.843,3649.232,"Without this Opinion of the California supreme court, it would not be anything invalid on its face."
1987.86-753,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3656.306,3658.353,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
