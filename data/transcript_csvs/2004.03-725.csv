2004.03-725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,6.77,We'll hear argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States.
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,9.371,12.51,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,83.303,97.587,"Well, can you look at the interest of the government as one of not allowing U.S. territory to be used to carry out a smuggling scheme?"
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,106.049,119.356,"Justice O'Connor, the government's interest in prosecuting somebody does not define the scope of what the statute at issue proscribes."
2004.03-725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.356,136.867,It's a wire fraud statute dealing with the use of communications capacity in this country to carry out a scheme designed to enable smuggling of goods.
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,136.867,153.497,"Well, if the... if the statute was not written as it is... the statute, as written, uses the words ""defraud"" and the word... the word ""property"", and both of those terms are terms that this Court has defined very narrowly."
2004.03-725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,155.355,169.844,"Ms. Brill, I thought your brief said that we have an anti-smuggling statute, which is directed precisely against smugglers, but it only applies to those countries that have similar protection for us."
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,169.844,170.959,"--Yes, Justice--"
2004.03-725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.959,171.702,And Canada does not.
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,171.702,172.983,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, that's exactly--"
2004.03-725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,172.983,173.354,Now--
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,173.354,173.81,--correct.
2004.03-725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.81,184.75,--the existence of that statute would seem to suggest... and a statute which is limited to countries that will do the same for us... would seem to suggest that we don't want to do this for Canada.
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,184.75,187.245,"Yes, that's exactly... that's exactly right, Your Honor."
2004.03-725,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,187.95,189.353,But it's also limited to vessels.
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,193.894,195.918,--By automobile.
2004.03-725,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,195.918,202.976,"--vehicles, as is done here, so that we don't have any statute that covers smuggling on land."
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,202.976,203.636,Right.
2004.03-725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.751,209.498,Is there something better about reciprocity for vessels and not reciprocity for land smuggling?
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,209.498,231.312,"I think it just evinces what Congress was concerned about most at the time, Justice Scalia, but it was... it is certainly the case that in any... any time that this country has endeavored to deal with matters of international tax enforcement, it has always demanded reciprocity."
2004.03-725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.968,301.635,"Well, if we don't do view this case as involving some attempt to indirectly enforce Canada's tax laws... suppose we don't view it with that lens... then does that put it outside the so-called revenue--"
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,301.635,327.064,"--Well, if it were not... if it did not serve the function... it doesn't matter what the government's intent is and what is in the mind of the prosecutor, but if it did not have any effect of enforcing a foreign government's revenue rule, then, yes, it would be outside; but there are numerous ways in which this prosecution does enforce a foreign government's revenue rule."
2004.03-725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,377.508,390.511,Is the rationale for the rule that enforcement of taxes is so unpopular that we want to minimize the exposure to... of our judges so that they... the only thing they have to do is enforce taxes that... paid to our own government?
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,392.451,411.687,"--Well, I think there's a certain amount of self-protection in some of the decision... decisions, surely; but the real... the underlying purpose of the revenue rule is a recognition that foreign... that taxes, in general, are a matter of policy."
2004.03-725,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,485.166,496.849,"But if we did... if we did enforce even a tax judgement of another country, there would be no U.S. law that would be violated."
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,517.094,524.691,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, the current restatement is worded in... addresses judgement specifically."
2004.03-725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.003,605.916,"You don't... you don't assert that this... that it... that this couldn't be done, do you?"
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,606.842,607.835,--Not that--
2004.03-725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.835,611.838,--assert that we shouldn't assert that we shouldn't interpret this statute to have done it.
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,611.838,613.158,"--Exactly, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-725,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,636.192,636.564,May I--
2004.03-725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,636.564,639.719,But you would come to that conclusion even if we had a reciprocal enforcement agreement.
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,646.285,655.694,"Correct, Your Honor, because there wouldn't... this statute wouldn't have been written to take that into account."
2004.03-725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,656.249,665.975,"So, in a sense, the revenue position is irrelevant to your... to your secondary or your... or your independent argument on statutory construction."
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,667.666,671.464,--As to just whether an unassessed tax claim--
2004.03-725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,671.464,672.29,Yes.
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,672.29,680.175,"--is property, the revenue rule... the revenue rule adds a boost to it, but there are two... there are two dimensions to the property element."
2004.03-725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,701.64,704.324,"--So tax revenues are not property, in your view."
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,704.324,722.445,"--Once a tax is collected, once the government actually has money in its hands, and if there's a scheme to, let's say, obtain an illegal refund through a tax and... that would be a scheme to deprive a government body of money."
2004.03-725,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,753.281,759.597,"--May I ask you, Ms. Brill, something that puzzled me about this case?"
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,771.736,777.969,"--Justice Ginsburg, there was an indictment that Canada issued against the Petitioners."
2004.03-725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,816.401,823.627,"Presumably, if we punish this person this way, Canada wouldn't... there's no double jeopardy, right?"
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,823.627,824.492,--That's correct.
2004.03-725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.492,830.89,"So we'd be punishing this person for violating Canadian law, and then Canada would punish this person for violating Canadian law."
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,830.89,837.662,"Yes, I haven't looked in detail at the statute of limitations provisions, but that could be the effect."
2004.03-725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,853.099,855.616,"Well, I think the government has an interest in saying,"
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,863.873,870.81,"--And if they want to pass a law that says that, because of the... because there's a domestic--"
2004.03-725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,870.81,876.383,"Well, they... of course, they say that this covers it, and it seems to me that really the... that turns on the definition of ""property""--"
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,876.383,877.331,--Okay.
2004.03-725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,877.331,878.9,--which is an arguable point.
2004.03-725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,878.9,884.39,"What if the... instead of a wire fraud case, it was assault and battery?"
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,901.562,902.777,"No, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.513,909.836,"The only purpose would be just what the purpose is here, they're trying to, you know, facilitate the smuggling operation."
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,909.836,927.297,"--Well, the assault and battery... whatever the assault and battery provisions are, you would be bringing the prosecution solely for that purpose; it does not have any... the effect of applying the assault and battery statute, if there was one--"
2004.03-725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.297,929.238,Interfere with Canadian's collection of their taxes.
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,931.179,936.957,"--Well, I think it... in that case, it would be... it would be far too attenuated to reach that conclusion."
2004.03-725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.609,948.74,Why is that any more attenuated than a conspiracy carried out down here in Maryland using American assets to do the evil deed in Canada?
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,948.74,960.34,"--Well, but the motive of the person performing the assault and battery would be irrelevant to the prosecution as to whether they intended to do the improper touching and, in fact, carried it out."
2004.03-725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,960.34,961.993,"Well, why isn't the motive irrelevant here?"
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,966.08,967.687,The question is whether--
2004.03-725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,967.687,971.774,--any more than in the... in the hypothetical we don't want citizens beaten up on our soil.
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,971.774,980.197,"--Justice Kennedy, the issue is whether... is what Congress had in mind in enacting the wire fraud statute."
2004.03-725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,987.999,989.363,"Well, but it used broad language,"
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,999.477,1011.283,"--The wire... it is... the wire communications may be an interstate or foreign commerce, the word ""any"" modifies"
2004.03-725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1014.021,1021.519,Is this statute applied against people who defraud the United States Government in taxes?
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,1021.519,1029.238,"--Your Honor, the government's position on that, I believe, is somewhat inconsistent."
2004.03-725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1062.924,1069.24,But you don't... you don't know of any prosecutions under this fraud statute for depriving the Federal Government of property.
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,1069.24,1082.986,"--Well, the Henderson case, which we have cited in the reply brief, is one from the Southern District of New York, where Judge Weinfeld said, when faced with a mail fraud prosecution of that type, this is outside the scope of anything that Congress intended."
2004.03-725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1113.655,1116.545,"Ms. Brill, is this the same thing if it were a building fraud?"
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,1130.002,1140.655,"--The statute only applies... what McNally said is, any assistance a governmental body obtains from the statute must be in the capacity of property-holder."
2004.03-725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1252.232,1260.034,"Ms. Brill, in the Court of Appeals, they treated the argument that this was not property as entirely separate from the revenue rule question."
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,1260.034,1263.849,"Well, Your Honor... no, Your Honor, we talked about both in the petition for cert.."
2004.03-725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1268.95,1271.347,"But the question, itself, doesn't refer to the property issue."
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,1271.347,1272.916,--It talks about the--
2004.03-725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.916,1287.072,"Was it... was it phrased the same way it is in your brief, in the petition?"
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,1287.072,1287.61,--Yes.
2004.03-725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1288.065,1288.991,"Well, then the last part of it--"
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,1288.991,1289.613,"--Right, but--"
2004.03-725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1289.613,1290.068,--obviously covers it.
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,1290.068,1291.433,"--Yes, the last part talks about--"
2004.03-725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1291.433,1292.009,"Oh, I see."
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,1293.002,1293.54,"--Yes, okay."
2004.03-725,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1397.194,1418.864,"May I ask you, when... now that we're getting into money, one of the things that the sentencing board had to do was to find out how much of a loss there was, and that involved determining what taxes would be due under Canadian law."
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,1429.161,1431.474,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it very much did."
2004.03-725,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1474.303,1478.307,A judge making that assessment.
2004.03-725,0,34153,laura_w_brill,,1478.307,1484.417,"The judge made the sentence... made the assessment at sentencing, yes."
2004.03-725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1520.454,1523.798,Mr. Dreeben?
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1523.798,1527.347,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-725,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1559.631,1560.374,Where?
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1561.61,1563.651,"--In the United States, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.651,1565.408,"Well, why didn't you prosecute him for that?"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1565.408,1573.582,"That crime depended upon the validity of the wire fraud charges, because the crime was use of a gun during... in relation to this wire fraud scheme."
2004.03-725,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1573.582,1576.349,"But that really doesn't get you anywhere, does it?"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1585.842,1596.988,"Well, what it tells you, Justice Souter, is why the United States has an interest in enforcing a law that facially is written to cover schemes to defraud that are carried out using the United States wires."
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1596.988,1600.127,But that's... but that's a reason for extending the statute to everything.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1601.28,1602.273,"No, Justice Scalia--"
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1602.273,1603.509,"""Property"" can mean anything at all."
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1610.362,1626.338,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I'm starting from the proposition that the language of the wire fraud statute textually applies to this scheme, and Petitioner's argument is that, because of the common law revenue rule, the statute should be read to exclude schemes to defraud a foreign government of tax revenue."
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.872,1661.073,What about evading a Cuban tax law that we think... that many people would think is an unjust tax law?
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1674.076,1682.6,The United States has prosecutorial discretion to determine when to invoke the statute and in what interests it should be served.
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1682.6,1691.971,"It may well, but when it comes here, this Court is going to have to decide... we'll just approve whatever you want to prosecute and let you not prosecute whatever you want?"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1691.971,1698.37,"There is no provision in the statute, Justice Scalia, for this Court to second-guess foreign-policy determinations that are made--"
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1698.37,1699.939,"Well, not just foreign policy."
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1773.189,1776.533,"--Justice Breyer, I don't think there's any reason to assume that everyone becomes a criminal."
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1776.905,1783.842,"No, only people who come over here because they don't want to pay taxes in those countries."
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1787.019,1794.078,"--Justice Breyer, in order to violate the wire fraud statute, you have to use deception in order to deprive another--"
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1794.078,1797.133,"--Yes, they don't tell Lenin that they're coming--"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1797.133,1800.727,"--Well, that wouldn't involve the use of the United States wires--"
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1800.727,1802.046,--and they write to each other.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1805.389,1819.879,"--Justice Breyer, if one stipulates that that violates the wire fraud statute or that there's enough conduct that does, the question still comes down to whether the United States chooses to prosecute that case."
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1820.705,1821.903,So the question comes down to--
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1821.903,1828.218,"The question comes down to whether this statute, which doesn't have to be read that way, ought to be read that way, whether it makes sense to read it that way."
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1830.53,1833.958,--I'm not sure of Canadian tax law.
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1833.958,1835.816,"Well, let's assume--"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1835.816,1837.197,In the context of this case--
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.197,1837.602,--Canada has an income tax.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1846.469,1852.906,--Not for using Canadian facilities to do so.
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.906,1854.27,"No, no, no, from this country."
2004.03-725,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1858.562,1860.131,He files it electronically.
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1860.131,1860.669,Yeah.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1860.669,1866.697,"The wire fraud statute is applicable to schemes to defraud, generally speaking."
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1872.27,1873.179,--reason for it.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1895.676,1902.901,"I don't think this is a realistic problem, Justice Breyer, that should require the court not to read a statute whose language--"
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1902.901,1904.842,"Well, what about the wealth tax in France?"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1904.842,1908.845,--There are a variety of taxing schemes all across the world.
2004.03-725,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1916.07,1920.157,"Mr. Dreeben, at the beginning of your argument, you said there were four federal interests you were going to identify."
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1924.077,1925.563,--The other three are--
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1925.563,1926.018,Second--
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1926.018,1930.826,"--The second one, which I began to allude to before hearing some questions about--"
2004.03-725,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1930.826,1931.857,Before you were asked a brief question.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1931.857,1941.705,--are that people who engage in schemes in this country are capable of then using the same techniques against victims in this country.
2004.03-725,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1969.941,1979.6,"Well, if we're concerned about offending the foreign country, then isn't the way to go, in fact, the way Congress has gone in this area, we negotiate treaties?"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2018.116,2025.668,"Justice Ginsburg, those are tax treaties designed to mutually assist the countries to collect taxes."
2004.03-725,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2043.7,2044.222,One of--
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2044.222,2044.594,--United States.
2004.03-725,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2044.594,2059.454,"--one of... one of the last interests that you mentioned, about offending foreign governments, well, on the face of this, it would seem, the one that... the country that's been done out of taxes is Canada, not the United States."
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2084.596,2087.402,"That's my understanding, as well, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2103.832,2107.714,"--How long has this statute been on the books, this wire fraud statute?"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2108.457,2109.693,1952.
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.06,2118.033,How many prosecutions like this have there been?
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2119.807,2120.922,This--
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.922,2128.641,"For, you know, using the mails or interstate commerce to defraud a foreign government of taxes?"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2128.641,2137.807,--This type of prosecution became more common in the 1980s when Canada greatly increased its taxes on importation of tobacco and alcohol.
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2137.807,2141.688,"More common, or didn't exist at all before the 19... do you know of any case before--"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2141.688,2143.053,"No, I'm not aware of any case before--"
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.053,2143.962,--before the 1980s.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2143.962,2144.334,--That's right.
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2144.334,2149.535,Doesn't that suggest to you that the statute isn't naturally read to cover stuff like that?
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2149.535,2150.361,"No, I think the statute--"
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.361,2151.642,We didn't have smugglers before then?
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2151.642,2157.314,"--No, of course there were smugglers before then, but the statute, on its face, is broad."
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2182.949,2183.692,What's the second reason?
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2183.692,2192.88,--The second reason is the claim that to deprive a foreign government of money by not paying tax revenues is not common law fraud.
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2192.88,2193.13,Okay.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2204.58,2206.149,"Well, Justice Scalia--"
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2206.149,2221.936,"If we... if we are unsure, if it's a close question whether it's property, if it's a close question whether we're enforcing the tax laws of Canada by prosecuting somebody for violating the tax laws of Canada, if that's a closed question, why doesn't the rule of lenity apply?"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2221.936,2231.429,"--Well, if the Court concluded that the question was not susceptible of resolution by resort to the usual tools of statutory construction, then you would apply the rule of lenity."
2004.03-725,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.363,2235.394,But may I ask this question?
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2258.921,2265.57,"--No, it would not, Justice Stevens, and that's because of the precise distinction that I drew in response to Justice Scalia's question."
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2287.134,2291.138,"What about the other reasons underlying it, which is what I was trying to get at before?"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2346.661,2362.758,"Well, Justice Breyer, first of all, the complexity of foreign tax law is something that would defeat a federal prosecution in which we need to show specific intent to defraud if the law were not sufficiently clear for us to be able to meet that burden."
2004.03-725,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2413.906,2437.228,"--To go to one more aspect of the statute which I don't think you've addressed, Congress said that... with respect to the wire fraud and mail fraud and, I think, other things... that restitution to the victim is mandatory, that it's not left up to the government to decide restitution or not."
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2467.609,2488.414,"--Justice Ginsburg, the syllogism doesn't track, because the entire scope of the revenue rule, as defined in the common law cases that can be pointed to as the background principle, has to do with a foreign government, or someone acting on its behalf, coming into this country's courts to enforce its tax rules."
2004.03-725,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2513.284,2516.361,"Now, how could that be, because restitution is to the victim?"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2524.179,2536.961,"--No, there isn't, Justice Ginsburg, but the revenue rule isn't of such a broad scope that it applies to efforts by the United States Government to secure punishment by... for a criminal conviction."
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2574.773,2582.946,"The restitution statute is not ambiguous at all; whereas, this statute has a number of ambiguities in it."
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2621.955,2623.07,--Justice Scalia--
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2623.07,2623.813,--So you have two statutes.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2631.409,2632.335,--There's a difference--
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2632.335,2634.176,"--Obviously, I wiggle out of it with the ambiguous statute."
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2634.176,2638.718,"--there's a difference, Justice Scalia, between an ambiguous statute and a broad statute."
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2667.158,2668.273,What about... what about a scheme--
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2668.273,2672.154,But you haven't told me... you haven't told me how you get out of the restitution statute.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2687.265,2688.934,"--Here is how I get out of it, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-725,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2723.691,2732.757,"Well, that view is in... somewhat in tension with your view that the common law revenue rule doesn't stand in the way of this prosecution."
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2741.218,2747.179,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, there is no common law rule that one country doesn't ""mess with"" another country's taxes."
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2812.467,2826.873,"--Have countries also... just... here, I don't know, in respect to the principle... would it have been viewed as contrary to the principle if a country were to pass a law... say, England were to pass a law saying it is a crime in England not to pay French taxes?"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2843.47,2851.393,"--I think that that's essentially the same question in this case, with the one significant difference that here there is a domestic--"
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2851.393,2852.674,But do you see why I want to characterize it?
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2872.82,2875.808,"--Well, I don't know what scholars would have said about it--"
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2875.808,2876.43,"No, what would you have said?"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2876.43,2877.506,--but this is what I would say about it.
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2877.506,2877.745,Yeah.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2877.745,2893.227,"When you're dealing with the principle that a statute of the United States will not be construed to be in derogation of a common law unless it's clear that that's its purpose, the court should be very careful in defining what the parameters of the common law are."
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.198,2916.716,"We haven't told... no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not telling Congress,"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2921.311,2941.373,"--Well, the only reason you would say that Congress hasn't done it, Justice Scalia, is if you concluded that... and I would ask the Petitioners what their best citations are, because I haven't been able to find them... what cases indicate that a country cannot bring the kind of prosecution that the United States did here to vindicate its own independent sovereign--"
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2941.373,2942.366,Nobody says they can't do it.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2962.361,2964.302,--It would probably be in derogation of a more--
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2964.302,2964.84,That's where--
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2964.84,2965.683,--fundamental principle.
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2965.683,2966.242,--Oh.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2966.242,2967.44,Not the revenue rule--
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2967.44,2967.811,Not the--
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2967.811,2974.787,--but a more fundamental principle that one country usually does not legislate with respect to extraterritorial acts.
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2974.787,2975.863,"--That would be another one, too."
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2975.863,2976.523,But if you--
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2976.523,2978.957,Because the... I... that's why I want to know--
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2978.957,2984.984,"--But that's not applicable here, either, Justice Breyer, because the crime involves wire fraud in the United States."
2004.03-725,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2984.984,2991.483,"Yeah, but why is it ethical, to the extent that there seems to be a mandatory obligation to order restitution?"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3002.984,3015.987,"Justice Souter, again, to say that it's in derogation of the common law principle assumes that the common law principle has applicability to one country seeking to vindicate interests of its--"
2004.03-725,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3015.987,3018.095,"Well, but I... a moment ago, you said,"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3027.754,3035.678,--Because the derogation that I was talking about with respect to Justice Breyer is punishing conduct that occurs entirely extraterritorially.
2004.03-725,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3038.816,3046.535,"Yeah, but the revenue... the revenue rule does not rest simply on the rationale of non-extraterritorial enforcement."
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3074.21,3096.024,"--Well, Justice Souter, I think that the policies underlying the revenue rule are narrower than the ones that you have articulated; but, even more to the point, they are not justifications that found their way into any holdings that would leave a reasonable legislator in 1952, when the wire fraud statute was enacted, to conclude that this is a rule that I'm going to have to specifically--"
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.024,3096.479,"Well, perhaps--"
2004.03-725,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3096.479,3097.017,Well--
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3097.017,3097.472,--I'm sorry.
2004.03-725,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3097.472,3097.722,--Go ahead.
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3097.722,3098.344,"No, no problem."
2004.03-725,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3098.344,3109.611,"I was going to say, perhaps there were no specific holdings, because it would have been regarded as, kind of, a bizarre derogation of the rule in the first place."
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3111.923,3114.64,I was about to say the same... the same thing.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3130.416,3132.085,"--No, but what I would say about--"
2004.03-725,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3132.085,3132.357,No.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3132.357,3138.096,"--the revenue rule is that it is a shrinking principle of the common law, not one that has been growing."
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3203.772,3204.598,--I got your point.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3220.051,3220.573,--That's right.
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3220.573,3221.893,That's been your response throughout.
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3221.893,3222.969,That is correct.
2004.03-725,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3222.969,3223.235,"Okay, I--"
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3223.235,3235.684,What you have instead is a law of the United States that's enacted to serve perfectly valid interests that the United States Government has in rooting out fraud in this country and in dealing with schemes to defraud that are created here.
2004.03-725,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3258.142,3261.364,"Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you... this is such a curious case."
2004.03-725,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3285.817,3305.946,"--I am not aware, Justice Ginsburg, of what specific law enforcement conversations occurred, but I can tell you that there is extensive law enforcement cooperation with Canada, as a close neighbor, and that the interests of the United States very much do favor our policing against smuggling here, and Canada policing against smuggling there."
2004.03-725,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3306.689,3307.72,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2004.03-725,2,34153,laura_w_brill,,3315.234,3315.977,Thank you.
2004.03-725,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3332.611,3334.674,Can I just ask you to tell us what your strongest case is?
2004.03-725,2,34153,laura_w_brill,,3336.698,3337.086,Sure.
2004.03-725,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3446.584,3457.154,"See, he's saying it isn't, for the reason that, he says, that if England did it for independent reasons, it wasn't doing it because it wanted to help France get it's money, that then it wouldn't have been in derogation."
2004.03-725,2,34153,laura_w_brill,,3462.271,3462.521,Right.
2004.03-725,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3480.187,3483.614,"You're saying, in effect, that derogation is an effects test, not an intent test."
2004.03-725,2,34153,laura_w_brill,,3483.614,3485.555,"--Yes, Your Honor."
