1964.18,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,28.201,"Number 18, William Beck, Petitioner, versus Ohio."
1964.18,0,33647,james_r_willis,,31.044,35.03,Mr. Willis.
1964.18,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,35.03,36.812,"Beg your pardon, Mr. Willis?"
1964.18,0,33647,james_r_willis,,39.54,45.628,Mr. Chief Justice and Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.
1964.18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,122.247,135.234,Did the officer testify that the informer also said or also suggested where the defendant would engage in the sense that he --?
1964.18,0,33647,james_r_willis,,135.234,139.146,There's no specific evidence in the record which supports that notion.
1964.18,1,29010,justice_bernnan,,224.28,227.182,Did they search him for something at the police station?
1964.18,2,33647,james_r_willis,,227.182,228.969,Apparently they were looking for something to justify.
1964.18,3,29010,justice_bernnan,,228.969,231.884,Did they book him -- did they book him for anything?
1964.18,4,33647,james_r_willis,,231.884,232.513,Yes.
1964.18,5,29010,justice_bernnan,,237.99,240.739,"So he was not booked until after he was searched, is that it?"
1964.18,6,33647,james_r_willis,,240.739,256.065,It's not clear in the record whether he was but they testified that they ar -- at the time they arrested him and in an answer to his specific question asked by me they said they arrested him by carrying on a scheme of chance which is a felony under the laws of the State of Ohio.
1964.18,7,29010,justice_bernnan,,256.065,260.563,That was at the time they stopped his car that that was the purpose of the arrest then?
1964.18,8,33647,james_r_willis,,260.563,261.595,Yes.
1964.18,9,29010,justice_bernnan,,264.012,270.877,"So this search of - of his person purported to be in any event related to that arrest for felony, is that it?"
1964.18,10,33647,james_r_willis,,270.877,272.327,Yes.
1964.18,11,29010,justice_bernnan,,370.387,371.511,Let's see if I can understand this --
1964.18,12,33647,james_r_willis,,371.511,371.719,Yes.
1964.18,13,29010,justice_bernnan,,371.719,373.845,He's arrested for the felony?
1964.18,14,33647,james_r_willis,,373.845,376.206,According to the testimony (Voice Overlap) yes.
1964.18,15,29010,justice_bernnan,,376.206,382.05,"But after they had searched him they actually prosecuted him only for the misdemeanor possessing the things that they found out, is that it?"
1964.18,16,33647,james_r_willis,,382.05,383.232,That's precisely the point.
1964.18,17,29010,justice_bernnan,,383.232,385.038,And it's that that conviction that we have before the Court?
1964.18,18,33647,james_r_willis,,385.038,392.057,And it's that that conviction that is before this Court.
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,1504.377,1509.602,"May it please the Chief Justice, all of the Justices in the Court."
1964.18,19,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1581.925,1585.775,"Where -- where does that appear, you paraphrase I know, but does that appear?"
1964.18,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1585.775,1588.591,"Now where does that appear, I don't know where it is?"
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,1588.591,1590.817,Number 10 -- page 10.
1964.18,19,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1590.817,1591.524,Page 10.
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,1591.524,1603.044,"Then you'd -- If you begin there about the arrest, “Then you didn't have any arrest that you knew of as far as 1960.”"
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2329.857,2331.013,Mr. McKnight.
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,2331.013,2331.869,Yes --
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2331.869,2336.339,Is this pertinent question [Inaudible]
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,2336.339,2337.576,Yes.
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2337.576,2345.686,Is that the investigation stating that [Inaudible] to the precedent and disclose an -- state an element of the record.
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,2367.041,2417.99,"Well, I will interpret that from the knowledge that has come to me not being assigned to the criminal division and being on the appellate where I just read what happened, but to me it means, that the police officer could not with the fragmentary information that he had, nothing more than time, place, the name of person, and what was to be found, could go to a magistrate and say “I just had a tip and this is what I've been told, and so on information and belief and I believe this information, I wish to make an affidavit and have a warrant issued.”"
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2481.654,2484.098,Is the warrant [Inaudible] self evidence?
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,2484.098,2491.847,I haven't seen a warrant made out to intercept an automobile at a particular point.
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2499.381,2501.03,But an arrest warrant would not?
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,2501.03,2502.675,Arrest warrant wouldn't.
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2502.675,2507.7,But he could gone out and considerably the arrest of the [Inaudible]
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,2507.7,2524.618,"I would say if, and the record is silent on that, if this were something and let me make this kind of analogy, they just said each day plays a separate event."
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2581.742,2591.924,Mr. McKnight I thought perhaps the moot question is that this [Inaudible] by he magistrate.
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,2619.022,2627.256,I think this -- I think that the Sergeant Delajo has furthered and he would have had to go.
1964.18,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2702.99,2707.461,Does that assume the point of making all these information [Inaudible]
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,2707.461,2715.408,"Well, the evidence may now permitted to stand Mr. Justice White but it was true, he found just exactly what he was looking for on Beck, it was true."
1964.18,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2730.709,2734.62,Beck was [Inaudible]
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,2734.62,2745.469,"Well, I think it -- since as I said, the case was tried on the questions that were propounded in support of the motion."
1964.18,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2760.803,2768.525,But the of -- the officer said that they had in mind coming from the familiarity of the [Inaudible] in Beulah.
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,2768.525,2769.49,Yes.
1964.18,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.49,2778.146,Would he say that where he got that idea that be there only asked to see if [Inaudible] informer told him on his behalf.
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,2787.506,2792.378,He -- he said that the informer told him where he would find him.
1964.18,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2792.378,2793.592,Where?
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2804.433,2858.237,[Inaudible] is that correct?
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,2858.237,2863.048,That is correct.
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2863.048,2889.172,Under the arguments is full on the basis on the premise and whether the [Inaudible] and he stopped him and they did infer and [Inaudible] that the police officer on a lot of tips to see [Inaudible] being stopped [Inaudible]
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,2889.172,2897.147,"Well, you see there could be more than one interpretation on making his doubt."
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2969.304,2977.162,"Now -- now what precisely, what do we have in this record that shows that Beck is about to – there is this problem of those who make an arrest."
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3003.007,3003.485,"Well, I would –"
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3003.485,3026.703,Are you arguing -- are you arguing Mr. McKnight that on the basis of a tip without any underlying circumstances to show that the informant so you don't have to [Inaudible] based on these tips that a one time criminal is back in business that the police may pick him up without a warrant.
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3026.703,3040.009,I would say that on the observation of the police as to the manner in which the person who has had a former conviction is acting in his presence.
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3040.009,3043.338,Now what -- what was he -- what does this record show?
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3051.755,3055.302,He was driving along lawfully and they curbed him that's what the record says.
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3055.302,3056.15,Driving –
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3056.15,3064.71,"Lawfully upon the street, 115th Street, when Delajo and the other officers in his car curbed him and he pulled in front of him and drove him to the curb."
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3064.71,3068.903,Do you have a sufficient basis that they [Inaudible]
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3068.903,3072.773,I would say ordinarily not.
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3076.376,3077.462,Why?
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3077.462,3088.677,I would say it because the information that he received as to what would happen at about that time and place did happen.
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3088.677,3090.556,You mean what the search disclosed --
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3090.556,3091.409,"No, no."
1964.18,19,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3091.409,3092.222,That's irrelevant.
1964.18,19,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3092.222,3093.222,No -- no.
1964.18,20,29010,justice_bernnan,,3188.236,3213.916,"Well from what you've told us about the operation of this kind of crime would you contend that there would have been probable cause if all of that had happened, that no informer, that the officer in this particular kind of work as you say is specialist, knowing this fellow who was engaged in it was in an area where he knew that kind of thing was going on and stopped him?"
1964.18,21,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3213.916,3221.459,"No, he'd have to have some information, some probable cause, the probable cause with the information no matter how it came."
1964.18,22,29010,justice_bernnan,,3243.948,3247.122,"Well, our cases are against as to that of course where --"
1964.18,23,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3247.122,3247.402,That's right.
1964.18,24,29010,justice_bernnan,,3247.402,3256.884,"-- the officer says that the informer is one who has given them information before which he found reliable, do we have that here?"
1964.18,25,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3256.884,3259.098,He -- he doesn't say that it is reliable.
1964.18,26,29010,justice_bernnan,,3271.224,3278.114,But why -- why then within our cases you have to satisfy to the requirements of probable cause.
1964.18,27,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3278.114,3280.633,"Well, I think Mr. Justice Brennan --"
1964.18,28,29010,justice_bernnan,,3280.633,3308.142,"And if -- if that you would now on the premise, Mr. McKnight as I understood you to make that it would not be enough without the information from the informant that the crux of this case probable cause is whether this supplies the deficiency when in this instance if you please there's no indication that the informer was a reliable informant in a sense to be defined."
1964.18,29,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3308.142,3320.905,"In my opinion yes, that would be the --actually that he would have to have information from some source but he would not have to divulge the name of the informer --"
1964.18,30,29010,justice_bernnan,,3320.905,3339.286,"Well he might not have to divulge it that I -- I suggest that's probably settled against your adversary in the case where the police officer can say that he had relied on this fellow before and had found him rely -- his information reliable, but that's -- that's missing in this instance."
1964.18,31,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3339.286,3355.418,"Well, I think that it could -- informer whom he had never heard because it could very well had be it, if we're just speculating, his informant could have been someone in the department who is an undercover man and who had –"
1964.18,32,29010,justice_bernnan,,3355.418,3367.731,Well Mr. McKnight you know of any case of ours in which in reliance on an informer we have not consistent that the informer being one upon previously the officer had relied?
1964.18,33,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3367.731,3385.479,"No, but in the cases that I've read from this Court, I think that the language used is where the informer participates in some way in the arrest or had some connection with the commission of the crime where he did more than just give information."
1964.18,34,29010,justice_bernnan,,3405.012,3420.16,Well my point is though in this instance it could well have been that the officer had a hunch that this fellow would be there and if he were there he was going to have policy slips on him as indeed proved that he did.
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3436.564,3472.978,"Well, I don't know that it is particularly any different other than the oath of the officer who didn't make it for the purpose of getting a warrant before a magistrate but on being called into open court and put under oath and query by counsel for the petitioner, remember he was in the Court and he was saying all of these, now, it's just a question whether he was to be believed when counsel suggested that he may have fabricated this because that just become a matter of credibility of the witness."
1964.18,35,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3472.978,3514.452,"Mr. McKnight it may not have been searching here that he had information in the past, but if you read this record and the testimony and saying that the informer called the officer, not only that then he was engaged in this business but if he could be found doing so at a certain spot at a certain time, if you read the record that way like the Ohio Supreme Court did, you did have some kind of confirmation for this information until the fellow found him in that car, which is another way of [Inaudible] of verifying to the reliability of informant."
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3514.452,3515.181,Well I didn't want --
1964.18,35,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3515.181,3523.344,The real question is whether or not of course the question is whether or not that whether you have what the Ohio Supreme Court did --
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3523.344,3529.986,"Well Mr. Justice White I wouldn't want the counsel to think of me as it expresses in his brief, you think for the Court for having done that."
1964.18,35,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3542.889,3550.84,"Mr. McKnight you haven't discussed one phase of the page, why was he searched at the police station?"
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3550.84,3574.534,Mr. Justice Black I said that by reason of the contraband which they expected to find secreted about his person it wouldn't be the policy of a police officer to ask the man to step out of an automobile on the public street and then proceed to search his person to find the contraband.
1964.18,35,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3574.984,3578.053,Now what was he searching for when he went to the police station?
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3578.053,3579.825,Search for number slips.
1964.18,35,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3579.825,3581.24,For what?
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3581.24,3587.331,For these slips that indicated that he was engaging in this gambling game called numbers.
1964.18,35,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3587.331,3591.3,"Have you -- you didn't discuss our case last year of Preston, did you?"
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3591.3,3592.02,No sir.
1964.18,35,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3592.02,3592.832,Have you read it?
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3592.832,3597.528,I don't think I read the Preston brief.
1964.18,35,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3597.528,3620.939,"That's a case where we had to pass on, we assumed that the search and the arrest was valid, probable cause by the Court, car was taken and the man was arrested and after they got him up to the police station, they went out and broke into the car and --"
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3620.939,3622.275,Calif – is that the California case?
1964.18,35,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3622.275,3625.704,Well we held that that was not a search incidental to the arrest.
1964.18,35,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3625.704,3627.051,[Inaudible] Kentucky.
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3627.051,3634.962,"Oh no sir, I was thinking about the Ker case -- no, sir I don't think I read that Mr. Justice Black."
1964.18,35,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3634.962,3642.318,Probably you can distinguish but it has a pretty close relationship to this one and I don't see why you've mentioned it at all?
1964.18,35,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3642.318,3652.832,"Well here you can search him because you're at a public place and a public street and you'd had to take his clothes off, would you not?"
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3652.832,3663.833,"You don't almost have to because again looking to the facts of lies, these number slips have been found on -- on pick up man could secrete it everywhere."
1964.18,35,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3696.92,3698.882,Where did they find them?
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3698.882,3707.437,"They found them in his sock, it was secreted in his sock and that was found when he was over the Fifth Precinct Station on 117 Chester."
1964.18,35,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3707.437,3712.11,Was there any reason for arresting him except the fact that they're intercepting him there?
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3720.015,3722.774,"Well, if there would be routine --"
1964.18,35,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3722.774,3724.414,I see nothing about it in the record.
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3724.414,3738.984,It would be routine if an officer had information and a man had something on his person and it wasn't readily identifiable or discoverable by what we call patting him down.
1964.18,35,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3763.69,3767.272,Well not to make him remove every garment when they put the man in custody.
1964.18,35,45538,william_t_mcknight,,3767.272,3768.828,"They may have taken him into the jail, yes sir."
