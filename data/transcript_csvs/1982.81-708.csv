1982.81-708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.264,We will hear arguments first this morning in City of Port Arthur against United States and others.
1982.81-708,0,39660,robert_q_keith,,10.233,17.465,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,493.351,518.216,"Mr. Keith, may I inquire whether you think that the standard that we should use to measure, a fair reflection of political strength of the blacks in the expanded city, should be measured on the basis of voting age population figures or on general population figures?"
1982.81-708,0,39660,robert_q_keith,,518.216,529.15,"Your Honor, in footnote 22 of the Rome decision the Court stated, respectfully, a preference for the voting age population."
1982.81-708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,533.459,536.02,"We haven't really determined that, have we?"
1982.81-708,0,39660,robert_q_keith,,536.02,537.02,--I think that's fair.
1982.81-708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,537.02,548.907,Is there anything in this record to show whether the general population statistics are a good indicator of future voting age population statistics?
1982.81-708,0,39660,robert_q_keith,,548.907,558.325,The Attorney General's office and the city and the court have all extrapolated this 35 percent number.
1982.81-708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,562.714,574.397,"You may have agreed to that, but is there anything in the record to tell us whether there is some correlation on future voting age population."
1982.81-708,0,39660,robert_q_keith,,574.397,575.63,"--No, Your Honor, there is not."
1982.81-708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,581.049,586.704,Is it your position that we should focus entirely on voting age population figures?
1982.81-708,0,39660,robert_q_keith,,586.704,594.498,"Your Honor, it is my view that that is the best standard if it is a legitimate, demonstrable number."
1982.81-708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,595.637,599.199,Does your argument rest on that premise?
1982.81-708,0,39660,robert_q_keith,,599.199,628.436,"Not at all, because if you take Justice Marshall's footnote in the Beer case and do the mathematics... and these become mathematical cases... our representation of 33 percent minority representation on the council and a 40 percent population, if you take that ratio, that's identical to that which he suggested was appropriate in the New Orleans... in the Beer case in New Orleans."
1982.81-708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,697.893,699.282,Refresh my recollection.
1982.81-708,0,39660,robert_q_keith,,706.889,707.919,"--No, sir, we do not."
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1413.577,1416.123,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1480.8,1483.565,"Mr. Phillips, why doesn't the Beer case control this case?"
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1483.565,1498.356,"Well, largely because the Beer case deals with a situation where there's simply a change in an electoral practice dealing with a pre-existing city and that city remains as it is, whereas--"
1982.81-708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1498.356,1502.62,There's nothing in Beer that limits it to that or says that it isn't applicable to annexations.
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1502.62,1503.292,"--No, clearly not."
1982.81-708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1527.391,1529.968,"City of Richmond antedated Beer, did it not?"
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1529.968,1531.717,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-708,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1592.88,1594.13,Mr. Phillips--
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1594.13,1594.739,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-708,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1594.739,1604.079,"--have you taken into consideration, there is a difference between the way land is annexed in Texas and the way land is annexed in Virginia?"
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1610.06,1611.434,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe so."
1982.81-708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.015,1646.919,Is this a late insight on the behalf of the Attorney General?
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1651.731,1655.229,"No, Your Honor, we would not have been up here under those circumstances."
1982.81-708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.3,1677.986,And now you agree with that?
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1677.986,1680.454,And that judgment we believe is entitled to respect.
1982.81-708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.454,1685.951,"Well, you seem to be agreeing with it; not just entitled to respect."
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1687.81,1702.758,"Well, because it is based on a set of findings that we believe are not clearly erroneous, and once you accept those findings, viewed through the prism of the district court's July 14th order, it seems to me there is no other conclusion that's available at this point."
1982.81-708,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1798.11,1803.468,"Mr. Phillips, do we know what the district court based its decision on?"
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1831.221,1832.55,"--Well, I don't think so."
1982.81-708,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1849.262,1855.806,"So you think notwithstanding the language that the court used, that there was no confusion about what the court was doing?"
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1855.806,1862.991,I don't perceive that any of the litigants disagree with regard to what the effect of the district court's order was and what it was intended to be.
1982.81-708,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1862.991,1873.721,May I ask you also whether it's your position that the Court should look only at voting age population figures?
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1873.721,1874.939,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-708,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1891.198,1894.744,Do you think it's error if the Court looks only at voting age population figures?
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1895.885,1896.041,--If it's error?
1982.81-708,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1896.041,1896.978,Wrong?
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1901.945,1913.066,"Well, the purpose of the Voting Rights Act and the approval of these changes is to determine their future effect, and I would think it would raise serious question if you completely disregarded what might be the potential effect."
1982.81-708,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1991.378,2004.95,"Were you suggesting that in an election at-large that a city with a third of its voters black, that they would have no influence, that neither candidate would pay any attention to obtaining their vote?"
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2004.95,2020.85,"The finding of fact by the district court in its June 12 opinion is exactly to that effect, that in only one or two elections in the 14 years prior to 1977 could it find any evidence to indicate that there might have been a swing vote influence."
1982.81-708,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2020.85,2024.536,Is that typical across the South today?
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2024.536,2026.27,"Well, I would hope not, Your Honor."
1982.81-708,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2060.365,2065.426,Is it the position of the Government that a majority vote is never appropriate?
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2065.426,2067.909,"No, Your Honor, not at all."
1982.81-708,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2069.159,2071.36,"It's the general rule across the United States, isn't it?"
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2071.36,2073.39,"--Yes, Your Honor, I think it is."
1982.81-708,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2081.45,2086.339,"And may I get clear, is purpose still in this case at this level?"
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2086.339,2090.196,"Not in terms of the submission to this Court, no, Your Honor."
1982.81-708,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2090.196,2091.962,So we consider only the effect?
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2091.962,2093.086,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.006,2113.046,"If we reverse, if we reversed the district court on its insistence on the plurality, would there be anything left of the case?"
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2113.046,2125.9,"Well, I don't think the United States' position is that this is infected with an invidious purpose, so I suspect there would be nothing left to litigate, although the intervenors might take a view different from that at this point."
1982.81-708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.9,2137.989,"At least, the district court didn't expressly negative any purpose--"
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2137.989,2153.748,"No, the district court submission... the district court's order seems to indicate rather clearly that if the city were prepared to remove this one objectionable feature that seems to be directly related to the effect of this plan, that it would be satisfactory."
1982.81-708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.779,2162.229,--Does that implicitly negative any invidious purpose?
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2162.229,2167.103,"--Well, not actually, not as a matter of logic I don't think, Your Honor."
1982.81-708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2228.905,2233.262,"May I ask you one question which perhaps isn't directly before us, but I'm curious about."
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2249.82,2250.382,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.382,2254.504,Do you think that holding is consistent with this Court's holding in Rogers against Lucas last year?
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2254.504,2263.969,It is... I hadn't really thought of that.
1982.81-708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2268.015,2271.014,Do you think it's consistent with the Voting Rights Act to have a mixed motive for a change?
1982.81-708,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2271.014,2282.853,"Yes, Your Honor, because the problem is that annexations create unusual problems and therefore you sort of have to examine them as a unique situation, I think."
1982.81-708,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2282.853,2287.382,Mr. Keith.
1982.81-708,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,2287.382,2294.489,"Mr. Justice Stevens, in the very outset of the district court's opinion, they said on page 4A of the opinion:"
1982.81-708,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.592,2313.183,But is it true that all the property annexed was predominantly white?
1982.81-708,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,2313.183,2314.058,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-708,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2315.824,2316.636,"Well, I mean, that is true?"
1982.81-708,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,2316.636,2317.308,--That is true.
1982.81-708,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2317.308,2319.026,That is not invidious?
1982.81-708,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,2319.026,2323.416,The city had already annexed the adjoining black territory.
1982.81-708,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2327.992,2332.896,"Well, were the same number of black and white people annexed?"
1982.81-708,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,2334.427,2335.646,"No, that is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-708,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2335.646,2335.787,That's right.
1982.81-708,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,2336.693,2337.394,That is correct.
1982.81-708,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.394,2339.644,And no problem?
1982.81-708,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,2339.644,2340.91,That is correct.
1982.81-708,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2429.639,2430.998,"Thank you, gentlemen."
