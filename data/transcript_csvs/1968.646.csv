1968.646,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,19.498,"Number 646, James F. O'Callahan, petitioner, versus J. J. Parker, warden."
1968.646,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,20.604,23.416,May it please the Court.
1968.646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,560.997,567.183,You see no escape on the Constitutional issue?
1968.646,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,567.183,568.219,"Well, I don't --"
1968.646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,568.219,569.375,Cite it.
1968.646,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,569.375,570.94,I really see no escape.
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1905.563,1908.577,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.646,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2058.862,2062.206,"But in this case, the civil authorities had him."
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2062.206,2066.745,The civil authorities had him and turned him over to the military police --
1968.646,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2066.745,2066.824,That's right.
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2066.824,2069.55,-- who proceeded with the case.
1968.646,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2069.947,2083.221,"Getting back to the old theory about interfering with the king's peace, how was the United States peace interfered with in the case?"
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2083.221,2095.128,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, I would suggest that the test perhaps should be framed in terms of the Constitution with stops the Government and regulation of the land and naval forces."
1968.646,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2111.134,2122.976,Would your position be -- would your position be the same today if a G.I. shot and killed the governor of Hawaii that Hawaii wouldn't have a chance to try him?
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2122.976,2127.068,"No, well, of course, what I'm saying is that there is an exclusive military jurisdiction."
1968.646,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2131.06,2133.363,"Well, what would the odds be?"
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2135.26,2140.148,"The odds as to what would happen in that, I'm sure the case would be handled by the civilian authorities."
1968.646,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2140.148,2141.815,Why are you sure?
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2141.815,2152.905,"Well, there are -- the policy of the army and of the services is that ordinarily upon request offenders against the civilian laws will be turned over to the civilian authorities."
1968.646,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2153.562,2156.454,"Well, but it has to be a request."
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2156.454,2159.468,Yes but I'm sure there are -- there would be a request in such a case.
1968.646,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2159.468,2167.737,The G.I.-- the G.I.'s constitutional right to a jury trial depends on who makes a request.
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2167.737,2168.037,Yes.
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2254.23,2263.48,"Are there any limitations as you see them on power of Congress under Article I, Section 8, Clause 14?"
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2263.48,2266.577,As for -- you're thinking perhaps of the tax evasion case.
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2266.577,2273.112,"No, I'm just saying generally to -- what is your view of the tax evasion case?"
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2273.112,2278.439,"First of all, I think that there might well be a statutory question there."
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2278.439,2299.281,"Well, that would come I take it that that would might come under the 10 U.S.C. Section 934, all of disorders and neglects of the prejudice of good order and discipline in the Armed Forces or conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces."
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2303.163,2307.964,I'm quite sure that was what it was brought under and not knowing the case.
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2315.003,2317.578,You particularize that and I don't want to --
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2317.578,2317.668,But as --
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2317.668,2344.409,"But I'll tell you to comment on another case but I would like to know whether you think there are any restrictions of congressional power under Article I, Section 8 and if so, what are they because that clause empower of Congress to make rules for the Government in regulation of the land and naval forces."
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2359.743,2364.162,I think it probably does mean that but I think we don't have to go that far in this case.
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2364.162,2365.38,"Well, maybe we do."
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2389.963,2394.645,I think that does have to follow from the broad language that's in the Constitution itself.
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2396.898,2397.595,I understand that.
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2397.595,2398.731,As extreme a case.
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2398.731,2420.347,"I understand that there, alright, but what I'm trying to -- I think you've answered my question, you say that Congress could like any rules, whatever, either one in two, that those rules be and I suppose those rules could be preclusive of civilian authority."
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2420.347,2424.577,"Again, we don't have a preclusion case here."
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2427.15,2440.126,"If you are going to try to confine a discussion here to this particular case, you're going to leave me substantially without your -- the benefit of your assistance."
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2440.126,2453.71,I think I would have to say that if the military or if Congress purported to preclude state jurisdiction over some of these crimes that would certainly be a difficult case.
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2453.71,2454.277,But what does this --
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2454.277,2470.077,"I think the question here, is I think framed and perhaps to my mind, should be restricted to the question whether legislation can as the plaintiff asserts, deprive the individual defendant of his jury right."
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2477.076,2494.05,"Well then, you say that Congress could not under this constitutional provision set up a system of rules that would be preclusive of the civilian authority in some respect."
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2504.726,2515.48,"Well, I do have to confess that I'm troubled and I hate to make a commitment as to the most extreme application that this could be given."
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2517.486,2523.832,Is there any First Amendment limitation upon the power of Congress?
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2523.832,2525.679,Under these articles?
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2542.31,2544.805,So that the First Amendment does restrict this.
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2548.456,2561.641,"As to the right to jury trial, I think it's -- it has been established that the grant to jurisdiction to Congress and the clause 14 is inconsistent with it."
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2561.641,2564.813,How about the right to confrontation of witnesses?
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2564.813,2576.975,"That is a case which in fact has within the last couple of years have risen in the Court of Military Bills, the Court of Military Bill does held that that right does in fact exist."
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2576.975,2579.089,Under the Constitution?
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2579.089,2581.632,Yes.
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2589.028,2592.29,Then I'll ask you one more question then I'm finished.
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2623.884,2623.952,Yeah.
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2623.952,2634.193,That would include for example the power of Congress to make it a crime and not to submit their income tax returns on time.
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2634.193,2646.614,"I think -- I think I would have to say that it would be our position apparently to go that far, though of course, I would say again that I don't think it necessary to go that far to decide this case or really the general problem raised by this case."
1968.646,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2646.614,2653.02,"You and I think, maybe we think definitely because I have to think beyond the limits of the individual case."
1968.646,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2655.543,2668.519,Yes indeed and of course this case does involve a general principle but it does not involve the further most exercised of jurisdiction that might be conceived of.
