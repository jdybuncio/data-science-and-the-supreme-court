2017.16-1348,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.6,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 16-1348, Currier versus Virginia. Mr. Fisher."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,6.6,22.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There's no dispute that if Virginia, like Nevada, required severance under the circumstances here, issue preclusion would be available with respect to the second trial. That much is dictated by Turner versus Arkansas."
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,22.0,22.48,Doesn't it --
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,22.48,23.04,So the only --
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,23.04,23.92,Doesn't -- I'm sorry.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,40.76,44.4,"So my understanding of Nevada law, and just I'm --"
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,44.4,45.0,Yeah --
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,45.0,53.48,"-- without getting into the weeds of exactly what any particular other state law than Virginia requires, but all I'm saying is state law required severance under the circumstances here without --"
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,53.48,54.36,"Well, it requires --"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,54.36,55.08,-- respect to what the parties --
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,55.08,57.2,-- severance unless both parties agree.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,57.2,58.88,"That's what Virginia law says, Your Honor."
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,58.88,59.52,Right.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,59.52,60.04,Right.
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,67.8,71.08,I don't know why that's not the same.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,71.08,71.32,"Oh, I think --"
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,71.32,71.64,Meaning it --
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,71.64,73.44,"We think it is the same, Your Honor."
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,81.8,82.48,That's Turner.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,82.48,83.44,That's Turner.
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,83.44,84.16,All right.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,84.16,84.36,Our case --
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,84.36,85.32,So Turner says that.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,87.04,88.28,I don't think it is.
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,88.28,88.64,Okay.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,88.64,89.32,I don't think it is.
2017.16-1348,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,100.8,101.48,"Well, what to default --"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,101.48,102.04,And we think --
2017.16-1348,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,102.04,112.72,"To sort of bracket this problem, what about a jurisdiction like the U.S. courts, where severance is not required, where there's -- says nothing about severance?"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,112.72,116.56,"I think there's some variance, Your Honor, across the federal courts, but to take your question of one like --"
2017.16-1348,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,116.56,116.88,All right.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,125.0,147.0,"Well, we think the answer there would be the same as well, but I would concede it would be a slightly harder case. But the point -- and there are two distinct reasons why consenting to severance in this situation or even, Justice Alito, in the hypothetical you describe should not waive the right to issue preclusion. First, the issue preclusion is a distinct right from the right against multiple trials."
2017.16-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,153.12,153.56,Mr. Fisher --
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,153.56,154.28,And the second --
2017.16-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,154.28,185.24,"-- is that -- is that distinction, that it's not like claim preclusion, more academic than real? That is, in this case, suppose you're right and there can be no retrial of the breaking and entering or of the theft. What's left? What would a prosecutor -- could a prosecutor realistically put on any case for the felon-in-possession charge?"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,185.24,212.6,"Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, it might be a challenge in this case, but it is certainly not theoretical in every case and not even necessarily in this case, depending on how the state would set out to prove the gun charges in the second trial. And I think this is brought out most clearly in the Wittig opinion that Judge Gorsuch -- then Judge Gorsuch wrote for the Tenth Circuit, and that opinion makes it very clear that what issue preclusion provides is the right, as -- as the court put it there, to be tried in a particular way."
2017.16-1348,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,233.76,238.4,But there is no issue preclusion clause in the Constitution.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,260.56,262.28,"Yes, that's what the Court said in Yeager."
2017.16-1348,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,284.76,299.88,"Yeah, but in Jeffers, the Court held that when the second trial involves the same offense under the Blockburger test and the defendant consents, the second trial can go forward."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,314.32,316.32,"Well, for two reasons, Justice Alito."
2017.16-1348,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,344.12,387.16,"But wouldn't it be odd to say that the defendant in Jeffers has a lesser double jeopardy right when what he is asserting is consistent with what the Double Jeopardy Clause was originally understood to mean, whereas, in a situation like this, what the defendant is asserting is something that was developed by our cases in the modern era but was not what the Double Jeopardy Clause was originally intended to mean. So, when the defendant is asserting the core double jeopardy right and says, I want a second trial, there can be a second trial, but when the defendant is asserting this new elaboration of the right, there can't be a second trial."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,388.64,425.04,"We don't think so, and let me leave aside for the moment the question whether Ashe is true to the original understanding and just distinguish Jeffers in this way: Which is Ashe deals with the inviolacy of acquittals, and that, Justice Alito, is the molten core of the -- of the Double Jeopardy Clause, the right not to be tried again for something of which you've been acquitted. And so what the Court said in Ashe and what Judge Friendly said in Kramer before it was the core of the Double Jeopardy Clause does indeed preclude retrials following acquittals, and to have that guarantee, that historical guarantee, have meaning in modern times, it needs to apply under the circumstances here."
2017.16-1348,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,425.04,425.6,Mr. Fisher --
2017.16-1348,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,425.6,427.6,"Well, what -- go ahead."
2017.16-1348,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,427.6,430.88,"First, you had a second point you wanted to make, and then I have a question."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,430.88,431.08,Thank you.
2017.16-1348,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,431.08,432.64,But I just wanted to hear your second point.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,432.64,433.32,Thank you.
2017.16-1348,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,473.64,482.96,Here -- here's my question: Suppose that in this case the court had made very clear to your client the consequences of agreeing to sever.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,498.52,501.44,"Well, first of all, Justice Kagan, it would not be okay under Virginia law."
2017.16-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,514.08,514.72,Do all parties --
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,514.72,515.52,So what you would --
2017.16-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,515.52,516.0,"Please, continue."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,516.0,519.08,So what you would have there is an unconstitutional conditions question.
2017.16-1348,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,523.92,544.68,"I mean, I guess the -- the reason I ask this is because it seems to me that maybe the problem in this case has to do with the fact that people just don't know what the background rule is, and that we could establish a background rule almost whichever way we establish the background rule and people would then be aware of the consequences going forward when they agree to sever."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,544.68,549.52,"Well, as I said, if you establish the background rule in our favor, I think everything is fine."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,553.48,557.08,"-- if a state were to, you'd have an unconstitutional conditions question there."
2017.16-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,557.08,562.04,Is it clear that under Virginia law there could not be a joint trial?
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,562.04,565.04,"There could be a joint trial, Justice Kennedy, both --"
2017.16-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,565.04,568.56,Is it -- is it clear that severance had to be -- had to be ordered?
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,568.56,581.64,"So the Hackney case, which is cited in the briefs, lays out Virginia law, and what it says is the trial court must sever unless both parties agree to joinder. And here, both parties consented to the default severance procedure."
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,583.72,584.56,"Mr. Fisher, the government --"
2017.16-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,584.56,590.0,But -- but isn't -- isn't -- doesn't that really set up a waiver? Isn't that something like a waiver if he doesn't agree?
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,590.0,611.08,"Well, we don't think -- we don't think simply agreeing to what the state wants to have in the first place, both as a matter of state law and the prosecutor in this case, should saddle the defendant with waiver by conduct. But if you think -- if you're still not persuaded by that, I would give you the two other reasons I gave Justice Alito, which is to say waiver by conduct can be established only by inconsistency of positions."
2017.16-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,645.32,658.56,"Are there any cases where there are bifurcated trials, in other words, the jury -- it's the same jury, but they try the breaking and entering first and the felon-in-possession second, and, if so, would issue preclusion apply there as well?"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,658.56,661.28,So there are no cases from this Court dealing with bifurcation.
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,670.88,697.76,"Mr. Fisher, what would happen in those bifurcated trials where -- it happens routinely in the Second Circuit: Same jury, you try the breaking and entering first or the robbery first, and then you try the felon-in-possession. Would double jeopardy bar the trial of the gun once there's been a conviction on the first charge, on the robbery or the breaking and entering?"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,697.76,700.12,"Not if there's a conviction, Your Honor, but if there's an acquittal."
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,700.12,701.12,Under Jeffers.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,701.12,702.0,Under Jeffers.
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,702.0,708.88,"But what you're saying is if there's not, if there's an acquittal, that issue preclusion would bar the second trial?"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,708.88,709.6,That's right.
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,710.6,710.92,That's Turner?
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,710.92,711.4,That's Turner.
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,715.96,723.76,"By the way, it was the government who went to the defendant and said consent to or agree to the severed trials?"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,723.76,729.88,"So my understanding is, is that during pre-trial proceedings, the government -- or, I'm sorry, the state, the Commonwealth --"
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,729.88,730.28,Yes.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,730.28,736.72,"-- reached out to the defense and said: It looks like we have to sever in this case, do you agree? The defense said yes."
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,739.56,749.96,"And just so we state the default rule clearly, to have a -- to have a joint trial, both parties have to agree; otherwise, law mandates severance?"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,749.96,750.32,Correct.
2017.16-1348,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,751.36,752.12,I thought --
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,752.12,753.04,But if I could return to --
2017.16-1348,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,753.04,761.92,"I thought that under Powell, if you're -- you're convicted on a count that is inconsistent with counts on which you've been acquitted, that that's -- that's still a conviction?"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,761.92,763.12,"That is, Your Honor."
2017.16-1348,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,788.28,791.0,"Just to -- just to pause, why is that?"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,791.0,792.72,"Because it's out of respect for the jury, Your Honor."
2017.16-1348,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,803.52,807.64,So we have respect for the same jury but not for two different ones --
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,807.64,807.84,Well --
2017.16-1348,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,807.84,810.28,-- in the same -- in the same -- under the same indictment?
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,810.28,812.72,"No, but we -- no -- it brings me right back to Yeager."
2017.16-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,840.16,840.44,Suppose you --
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,840.44,841.6,And so really --
2017.16-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,841.6,844.16,Suppose you prevail in this case.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,857.56,860.92,"Justice Kennedy, that's not been the experience in states that have our rule."
2017.16-1348,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,869.88,923.96,"Why? Why? That's -- I mean, that's the part -- the point that was a very practical point. When I'm a judge on the First Circuit, I would say in multiple party, multiple, you know, gang cases and so forth, one of the most common things was a defendant would appeal, either saying it should have been a sever, he should have been severed if he wasn't, or he shouldn't have been if he was, and so forth. Very, very common. And so what was worrying me is that the prosecution, if we -- if we adopt something like you say, and the defendant comes in and says, I want to be severed here at least as to some of the counts, the prosecutor thinks, if I agree to that, I don't know what's going to happen. You know, we'll get some kind of a verdict in this first case."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,979.28,983.48,"Well, as -- as I say, to the extent we have empirical evidence, it -- it -- it supports my position."
2017.16-1348,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,983.68,984.76,Why wouldn't it work out that way?
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,984.76,986.0,Let me tell you two reasons --
2017.16-1348,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,986.0,986.24,Yeah.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,986.24,986.84,-- Justice Breyer.
2017.16-1348,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1028.56,1030.08,But there will be reasons --
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1030.08,1030.68,-- less important crime.
2017.16-1348,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1030.68,1031.12,What I'm worried about --
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1031.12,1031.76,And it would run concurrent.
2017.16-1348,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1031.76,1034.88,I'm worried about other -- that there are other situations.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1050.96,1058.04,"Well, we don't have a problem leaving severance decisions to trial judges according to the various rules across the country."
2017.16-1348,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1059.16,1075.48,"Yeah, I'm not -- that isn't -- I'm just so worried about this prosecutor who now is going to take the government's position against and throw, in a very big trial with 19 defendants, some guy who happened to be on the corner, you know, and the jury isn't going to distinguish among them, and you see where I'm going."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1075.48,1092.6,"Remember, though, Justice Breyer, I don't think prosecutors are going to necessarily act that way because they have an interest in justice just like the defense does. And, secondly, think -- if they play it out in their minds, if they get a conviction in the first case, they're very likely to just drop the second case or, if the second case is also important, the defense at that point --"
2017.16-1348,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1092.6,1092.76,"I see, I see."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1092.76,1095.72,-- is likely to plead because he's already been to trial on roughly the same facts.
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1095.72,1104.48,"Mr. Fisher, don't we have a case that says this issue preclusion is only between the same parties?"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1104.48,1105.52,"Yes, you do, Justice Sotomayor, so I --"
2017.16-1348,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1105.52,1110.0,"And we have a case that says, if another defendant gets an acquittal, that doesn't help you?"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1110.0,1111.0,That's Standefer.
2017.16-1348,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1133.8,1134.56,But do you think the result --
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1134.56,1135.36,When an acquittal happens --
2017.16-1348,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1135.36,1135.6,I'm sorry.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1136.24,1137.32,"Oh, I'll just finish my sentence."
2017.16-1348,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1145.76,1152.6,Is -- is there anything to indicate that the result would be different -- would have been different in Jeffers if the first trial had been an acquittal?
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1152.6,1156.2,"Well, the justice who wrote Jeffers, Justice Blackmun, signed on to Green as --"
2017.16-1348,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1156.2,1156.4,Yeah.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1156.76,1158.76,"-- later on, saying yes, it would have been different."
2017.16-1348,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1158.76,1159.48,He said it later.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1159.48,1159.92,Yeah.
2017.16-1348,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1159.92,1165.36,"But the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't draw a distinction between convictions and -- and acquittals, does it?"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1165.36,1183.44,"Well, in case after case -- I think Scott is the best example I could give you, where Chief Justice Rehnquist went on at great length about how there's a special place for acquittals under the Double Jeopardy Clause and special rules apply to acquittals. Just -- just take, for example, an appeal for -- appeal for sufficiency of the evidence."
2017.16-1348,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1202.0,1203.28,"Well, but not entirely."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1206.8,1210.04,"Well, Bravo-Fernandez, as I said, is a case like Powell."
2017.16-1348,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1211.2,1211.76,"Yeah, I think so."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1211.76,1231.76,"-- when I say acquittal. What I mean by an acquittal is not simply the piece of paper of an acquittal but an acquittal that we can say establishes an issue of ultimate fact against the prosecution. And so, when we have an acquittal like that, which is what we had in Yeager and which was distinguished from the situation in Powell and later distinguished from Bravo-Fernandez, then that acquittal has issue-preclusive effect."
2017.16-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1264.32,1264.52,Suppose --

2017.16-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1264.72,1267.24,I'm still interested in what happens if you prevail.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1273.36,1273.92,Sure.
2017.16-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1282.84,1285.16,Would you do that in a bifurcated trial?
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1285.16,1286.08,Pardon me?
2017.16-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1286.08,1288.24,Would you do that in a bifurcated trial anywhere?
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1288.24,1292.68,"Well, I think you might have a challenge -- if your bifurcation dealt with the same jury --"
2017.16-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1292.68,1293.0,Yes.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1293.0,1301.48,"-- once you got the -- once you got the prior conviction out in front of the jury, I think then you might have a -- you might have a problem under state law in -- in dealing with the prior convictions."
2017.16-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1334.0,1354.32,"Mr. Fisher, the issue preclusion was taken over into the criminal context in Ashe, but it originated in civil cases. Is there any difference between issue preclusion as it would apply in a civil case and in a criminal case?"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1354.32,1357.2,"Well, not for purposes of this case, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.16-1348,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1378.12,1400.96,"Mr. Fisher, are we confident that civil issue preclusion would apply in circumstances like these, where a party consents to a bifurcated trial, or might it be more law of the case where it's more equitable? I know you cite an old Tenth Circuit case suggesting issue preclusion might apply here, but it's -- it's a malleable doctrine even in the civil context."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1409.84,1411.68,"So let me say two things, Justice Gorsuch."

2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1418.16,1419.48,We cited what we found.
2017.16-1348,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1419.48,1419.6,Yeah.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1419.6,1439.24,"The other side I don't think disputes -- you can ask them, but I didn't take them to dispute our -- our representation based on civil law, the civil side of things. And also I'd point you to Judge Friendly's opinion in Kramer, where, on page 917, he surveys older cases from this Court that are civil, and those cases, the Keokuk case is one."
2017.16-1348,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1439.24,1447.44,"But you'd agree in civil cases -- or maybe you wouldn't, tell me if I'm wrong -- that in civil cases it's not a foregone conclusion that issue preclusion would apply in these circumstances."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1454.68,1454.8,"Well, we --"
2017.16-1348,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1454.8,1461.4,-- you'd agree that your research did not prove that this would be obviously precluded even in a -- in a civil matter?
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1461.4,1465.64,"Well -- well, I'll just say our research uncovered limited authority to that effect."
2017.16-1348,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1466.4,1466.68,Fair --
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1466.68,1467.6,-- absolute answer.
2017.16-1348,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1467.6,1468.0,Fair enough.
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1468.12,1471.52,But we think it should apply for all the same reasons we'd be saying here.
2017.16-1348,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1480.72,1481.92,"Well, what do we do about --"
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1481.92,1482.4,-- and that's --
2017.16-1348,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1482.4,1498.0,"What do we do about the fact that claim preclusion in the criminal context isn't as robust, in the criminal context, under Blockburger as it would be in the civil context? We use a transaction test in the civil context and an elements test in the criminal context."
2017.16-1348,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1508.16,1524.0,"Well, I think, Justice Gorsuch, it's perhaps helpful to separate -- separate out the substantive boundaries of the doctrine, whether it be claim preclusion and issue preclusion, from the -- from the question whether they can be waived. And so we leave the substantive boundaries of issue preclusion and, obviously, claim preclusion where we found them."

2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1543.6,1559.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The difficult question presented in this case can be answered by applying the logic of three principles this Court has already embraced. First, when a defendant agrees to have multiple trials, he gives up his right to argue that the later trial is barred based on double jeopardy."
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1559.56,1574.72,"How can you call this an agreement? State law says you're entitled to severance unless both of you consent to joinder. So, under state law, they have an absolute right to severance."
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1577.84,1579.84,"I have three responses, Justice Sotomayor."
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1587.88,1589.52,"Well, that begs -- that begs the question."
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1589.52,1603.4,"But if the Court does go beyond sort of the question presented and look at Virginia law here, the facts in this case, and you can see this in the November 20, 2013, brief in support of the motion in limine, and the record here isn't fulsome on the point, but this is from the defendant himself."
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1612.2,1613.92,It needs to be severed under state law.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1613.92,1617.16,"Well, he could have agreed to go forward to the judge on a trial --"
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1617.16,1619.08,Now that's the question.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1643.84,1644.64,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, it --"
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1644.64,1646.68,He's entitled to a separate trial.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1648.92,1655.24,"Well, so what Virginia has done is confer an extra benefit on criminal defendants in cases like this where they can have the choice --"
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1655.24,1655.36,It's not a --
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1655.36,1656.2,-- of having severance.
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1656.2,1657.6,It's not a benefit; it's a right.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1657.6,1662.32,"Well, it -- it comes from -- it's an interpretation of a state judicial rule of procedure by the court of appeals."
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1669.6,1688.52,"So there's no right to an appeal, but we have said -- no constitutional right to an appeal, you're entitled to it statutorily, but we've said it's unfair, a Hobbesian choice, to force a defendant to give up his right to appeal to retain his double jeopardy rights."
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1688.52,1688.92,"Well, that's --"
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1688.92,1701.72,So why is it not a Hobson's choice to be forced to give up the prejudice of a joint trial in order to retain the double jeopardy rights?
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1701.72,1704.24,"Well, I think Your Honor is talking about Green, the case there."
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1704.24,1704.28,Uh-huh.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1704.28,1714.84,"And so, if we look at Green, what the court there said was you do, in fact, give up your double jeopardy right with respect to the conviction that you appealed. Green just said you don't give up your double jeopardy right with respect to the acquittal that was implicit in that case."
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1714.84,1717.0,"Well, you've already been -- you've already been tried."
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1717.0,1717.68,Right.
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1739.96,1742.68,The state -- the state has made a different determination.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1754.24,1766.08,"Well, what Hackney says ultimately is that the -- the -- Virginia wants to give extra protections to criminal defendants in this context, to allow them to have control over the proceedings, which is what this Court has, generally speaking, looked to."
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1766.08,1771.68,"No, but that's not true, because it gives not just the defendant but the state the right."
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1777.96,1781.84,"Well, there's no suggestion in this case that the state would not have wanted a joint trial."
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1782.8,1785.08,"Well, it went -- it didn't ask for one."
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1790.6,1793.08,That's the representation based on Hackney from the Commonwealth's attorney.
2017.16-1348,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1820.08,1820.24,Can I --
2017.16-1348,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1820.24,1822.28,"Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry."
2017.16-1348,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1822.28,1825.36,"I -- I -- look, it's complicated."
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1863.6,1864.28,"That's right, Justice Breyer."
2017.16-1348,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1864.28,1864.68,Okay.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1881.92,1882.92,That's right.
2017.16-1348,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1882.92,1889.16,And the reason it's right is because this is in a sense allowing a little bit of jury nullification in.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,1968.36,1988.4,"So, Justice Breyer, I think your -- the way you approached the hypothetical is to bracket this case with the issue preclusion cases, Powell, Bravo-Fernandez and Yeager. What we think the right set of cases for the Court to look at in deciding the issue here are the multiple trial right cases where the -- what you -- you don't necessarily look at the acquittal that came up in the middle of the trial. What you ask -- or in the split proceedings here."
2017.16-1348,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2008.88,2008.96,Well --
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2008.96,2009.84,-- of inconsistent verdicts.
2017.16-1348,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2009.84,2023.52,"mean, it's one thing to say, as we've said many times, that when you say I want two trials, that what you've given up is the right to object about two trials."
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2059.92,2080.6,"Well, there is, Justice Kagan, because issue preclusion has to be understood as part of the three core protections under the Double Jeopardy Clause. And so the hypothetical that you spun out there suggests that issue preclusion does serve to bar only evidence in some cases and not necessarily preclude a trial. It's important to note that in none of this Court's cases addressing issue preclusion has that ever been the result."
2017.16-1348,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2080.6,2083.56,"Well, I don't -- I don't understand what that means."
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2106.36,2118.76,"Well, what we would say, Justice Kagan, is that just means issue preclusion doesn't apply at all in that case because, when issue preclusion applies in the criminal context, it serves only to bar the trial. And Dowling really is a good example of this dealing with 404(b) identification evidence."
2017.16-1348,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2120.32,2149.64,"Well, whatever you call it, the point still stands that the defendant is in a position where it's perfectly consistent to say two things: Yes, I would like two trials, and in that second trial, I expect that issue preclusion principles will apply. That's very different from the kind of inconsistency that we've pointed out in the past, where the government can't -- the person can't say on the one hand I want two trials and say on the other hand I don't want two trials."
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2149.64,2172.28,"Well, Justice Kagan, I think we're maybe speaking past each other just a little bit. Let me try again to be a little bit clearer, which is our position is that once the defendant says in the second trial I want to argue issue preclusion, issue preclusion principles would apply to limit the government's theories, that issue preclusion doesn't do that, and that this Court has never held that to be the case. In fact, in the briefing in Ashe, the briefs disclaim that they were ever asking the court for a rule on that fashion."
2017.16-1348,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2188.68,2189.36,Well --
2017.16-1348,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2189.36,2199.96,And the Commonwealth could have proved the second offense without making any reference to the breaking and entering of the residence or the theft of the safe.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2259.08,2261.28,"We think that's exactly right, Justice Alito."
2017.16-1348,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2325.12,2353.56,"Can we -- can we clear up one thing about this case? The Virginia Court of Appeals, which has written the dispositive opinion, thought that overreaching was an ingredient of issue preclusion in criminal cases. I see nothing in our cases that requires overreaching in order to apply issue preclusion."
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2353.56,2360.2,"Justice Ginsburg, we agree that the court of appeals looked at prosecutorial overreach as an important component of the Double Jeopardy Clause."
2017.16-1348,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2387.76,2391.12,It doesn't say the state in the Constitution.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2444.36,2447.12,"Well, that's the question the Court granted certiorari on, Justice Breyer."
2017.16-1348,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2447.12,2447.84,"Which, the second?"
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2447.84,2448.44,The second one --
2017.16-1348,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2448.44,2448.48,Yeah.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2448.48,2451.24,"-- about whether or not, when a defendant consents to sequential trials --"
2017.16-1348,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2451.24,2451.44,Yes.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2451.44,2452.68,-- does that forego their right --
2017.16-1348,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2452.68,2452.88,Yeah.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2455.36,2455.56,I --
2017.16-1348,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.56,2456.24,-- in your opinion?
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2456.24,2458.2,That's the easiest way to resolve this case.
2017.16-1348,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2458.2,2458.32,Yeah.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2458.32,2470.4,And we think that the best -- the clearest articulation of the rule that underlies a lot of this Court's double jeopardy precedent is that what the Court wants is for the defendant to have as much control as possible over the way the course of proceedings will play out.
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2477.24,2484.32,"How about if he had stood up and simply said: Do you agree? You say: Judge, that's what the law says."
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2484.32,2489.56,"Our position, Justice Sotomayor, would be if he doesn't object to it, then that is the same thing."
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2491.08,2491.32,All right.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2495.04,2495.36,"Well, he has --"
2017.16-1348,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2495.36,2505.12,-- to maintain his -- he has to go to trial and suffer the prejudice to be able to retain his double jeopardy claims?
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2505.12,2510.12,"To argue issue preclusion here and to not have this waiver argument, he would have to want to go to a joint trial."
2017.16-1348,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2634.44,2636.16,But that would -- that would be left over for remand.
2017.16-1348,1,62908,matthew_r_mcguire,,2645.72,2653.44,"That's the question the Court granted certiorari on, Justice Ginsburg, but we understood the Court's precedent to mean that we can argue -- argue for an alternative basis for affirmance."
2017.16-1348,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2667.36,2679.64,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ross."
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,2679.64,2706.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Double Jeopardy Clause provides defendants with a right against multiple trials for the same offense, but it does not protect a defendant from the consequences of his voluntary litigation choices. Whereas here, a defendant agrees to multiple trials on different charges in order to obtain a benefit, he cannot thereafter argue that his charges are, in fact, one offense for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause."
2017.16-1348,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2706.4,2713.68,"Well, Ms. Ross, why not make sure that it actually is the defendant's choice? I mean, if it were, that would be one thing."
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,2735.08,2766.76,"So I think that's not the best way to think about this kind of problem, Your Honor, because the -- this Court's cases do not generally think about the double jeopardy right in those terms. So, in Dinitz, for example, this Court specifically held that a defendant's claim that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to have a double jeopardy claim was not for -- was not the right way to think about that issue because, in fact, the Court sort of presupposes that in these circumstances these are litigation decisions that may be difficult that may be made sort of in --"
2017.16-1348,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2766.76,2792.16,"But your argument is all about voluntary choices on the part of the defendant, and you're essentially arguing a kind of waiver by conduct. And what I'm suggesting is if this is -- you know, if this -- if the way to think about this case is what is the defendant giving up when he agrees to a severance, then the obvious answer is: Tell the defendant what the consequences are, and ask him whether he's willing to suffer them."
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,2792.16,2795.0,"Your Honor, that might be one way to deal with the problem."
2017.16-1348,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2898.2,2935.12,"Well, but maybe the defendant understands that we in our Double Jeopardy Clause have -- have emphasized pretty strongly the value of acquittals, and that acquittals mean something in our system, and they preclude the government from doing certain things that are inconsistent with those acquittals. So I guess -- I guess I don't -- don't understand why, in the absence of a colloquy, and given the backdrop of double jeopardy law that focuses so much on not doing anything that's inconsistent with acquittals, the defendant would, of course, know that he was giving up his right to issue preclusion?"
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,2935.12,2935.6,"Right, Your Honor."
2017.16-1348,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2968.32,2968.72,"Well, but --"
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,2968.72,2969.2,-- multiple offenses.
2017.16-1348,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2969.2,2991.0,"-- then you're saying, when you say the Double Jeopardy Clause protects multiple trials for the same offense, that's one thing that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects. And another thing that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects -- and this is the difference between the claim preclusion aspect of it and the issue preclusion aspect of it -- is the preservation of acquittals. And that's what is involved in this case."
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,2991.0,3005.04,"So, Your Honor, I would just note that the way that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects acquittals is in two specific ways, and we lay this out in our papers. On the one hand, as everyone agrees here, following an acquittal, a defendant cannot be tried again."
2017.16-1348,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3035.88,3045.8,"I'm sorry, what's technically distinct about having committed a robbery against two people? If you rob each person, those are distinct crimes."
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,3045.8,3047.56,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2017.16-1348,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3047.56,3064.64,"But we don't permit you to try a person for robbing one person and then try the second crime, which is not technically distinct, it's distinct completely, there are different people involved."
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,3069.8,3070.36,That's correct --
2017.16-1348,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3070.36,3071.44,If you've been acquitted.
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,3071.44,3072.96,"That's correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2017.16-1348,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3102.28,3102.96,But they wouldn't be --
2017.16-1348,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3102.96,3103.76,That's claim preclusion.
2017.16-1348,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3103.76,3114.12,"They wouldn't be the same offense, the claim preclusion first, in the Ashe case, multiple victims."
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,3129.84,3133.12,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.16-1348,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3143.28,3143.52,Okay.
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,3153.84,3154.52,Yes.
2017.16-1348,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3154.52,3157.16,Defense in the first case was I was in Chicago at the time.
2017.16-1348,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3208.52,3208.92,Okay.
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,3209.68,3211.0,"Yes, Justice Breyer, I do."
2017.16-1348,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3211.0,3222.44,"You get the point. He's waiving a constitutional right and, therefore, why shouldn't it be express? And that's -- that is where I think I stop because I want to know your answer."
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,3222.44,3240.64,"Certainly, Justice Breyer. So my answer is that the same argument could have been made and I think, in fact, was made in Jeffers, that essentially in Jeffers the defendant said: I want to be tried separately. And then later he said: Well, actually, this is a lesser included offense in a greater offense, and that under this Court's precedent, now means that I was actually charged with one offense."
2017.16-1348,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3270.52,3279.16,What would have happened here if the defendant got up and said Virginia law requires separate trials.
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,3291.24,3292.04,"May I answer, Your Honor?"
2017.16-1348,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3292.04,3292.56,Sure.
2017.16-1348,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,3292.56,3314.16,"So, if the defendant says I will not waive and I want separate trials, I think then the prosecution and the court would have to decide sort of what -- what happens going forward. And the prosecution in that case would have every reason to oppose severance, as I think -- as I think that states and prosecutors might well do going forward if -- if this case comes out that way."
2017.16-1348,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3314.64,3317.08,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Fisher."
2017.16-1348,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3317.08,3319.56,Thank you.
2017.16-1348,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3369.88,3376.08,But could the -- could the Commonwealth have proven the second charge the way that I suggested during the prior argument --
2017.16-1348,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3376.08,3376.76,I think perhaps --
2017.16-1348,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3376.76,3378.92,-- by making no reference to the breaking and entering or the larceny --
2017.16-1348,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3378.92,3380.52,"I think perhaps yes, Justice Alito."
2017.16-1348,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3398.6,3399.12,"Well, why would it not --"
2017.16-1348,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3399.12,3399.6,But in general --
2017.16-1348,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3399.6,3402.52,-- why would it not? It proves all the elements of the offense.
2017.16-1348,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3402.52,3429.08,"Well, the way the jury instructions were laid out in the -- in the -- in the case, it said participate in some way in the crimes of breaking and entering and the theft. And so whether handling the guns down by the river later would be participating in some way in that would be an argument the parties could have. But the crucial point, Justice Alito, and my crucial point to the whole Court, is that issue preclusion does not necessarily bar a second trial. And the other side doesn't dispute that the test is inconsistency."
2017.16-1348,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3435.12,3444.4,"I think what you just said, I don't want to belabor the point, but it does seem to me inconsistent with the Second Circuit's opinion in Kramer that you relied on pretty heavily."
2017.16-1348,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3444.4,3447.84,I'll just say not at all. I just would urge the Court to reread that opinion.
2017.16-1348,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3449.64,3450.24,"No, I read it."
2017.16-1348,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3450.24,3450.84,They sent it back down --
2017.16-1348,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3450.84,3457.36,But you could have -- they could have proven the -- the -- the second offense without making any reference to what had happened in the other -- in the other offense.
2017.16-1348,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3457.36,3464.96,Which is why Judge Friendly does not bar a second trial and sends certain cases back for retrial with the government simply not being able to introduce certain evidence --
2017.16-1348,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3464.96,3466.52,"Mr. Fisher, what's your second point?"
2017.16-1348,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3466.52,3467.12,Thank you.
2017.16-1348,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3468.0,3485.68,"My -- my second point is that the other thing that, particularly the Solicitor General, the argument they make, is that the government has a right, so to speak, to try all of its counts at once, just like in Powell. And so my answer to that is that argument simply is exactly the same argument the Court rejected in Yeager."
2017.16-1348,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3576.28,3577.8,"Thank you, counsel."
