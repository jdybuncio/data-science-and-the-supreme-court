1972.30_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.528,"Mr. Keeley, you may proceed whenever you’re ready."
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,7.528,14.791,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.30_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,91.4,92.178,Mr. Keeley.
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,92.178,93.128,"Yes, sir?"
1972.30_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,93.808,107.385,Could you tell us what page on the -- would it be Page 15?
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,107.385,117.131,"Yes, Page 15."
1972.30_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,169.454,177.725,"Mr. Keeley, will you somewhat enlighten me as to why this case is very important to the State of Michigan?"
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,192.5,213.261,"No, I think the rules in that this case began, Your Honor, is because there was oil and gas believed to have been underneath this water and additionally there have been some other mineral developments that are not in the record at all but are important to both states."
1972.30_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,213.261,228.079,"I see, well that’s -- it just hadn’t come clear to me and I wondered what was all about."
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,228.079,259.295,"When the Special Master made his relocation of the north cape of the Maumee Bay, he did not determine pursuant to the statute of 1836, that’s June 15, 1836, but he relied on the survey by Engineer Gannet when there was a joint commission between -- provided by these two states to survey the land boundary."
1972.30_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,345.809,355.377,The indispensable adequacy of the Congress drew the line that you say that drew in 1836 West Sister Island would be in Michigan.
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,358.038,359.258,What island would be in Michigan?
1972.30_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,359.258,368.957,"West Sister Island, that’s what the Master said."
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,368.957,375.297,I am not aware that he did say that Mr. Justice.
1972.30_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,375.297,378.601,"Well, I get the page for it."
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,383.684,384.587,Okay.
1972.30_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,393.403,394.972,Did he say bizarre?
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,394.972,411.793,"I believe it’s on Page 29 of his report that the statute of 1836, June 15th of 1836 is clear and unambiguous."
1972.30_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,547.948,566.969,"Well, I thought that that’s the only way the that the Special Master used it and what he did was to use the old lighthouse, which was located on Turtle Island within a very small margin of era, and he reversed the northeast course backwardly."
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,575.866,576.28,He referred to --
1972.30_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,576.28,578.09,Through the old lighthouse?
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,578.09,578.668,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.30_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,578.668,579.78,That’s the way I understood it.
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,579.78,594.715,"But as far as the statute creating the boundary line is concerned, that only relocates the north cape of the Maumee Bay and has nothing to do with the -- from the north cape of the Maumee Bay."
1972.30_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,597.135,599.308,"Well, the reference is to a northeast course, isn’t it?"
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,599.308,599.948,"Northeast course, yes."
1972.30_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,599.948,610.786,"And northeast means 45 degrees, so the Special Master held and your claim is that it means generally northeastwardly following the previous line, isn’t that it?"
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,610.786,611.905,That’s correct.
1972.30_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,611.905,617.876,"Which would be just a couple of degrees north of east, isn’t that right?"
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,617.876,618.463,That’s correct.
1972.30_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,618.463,620.334,Right.
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,620.334,630.044,And he maintains that further on the grounds that the case is -- that the statute is clear and unambiguous.
1972.30_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,630.044,643.393,"Counsel, in the circumstances of a disagreement of this kind, do you think there is any perfect way to achieve a perfect solution?"
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,643.393,651.517,"I would think there is any perfect way to achieve anything except I think you can follow the statute and if you want to call that as a perfect remedy, that’s --"
1972.30_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,651.517,659.095,"Well, I am talking now about the physical factors, not statutory interpretation."
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,661.194,661.969,Yes.
1972.30_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,661.969,670.658,"-- if you have this kind of a boundary problem, isn’t it a matter of doing the best you can with what you have to work?"
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,670.658,676.403,"Yes, I see what you mean Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.30_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,719.269,721.327,Perpendicular to what Mr. Keeley?
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,721.327,723.264,Perpendicular to the Bay.
1972.30_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,732.084,734.977,Do you mean a line across the mouth of the Bay?
1972.30_orig,0,19350,charles_f_keeley,,734.977,735.619,That’s right.
1972.30_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,774.987,778.083,Very well.
1972.30_orig,1,19915,charles_s_rawlings,,784.638,789.026,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.30_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,974.63,980.162,Why did it take until mid 1950 to have that survey made?
1972.30_orig,1,19915,charles_s_rawlings,,980.162,989.435,"Apparently -- well, of course the dispute between the two states was settled in 1836 by virtue of the enabling legislation."
1972.30_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1059.098,1074.227,"This dispute, this general dispute, has a long, long history doesn’t it Mr. Rawlings and back to the so-called War of Toledo when each troops from Michigan and troops from Ohio were well on their way to a confrontation over this boundary dispute?"
1972.30_orig,1,19915,charles_s_rawlings,,1074.227,1075.784,"Yes, it does Mr. Justice Stewart."
1972.30_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1103.792,1113.154,"It was a strange to say the least starting point, the southern extremity of Lake Michigan for a boundary between Ohio and the State of Michigan."
1972.30_orig,1,19915,charles_s_rawlings,,1113.154,1132.591,"Yes, although when one considers that Ohio and Michigan are part of the five states carved out of the Northwest Territory and further considers that at that point in time, Lake Michigan was perhaps the only known physical feature of that area, which could be located other than the Ohio River on the south and the Pennsylvania line on the east."
1972.30_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1194.101,1213.208,"Mr. Rawlings, would Congress have had any reason to think that a line between the southern tip of Lake Michigan and the north cape of Maumee Bay would have been an east-west line as opposed to perhaps a more northeasterly line than it turned out to be?"
1972.30_orig,1,19915,charles_s_rawlings,,1213.208,1214.482,"I don’t believe so, Your Honor."
1972.30_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1235.482,1239.623,"Well, and then you say that the Congress knew this in 1836?"
1972.30_orig,1,19915,charles_s_rawlings,,1239.623,1248.9,I believe in 1836 Congress knew the physical fact of the southern extremity of Lake Michigan much better than they had realized it prior to that time.
1972.30_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1266.984,1280.621,"Well, if they knew that the line were northeast, doesn’t that give some plausibility to Michigan’s contention that when it speaks of the northeast projection out into the lake that they meant simply a continuation of the land boundary?"
1972.30_orig,1,19915,charles_s_rawlings,,1280.621,1295.512,"I don’t believe so, Your Honor, because the due east line which was striven for by the territory or Michigan, up until the enactment of the 1836 legislation, was rejected by the Congress of the United States."
1972.30_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1920.415,1920.915,When was that?
1972.30_orig,1,19915,charles_s_rawlings,,1922.332,1926.57,"Yes, the Ohio General Assembly passed their resolution in 1933."
1972.30_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1926.57,1929.952,And it was done with the prospect that Michigan would pass a concurrent resolution but not --
1972.30_orig,1,19915,charles_s_rawlings,,1929.952,1934.993,"Yes, specifically stated in the 1933 Resolution as the hope that Michigan would pass a like resolution."
1972.30_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1934.993,1936.688,Right and Michigan did so.
1972.30_orig,1,19915,charles_s_rawlings,,1936.688,1940.353,They did in 1945 identical to that of Ohio.
1972.30_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1945.584,1946.243,Right.
1972.30_orig,1,19915,charles_s_rawlings,,1946.243,1949.139,-- the filing of this litigation.
1972.30_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2002.787,2005.464,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Keeley?"
1972.30_orig,2,19350,charles_f_keeley,,2005.464,2006.975,"I have nothing, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.30_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2006.975,2007.56,Very well.
