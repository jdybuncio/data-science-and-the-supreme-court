1987.85-1765,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,76.75,"Mr. Olson, you may begin whenever you are ready."
1987.85-1765,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,76.75,80.785,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.85-1765,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,128.616,131.801,"Now, is the validity of that penalty before us, Mr. Olson?"
1987.85-1765,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,131.801,132.401,Yes.
1987.85-1765,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,139.573,140.856,"Well, your emphasis is on the punitive damage."
1987.85-1765,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,140.856,142.192,"--Yes, that is correct."
1987.85-1765,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,142.192,143.842,"But you are arguing the penalty, also?"
1987.85-1765,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,143.842,144.525,"Yes, we are."
1987.85-1765,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,144.525,145.227,Thank you.
1987.85-1765,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,145.227,155.083,"Because the punitive damage issue is a logical antecedent to the question raised by the appeal penalty, because we regard punitive damage as the central issue in this case."
1987.85-1765,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,155.083,162.772,"We don't reach the appeal penalty, because if we were to reverse on the other point, you would have won the appeal and you wouldn't pay the penalty, right?"
1987.85-1765,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,162.772,163.139,Exactly.
1987.85-1765,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.212,180.483,"Mr. Olson, are you arguing the punitive damages question on the basis of a due process argument as well, or just Eighth Amendment?"
1987.85-1765,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,180.483,185.519,We are arguing both on the basis of a due process clause objection and on the Eighth Amendment.
1987.85-1765,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.519,191.673,"Was the Eighth Amendment argument ever raised in the state courts, Mr. Olson?"
1987.85-1765,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,191.673,202.897,"On a petition for rehearing, in the Mississippi Supreme Court, which this Court has held is an appropriate and not untimely point at which to raise such an issue, the--"
1987.85-1765,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,202.897,205.266,"Well, it depends."
1987.85-1765,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,216.991,227.714,"--We submit that, and perhaps we are misreading this Court's decision in Hathorn v. Lovorn, but that this Court held that it is not untimely."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1596.623,1611.465,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.85-1765,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1685.68,1695.469,"Well, there were many states that did not have them until very recently, and states larger than Mississippi got along pretty well."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1695.469,1699.357,"Justice Blackmun, that is entirely correct, and I am not suggesting Mississippi cannot get along."
1987.85-1765,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1714.747,1717.716,"But that again is routine, really."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1717.716,1725.804,"Well, Your Honor, it may be routine, but I do not think it is routine in most states for there to be the backlog of appeals there is in Mississippi."
1987.85-1765,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1830.139,1830.991,Mr. Ennis.
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1835.643,1838.145,"Yes, Justice Brennan, there are other states."
1987.85-1765,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1859.225,1860.177,May I have that again?
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1860.177,1861.26,Yes.
1987.85-1765,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1872.568,1881.424,"Some of those states you mentioned, at least presently, I don't know what may have been the case when they enacted this statute, presently they have intermediate appellate courts."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1881.424,1883.441,"Yes, that is correct, Justice Brennan."
1987.85-1765,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1921.649,1927.821,"There is a post-judgment interest statute, is there not?"
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1927.821,1928.921,"There is, Justice O'Connor?"
1987.85-1765,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1928.921,1929.537,In Mississippi?
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1929.537,1937.777,"There is simple 8 percent interest, and we are not claiming that this statute is needed to further that desire to get interest on the judgment."
1987.85-1765,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.829,1972.35,Isn't the second really the same as the first?
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1972.35,1975.385,"They are certainly similar, Justice White."
1987.85-1765,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1975.385,1982.039,"Well, it is just supposed to make the Appellant take a second look."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1982.039,1986.943,All of these are designed to make the Appellant take a second look.
1987.85-1765,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1987.56,1989.743,And see what his hole card is.
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1989.743,1990.612,That's correct.
1987.85-1765,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2275.713,2281.367,Do you take the position that no due process claim was raised below?
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2281.367,2284.469,"No, I do not, Justice O'Connor."
1987.85-1765,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2315.19,2331.534,"Suppose Mississippi had a rule that was just as expressed as it could be, that it shall be no barrier to our consideration of the claim if you wait until petition for rehearing to raise it."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2358.886,2360.336,"No, I do not, Justice White."
1987.85-1765,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2361.369,2364.271,"Well, how about, what do you make out of Hathorn?"
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2364.271,2366.14,I understand Hathorn.
1987.85-1765,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.947,2428.33,Of the due process claim?
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2428.33,2429.197,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.85-1765,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2429.197,2435.969,"Because after all, it takes the Due Process Clause to apply the Eighth Amendment anyway."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2435.969,2443.457,"Your Honor, as I will show in a moment, they did not even apply, they did not even make a due process challenge to the size of this judgment in the Mississippi Supreme Court."
1987.85-1765,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2443.457,2450.127,"My transcript of the last sentence of their brief is this, in the Supreme Court of Mississippi, about the punitive damages."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2459.668,2461.518,"Justice Rehnquist, it is."
1987.85-1765,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2479.296,2489.688,"Well, if something can be raised on rehearing, that is all you have to rely on, because you don't have oral argument on most petitions for rehearing."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2489.688,2497.543,"You can look to the Petition for Rehearing itself, which is on Page 138(a) of the Appendix to the Jurisdictional Statement."
1987.85-1765,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.063,2611.8,Let me direct your attention to Page 135(a) of the jurisdiction statement.
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2653.81,2667.153,"Your Honor, it is the clearest possible raising of a due process challenge, and that is a challenge not to the size of this award, but to any punitive damage award, because the defendant cannot know in advance how large it will be."
1987.85-1765,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2667.153,2668.755,"Any unrestricted one, without a limitation on it?"
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2668.755,2669.205,Any unrestricted one.
1987.85-1765,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2676.325,2680.111,I asked counsel whether he was making that and his response was yes.
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2680.111,2686.031,"They may be making it, Your Honor, but as you noted in response to that question, they don't seem to have spent much time on it in their briefs."
1987.85-1765,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2727.508,2749.79,"Mr. Ennis, to get to the substance of some of these questions, on the due process issue, would you think that it would be a valid criminal statute to say that anyone who commits a particular offense shall be subject to a fine in whatever amount shall be determined by the jury that tries him?"
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2753.092,2762.598,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that there would be very serious problems under the Due Process Clause for a truly criminal case, for that kind of an award."
1987.85-1765,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2769.871,2773.489,What are they limited by?
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2773.489,2776.858,The common law restrictions that did apply to amercements were applied.
1987.85-1765,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.098,2814.25,I'm not interested in that for the moment.
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2826.74,2834.063,"It's not an indeterminate amount, because there are limitations on punitive damage awards, that they not shock the conscience of the Court."
1987.85-1765,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2834.063,2837.515,"That is a limitation, that it not shock the conscience of the Court?"
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2847.471,2852.108,"Justice Scalia, this test, the ""shock the conscience test"", has been fleshed out more than that."
1987.85-1765,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2871.669,2887.281,"What does that mean, if $1,600,000.00 is not disproportionate, as you say it isn't, and as your Court said it wasn't, to a failure to pay a much lesser claim, insurance claim?"
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2887.281,2896.22,"Because it is not whether it's disproportionate to the financial injury to the plaintiff, it is whether it is disproportionate to the nature of the offense."
1987.85-1765,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2904.29,2908.527,I don't understand what you are saying.
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2918.817,2921.335,"It would depend upon the nature of the offense, Your Honor."
1987.85-1765,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2921.335,2925.037,"Well, suppose it was what Bankers Life was worth?"
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2925.037,2928.858,That would be excessive under the common law.
1987.85-1765,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2928.858,2932.56,Suppose it was one dollar less.
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2932.56,2934.01,It would still be excessive.
1987.85-1765,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2934.01,2936.362,What would not be excessive?
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2936.362,2939.314,"Well, let me try and answer that, Justice Marshall."
1987.85-1765,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2949.688,2952.306,And that's it?
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2952.306,2954.806,"Well, that was the limitation at common law."
1987.85-1765,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2954.806,2955.758,And that's it?
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2957.275,2958.794,There are two.
1987.85-1765,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2970.352,2974.97,"Bankers Life is a corporation, it's not an individual."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2974.97,2975.756,That is correct.
1987.85-1765,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2975.756,2980.558,So Bankers Life doesn't have any livelihood.
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2985.027,2996.919,"If the punitive damage award had been so large as to in effect force Bankers Life out of business, that would have violated the common law standards reviewing courts apply in reviewing punitive damage awards."
1987.85-1765,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2996.919,3006.191,"Even if it only had $50.00 left in the till and the jury hits it with a $50.00 punitive damage, which tilts it over into bankruptcy, $50.00 would be too much?"
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3006.191,3009.91,Any amount would be too much if it deprived them of their means of livelihood.
1987.85-1765,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3032.092,3044.316,"So the tests are, not shock the judicial conscience, not deprive of means of livelihood and thirdly, not be excessive in relation to the offense, whatever that means."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3044.316,3047.102,Those are the principal tests used by the common law.
1987.85-1765,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3061.176,3065.146,Criminal statute that had those three tests.
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3081.823,3086.477,"Your Honor, that would be a much more difficult question than the question before this Court."
1987.85-1765,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.862,3092.297,"I would, too, and I don't see very much difference if you call it civil or criminal."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3092.297,3104.105,"Well, this Court has perceived a very important difference between calling things civil and calling them criminal, in a long line of cases, including several very recent cases."
1987.85-1765,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3104.105,3107.99,"Of course, this case is a very convenient one for a Mississippi jury."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3127.804,3132.458,"Your Honor, the jury did not run wild in this case."
1987.85-1765,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3228.252,3233.739,"Would you agree that punitive damages are quasi-criminal, at least?"
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3233.739,3241.327,"Your Honor, I would not personally characterize them as quasi-criminal, but even if they were quasi-criminal, that does not mean they are criminal."
1987.85-1765,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3277.102,3289.326,"Yes, but in a due process challenge, at least those have been determined by legislative branches to be appropriate and they would perhaps survive a due process challenge, wouldn't you think?"
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3289.326,3290.743,"Let me respond to that, Justice O'Connor."
1987.85-1765,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3311.323,3320.429,"One legislative judgment, Mr. Ennis, one legislative judgment that the Due Process Clause does not defer to is the legislative judgment not to make a legislative judgment."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3374.599,3382.253,"There was a bill pushed by the insurance industry in the 1986 legislative session, which got out of committee, went to the floor of the Mississippi Legislature."
1987.85-1765,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3400.131,3401.666,"Thank you, Mr. Ennis."
1987.85-1765,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3401.666,3402.616,Thank you.
1987.85-1765,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3402.616,3404.535,"Mr. Olson, you have four minutes remaining."
1987.85-1765,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3404.535,3408.237,I will be brief.
1987.85-1765,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3438.856,3442.676,Are you suggesting that it was deliberating all of those four years?
1987.85-1765,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3442.676,3445.445,I have no way of knowing.
1987.85-1765,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3631.834,3635.035,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
