1989.88-1951,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1951, United States v. Frances Dalm."
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,29.685,30.002,Yes.
1989.88-1951,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,30.002,30.769,Good.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,32.169,36.387,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1951,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,145.175,149.044,Do you know why there was no gift tax return filed that year?
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,149.044,152.579,The record does not reflect that.
1989.88-1951,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,152.579,155.781,Maybe I should ask your opponent.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,155.781,157.547,"Yes, you could."
1989.88-1951,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.547,173.743,"In theory, if the government later decides that income tax was owing on it, that it wasn't a gift, should the government give credit for the gift tax that was paid?"
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,173.743,175.926,The government will give credit.
1989.88-1951,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.028,209.694,And there was some settlement here?
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,209.694,211.163,There was a settlement in this case.
1989.88-1951,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.763,215.848,Did that give credit in the settlement for the gift tax?
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,215.848,222.954,--It's unclear whether... the court of appeals decided that it was necessary to remand the case to determine whether or not the settlement had given credit for the gift tax.
1989.88-1951,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.388,230.457,But you do avow that one way or another credit will be given for the gift tax that was paid?
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,230.457,238.547,"--Well, at this point I don't think any court has jurisdiction over this claim, this claim for a gift tax."
1989.88-1951,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.419,248.753,Right.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,248.753,258.794,"And at that point the IRS will give credit, will... it's given notice to taxpayers in its Revenue Ruling 7156 that it will at that point perform equitable recoupment."
1989.88-1951,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,259.844,261.094,"Well, can... can that happen now?"
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,261.094,264.146,--It can't happen now because the--
1989.88-1951,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,264.146,265.229,Can or cannot?
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,265.229,265.662,--Cannot.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,318.612,322.064,"May I just interrupt, if I may?"
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,324.766,327.634,"Well, the... the district court suit was filed in '85."
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,330.686,336.657,"--I thought the refund suit for the recovery of the gift tax was filed on December 1, 1984."
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,336.657,339.525,"I believe it was November 1, 1984."
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,342.727,345.179,Which was before the deficiency matter had been concluded?
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,345.179,345.562,That's right.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,345.562,357.07,And is it correct that had the taxpayer at that time paid the income tax in dispute and filed a claim for refund that the taxpayer could have recovered the gift tax--
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,357.07,359.07,If she--
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,359.07,359.42,--erroneously--
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,359.42,364.307,"--If she had paid the income tax and filed the income tax refund, she could have--"
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,364.307,366.092,--She could have--
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,366.092,371.044,"--Well, one... excuse me... once... once the claim was in the tax court, the tax court has jurisdiction over that claim."
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,371.044,371.711,"--Well, yes, but--"
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,371.711,374.063,If she hadn't gone to tax court in 1983--
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,374.063,375.882,--If instead of proceeding in the tax court--
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,375.882,376.432,--Right.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,376.432,381.451,--she had paid her income tax and filed a refund suit which had two counts in it.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,391.707,405.134,"I... I believe what would have happened is that the Service would have considered... the way you stated it, would have considered under number one that what in fact had happened was that the taxpayer was filing a refund claim for the income tax."
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,413.407,423.095,It might have given her credit if... but would it have had the authority under your argument you make here to strike count 2 of her complaint and say it's too late to sue for the gift tax?
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,423.095,423.862,Yes.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,435.12,442.224,"Assume for a moment that the income tax claim is $100,000 and the gift tax claim is $30,000, so we have... and she files the two counts."
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,452.798,456.583,--I don't think that the IRS would have done that.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,456.983,462.904,"Well, I... are we relying on the good faith or sort of the equitable judgment of the administrator or did she have a right?"
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,464.689,465.605,--She did have a right.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,465.605,465.789,"--to 30,000?"
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,465.789,473.545,"And if... if for some reason the Service hadn't given her the... hadn't reduced the $100,000 by $30,000, she could have filed suit in the district court."
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,473.545,474.528,And she could have--
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,474.528,475.395,And the district court would--
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,475.395,479.247,"--And she had a right to prosecute successfully a refund claim for the $30,000?"
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,479.247,482.199,--I wouldn't call it a refund claim.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,483.532,486.084,"Well, she had a right to recover $30,000."
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,486.084,489.186,"--She had a right to have her income tax reduced by $30,000."
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,489.186,492.138,So she could do it by an independent action but not by way of a counterclaim.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,494.607,498.209,She couldn't do it by way of an independent action for the gift tax.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,498.209,500.642,But as a separate count she could.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,500.642,500.975,What I'm trying to--
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,500.975,502.058,"Well, okay."
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,502.058,511.331,--What I'm trying to... the distinction I'm trying to draw is that the difference between an independent suit for the gift tax and a suit for the income tax is not a subtle distinction.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,555.276,564.465,"Yes, but it seems to me if you read those as you... literally, that would bar her refund claim for the 30,000 even if she'd filed it in connection with an income tax refund claim."
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,564.465,567.148,"--Well, the theory of equitable recoupment... I mean, it could be that--"
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,567.148,568.664,Because it's not a defense anymore at this point.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,571.766,575.652,--Under... the Court explained in Bull that it considered her a defendant.
1989.88-1951,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,620.081,629.437,Could a claim like that ever be not just kind of a recoupment or... but lead to an affirmative recovery against the government on the basis--
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,629.437,629.687,--No.
1989.88-1951,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.305,639.209,"--Well, it... it is an affirmative recovery against the government in the sense that you're talking about a suit for a refund."
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,639.209,640.626,In the sense that the government--
1989.88-1951,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,640.626,653.468,"She's paid the tax and she is... she can sue to get back the amount of the gift tax, although it would not be described as a refund of the gift tax, it would be described as a recoupment and, therefore, a reduction of her income tax."
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,653.468,654.252,--That's right.
1989.88-1951,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,659.539,664.174,"And perhaps... perhaps you think that you have been through this with Justice Stevens, but I want to make sure I understand it."
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,689.576,690.642,--Yes.
1989.88-1951,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,690.642,692.593,"Yes, she would have had that right?"
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,692.593,693.077,"Yes, she would have."
1989.88-1951,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,693.86,708.853,"Now, what if... if in Justice Stevens' hypothetical instead of the income tax being $100,000 and the gift tax $30,000, the income tax is $100,000 and the gift tax $200,000, could she possibly have recovered more than $100,000 from the government?"
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,708.853,709.389,--No.
1989.88-1951,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.101,736.706,"Well, in that situation the government wouldn't have... wouldn't have sought to convert a $200,000 gift tax into a $100,000 income tax anyway."
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,737.222,737.839,"Well,--"
1989.88-1951,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,737.839,742.86,--presumably the IRS would have been quite happy to have her pay the gift tax instead of the properly due income tax.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,742.86,746.412,"--Well, presumably they would have assessed whatever they thought the correct deficiency was."
1989.88-1951,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,746.412,750.28,That lawyers are required to answer hypothetical questions from judges.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,761.888,762.94,That's right.
1989.88-1951,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,762.94,768.76,"I'm sure that the Service has not been this charitable always, has it?"
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,772.145,779.366,"Well, I don't think there's anything in the record in this case that indicates that the Service acted incorrectly."
1989.88-1951,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,779.366,781.985,"Well, the... Daniel Bull is an old client."
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,788.822,791.524,"Well, the decision was correct in Bull."
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,795.476,796.459,"While you're interrupted, could I ask you one other question--"
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,796.459,796.859,--Oh.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.859,797.359,--about the fact?
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,813.719,815.321,It was supposedly an executor's fee.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,815.321,816.454,A third of the estate?
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,816.454,817.037,That's right.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,817.037,817.522,Wow.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,817.522,818.305,That's right.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,820.557,822.357,And that's--
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,822.357,823.357,But that's not before the Court.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.357,823.976,--Yeah.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,824.309,844.288,"To play this out a little farther, just to make sure that the theory... I'm getting across the theory, once the respondent petitioned the tax court, she was in a forum that this court has considered to be without equitable powers to apply equitable recoupment."
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.351,893.203,Let me just say... I'm sorry to keep interrupting.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,898.207,900.59,--That's the Gooch Milling case.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,909.38,917.569,"Well, is the... is the government making an unqualified representation that in this set of facts if she had raised it in the tax deficiency proceeding, she could have... it would have been proper?"
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,918.771,919.604,It would have been proper to raise it.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,919.604,920.088,--Okay.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,920.088,922.14,I'm not... I'm not taking any position on what the result would be.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.14,923.273,"Well, you can always raise anything."
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,924.842,925.392,I just mean--
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.392,925.892,"--the refund suit, too."
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,926.175,926.675,--Excuse me.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,926.975,927.808,--you're just saying she ought to lose.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,930.427,931.777,--I just mean jurisdictionally.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.514,946.203,But I'm... I have the distinct impression that they would have denied the claim in the tax deficiency proceeding because it's not a proceeding on which you get refunds of incorrectly paid tax--
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,946.203,948.405,I think that the... it wouldn't have been a refund.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,979.007,980.324,"--But again, it wasn't later."
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,982.059,982.509,--Right.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,984.328,984.994,All right.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,984.994,986.161,--with the income tax litigation.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.841,1014.513,"Which means, if I understand it correctly, had she'd filed her gift tax refund case the day the government asserted the deficiency, your same argument would be made here?"
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,1014.513,1015.696,That's right.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1015.696,1016.046,Yeah.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,1016.046,1016.379,That's right.
1989.88-1951,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.379,1016.579,Okay.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,1016.579,1017.079,It's barred.
1989.88-1951,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.604,1123.245,And so it was just a... just a bad oversight not to claim recoupment when they were talking about settling the income tax claim?
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,1123.245,1124.612,That's right.
1989.88-1951,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1128.466,1131.751,They... they could claim that alternatively.
1989.88-1951,0,18773,christine_desanhusson,,1139.239,1139.639,Yes.
1989.88-1951,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1145.594,1148.427,"Very well, Ms. Desan-Husson."
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1149.26,1154.681,"Mr. Chief Justice and Honorable Justices, may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1951,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1202.062,1204.345,"Mr. Pierce, may I... may I interrupt you?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1212.1,1212.367,--No.
1989.88-1951,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1212.917,1215.969,And why... why the difference in treatment of the two years?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1215.969,1221.539,"The... the first question, why was a gift tax not filed in 1977."
1989.88-1951,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1242.603,1245.186,"Of course, the donee is also liable secondarily."
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1245.186,1247.405,The donee is liable secondarily.
1989.88-1951,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1247.405,1250.857,Who took the initiative with respect to the '76 return?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1250.857,1252.475,Clarence Schrier.
1989.88-1951,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1252.475,1253.641,Uh-huh.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1253.641,1255.843,All right.
1989.88-1951,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1276.69,1286.879,"Well, could... could she have paid the income tax deficiency and filed suit in district court seeking the setoff on--"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1286.879,1287.996,Your Honor--
1989.88-1951,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1287.996,1288.914,--on the gift tax as paid.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1288.914,1290.748,--you're getting to the heart of the issue.
1989.88-1951,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1293.181,1293.597,Why not?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1293.597,1302.387,"--and the reason the answer is no is that she could not pay $300,000 and go to tax court... I mean, go to the district court or the court of claims."
1989.88-1951,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1303.687,1306.12,You mean she lacked the money--
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1306.12,1308.286,--She lacked the money to do that.
1989.88-1951,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1308.286,1308.77,--to pay the deficiency?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1308.77,1310.072,That is correct.
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1363.02,1371.376,"And there was never any mention in those settlement proceedings, or anything else, about the gift tax that had been paid?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1371.376,1374.744,"--There... there had been, yes."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.43,1376.013,"Yes, what?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1376.013,1379.565,"--there's an allegation in the petition that the gift tax had been paid as well, yes."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1379.565,1395.741,"Well, was there any claim that the Service should... should recognize that they were trying to tax to... the same event twice and that they should grant equitable recoupment?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1395.741,1402.58,There was a claim in the petition that the government had received an economic benefit to which it was not entitled.
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1406.715,1415.988,"Well, then why... why shouldn't the settlement figure represent a settlement of everything that was involved?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1415.988,1432.433,"Because the government and the revenue officials threw out, denied, any credit whatsoever of the gift tax for the erroneous... to the income tax... the gift tax being erroneous only upon collection of the second tax."
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1432.433,1446.276,"But if I sue you one count in contract and one count in tort and we... in the middle of the trial we settle for a stipulated amount of $80,000 without specifying, both those claims are barred thereafter, aren't they?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1446.276,1447.126,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1447.826,1448.842,What's your authority for that?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1448.842,1450.828,--What is my authority--
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1450.828,1453.846,What is your authority for saying both of those claims are not barred?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1453.846,1460.417,"--Number one, the tax court does not have jurisdiction over equitable recoupment."
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1461.719,1469.373,"Well, so it couldn't... you filed this complaint and alleged the government had gotten money was... but it could... the tax court couldn't have given you any relief in it?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1469.373,1471.408,--The tax court had no jurisdiction over the doctrine of that--
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1471.408,1473.177,Why did you make the allegation?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1473.177,1476.378,"--Because it was a fact, Your Honor."
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1476.378,1479.997,"Well, that isn't really the reason you ordinarily put something in a pleading."
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1482.615,1485.651,We believed it was very unfair.
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1521.074,1522.859,I don't find it persuasive.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1522.859,1524.342,All right.
1989.88-1951,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1524.342,1535.167,"Mr. Pierce, how did you ever effect a settlement in the tax court, 50 percent of the asserted deficiency?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1536.767,1538.619,"It was a very poor deal, Your Honor."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1539.952,1542.254,That's all the money that he had.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1545.123,1551.694,--It was a poor deal for the taxpayer for the simple reason that he could not take the chance of losing and going bankrupt.
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1579.029,1580.163,"Well, why did you settle?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1580.163,1582.481,--Why did the taxpayer settle?
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1582.481,1582.915,Yeah.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1582.915,1584.933,The taxpayer settled because--
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.933,1586.367,If you thought you were going to win--
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1586.367,1593.956,"--Because they would have been bankrupt if they had lost, and that was the taxpayer's very words."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.956,1613.184,"--Well, but if they... do you suppose on review if they had... if they had lost, do you suppose on review... and the government wanted to collect the income tax... don't you suppose you could have claimed equitable recoupment in reviewing the tax court?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1613.184,1614.869,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1614.869,1616.102,Why not?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1616.102,1616.869,Because--
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.869,1620.088,You say the tax court didn't have jurisdiction to rule on it.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1622.19,1624.642,--We believe the district court has jurisdiction to rule on it.
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.642,1625.475,You mean later.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1625.475,1626.844,Yes.
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1626.844,1628.96,How about on review of the tax court?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1628.96,1630.546,I don't believe so.
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.225,1661.148,"So you say... you say that this is the only way that you could get equitable recoupment and that you... there was no way, as long as you didn't have money to pay the tax, that you could have--"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1661.148,1663.433,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1664.05,1665.552,--tried to exercise the setoff?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1665.552,1666.735,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1691.786,1705.11,But is it... is it clear in this record that... that the IRS in the course of settlement absolutely refused any recognition of the prior payment of the gift tax?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1705.11,1706.244,Absolutely.
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.579,1710.848,"Well, I know you were there, but does the record show it?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1713.114,1715.316,I don't... I don't know that the record will show it.
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1728.791,1732.493,--What did... the court of appeals remanded to see if... if what?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1734.512,1735.528,Yes.
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1739.666,1745.903,"--Well, the... so you did claim in the court of... I see."
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1747.103,1756.542,I... I would like to point out some of the government's concessions in their reply brief that I think narrows the issue for this Court.
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1794.667,1798.202,But what... what... how would you describe the one transaction?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1798.202,1804.523,One transaction is the receipt of the money in 1976.
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.808,1807.558,Taxed twice.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1807.558,1814.212,"--has been subjected to two inconsistent treatments, inconsistent taxes... that one single transaction."
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1833.625,1836.827,"The brief only has eight pages, as I see it."
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1838.51,1839.36,--Their reply brief.
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.36,1841.962,I only see... I thought you said page 10.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1841.962,1847.616,It's page 10 of the government's reply brief on the writ of certiorari.
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1847.616,1848.766,"Oh, the--"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1848.766,1854.186,"This is on the merits, Your Honor."
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.222,1858.238,--Merits.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,1858.238,1875.016,And they state that both the payment of the gift tax and the later assessment of a deficiency and payment of the income tax concerned one transaction that could have been examined in all its aspects without offending the policies underlying the statute of limitations.
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.757,2022.612,Has the government assessed you... assessed your client some income taxes with penalties and interest?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2022.612,2023.712,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.712,2028.616,"And if you hadn't gone to the tax court, what would the government have done?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2030.385,2032.385,The government would have put them out of business.
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.153,2040.157,"--Well, at that point would you have had any way of asserting your setoff?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2040.157,2045.745,"No, Your Honor, we would not because the only method of doing it would be to pay the tax in full."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.915,2053.332,Uh-huh.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2057.151,2058.303,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1951,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2058.303,2062.188,"--don't you think the government could say any erroneous taxes you pay, too bad?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2071.71,2072.71,"No, Your Honor, I'm not saying that."
1989.88-1951,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2073.644,2079.548,"Well... Well, if they can do that, then I assume you could... you could disallow... you could disallow recoupment entirely, couldn't you?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2084.184,2086.053,"--No, you could not."
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2094.373,2095.075,What's your case--
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2097.459,2100.813,For the proposition that it would be a lack of due process?
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.813,2104.598,"That Bull... you're saying Bull was required by the Constitution, I take it."
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2104.598,2105.765,"No, I'm... no."
1989.88-1951,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2117.606,2121.224,"Well, what if it was?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2137.251,2137.968,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1951,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.452,2202.123,"Well, even... even the Bull case, Counsel, says that the taxpayer has a right of restitution, but nevertheless, he may be without a remedy."
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2202.123,2222.102,"--Your Honor, I would refer to Judge Hand in the Elbert case, that I believe was way before his time, where he said one does not lose a remedy by going to a forum where the remedy in fact did not exist."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2388.191,2390.827,And what was the total... what was the total income tax claim?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2392.562,2395.681,"--The... the principal was $160,000."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.681,2398.133,And... but with penalty and interest?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2398.133,2401.585,"With penalties and interest you'd have approximately $300,000 at that time."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2401.585,2403.068,And you settled it for 150?
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2403.068,2403.953,No.
1989.88-1951,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2407.672,2417.695,"Your cause of action really arose... I mean, this is... this is recoupment of... recoupment assumes recoupment of something that you had a cause of action for."
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2456.588,2459.038,"But it wasn't erroneously paid, Your Honor."
1989.88-1951,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2461.304,2462.423,"Well, it was in fact."
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2465.108,2466.508,In fact it was not.
1989.88-1951,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2477.1,2483.903,But it was not determined to have been erroneous until... until it was determined that an income tax was due instead of a gift tax.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2486.938,2490.473,--Our position is that it was a gift.
1989.88-1951,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.842,2494.225,You... you were wrong.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2495.711,2498.194,"No, Your Honor, we were not wrong."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.124,2521.426,"--Well, no court has ruled that you were wrong?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2521.426,2522.342,Not really.
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2523.009,2523.809,Not really.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2526.894,2528.18,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2542.856,2551.093,"The government just wants the statute of limitations applied equitably to all taxpayers, it says, so that everybody gets a fair shake in the tax thing."
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2558.598,2559.665,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2570.99,2571.673,"Well, but--"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2571.673,2572.858,--where it virtually has no existence.
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2572.858,2576.477,"--It was fairly drastically restricted in Rothensies, wasn't it?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2576.477,2585.0,"I believe Rothensies restricted the doctrine to... to where it should have been restricted, to this Dalm situation."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2612.765,2614.333,"At least, many of them can't."
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2614.333,2616.369,--Most of them can't.
1989.88-1951,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2620.654,2624.789,"Mr. Pierce, you're arguing now that the gift tax was not wrongly paid?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2624.789,2626.64,We... We--
1989.88-1951,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2626.64,2629.526,"If it was not wrongly paid, what is your basis for recoupment?"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2629.526,2636.865,--Because of the collection of the second tax on an inconsistent theory treating it as an income tax transaction.
1989.88-1951,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2636.865,2638.715,Therefore you must assume it was wrongly paid.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2647.354,2653.458,"The whole theory of the case is that... is the doctrine of equitable recoupment, Your Honor."
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2653.458,2656.26,"Well, whichever one it was--"
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2656.26,2656.677,That is--
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2656.677,2658.779,--it doesn't justify two taxes.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2658.779,2659.779,--That's correct.
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2660.898,2663.35,It was either a gift tax... it was either a gift or an income.
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2663.35,2663.75,One tax.
1989.88-1951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.45,2666.301,"And there was supposed to be one tax, not two."
1989.88-1951,1,40159,robert_b_pierce,,2666.301,2667.417,That is correct.
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2756.424,2758.709,"Thank you, Mr. Pierce."
1989.88-1951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2760.559,2762.944,Let me.
1989.88-1951,2,18773,christine_desanhusson,,2791.43,2802.802,"If she had gone to the district court before going to the tax court, and if the claim in the district court had been a claim for the income tax deficiency, she could raise equitable recoupment."
1989.88-1951,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2816.296,2819.68,"Well, if she had paid the tax and... and went in for an income tax refund--"
1989.88-1951,2,18773,christine_desanhusson,,2819.68,2820.464,--Right.
1989.88-1951,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.464,2822.782,--she could have raised the recoupment?
1989.88-1951,2,18773,christine_desanhusson,,2822.782,2823.282,That's right.
1989.88-1951,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.282,2823.748,Yes.
1989.88-1951,2,18773,christine_desanhusson,,2823.748,2824.315,That's right.
1989.88-1951,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2824.315,2825.817,How about the larger point?
1989.88-1951,2,18773,christine_desanhusson,,2825.817,2835.34,"The larger point I was just going to make is that I think... I mean, Congress decided that collecting taxes first and settling disputes later was the way it was going to build the revenue code."
1989.88-1951,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2840.725,2841.125,Should we--
1989.88-1951,2,18773,christine_desanhusson,,2841.125,2846.379,--I guess that would have been... that would have been the way to guard access to the district court.
1989.88-1951,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2846.379,2855.552,--Can we judge this case on the assumption that the Internal Revenue Service did not give any credit in the settlement for the prior payment of the gift tax?
1989.88-1951,2,18773,christine_desanhusson,,2855.552,2860.538,"You can do that, yes, because the--"
1989.88-1951,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2860.538,2867.542,The... our adversary said they... it was urged that the Service give credit and that was denied.
1989.88-1951,2,18773,christine_desanhusson,,2867.542,2868.827,--It's unclear.
1989.88-1951,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.846,2872.646,"But, anyway, we judge the case as though there was no credit given?"
1989.88-1951,2,18773,christine_desanhusson,,2872.646,2873.663,--Yes.
1989.88-1951,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2873.663,2882.571,"Well, is that entirely accurate to... you have an $80,000 payment... and what more about it do you know than that?"
1989.88-1951,2,18773,christine_desanhusson,,2885.254,2885.939,That's all... that's all we know.
1989.88-1951,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2899.413,2902.399,So you say it's irrelevant whether they gave credit or not.
1989.88-1951,2,18773,christine_desanhusson,,2902.399,2903.651,That's right.
1989.88-1951,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2906.602,2908.885,"Thank you, Ms. Desan-Husson."
