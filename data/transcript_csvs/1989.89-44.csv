1989.89-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-44, Dennis Burnham v. The Superior Court of California."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,25.948,29.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.705,237.451,"Mr. Sherman, even if you are correct that some minimum contact is necessary for personal jurisdiction, wouldn't the transitory presence within the state of someone meet that test--"
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,237.451,237.751,Well--
1989.89-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.751,239.486,--in a good many instances?
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,239.486,240.62,"--I think not, Your Honor."
1989.89-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.688,257.865,I would have thought so and that perhaps someone who voluntarily enters a state to transact some business or to visit there might well meet whatever minimum contacts are--
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,257.865,258.315,--That... that--
1989.89-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.315,259.149,--required.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,259.149,260.649,"--On that... on those facts, yes."
1989.89-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,269.005,269.505,Well--
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,269.505,270.205,--classically flying over--
1989.89-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.205,270.624,--yes.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,275.926,276.611,--Right.
1989.89-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,276.611,280.997,--and is served in mid-air than you do with someone in your client's--
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,280.997,281.847,That's correct.
1989.89-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,281.847,282.582,--position.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,282.582,293.621,But the question that your hypothetical poses is what kinds of contacts would be sufficient under the minimum contacts test for somebody who was not in the state very long.
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.057,322.474,Mr. Sherman--
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,322.474,323.557,--there would be a restriction.
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.557,328.961,--This sort of points out... points up one of the problems with... with abandoning the gotcha test.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,356.86,366.966,"Well, Your Honor, if there were no Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution and we didn't have to worry about due process and we're looking for an easy test, then that might be an easy test that a court would want to--"
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.966,368.166,But for 200 years--
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,368.166,369.002,"--Well, that's true."
1989.89-44,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,384.059,388.38,"--Well, easy tests are not unrelated to the due process clause."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,405.206,411.143,"I think what most people would think is if you're within the borders of the state, you're subject to the power, if you will, of the state."
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,434.075,443.414,"Well, the minimum contacts really... test, though, really developed on when is service outside the state satisfactory."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,443.414,444.133,That's true.
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,445.233,451.037,And International Shoe I thought seemed to recognize the validity of the so-called gotcha.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,451.037,454.655,"--Well, I think there's kind of been a mistaken understanding of what that phrase meant."
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,525.684,530.053,xxx Pennoyer was irrational.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,530.053,530.503,"Well, that's correct."
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,534.005,534.373,"Well, I don't know."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,538.659,545.179,I think it overturned the theoretical underpinning of Pennoyer when it said that power was no longer the basis of jurisdiction.
1989.89-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,573.748,575.534,May I ask you another sort of general question?
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,584.64,586.823,--I really do not know enough about criminal law--
1989.89-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,586.823,597.444,"Say... say somebody commits a crime in Nevada and they send out an all points bulletin and he's hitchhiking through New Mexico and... but he's not... doesn't intend to stay there, had no contacts at all whatsoever, but they arrest him and extradite him."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,600.046,603.415,"--Well, I don't know enough about criminal law to give the best answer to that."
1989.89-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.415,603.882,But you--
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,603.882,626.114,"But my off-the-cuff answer would be that although the state may have the power, because it's given the right to do so by this Court, to arrest the defendant and to ship him back to the other state, extradite him, that the analogy in the civil case would be that if the defendant is served in the law... in the forum, that the state then can shift the lawsuit... should shift the lawsuit back to the original--"
1989.89-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,626.114,627.048,"--Well, forum nonconvenience allows that."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,628.4,631.602,"--But... well, but the extradition is mandatory, is it not, in your hypothetical?"
1989.89-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,634.97,638.421,"Yeah, but the only way you get jurisdiction over him is in the gotcha theory."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,638.421,638.671,No.
1989.89-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,642.04,642.523,That's right.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,642.873,644.075,But the purpose of arresting him--
1989.89-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,644.075,649.396,--But your power to do it is based entirely on the fact that he's... he happens to be passing through the state.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,649.396,649.779,"--That's true, but--"
1989.89-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,649.779,651.213,I don't know why that's any more unfair than--
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,651.213,651.463,--But the--
1989.89-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,651.463,652.948,--or any less unfair than what you say.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,652.948,659.502,--But the consequence of your hypothetical is that the defendant winds up being tried in the state of origin.
1989.89-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,659.502,660.052,"Well, that's true."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,660.519,661.287,And the analogy--
1989.89-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,661.287,666.089,"--there's a legal proceeding in the state of arrest, namely, the extradition hearing and he might conceivably win there."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,666.089,678.297,"--Well, but in the civil case the analogy would be there's a civil proceeding in California and he is served in California and then he makes his motion to quash for lack of jurisdiction, and it's granted, and the case then goes back to New Jersey."
1989.89-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.297,678.915,"Yeah, but I don't know why he--"
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,678.915,679.732,Because he doesn't have sufficient--
1989.89-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,679.732,680.198,--I don't know why the criminal--
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,680.198,680.515,--contacts--
1989.89-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,680.515,683.884,--defendant wouldn't be entitled to have his motion granted also on your theory.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,695.258,696.544,--There's no more I can say about that.
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.635,744.608,It's clear that one way you... you can place the jurisdiction in the case just beyond doubt is you serve the individual in the jurisdiction.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,753.714,754.014,--Well--
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,754.014,755.749,That... that would be gone?
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,755.749,757.066,--That's true.
1989.89-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,790.554,800.027,"Mr. Sherman, what do you think of the amended restatement version of when jurisdiction applies?"
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,800.027,801.911,I think there are several problems with it.
1989.89-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,814.704,816.071,That there is jurisdiction?
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,816.071,816.737,--There is jurisdiction.
1989.89-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,816.737,817.989,It starts from that premise?
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,817.989,818.656,That's right.
1989.89-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,827.612,832.749,"Well, it struck me as maybe a pretty good statement of what the rule might be."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,851.977,852.996,That's true.
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,877.862,886.967,Do you think... do you think we really... this case really... is it really necessary in this case for us to decide this issue?
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,895.823,897.123,"Well, no, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.785,922.723,"But here's a... but it said in light of the evidence presented to the trial court, the petitioner's... within California was for the dual purposes of visitation and conducting business activities."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,922.723,923.123,That's correct.
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,923.774,928.46,So the imposition of personal jurisdiction in this case will not affect... will not act to discourage parental visitation.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,928.46,929.044,--That's correct.
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,934.931,935.65,I understand.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,935.65,936.15,--as to... so--
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,936.15,936.733,But nevertheless--
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,936.733,937.333,--It was not--
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.333,944.32,"--we... we judge this case... as the case comes to us, he wasn't just there; he was there conducting business."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,944.32,944.922,--That's true.
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,950.891,951.509,"Well, maybe we don't have--"
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,951.509,952.076,And it couldn't have--
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,952.076,955.295,"--to hold that, but I don't... if that was... if that's the case--"
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,955.295,956.561,--It doesn't say that--
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,956.561,958.663,--maybe we made a mistake granting the case.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,958.663,981.695,"--It doesn't say that jurisdiction was being upheld on the ground that he has sufficient contacts under the minimum contacts test, and it couldn't have because it was quite obvious that the trial court did not ground jurisdiction on that basis, and it couldn't have because under California law and under this Court's decisions there are insufficient contacts as a matter of law to uphold jurisdiction here for two reasons."
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.925,1037.031,"I suppose if all that the wife wanted to do was to change custody, she could have served him out of state."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1037.031,1042.501,--That's correct because under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act you don't need personal jurisdiction--
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1042.501,1042.935,Yes.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1042.935,1046.137,--over the defendant in order to adjudicate status of the children.
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.958,1068.651,"Mr. Sherman, if... if we can't look to 500 years, or however long it is of... of the common law as to what, you know, fundamental fairness requires... we can't really on that... and we can't even rely on the American Law Institute, where... where do we search--"
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1068.651,1069.67,The minimum contacts--
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1069.67,1072.538,--for this... for this principle of what fundamental fairness requires?
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1072.538,1074.721,--You just... you just apply the minimum contacts test across the board.
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1074.721,1075.573,But this is a contact.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1076.406,1076.806,Well--
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.806,1077.99,--physical presence is a contact.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1077.99,1078.692,--That's true.
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1079.308,1080.525,"I mean, everything is a contact of sorts."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1080.525,1080.942,That's true.
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.292,1084.346,And our... our tradition would seem to show that it's... that it's enough of a contact.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1084.346,1086.512,"--No, because--"
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.512,1086.996,Why not?
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1086.996,1092.683,--Because the tradition does not found jurisdiction on the fact that a person is present.
1989.89-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.346,1118.317,"We'll resume there at 1:00, Mr. Sherman."
1989.89-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1118.317,1140.081,We'll resume the argument in Burnham against Superior Court.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1141.016,1147.002,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1290.759,1293.295,"Well, none of those things are involved here either."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1293.295,1294.211,That's true.
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1304.633,1305.435,xxx.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1305.435,1306.618,--That's true.
1989.89-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1311.22,1313.672,"So, we've been stuck with these examples for a long time?"
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1313.672,1314.139,--That's true.
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1331.217,1341.656,I assume that the state... the state supreme courts can deem it outmoded as far as their states are concerned or the state legislatures.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1341.656,1342.025,Well--
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1342.025,1342.925,Right?
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1342.925,1350.964,--This Court presides over the area of personal jurisdiction because it interprets what is consistent with the fundamental due process--
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.964,1351.464,"Well, that's right."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1351.464,1352.397,--protections that defendants have.
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.397,1356.599,But what... what is... what is consistent with due process under the Federal Constitution?
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1368.24,1376.912,"Well, the problem I see with that is the state supreme courts have been loath to overturn the doctrine precisely because this Court has not."
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.531,1379.097,"Well, they'd have no choice if we did."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1379.097,1379.947,"--Well, that's... that's true."
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1400.461,1402.997,What about... what about state legislatures?
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1402.997,1413.37,"I don't know of any legislature that has seen fit to... as a matter of fact, they've all gone the other way, as California has, and enacted a long-arm statute that says we have jurisdiction if it's consistent with the Constitution."
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.322,1425.345,"Well, then... then how do we know this is inconsistent with fundamental principles of fairness if the state... state courts haven't thought so... and they certainly could do it under state law."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1427.112,1427.462,Well--
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.462,1433.332,"I mean, I think they could say, as a matter of our state constitution, we don't think it's... it's appropriate, right?"
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1441.705,1442.474,--Not to my knowledge any.
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.474,1443.207,Nobody.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1443.207,1444.34,But there is--
1989.89-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1444.34,1453.913,"There's... there's a certain builtin pressure, I suppose, from the bar in every state that at least we want to be able to serve as many people as can be served in another state."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1463.22,1465.62,--That's true.
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1481.765,1482.882,They're not bound by Pennoyer.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1487.936,1489.705,That it's constitutional if they choose to do it.
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.705,1491.055,That it's constitutional if they choose to do it.
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1491.055,1491.505,And they have--
1989.89-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1491.505,1493.073,"And it's constitutional if they choose not to do it, too."
1989.89-44,0,40404,richard_sherman,,1493.073,1501.743,--And they have statutes which say they may exercise jurisdiction to the full extent permitted by the Constitution.
1989.89-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1662.916,1664.133,"Very well, Mr. Sherman."
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1668.753,1672.105,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1989.89-44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.641,1757.727,"Well, the end result of this approach is the state ought to be able to serve him anywhere."
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1757.727,1768.352,"Well, I don't believe that this case is limited to the mere fact that this particular defendant was served within the State of California."
1989.89-44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1791.884,1796.67,So you think... you think he could have been served in New York?
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1796.67,1796.953,I think--
1989.89-44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.953,1798.887,Under a long-arm statute.
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1798.887,1805.525,"--To be perfectly honest, I do think that that would be a reasonable rule because under this case the fact is--"
1989.89-44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.525,1807.56,But is that issue open to us in this case?
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1807.56,1808.043,--I'm sorry?
1989.89-44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1808.043,1811.995,Is that issue open to us in this case?
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1811.995,1832.408,"The... my understanding of the particular facts in this case are that this husband not only was served personally in Mill Valley, California in January of 1988, but was also served by substituted service, not personal service, in New Jersey, and that the service in New Jersey complied with New Jersey requirements relating to substitute of service."
1989.89-44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.408,1837.562,But the rationale of the court below was personal presence is enough.
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1837.912,1838.695,That is correct.
1989.89-44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.607,1857.79,And you're arguing that that's an alternative ground for--
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1857.79,1858.392,"--Yes, I am."
1989.89-44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.082,1869.082,--But it was raised below?
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1869.082,1870.949,It was raised below in each of the courts.
1989.89-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1870.949,1884.024,"Mr. Devereaux, in your view, however, it would also be sufficient if the petitioner had been served while flying across... over California in an airplane."
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1884.024,1884.407,No.
1989.89-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1902.838,1910.592,How about someone who has to change planes in an airport to get to another destination and is served while changing planes?
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1910.592,1912.924,"--Well, those facts are not the facts in this case."
1989.89-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1913.275,1913.709,No.
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1914.559,1928.386,"--I would have a harder time justifying jurisdiction based on those facts, but I happily don't have to specifically address those facts in this case because here we have not only the husband's repeated--"
1989.89-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1928.386,1934.807,But I thought your power theory would resolve those rather unpleasant questions.
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1934.807,1937.825,--I believe that the power theory would resolve those.
1989.89-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1937.825,1939.942,And that's the theory you espouse.
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1939.942,1940.544,No.
1989.89-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1941.227,1941.661,No?
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1941.661,1958.405,"--that I espouse is that the exercise of state court jurisdiction in each case must be fair and reasonable under the standards of International Shoe and that that is the effect in this case, that the exercise--"
1989.89-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1958.405,1961.107,"Well, how is that different from the restatement approach?"
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,1961.107,1970.263,--I don't... I think the restatement... the revised restatement approach sets forth an eminently reasonable approach to resolving this problem.
1989.89-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1995.761,1996.197,"Yeah, but I'm sorry to hear--"
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,2017.993,2033.153,"--Well, I think that, as the Court pointed out most recently in 1984 in Burger King, the physical presence of the defendant in the state can in fact enhance the affiliation of the defendant with that state and can enhance the foreseeability of being sued in that state."
1989.89-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2050.697,2053.531,You're... you're not disagreeing then with your... with your opponent here.
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,2058.935,2060.553,"--Well, I think that... I think that--"
1989.89-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.553,2069.242,"I mean, if that's the invitation, frankly, I don't think the mere fact that... that this person happened to be there to see his daughter... that doesn't seem to me very fair."
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,2069.242,2072.46,"--This person didn't just happen to be there to see his daughter, however."
1989.89-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2080.63,2088.387,"Well, maybe we should remand to the court of appeals to... to decide whether... the court of appeals didn't purport to decide it on a totality of fairness basis, did it?"
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,2088.387,2089.004,"--No, it did not."
1989.89-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.92,2090.255,No?
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,2090.255,2090.589,--because it felt--
1989.89-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2090.589,2091.306,Then it--
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,2091.306,2094.725,"--that the presence rule continued to be the law in this country, and I believe--"
1989.89-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.725,2095.541,--But you're saying it isn't.
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,2096.327,2096.877,"--No, I'm saying--"
1989.89-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2096.877,2097.477,--the totality of everything.
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,2097.477,2097.843,"--No, no, no."
1989.89-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.634,2110.417,You can't have it both ways.
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,2123.644,2131.381,"--Well, then my position is that this Court should say that the law has been that presence is sufficient and should continue to say that."
1989.89-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2306.746,2328.177,"Mr. Devereaux, the question presented in the petition for cert. and on which I thought we had... we had granted cert. and what I thought we were here to decide or what you were here for us to decide, is this: is service of process on a nonresident defendant while he is physically present in the forum state a sufficient basis by itself for the exercise of personal jurisdiction."
1989.89-44,1,30040,james_o_devereaux,,2354.644,2361.916,"Well, Justice Scalia, I, of course, can't speak to the reasons for the Court's granting cert. in this case."
1989.89-44,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2578.804,2580.089,"Thank you, Mr. Devereaux."
1989.89-44,2,40404,richard_sherman,,2582.789,2583.591,Yes.
1989.89-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2623.433,2627.635,Do you think the state has physical power of somebody flying overhead in an airplane?
1989.89-44,2,40404,richard_sherman,,2627.635,2627.968,Well--
1989.89-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2627.968,2628.685,Physical power over that--
1989.89-44,2,40404,richard_sherman,,2628.685,2628.985,"--Well, if the--"
1989.89-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2628.985,2629.67,--over that person?
1989.89-44,2,40404,richard_sherman,,2629.67,2633.972,"--If the territory of the state extends to the air space, then apparently they do."
1989.89-44,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2723.263,2725.029,"Thank you, Mr. Sherman."
