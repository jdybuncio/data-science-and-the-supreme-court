1962.134,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,207.196,208.743,What's a half slip?
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,208.743,220.976,A half slip Your Honor is a card where the better puts in a number to a person engaged in a business of taking wagers.
1962.134,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,264.598,267.242,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,267.242,270.609,Something to that effect Your Honor.

1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,379.447,380.121,Separate and --
1962.134,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,380.121,383.031,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,383.031,386.065,"Yes, Mr. Justice they were similar, but separate."
1962.134,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,386.065,387.865,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,387.865,389.811,All with the same deed.
1962.134,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,398.421,399.544,Same Judge?
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,399.544,400.501,Same Judge.
1962.134,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,400.501,401.647,You were the Counselor?
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,401.647,403.361,"I was the Counselor, yes Your Honor."
1962.134,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,403.361,406.972,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,406.972,409.839,The Kahns case called first that morning.
1962.134,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,432.494,433.456,They pleaded guilty?
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,433.456,435.386,And they pleaded guilty.
1962.134,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,445.397,447.039,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,447.039,450.792,For a probationary report and so forth.
1962.134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,741.284,746.013,"Particularly for me, Mr. Fitzgerald with that argument is that the Kahns aren't here."
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,748.365,750.401,"They are not Petitioner's here, admittedly sorry Your Honor."
1962.134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,750.401,753.208,You are not talking about the Kahns rights under the Fifth Amendment?
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,753.208,753.9,"Yes, sir."
1962.134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,753.9,769.191,But the Petitioner here is a third party and how can avail himself to their rights or complain if their rights are violated anymore that he can complain if they hadn't waived the protection of the Fifth Amendment and testified against him?
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,769.191,779.404,"If the Kahn's were testifying concerning a further crime, these crimes might also involve the Petitioner."

1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,826.851,833.901,"That is a further part of my argument, Your Honor in the so-called popular term guilt by association."
1962.134,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,894.509,897.996,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,897.996,907.923,"There was a same transaction – well, for instance the Kahns would be asked the question which they were asked, did you have any business relations with the defendant?"
1962.134,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,975.846,981.657,"Is there any area of examination that would have been proper for these witnesses, Kahns?"
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,981.657,992.422,"There were some witnesses, some questions Counsel didn't object to their name, where they lived, what they did, how long they owned the property they had."
1962.134,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,995.543,997.725,Are those the only things that --?
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,997.725,999.134,Matters along that line.
1962.134,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,999.134,1000.389,That they could have testified to.
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1000.389,1007.582,"And there were other questions, which in the course of this trial, having in mind that the Kahns have pleaded guilty."
1962.134,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1007.582,1008.934,Yes.
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1008.934,1014.551,It was virtually a retrial or an opening up of their trial by questions.
1962.134,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1024.663,1037.492,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1037.492,1040.306,I am not saying that is a general statement.
1962.134,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1045.186,1048.311,What is it that makes this difference [Inaudible]?
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1048.311,1058.463,"For instance, there it is conceivable whether it could be government witnesses that were called to the stand and they might be custodian of public documents."
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.936,1107.682,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1107.682,1123.112,"I say this case is unique Mr. Justice, because here the Government knew from the information being before it, from the dockets of the Court before it, that Kahns were within [Inaudible] this entire matter, which involved Mr. Namet."
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.112,1125.317,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1125.317,1130.009,"That's right, there is no question about that and Government even admitted that on their bench conferences."
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1130.009,1142.754,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1142.754,1147.683,"Again, as a Court ruled in sustaining the objections at --"

1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1150.076,1154.284,"I believe they did Your Honor, where they said it was a legal conclusion."

1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1170.774,1172.294,It's relevant.
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.294,1173.627,It's relevant.
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1173.627,1175.415,"Prior to that, there was another question."
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.415,1182.093,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1182.093,1185.404,"Well, now they wanted to explain."
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1187.268,1199.223,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1199.223,1201.144,"Of course, I think I agree with Your Honor too."

1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1207.357,1210.538,"Of course, Your Honor, dealings of one thing."
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1228.782,1236.696,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1236.696,1246.824,"What I say, set as my original -- hoping as I told the Trial of Judge in this case, I don't think that Kahn should ever have been put on the stand."
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1246.824,1257.408,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1257.408,1261.183,"Well, there was a question before that Your Honor which was not admitted."
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1278.698,1282.058,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1282.058,1284.591,"Well, many people had dealings with the Kahn."
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1284.591,1286.688,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1286.688,1290.71,I can't see the relevancy of it.
1962.134,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1292.859,1305.948,"My understanding was in the bench conference, the Judge said this so far the testimony [Inaudible] which they completed jury, the Fifth Amendment was not available."
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1305.948,1306.884,Yes.
1962.134,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1306.884,1311.834,But it was available to the extent that it might have involved in other trial.
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1311.834,1312.5,That's right.
1962.134,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1312.5,1319.233,"Then I understand that the Judge said, “Why don't you bring this man to chambers to go over his testimony?”"
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1319.233,1320.408,"He didn't say that to me, no."
1962.134,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1320.408,1321.851,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1321.851,1323.651,He called for a conference between --

1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1353.58,1355.36,I did Your Honor.
1962.134,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1355.36,1358.657,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1358.657,1372.634,"Well, when we had these various conferences, the Judge was -- let's say on my side one time and the Government side the other time, and it was never completely clear just what his feeling was."
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.207,1447.129,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1447.129,1448.823,Not relevant to the Namet's case.
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1448.823,1450.219,I know [Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1450.219,1451.517,There was no evidence of --
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.517,1455.185,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1455.185,1459.559,They never had one iota of evidence that Namet was every present when a bet was taken in the counsel.
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.559,1464.197,[Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1464.197,1466.148,They had evidence he was in and out of the store.
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.148,1483.314,And [Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1483.314,1491.608,"I would say this is relevant Your Honor if Namet -- unless an agent was inside to say he stood there, saw Namet present when bets were being taken."
1962.134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.608,1496.181,The evidence [Inaudible]

1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1501.523,1520.463,"May I put it this way Your Honor, there was an -- that exact question came up in relation to another store, when Namet had entered, as he was followed around, and the government witness on the stand testified to the effect, the bets were taken in that store."
1962.134,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1533.01,1552.483,What did the prosecutor say was the relevancy of having these witnesses ask questions before in the presence of the jury when it was known that their answer would be -- they wouldn't answer it because of the Fifth Amendment?
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1565.207,1584.44,"Well, a prosecutor at that time felt that if he could get the Court's permission to put the Khans on the stand, he could go the distance and ask them many questions, open up everything and bring out evidence of what happened or things that occurred when Mr. Namet wasn't present."
1962.134,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1584.44,1611.164,"I would suppose that your objection is, I haven't heard you say it yet, but I thought that was it, that's it was certainly not relevant or proper deliberately to put witnesses on the stand and ask them questions, which would tend to incriminate this defendant when it was known in advance that they would refuse to answer on the ground of self-incrimination?"
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1611.164,1616.146,"I didn't put the query that way Your Honor, but I thought I had tried to make that, so that is my position."
1962.134,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1616.146,1617.081,That is your objection.
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1617.081,1618.339,"Yes, Your honor."
1962.134,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1618.339,1622.479,You are not claiming that it is not relevant to ask them some questions about this.
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1636.418,1651.211,"That's very true Your Honor and in answer to that, the government in its brief has said that the -- or the government as they went along in this case have no time knew other than the mere statement of an attorney as to what the Khans would do well."
1962.134,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1651.211,1654.845,That's a very common factor [Inaudible] committed something --
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1654.845,1656.617,Virtually the only way I can see --
1962.134,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1656.617,1663.52,[Inaudible] say they won't testify without incrimination may be two or three hundred times.
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1668.022,1668.958,Well I --

1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1675.617,1677.915,That's right Your Honor -- they are not objecting themselves.
1962.134,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1677.915,1720.005,How would you [Inaudible] how is your man prejudiced [Inaudible]
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1720.005,1733.165,"He is prejudiced very much I think of this way that his counsel is stripped of the right of cross examination to an inference, which has been created, an important inference."
1962.134,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1733.165,1733.255,"There is more than that, isn't there?"
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1733.255,1735.823,As guesswork in the part of the Jury is a conjunction.
1962.134,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1735.823,1757.348,"Everybody knows if you get a witness who is associated with somebody else, some kind of bet and you are [Inaudible] kind of been connected with one another, if the prosecutor can [Inaudible] get in, as that man standing before the Jury and not going to testify on the ground of discriminating, it does more than affect the witness, it affects the other man."
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1757.348,1757.534,"It does, Your Honor."
1962.134,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1757.534,1765.812,"And that may not be sufficient to reverse the case, but I would think it would [Inaudible] prejudices on the circumstances at the time."
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1765.812,1766.947,It's one of the --
1962.134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1766.947,1767.971,"Well testimony, yeah."
1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1779.991,1789.182,Unless the – as a Judge putting this case and by the remark of counsel was in an enviable position and -- that's true.
1962.134,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1789.182,1803.197,"But if its testimony that's put in against him as the testimony relevant, prosecutor knows it, that's one thing of course, but if they put somebody up there and make them do something, they know that they won't do."

1962.134,0,30349,john_h_fitzgerald,,1833.017,1845.902,"Insofar it's the one information to which they have pleaded guilty was concerned, they didn't have a wagering tax."
1962.134,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1845.902,1846.992,Mr. Pollak.
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1846.992,1851.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."

1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2043.086,2051.391,"Well, I mean to spend as petitioner's counsel addressed himself most primarily to the first issue on the propriety of the calling Kahns."
1962.134,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2242.694,2244.497,That was outside the presence of the jury.
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2244.497,2248.445,"That was outside the presence of the jury Mr. Justice Black, yes sir."
1962.134,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2323.982,2338.149,[Inaudible]
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2338.149,2341.971,"I think that would make a difference, and I intend to address myself to that directly."

1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2405.166,2411.062,"No, there were some questions, Your Honor, as to which no objection was interposed and he answered those questions."
1962.134,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2417.627,2420.912,[Inaudible]
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2420.912,2430.254,"No, we would not, but, we assume that if there is -- if the question is asked and there is no objection, that then he is giving a voluntary answer."
1962.134,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2430.254,2447.165,"May I ask have you viewed the record as I have read it, but as you view the record, did the prosecuting attorney ask any questions of the Kahns which the Court had told him in advance in his chamber, he would not compel them to answer."
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2478.555,2487.618,Our position is Your Honor that the government here acted properly in putting him on the stand and in questioning.
1962.134,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2509.993,2512.859,"But that's what I thought, what this record shows on that."
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2512.859,2515.465,We do not believe that this record shows that.
1962.134,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2577.319,2578.787,You're not challenging --
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2578.787,2581.441,"We're not challenging, no Your Honor."

1962.134,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2587.712,2609.584,[Inaudible]
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2609.584,2610.081,Yes.
1962.134,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2610.081,2624.702,[Inaudible]
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2624.702,2634.363,"Mr. Justice Goldberg, we do not think that those questions were -- require a reversal here."
1962.134,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2817.749,2826.321,But there was -- the government did have knowledge of something when the judge told them out of the presence of the jury there were certain things they would not let him ask.
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2826.321,2828.551,That's right.
1962.134,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2847.094,2851.419,Have they been convicted for taking wagers from this man Namet?
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2851.419,2862.524,They had been convicted of failing to register and failing to pay the tax while engaged in wagering operations.
1962.134,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2862.524,2868.599,They had not -- that is it had not been adjudicated in the prior case where they pleaded guilty or whether --
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2868.599,2872.106,The face of the information did not refer to Namet.
1962.134,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2872.106,2883.995,"So that this question was one that was related to this defendant on trial, and which was precisely inline with what the Court had told him they couldn't ask him, wasn't it?"
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2883.995,2885.017,"Well, no."
1962.134,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2904.221,2906.503,"I understand it, I understand it."
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2944.825,2969.377,"Well, we may -- the government may differ Mr. Justice Black in this respect, the -- we feel that there is some burden upon the Lawyer for witnesses or a Lawyer for a defendant to see that the witness make it certain that the witness will claim the privilege."
1962.134,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2973.735,2978.166,"Then of course that is, without that there would be no relevancy to it unless --"
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2978.166,2987.414,"Well, in the circumstances of this case, we do not believe that it was certain that these witnesses would continue to claim their privilege."
1962.134,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2990.99,3000.55,You think you are [Inaudible] with that been said the layer said they were going to do and nobody objected on the ground and hadn't asked them.
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3010.18,3020.056,"We believe that in the absence of a request by the defendant's lawyer for proceedings outside the hearing of the Jury, the government was entitled to proceeding the normal way."
1962.134,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3020.056,3021.343,[Inaudible] that argument.
1962.134,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3021.343,3032.912,"And we are very concerned that the rule contended for by the petitioner would exclude witnesses, exclude material evidence from the Jury."
