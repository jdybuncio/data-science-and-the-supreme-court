1982.81-2169,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.59,We will hear arguments next in Haring against Prosise.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,55.397,86.791,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents the issue of whether a person who pleaded guilty in state court to making illegal drugs and who did not raise the validity of the search that produced the essential evidence of that crime can later bring an action under 42 United States Code Section 1983 claiming that that same search was unconstitutional."
1982.81-2169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.097,139.969,"Mr. Lasso, I take it there was no motion to suppress in the Circuit Court."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,139.969,140.269,"--That is correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-2169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,317.401,325.285,"Mr. Lasso, do you think that the absence of a motion to suppress played any part in the reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit?"
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,325.285,329.52,"--Well, yes, Justice Rehnquist, it did."
1982.81-2169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,339.405,348.979,"As you read the Court of Appeals opinion, does it reserve the question as to whether there would be preclusion had there been a suppression hearing, or does it say there would have been preclusion?"
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,348.979,351.977,I think it perhaps reserves that question.
1982.81-2169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,397.945,399.848,What was Prosise sentenced to?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,399.848,404.223,He was sentenced initially to 25 years in the state penitentiary.
1982.81-2169,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,443.628,448.034,Has he at any time ever raised a question of effective assistance of counsel or lack of it?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,448.034,449.766,"No, Your Honor, he has not."
1982.81-2169,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,515.397,517.659,You would agree with that approach?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,517.659,520.924,"Yes, Your Honor, I would."
1982.81-2169,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,520.924,527.767,The problem in part is the possible uncertainty about what Virginia law is.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,542.184,547.397,My thought on that is that they are plainly incorrect.
1982.81-2169,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,556.834,558.659,--Which has no written opinion.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,562.376,564.001,That's correct.
1982.81-2169,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,582.727,588.319,What effect does Virginia give to those unreported decisions?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,588.319,596.941,"There is no case in the Virginia Supreme Court which indicates whether it would be given one particular weight or another, but the fact is is that it does exist."
1982.81-2169,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,637.924,644.999,"But in any event you are content to let it rest on whatever Virginia law would determine, I take it."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,644.999,651.468,"I would think that we are commanded to do that under 18, 28, Section 1738."
1982.81-2169,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,665.053,676.221,"Well, and then the Court of Appeals proceeded to decide what Virginia law was, and normally I suppose this Court defers to that kind of a determination, does it not?"
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,676.221,684.902,"--Normally it would defer, but if you read the Fourth Circuit very carefully, it never decided what the Virginia Supreme Court rule was."
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,737.273,739.24,But he wasn't convicted on the search.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,743.347,746.393,"He was convicted on his own guilty plea, but--"
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,746.393,747.738,Period.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,747.738,755.451,"--He was convicted on that, but he... but during that time, the fact, the evidence that was available was the evidence that was produced by the search."
1982.81-2169,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,760.03,760.732,Does--
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,760.732,762.888,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1982.81-2169,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,762.888,777.944,--Does the state of Virginia have a rule on guilty pleas comparable to Rule 11 of the federal criminal rules that the sentencing judge makes an inquiry as to the factual basis of the plea?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,777.944,782.787,There is a... there is a very brief factual inquiry.
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,808.509,835.765,"May I ask you if you would make the same basic argument if you had a case in which there were, say, two different sets of evidence that supported the guilty plea, one of which was... there was no challenge to the legality of the seizure, but as to some of the evidence there was a question as to the legality of the seizure, and then he pleaded guilty, and the undisputed evidence would be enough to support the guilty plea, but he nevertheless files a 1983 action just like this, saying there is some kind of a constitutional right to damages."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,838.215,840.979,It presents a difficult question.
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.303,857.537,What would be the incentive?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,861.19,869.546,"--Well, the position would be that he should nonetheless, if there is evidence there that is at all important, then he should raise that at the first opportunity."
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.546,869.999,But what is the purpose?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,873.949,880.06,"Well, the next question is, why should he deliberately bypass that opportunity and then litigate it later and not be--"
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,880.06,884.76,Because it is relevant to a damage claim and totally irrelevant to a guilty plea determination.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,884.76,889.291,"--If that position were taken, then that would at least eliminate the second search."
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,895.912,897.004,"Yes, if he doesn't challenge that."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,917.012,921.275,"--If it had nothing to do with the conviction, if the evidence was--"
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,921.275,922.339,"Well, it was cumulative."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,924.619,936.018,"--Then an argument would be, you could then again look to state law if it were clear, but perhaps that is one instance when that search might be litigated in a 1983 action."
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1023.016,1028.327,"You fail to draw the difference between criminal and civil, do you not?"
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1028.327,1032.152,I am saying that the policy consideration is similar.
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1032.152,1038.649,"You say the criminal case, when you end a criminal case, you also end the civil case."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1040.899,1051.725,"Justice Marshall, I am saying that during the criminal case, all inquiries into the claims that were relevant to that criminal case should be ended."
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1053.269,1055.566,Including the civil case.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1055.566,1057.784,"Including the civil case, because if you don't--"
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1057.784,1059.656,Isn't that a novel rule?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1059.656,1061.906,"--Well, this case is novel."
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1066.358,1072.746,I don't think it's novel to file a civil case involving a criminal prosecution.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1076.213,1077.901,"--Well, I am sure it has."
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1093.738,1094.752,Is this estoppel or something?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1094.752,1096.393,"Excuse me, Justice--"
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1096.393,1097.563,Like estoppel?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1097.563,1099.798,--It is like estoppel.
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1110.186,1117.836,Do you think that he intelligently waived his criminal... his civil case?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1117.836,1125.039,--I think he intelligently and voluntarily waived any right to claim that the search and seizure was illegal.
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1125.538,1126.146,Civil?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1126.833,1128.771,--I think it has got to apply to that.
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1146.216,1150.635,"Well, I think Johnson versus Zerbst says in order to show a waiver you have to show it."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1150.635,1151.574,"--Well, what Johnson--"
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1151.574,1152.791,Not infer it.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1152.791,1154.713,"--Excuse me, Justice Marshall."
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1179.578,1188.277,"Well, your theory is that he deliberately gave up his right of civil action, and then filed a civil action."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1188.277,1189.197,That's correct.
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1189.197,1190.745,That doesn't make sense to me.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1192.851,1195.445,If it gave it up is exactly right.
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1207.615,1209.378,It's a different court.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1216.0,1222.796,"--It is a different court, but what he seeks to bring into question is the integrity of his conviction."
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1231.776,1241.084,"Mr. Lasso, may I ask you another... You say he brings into dispute the integrity of his conviction, but I don't understand that any of the relief he could possibly get here would set aside the guilty plea, would it?"
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1243.521,1245.284,--He is asking for damages--
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1245.284,1249.001,"He will stay in jail no matter what happens, as I understand the record, anyway."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1249.001,1250.611,"--Well, he should stay in jail, because--"
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1250.611,1252.44,"I mean, even if he wins he stays in jail."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1252.44,1253.547,--That's correct.
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1275.493,1278.882,"Well, I would agree with you it is unlikely he is going to recover that, and I would also think--"
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1278.882,1279.693,--It is very unlikely.
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1279.693,1282.864,--it would be unlikely that the time in jail will be an element of damage.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1289.938,1291.455,"That's correct, and excessive--"
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1291.455,1292.484,But supposing they beat him up.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1292.484,1293.626,--An excessive--
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1293.626,1294.874,Why should that be foreclosed?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1294.874,1295.311,--I am sorry.
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.322,1320.285,"Well, but you could have an excessive... say you have a coerced confession case, and he alleged that he was maltreated in order to get the confession, and then he goes ahead and enters a guilty plea on the ground that there is additional evidence of guilt."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1325.002,1328.016,"--Physical harm, perhaps, but that's... but that's--"
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1328.016,1328.812,"--Well, why is that different from this?"
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1328.812,1330.984,--but the physical harm is the due process claim.
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1332.154,1334.202,"Well, he waived it in the criminal trial."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1337.964,1338.978,--The issue that--
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1338.978,1340.167,Why would that be different?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1340.167,1340.745,--Excuse me.
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1359.611,1365.857,Even if he thinks there is other evidence of guilt and he would rather plead guilty and get the criminal trial over again?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1368.482,1378.387,"--The state... well, again, that goes beyond the facts here, because here, it is not an issue that has only cumulative effect or some peripheral effect."
1982.81-2169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1408.093,1412.636,So you are only asking us to decide the case in which all the evidence supporting the guilty plea was the subject matter of the search?
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1412.636,1414.185,"Well, essential evidence."
1982.81-2169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1433.815,1469.601,"Mr. Lasso, I can see how someone who perhaps faced a sentence of 30 days or 60 days for the offense charged might seek to avoid Stone against Powell by simply pleading guilty and figure he'd get his hearing on the search and seizure question in a 1983 action in the federal court, but in a pending sentence of 20 or 25 years, you would think that would be far more important in the eyes of an accused than some rather putative recovery in a damages action."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1469.601,1472.786,"I couldn't agree more, Justice Rehnquist, and that is the point of this case."
1982.81-2169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1512.175,1518.095,"Well, the Fourth Circuit focused in its analysis of preclusion on incentive to litigate."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1523.203,1525.169,They seem to suggest that.
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1539.554,1540.334,Mr. Lasso... excuse me.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1540.334,1540.899,--I am sorry.
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1551.361,1564.012,"It just occurred to me that all the arguments you are making here could be made to a jury in this case, and I can't conceive of a jury bringing in more than 15 cents."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1564.012,1566.261,"Well, I would think a jury would bring in nothing--"
1982.81-2169,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1566.261,1567.138,That's right.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1571.369,1572.867,"--Well, except for one thing."
1982.81-2169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1594.845,1597.813,"Of course, that is the hope of every defendant, I suppose."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1597.813,1598.593,"--Oh, I am sure."
1982.81-2169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1598.593,1599.591,In all fields of law.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1603.124,1605.795,"That's correct, and that was my hope here."
1982.81-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1606.73,1609.073,"Well, of course, he might have won."
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1609.073,1611.464,"Pardon me, Justice?"
1982.81-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1611.464,1613.508,He might have won his suppression motion.
1982.81-2169,0,21152,david_r_lasso,,1613.508,1620.195,"Had he won his suppression motion, we would then be faced with the question of what preclusive effect, if anything, should be given to winning."
1982.81-2169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.195,1625.346,"You mean, you are suggesting that he couldn't then sue for damages?"
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,1758.495,1760.403,Thank you.
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1788.857,1792.64,"He was represented by counsel at the guilty plea, I take it."
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,1792.64,1793.747,"He was, Your Honor."
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1812.441,1814.332,He was raising that in the 1983 case?
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,1814.332,1815.018,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1816.332,1817.689,Let me be sure I have that clear.
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,1825.688,1826.577,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1836.306,1842.445,"Well, do you know of any authority that allows the setting aside of a guilty plea in a 1983 action?"
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,1842.445,1845.915,"He is not attempting to set aside the guilty plea, Your Honor."
1982.81-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.216,1871.245,Did the Fourth Circuit rely on that aspect of the case?
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,1871.245,1873.402,The court did not at all rely on that.
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1965.38,1970.739,What issues in your view were litigated on the guilty plea?
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,1976.142,1981.906,That a factual basis exists for the elements... finding the elements of the offense.
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1981.906,1986.215,And that there were no valid defenses?
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,1986.215,1990.009,"No, they waived valid defenses."
1982.81-2169,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2157.723,2159.864,Was that referring to the Souders case?
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2159.864,2160.909,"--No, it was not."
1982.81-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2167.503,2174.593,"Mr. Townsend, supposing we were simply talking about diversity of jurisdiction here, and it wasn't a 1983 case at all."
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2192.663,2209.516,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, particularly in light of the question... in light of the fact that Virginia law, although there is no Supreme Court case particularly on the question of suppression of evidence, neither is there a Circuit Court case dealing with that."
1982.81-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.699,2233.476,"You say that Souders is no closer even if it were a Supreme Court of Virginia decision on the merits, than the cases you have cited?"
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2233.476,2261.95,"--It would be a closer question, to be sure, had it been rendered by the United... I mean, by the Virginia Supreme Court, because it is a Fourth Amendment question in some respects, although the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals was looking for an issue dealing with the admissibility of evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds, and this... the court... the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals was very carefully to narrowly construe or narrowly answer that particular question and no other question."
1982.81-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.698,2310.055,Is there a way we can examine that decision ourselves?
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2310.055,2312.242,"The Souders decision, Your Honor?"
1982.81-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2321.362,2333.186,"Suppose we thought it was very relevant to the issue, different from you, and that the Court of Appeals didn't know about it."
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2351.943,2354.537,"--Well, I believe that--"
1982.81-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2354.537,2358.456,That there is preclusion.
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2371.171,2374.17,--I think that that would probably be the result.
1982.81-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.17,2375.122,"Well, what about this case then?"
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2377.15,2378.495,Not that I am aware of.
1982.81-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.801,2400.36,"Well, we can't... Let's suppose you agreed that Souders was right on, and that it was contrary to what the Court of Appeals said Virginia law was."
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2404.484,2405.686,It was or was not?
1982.81-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2405.686,2406.875,It was not.
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2406.875,2412.608,"I would think that if it were on all fours, the Court would probably be required--"
1982.81-2169,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2412.608,2413.341,To remand.
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2413.341,2429.27,"--or would probably remand to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of that decision, but I would point out again that the Virginia Supreme Court has expressly said that denial of writ of error is a discretionary review, and such denials have no precedential effect."
1982.81-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2429.27,2449.715,"Well, Mr. Townsend, do you see the inquiry to be made by a Court of Appeals or a District Court here in determining what state law is for purposes of preclusion to be any different than the inquiry of a state... of a federal court sitting in a diversity case trying to ascertain what state law is?"
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2449.715,2458.072,I believe that there is some difference in the fact that a 1983 action is different than a diversity action.
1982.81-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2465.598,2479.578,"But so far as preclusion is concerned, I gather that the focus of the Fourth Circuit and, I take it, the focus of your argument here that Virginia law is such and such is... the object is to find out what Virginia law is."
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2479.578,2491.26,"I believe that if this Court... our position is that the Virginia law is settled that criminal convictions, whether by plea or by trial, have no collateral estoppel effect in Virginia."
1982.81-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2516.05,2516.924,Would you--
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2523.872,2525.622,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-2169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2525.622,2529.48,"Justice Stevens, for the last three hours, he has been trying to get a question."
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2531.153,2532.26,I will certainly give him the opportunity.
1982.81-2169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2532.26,2552.955,"I just wanted to ask you... I thank you, Brother Marshall... is it not a fact that in the Souders case the plea of guilty was to assault and battery of a police officer, which was flatly inconsistent with the civil claim of excessive force, so that that case is quite different from this?"
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2552.955,2554.016,It is.
1982.81-2169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2554.016,2564.279,"Here, there is nothing inconsistent with the plea of guilty to possession of controlled substances and still having an illegal search, but there it seems to me it is... I don't know why we have to wrestle with that case."
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2564.279,2565.527,I don't believe that we do.
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2766.429,2768.851,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, counsel."
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2768.851,2769.381,Thank you.
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2769.381,2788.532,"Mr. Townsend, you may continue."
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2788.532,2790.719,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2813.441,2828.752,"But isn't it the obligation of the court as under Rule 11 of the federal system that a court will not accept a guilty plea unless he is satisfied, unless the court is satisfied of guilt in fact and in law?"
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2828.752,2833.778,"Yes, Mr. Prosise is not contesting the fact that he is guilty in fact of--"
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2833.778,2834.795,And in law.
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2834.795,2841.028,"--And in law, and he is not contesting the legality of that conviction, nor is he seeking relief from custody."
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2841.028,2846.382,I got an intimation that you were suggesting something to the contrary in your first statement.
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2846.382,2850.787,"No, I... if I did imply that, I didn't mean to, and I am sorry."
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2867.185,2872.403,I still find that statement inconsistent with your immediately prior response.
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2872.403,2906.858,"--Mr. Prosise is not questioning his factual guilt, but there are other individuals besides Mr. Prosise that this decision will impact upon, and I was just getting at the point that the Court shouldn't adopt an incentive to litigate analysis or necessarily collaterally estop essential elements of the offense because of the fact that a plea by itself doesn't necessarily--"
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2906.858,2911.561,Suppose he had gone to trial and had been found guilty.
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2913.87,2917.228,--And had not litigated the issues?
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2917.228,2922.286,"Well, if he went to trial, I assume he would litigate everything that he conceivably thought he could litigate."
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2922.286,2946.45,"I think the question of whether he would be precluded then is already answered by Allen versus McCurry, that had he litigated those, he definitely would be precluded, absent a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that could then be established in the District Court, but I think that question is already answered clearly by this Court's decision in Allen."
1982.81-2169,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2946.45,2949.476,Mr. Townsend--
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2949.476,2950.026,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-2169,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2950.026,2954.367,--both of the courts below ruled on the excessive force issue.
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2959.475,2980.232,"I think the court felt that it was improper to reach the merits of the question because collateral estoppel being a defense to the merits was more appropriately addressed, and that the merits needn't be reached because Mr. Prosise didn't have the right to bring the suit in the first--"
1982.81-2169,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2980.232,2984.794,Wasn't the issue of excessive force also addressed to the merits?
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2984.794,2988.448,--There was no collateral estoppel claim made as to the excessive force charge.
1982.81-2169,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2992.461,2993.553,Only to it?
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2993.553,2994.742,"Excuse me, sir?"
1982.81-2169,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2994.742,2995.631,Only to that?
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,2995.631,2996.77,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-2169,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2996.77,3002.237,"The district judge found the search was valid, and then went on and addressed the collateral estoppel issue."
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,3002.237,3013.25,"I don't think... well, as an initial matter, I think the District Court misunderstood the allegations of the Fourth Amendment issue."
1982.81-2169,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3036.927,3041.739,Did someone make a finding that there may have been consent to this search?
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,3041.739,3048.127,--The... I don't believe there was a finding of consent to the search.
1982.81-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3117.019,3131.854,"Mr. Townsend, was the grounds upon which the District Court granted summary judgment on the Fourth Amendment claim solely collateral estoppel, or was it both collateral estoppel and on the merits of the claim?"
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,3131.854,3137.258,"--No, I believe... it was not solely on collateral estoppel, but neither was it on collateral estoppel on the merits."
1982.81-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3152.942,3158.83,So you say the District Court didn't grant summary judgment on the merits of the Fourth Amendment claim?
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,3158.83,3160.343,"No, the District Court did not."
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3362.996,3371.38,"Well, when you say the Petitioners want their conviction, who gave them that conviction?"
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,3371.38,3379.753,"Mr. Prosise, and he is not seeking in any way to avoid his guilty plea now, although he did initially attempt to withdraw his guilty plea."
1982.81-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3445.743,3459.548,"Mr. Townsend, what if the Fourth Circuit is affirmed here and your case goes to trial and your client is still in jail, and the Virginia authorities say, you know, that he doesn't have parole coming, he can't get out of jail?"
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,3462.844,3467.109,"Well, as a factual matter, Mr. Prosise is not in jail."
1982.81-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3467.109,3470.295,What happened to the 20-year term?
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,3470.295,3477.041,"The 25-year term was reduced to 12 years, and under Virginia parole guidelines, he has now made parole."
1982.81-2169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3492.974,3494.394,Testificanum.
1982.81-2169,1,37318,norman_a_townsend,,3494.394,3505.842,"--ad testificanum, rather, excuse me, would permit the federal court to bring Mr. Prosise from the jail to the District Court for resolution of the problem."
1982.81-2169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3642.084,3642.958,Very well.
1982.81-2169,2,21152,david_r_lasso,,3644.381,3650.83,"Mr. Chief Justice, a few brief remarks on rebuttal."
1982.81-2169,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3817.609,3820.717,Could he have then made a motion to suppress?
1982.81-2169,2,21152,david_r_lasso,,3820.717,3823.712,It may be that at that point... it was the sentencing hearing.
1982.81-2169,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3863.401,3869.789,I suppose the state would perhaps rather have no exclusionary rule at all?
1982.81-2169,2,21152,david_r_lasso,,3869.789,3874.086,I am sure many people would support the taking away of--
1982.81-2169,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3874.086,3884.673,In which event if the Fourth Amendment means anything there would be suits for unlawful searches.
1982.81-2169,2,21152,david_r_lasso,,3884.673,3886.47,--That's correct.
1982.81-2169,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3919.582,3920.518,"Thank you, gentlemen."
