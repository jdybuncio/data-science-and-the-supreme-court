2016.15-1358,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.835,"We'll hear argument next this morning in case 15-1358, Ziglar v. Abbasi. Mr. Gershengorn. IN NOS. 15-1358 AND 15-1359."
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,7.835,61.75,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case marks the return of Iqbal as Plaintiffs seek to hold essentially the same defendants liable for the same actions arising in the same extraordinary circumstances in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks. All of the judges below concluded that Plaintiffs' core theory is squarely foreclosed by Iqbal. But the Second Circuit majority then formulated its own list merger theory of liability, premising liability on the alleged decision of Attorney General Ashcroft to merge the New York list of detainees, which had not been fully vetted, with the INS list, thereby continuing the hold-until-cleared policy for detainees on both lists. Bivens' liability does not attach here for at least three reasons. First, the Bivens remedy should not be extended to national security and immigration policy decisions by senior officials in the wake of the September 11 attacks."
2016.15-1358,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,121.78,138.12,"But you -- you seem to be assuming that the whole case is about the merging of the New York list with the other list, but I thought that this was -- this case was identified as a prison conditions case."
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,138.12,141.21,"So, Your Honor, that broader theory was raised below."
2016.15-1358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,316.45,320.235,"This went on for several months, eight months."
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,320.235,323.65,I think the list merger decision is early on in the --
2016.15-1358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,323.65,324.18,"Yes, but weren't --"
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,324.18,324.83,And that's where --
2016.15-1358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,324.83,326.41,-- weren't they held for eight months?
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,326.41,328.66,"They were held longer, and there's no doubt that the clear --"
2016.15-1358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,328.66,329.05,No I can --
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,329.05,329.69,-- longer than it should.
2016.15-1358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,329.69,331.15,So I can understand after a bomb attack.
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,430.75,438.78,"Your Honor, because I think the core of the allegation against Ashcroft and Mueller is not that they prolonged the -- prolonged the detention."
2016.15-1358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,448.3,451.165,How long after 9/11 did they adopt that policy?
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,451.165,455.24,I believe it was in the -- within the first months after 9/11.
2016.15-1358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,455.24,456.29,First months.
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,456.29,456.635,Yeah.
2016.15-1358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,456.635,457.91,How many months?
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,457.91,460.56,"Your Honor, I -- the -- I apologize."
2016.15-1358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,461.38,462.91,Was it more like eight months or more like --
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,462.91,463.35,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-1358,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,519.04,519.7,But what about --
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,519.7,520.01,-- the second --
2016.15-1358,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.01,527.695,"-- what about the -- it's one thing, as Justice Breyer pointed out, to say you initially hold these people."
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,551.12,574.89,"Your Honor, they -- well, they are being held in restrictive conditions of confinement, but those conditions are lawful as to folks with individualized suspicion. Now, the -- the -- there is -- the -- the core of the claim that the Second Circuit saw against Attorney General Ashcroft was the decision to submit the individuals to the -- to the restrictive conditions in the first place."
2016.15-1358,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,629.82,634.43,Is the argument you're presenting a -- a Bivens argument or a qualified immunity argument?
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,634.43,639.81,"So, Your Honor, the argument we've been discussing now is the qualified immunity, Iqbal argument."
2016.15-1358,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,702.05,707.16,Is -- is there -- the APA argument strikes me as -- as somewhat odd.
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,715.735,723.01,"It is an available remedy, and indeed it was used here by -- invoked by some and those folks were released."
2016.15-1358,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,754.31,766.055,"How could they have -- how could they have access to habeas when they were locked up without access to a lawyer, without access to a telephone?"
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,766.055,776.08,"So, Your Honor, there were individuals who did file habeas petitions and -- and those individuals were largely released before the claims could be adjudicated."
2016.15-1358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,794.275,818.28,"I suppose that in 1942, there was a president or a secretary of defense who decided let's take 140,000 people -- 60,000, 70,000 citizens and 60,000 noncitizens -- and lock them up for ten years or five years or four years. All right."
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,868.105,870.68,"So, Your Honor, I guess I would say a few things to that."
2016.15-1358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,873.87,874.56,"No, not at all."
2016.15-1358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,874.56,877.87,I used a historic example and I'm not worried about this case.
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,877.87,879.55,-- arrested for an immigration violation --
2016.15-1358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,879.55,879.67,"Yeah, yeah."
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,879.67,881.68,-- in the context of a specific investigation.
2016.15-1358,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,881.68,881.91,Okay.
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,882.89,892.245,"Even with respect to Your Honor's hypo, I think it actually points up the problem with extending Bivens to national security policy decisions and to policy decisions in general."
2016.15-1358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,924.13,933.77,"But wasn't -- what's the best authority you have for saying that, assuming there's a Bivens action that has to be cut off at the lower level of officials, it can't be to the highest officials? What -- what authority do we have?"
2016.15-1358,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,933.77,935.92,"It's not the highest level of officials, Your Honor."
2016.15-1358,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,949.845,969.905,"Thank you, General. Mr. Lamken. IN NO. 15-1363."
2016.15-1358,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,969.905,982.675,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please -- please the Court: On behalf of Misters Hasty and Sherman, I wanted to begin with qualified immunity, in particular with respect to the official conditions."
2016.15-1358,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1011.22,1016.83,Who determined the level of -- of restriction? This -- this was not just restriction.
2016.15-1358,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1017.98,1024.82,"Your Honor, the answer is that the BOP directed that you would use the most restrictive conditions permissible."
2016.15-1358,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1101.34,1110.12,What about -- what about all the conduct that was not directed by the attorney general or the FBI?
2016.15-1358,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1110.12,1111.31,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1358,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1117.965,1118.58,Yes.
2016.15-1358,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1124.42,1125.27,Yeah.
2016.15-1358,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1180.23,1186.735,"You're -- you're in charge of a detention facility, and all these things are going on."
2016.15-1358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1197.995,1207.9,And the allegation is that he deliberately did not take a routine inspection of that particular portion of the prison in order to be willfully blind as to what was going on.
2016.15-1358,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1207.9,1216.11,"Well, there's -- there's no doubt that misconduct occurred and there's no doubt that Mr. Hasty actually sees the complaints, because that's part of the grievance process."
2016.15-1358,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1236.29,1244.805,How could that pinpoint one particular moment in time when this is ongoing behavior?
2016.15-1358,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1244.805,1253.68,And I think the answer is that you pinpoint his awareness and the injuries that these Respondents are claiming damages for.
2016.15-1358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1253.68,1282.835,"And you say it in paragraph -- in paragraph 74, it says, ""Indeed, after a few months of interacting with the plaintiffs, the MDC defendants"" -- I take it those are the people we're talking about -- ""realized that they were not terrorists, but merely immigration detainees; yet the restrictive conditions and harsh treatment continued."" So what is that but an allegation that they did know about it and they did continue the harsh treatment?"
2016.15-1358,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1282.835,1295.435,"So, Justice Breyer, referring specifically to the unofficial abuses by the guards as opposed to the official conditions, temporarily, what's missing there is what happened afterwards."
2016.15-1358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1303.44,1306.6,It is their restrictive conditions and harsh treatment.
2016.15-1358,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1307.26,1307.48,That's true.
2016.15-1358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1307.48,1308.84,-- in the complaint they have a list.
2016.15-1358,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1308.84,1325.56,"And that's exactly the difficulty, is that he's aware of harsh treatment generally and, therefore, he must be liable for all harsh treatment that occurs after that awareness. You cannot say that here there is abuses generally with no particular time frame and then hold him liable for every intentional tort that occurs in the institution."
2016.15-1358,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1450.45,1467.54,"So if the official policy that was adopted that we want to beat the prisoners, you know, every day and that was the FBI policy and it's communicated down, the prison administrator has no choice but to carry out that policy?"
2016.15-1358,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1467.54,1468.26,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-1358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1535.23,1540.06,"Anything about the hypothetical I gave, of course, is a real one, not this case."
2016.15-1358,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1545.32,1546.14,Well --
2016.15-1358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1546.14,1546.78,I mean --
2016.15-1358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1546.78,1549.1,-- that was a pure hypothetical -- you get my point.
2016.15-1358,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1549.1,1549.68,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-1358,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1554.34,1559.45,"This -- sometimes in Bivens, there are many, many remedies in the judicial system."
2016.15-1358,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1559.45,1566.27,"We have habeas, we have -- there's an FTCA claim that was brought by the predecessors of these plaintiffs in which they recovered money on in a settlement."
2016.15-1358,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1578.635,1588.2,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Meeropol."
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,1588.2,1601.045,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court: Under Petitioners' theory, any Muslim or Arab noncitizen present in this country could be placed for months in solitary confinement for violating the immigration law."
2016.15-1358,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1616.72,1633.085,"Does that role include the shaping and an announcement, really, of private damages remedies? We've been very explicit about the restraint in extending the Bivens action beyond its original contours."
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,1633.085,1635.11,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-1358,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1687.67,1690.695,That -- that was -- that was failure to give medical treatment.
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,1690.695,1692.545,That's correct in Carlson.
2016.15-1358,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1692.545,1709.39,"And there's -- there's been Bivens, the gender discrimination case, and Coleman v. Miller, I think, the -- the medical -- denial of medical treatment."
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,1709.39,1710.07,"Carlson, yes."
2016.15-1358,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1710.07,1716.61,"But the -- but -- yes. But we've been very careful in subject and places to say, we go no further."
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,1730.945,1744.985,"Well, if it is a new Bivens cause of action, Your Honor, I submit that it is an appropriate one here. Now, what the DOJ Petitioners argue is that Bivens should not be extended because they were setting national security and immigration policy."
2016.15-1358,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1776.69,1778.05,I'm not sure I understand your point.
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,1795.57,1796.59,"That's correct, your Honor."
2016.15-1358,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1796.59,1804.35,It was to detain those individuals until they were properly cleared and could be -- could be released.
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,1828.185,1831.285,This does arise in a national security context.
2016.15-1358,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1856.625,1859.65,I guess my point is -- is a different one.
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,1919.465,1926.42,"Well, it is certainly true that the Court has stepped back from freely implying private causes of action."
2016.15-1358,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1966.28,2000.065,"I understand that. But the point made by your friend on the other side, though, of overdeterrence, when you have the attorney general, the director of the FBI, the director of INS sitting down and making -- what are we going to do to respond to this crisis, and -- and people in the -- were of -- old enough, 9/11, sort of have a better sense of what that crisis was like. And if you imply a Bivens actions, one of the things they're going to enter into, what is best, what is appropriate, and presumably also, what's constitutional."
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2021.93,2041.45,"I have two responses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, qualified immunity creates a powerful protection for Federal officials who are undertaking a good-faith effort to protect our national security, which everyone agrees is of paramount concern, but who do so believing their actions to be lawful, even if they are mistaken."
2016.15-1358,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2062.74,2073.88,"I'll ask you one other thing, which is, has this been fully argued out below? I mean, I think it is an enormously important and very open question."
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2130.68,2131.11,Uh-huh.
2016.15-1358,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2131.11,2143.025,"Has that been fully argued in this case? If I go and look in the record, can I find a question that I have wondered about for quite a long time fully answered?"
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2143.025,2159.03,"I -- I don't believe so. I -- I think the question you're posing is whether damages would actually be a less intrusive remedy in this situation than allowing for an injunctive relief claim at the outset, if I understand your -- your question correctly."
2016.15-1358,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2159.03,2160.01,In a set of cases.
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2160.01,2161.05,And -- and yes.
2016.15-1358,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2262.58,2264.33,We're talking about adequate remedies.
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2289.02,2291.355,There were some habeas petitions filed.
2016.15-1358,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2461.49,2475.865,"If -- if we -- if we hold that our previous cases instruct that we should not go further with Bivens, you still have Section 1985(3). Can officials conspire with each other?"
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2475.865,2477.88,"Yes, absolutely."
2016.15-1358,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2477.88,2483.69,Is there -- is there -- I was thinking of the -- is -- is there precedent on that in your point?
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2483.69,2484.56,It -- in this case --
2016.15-1358,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2484.56,2485.105,In your favor?
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2485.105,2485.57,Yes.
2016.15-1358,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2512.68,2518.75,Is there precedent in your favor on this point that there can be this conspiracy if -- if it's established by the facts?
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2518.75,2519.65,Yes.
2016.15-1358,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2524.78,2538.21,"What -- what is so fact-intensive about the argument that government officials -- the government is the entity and officials within that same entity don't conspire among themselves, they're just doing their -- doing their jobs?"
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2538.21,2545.205,"Well, I think it depends on the role of the high-level officials vis-à-vis the low-level officials at the Metropolitan Detention Center."
2016.15-1358,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2609.4,2611.07,That's Carlson v. Green?
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2611.07,2612.93,"Yes, exactly."
2016.15-1358,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2612.93,2623.635,"I thought the -- the Second Circuit majority said yes as to Hasty, Hasty, deliberate indifference, but not as to Sherman."
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2623.635,2624.81,That's correct.
2016.15-1358,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2679.16,2689.075,"Well, would that -- were they -- were those conditions constitutional as to individuals about whom the FBI had reasonable suspicion of a connection with terrorism?"
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2689.075,2690.6,That would depend.
2016.15-1358,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2702.41,2703.98,Is your argument dependent on that?
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2703.98,2704.37,No --
2016.15-1358,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2704.37,2712.55,The proposition that it would be unconstitutional even as to those who have -- with respect to whom the FBI had reasonable suspicion?
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2712.55,2713.12,No.
2016.15-1358,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2739.67,2755.23,"The whole position as I understand it, the way it was presented today, was that the FBI had a list and the -- there was no way they could determine what degree of information the FBI had as to any particular person."
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2755.23,2759.9,But they were told what information the FBI was relying on.
2016.15-1358,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2772.48,2788.535,With all the information? Do you -- you think that the FBI in a -- in a sensitive -- investigation of something sensitive like this about terrorism would necessarily have told people at MDC every bit of information they had connecting people with -- with terrorism?
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2788.535,2803.645,"Well, our factual allegation was that they were told all the information that was relevant to the threat that the men posed to the institution. And also important here is what the OIG has explained about the meaning of the -- of the of-interest designation."
2016.15-1358,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2870.489,2877.36,The FBI goes into a rooming house after having information there's a nuclear weapon on the floor.
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2902.475,2902.88,Well --
2016.15-1358,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2902.88,2904.905,And we also know there was a nuclear weapon.
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,2911.04,2915.12,"Well, we don't challenge the fact that these men were detained at all."
2016.15-1358,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3050.09,3069.81,"Well, I suppose one answer would be the normal injunctive action would challenge the constitutionality of the policy, which would seem, at least at first blush, to be a more appropriate way of doing it than to -- than individual damages actions against officials responsible."
2016.15-1358,2,62796,rachel_meeropol,,3069.81,3082.685,"But an injunctive -- an injunctive claim, while it could stop, currently, current unconstitutional conduct cannot deter future unconstitutional conduct from occurring."
2016.15-1358,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3176.665,3183.77,"Thank you, counsel. General Gershengorn, four minutes. IN NOS. 15-1358 AND 15-1359."
2016.15-1358,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3183.77,3193.71,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A few quick points. First, a few short corrections of the record, although I apologize for the confusion about the date."
2016.15-1358,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3217.595,3218.0,What was --
2016.15-1358,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3218.0,3218.53,I'd like to make --
2016.15-1358,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3218.53,3219.555,What was the date of that?
2016.15-1358,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3219.555,3221.25,"That was September 20, 2001."
2016.15-1358,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3351.615,3353.04,Just one point on -- on 1985.
2016.15-1358,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3362.035,3362.85,That -- so --
2016.15-1358,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3362.85,3363.38,That's different.
2016.15-1358,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3363.38,3368.51,"With respect to the interagency conspiracy, I think that suggests even the right wasn't involved."
2016.15-1358,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3438.9,3452.16,"Thank you, counsel. General Gershengorn, before you leave the podium, I'd like to note that the Court thanks you for your service to the Court as acting Solicitor General over the past many months."
2016.15-1358,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3452.16,3452.86,Thank you.
2016.15-1358,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3452.86,0.0,The case is submitted.
