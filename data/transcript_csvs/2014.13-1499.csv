2014.13-1499,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.653,"We'll hear argument next in case 13-1499, Williams-Yulee v. the Florida Bar."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,7.542,10.806,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1499,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,63.738,75.702,"Mr. Pincus, whatever the standard, suppose the Florida rule was simply no face-to-face solicitations."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,86.007,92.785,"Well, I certainly would concede it in this case, Your Honor, because my client did not engage in any face-to-face solicitation."
2014.13-1499,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,94.988,102.722,I want to understand your view of the scope of the First Amendment in relation to the selection of -- the election of judges.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,102.722,115.108,"I think a state could adopt a prophylactic rule prohibiting face-to-face solicitation, certainly one-on-one solicitation and perhaps as some states have done solicitations in larger groups."
2014.13-1499,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,134.067,139.315,But the First Amendment would not allow that for the candidate for political office.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,139.315,140.766,Exactly.
2014.13-1499,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,140.766,160.103,So you are making it -- you are recognizing that there's a difference between judicial office -- that the First Amendment allows the State to do things with respect to the election of judges that it wouldn't allow them to do with respect to the election of members of the legislature.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,160.103,169.907,"Well, I guess I would amend my answer to say that -- that the First Amendment might allow a ban on some solicitations on a coercion theory."
2014.13-1499,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,175.549,182.673,"Yeah, but I just asked you -- you gave me an answer and now are you telling me that that answer was ill considered?"
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,199.368,218.453,"I think it would be judged by the same strict scrutiny standard, but I think the interests that the government could advance in support of that restriction in the judicial context, one of them doesn't exist in the legislative context, the interest in preventing bias or in preserving impartiality."
2014.13-1499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,241.756,250.865,"But if you had the statute that you say would be valid barring face-to-face discrimination, then you have all sorts of gradations."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,276.52,277.365,I think--
2014.13-1499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,277.365,288.421,"It seems to me when you make the initial concession, you have a real problem in determining how to make this not over or under-inclusive."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,288.421,290.905,"--I don't think so, Justice Kennedy."
2014.13-1499,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,315.848,316.706,"Well, which is it?"
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,323.19,324.875,"--I guess I would say ""in person"", Your Honor."
2014.13-1499,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,324.875,325.767,In person.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,325.767,341.323,"I think the question here -- again, just to back up for a minute, is in -- I think in all of the contexts that we're talking about here, the interest is whether the person solicited is being coerced."
2014.13-1499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.323,342.602,Back all the way up--
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,342.602,343.241,Sure.
2014.13-1499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.241,348.522,--and give us the three interests that you started off saying were at issue here.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,350.144,351.785,"I didn't, sorry, Your Honor."
2014.13-1499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.785,353.673,"Oh, it's your fault."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,355.424,357.44,There are three interests.
2014.13-1499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.494,375.51,What about the interest in judicial dignity?
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,375.51,377.007,"Well, that--"
2014.13-1499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.007,381.098,"I mean, there's stuff we don't let judges do that we let other people do."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,414.758,419.379,"--Well, I -- I think there is such an interest, we acknowledge that in our brief."
2014.13-1499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,427.534,429.109,"No, no, but answer my question."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,429.752,431.016,--Would it be okay to--
2014.13-1499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.016,432.704,An interest in judicial dignity.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,436.966,450.364,"--I think there is such an interest, and I think it's executed principally through the acts of judges as judges and maybe is best analyzed under the government employee free speech rubric."
2014.13-1499,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,487.538,499.58,--So if Florida law didn't let them do that -- what I'm trying to find out is if you think you can have different rules for judicial elections than you can have for political elections.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,512.792,514.98,--Well--
2014.13-1499,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,514.98,515.885,And they--
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,515.885,519.476,"--To answer your question, Justice Ginsburg, yes, there can be different rules."
2014.13-1499,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,549.213,568.816,--Suppose a state's view is we want the -- our judiciary to be above the political fray so we have this kind of restriction on putting themselves forward as -- as the solicitor.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,568.816,571.783,"Well, a couple of answers, Your Honor."
2014.13-1499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,620.808,622.54,"Well, how can the judge not know?"
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,631.271,640.595,"--Well, there are some states that prohibit the judge from finding out who -- who knows; Minnesota, for example, has that prohibition."
2014.13-1499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,640.595,643.312,"Well, that -- it seems that -- that's just unworkable."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,643.312,651.532,"I think there's a question about how effective it is, but I do think that undermine -- underlies what's really going on here."
2014.13-1499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,662.447,669.727,"So you're suggesting that there could be a mass mailing, but the judge somehow could be prevented from knowing who responded?"
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,669.727,673.989,"--Well, that is the rule in some states and I don't--"
2014.13-1499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,673.989,680.033,I'm asking you whether or not that is consistent with your theory of where we can draw the constitutional line.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,680.033,701.384,"--Well, I don't -- I think the Court could conclude, as -- as the Eighth Circuit did, that in Minnesota, a state like that, where the judge doesn't know, there is even less of a -- of a reason to prohibit solicitations because the judge isn't going to know who responded."
2014.13-1499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.384,705.416,"Good, honest, Midwestern state, they're not going to tell."
2014.13-1499,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,705.416,710.692,Could I go back to judicial dignity coercion.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,747.913,751.589,"Well, two, I don't think so, Your Honor."
2014.13-1499,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,759.537,760.554,"Well, I--"
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,760.554,761.09,But I -- I think--
2014.13-1499,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,761.09,762.21,--Because she was unknown.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,762.21,762.234,--even when she--
2014.13-1499,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,762.234,772.962,But I'm talking about this -- this is -- this prohibition is dealing with an issue that does happen in the vast majority of cases.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,772.962,776.994,"--I guess, here's the contrast, Your Honor, if I may."
2014.13-1499,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,812.495,813.041,Well--
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,813.041,815.619,--in an area where we're talking to about compelling interest.
2014.13-1499,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,815.619,834.002,"--that's -- that's what you think, but I can actually see how receiving a signed letter from the judge saying, give, and -- or a telephone call or a personal meeting has an incrementally greater impact than a letter."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,855.429,872.392,"And I think that's why, at least one line that -- that I think is permissible in my response to Justice Ginsburg is a line between written communications and oral communications, either one-to-one or in-person communications one-to-one in a small group."
2014.13-1499,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,917.994,929.1,Is there anything in -- in the Florida rules -- I couldn't find it -- that would prohibit Judge Jones in your example from giving the committee a list of people to contact?
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,929.1,937.94,I -- there is a rule that says that judges can't -- or candidates can't do indirectly what they do directly.
2014.13-1499,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,944.498,970.302,"But your problem -- problem, in a way to decide this, and it's a sort of joke but it's so true in the experience of the court of appeals that I had, my brother in the district court, district court judges I know, in State and Federal systems, that the normal response to a lawyer -- by a lawyer to a judge in any minor request or, you know, something normal, the answer is yes."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1040.368,1044.943,"Well, I -- I think, a couple of things, Your Honor."
2014.13-1499,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1061.469,1069.229,"No, that's if you're maybe you're looking for something -- when -- when somebody else writes the letter, somebody else makes the request."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1069.229,1070.83,--But--
2014.13-1499,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1070.83,1076.273,This is so instinctive but my instinct is it's not the same thing.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1076.273,1078.462,--But they're making the request on the behalf of the judge.
2014.13-1499,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1078.462,1078.475,Right.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1078.475,1080.242,I think that's the critical factor--
2014.13-1499,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1080.242,1080.647,So why is--
2014.13-1499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1080.647,1083.115,"I mean, it doesn't -- it doesn't just go to a lawyer either."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1087.846,1088.392,--It is--
2014.13-1499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1088.392,1098.624,"It's anybody, which really makes me think that it has more to do with judicial dignity than -- than the corruption stuff we've been talking about."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1100.465,1103.681,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2014.13-1499,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1105.448,1111.897,--Isn't the proof of the pudding in what Justice Breyer is saying in the statistics?
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1139.702,1141.542,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2014.13-1499,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.984,1187.882,"I think -- I think you'd find the same statistics true with respect to political candidates, that they do much better when they -- when they put the arm on you personally, rather than having somebody else contact you."
2014.13-1499,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1190.253,1192.332,"Well, that's the point, isn't it?"
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1192.332,1193.986,"Well, I think it's only the point to--"
2014.13-1499,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1193.986,1194.501,When you put the arm--
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1194.501,1195.25,--I'm sorry.
2014.13-1499,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1237.559,1256.097,"Mr. Pincus, I take it it follows a fortiori, from what you're saying, that the Federal canon that applies to us is unconstitutional, at least as respects to written communications, so we're not allowed to put our name on fund-raising materials and things like that."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1260.032,1261.295,"No, I don't think so, Your Honor."
2014.13-1499,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1284.349,1286.085,"I'm sorry, I really didn't get that."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1291.598,1294.161,You're Federal employees.
2014.13-1499,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1309.59,1313.416,So Florida could regulate the already elected judge when he's running for reelection?
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1313.416,1314.995,"Well, I think--"
2014.13-1499,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1314.995,1321.539,"And he could say, we have a rule: Judges don't solicit, period, for charities, for themselves."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1336.237,1348.322,"--No, I don't think so, Your Honor, because I think this is speech in a different category any -- any more than the government can say, we're going to use Pickering to respect the solicitation speech of a sitting congressman or State legislature."
2014.13-1499,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1357.608,1365.863,"--But, you know, I would think -- I would think it's -- it's just opposite, right, that in a case for Federal judges -- like you say, there's not really much of an interest."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1394.548,1396.345,"--I think that's wrong on two counts, Your Honor."
2014.13-1499,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1406.974,1407.416,"Well, you're -- I'm sorry."
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1408.0,1414.84,"--I'm sorry -- contributes in any way to the protection of that interest seems inconceivable if the question is, is there bias?"
2014.13-1499,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1432.551,1432.941,Yes.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1464.675,1476.483,"--I think if the State wanted to adopt a system of public financing for judicial candidates, that it might well then be constitutional for the State to ban solicitations on the McConnell theory."
2014.13-1499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1476.483,1477.7,What about the answer to Justice Kagan's question?
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1479.463,1479.51,I don't think--
2014.13-1499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1479.51,1483.426,"--Oh, well, I'm not going to answer that question because we -- we can think about something else?"
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1483.426,1487.07,"--I think the answer to that question is no, because the contributions are still permissible."
2014.13-1499,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1520.603,1530.209,The whole -- but the whole effort on Florida's part is to make the selection of judges not like the political context.
2014.13-1499,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1542.555,1545.007,"Well, respectfully, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't think so."
2014.13-1499,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1564.976,1568.24,"If I may, Mr. Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."
2014.13-1499,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1568.24,1569.424,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1499,1,18003,barry_richard,,1575.437,1578.421,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.497,1618.589,Unless it's a thank you note.
2014.13-1499,1,18003,barry_richard,,1618.589,1619.701,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-1499,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1621.386,1627.757,"I mean, once you say you can send a thank you note, what -- what you've just said is not true."
2014.13-1499,1,18003,barry_richard,,1627.757,1637.942,"--Well, if -- if what we focus on, which is what my colleague and opposing counsel focused on, is the intimidation issue, I agree with you."
2014.13-1499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1663.218,1664.825,"Well, but there's not always such an appearance."
2014.13-1499,1,18003,barry_richard,,1683.879,1696.266,"I think, Your Honor, that what we deal with here, in response to your question, is similar in kind to this issue of how many people are being addressed."
2014.13-1499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1718.849,1723.474,"Well, there's a difference between micromanaging and overinclusiveness or under-inclusiveness."
2014.13-1499,1,18003,barry_richard,,1729.174,1730.25,"--It could be, Your Honor."
2014.13-1499,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1770.329,1776.873,I -- I -- be careful with that line because there's a number of Justices on the Court that dissented from that--
2014.13-1499,1,18003,barry_richard,,1776.873,1777.544,I--

2014.13-1499,1,18003,barry_richard,,2608.233,2632.676,"--I disagree with that, Your Honor, and I find it curious that the Petitioner would suggest that if we take the restrictions off of incumbent judges so that they're now free to call lawyers who appear before them or litigants who might be appearing before them and ask for money, that that wouldn't give the incumbent an enormous advantage over non-incumbent judges."
2014.13-1499,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2643.557,2653.702,"Well, I'm sorry, but you -- up to this point you've been saying what a significant difference it makes whether someone can solicit in person or not, and that's why you've drawn the line there."
