1962.62,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.039,"-- Northern Natural Gas Company, Appellant, versus State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas."
1962.62,0,35406,mark_h_adams,,10.226,17.683,"Mr. Chief Justice, gentlemen of this Court."
1962.62,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,213.658,214.815,In what brief is that?
1962.62,0,35406,mark_h_adams,,214.815,218.365,In the first memorandum filed in behalf of the Federal Power Commission.
1962.62,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,218.365,220.485,Oh yes.
1962.62,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,220.485,221.884,April 24th?
1962.62,0,35406,mark_h_adams,,221.884,225.942,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.62,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,531.038,537.255,"I'd -- I didn't get that last, just that last statement in what the Commission did."
1962.62,0,35406,mark_h_adams,,537.255,562.037,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think maybe if I amplified it a little bit, it'd be -- the Kansas Corporation Commission in 1944 promulgated what they call the basic proration order for the Kansas Hugoton Field."
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3273.424,3283.234,"If it please the Court, the appellants ask the state ratable state orders on the grounds they are void under the Supremacy Clause."
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3458.496,3459.652,May I ask you this question?
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3459.652,3461.062,Yes sir.
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3461.062,3481.832,"Suppose they had a contract outstanding to buy from 10 people, had a fixed price in companies [Inaudible] and this order required them to go out and make new contracts which [Inaudible] more people whatever price they could get."
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3484.836,3486.148,"No sir, no sir."
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3518.779,3536.268,"In other -- it -- suppose that it have noticed some of these of contracts have changed in a matter of price from time to time so they had 10 contracts, five of them at one price and five of them is 100% above that."
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3549.141,3557.274,"Well, he would, under that circumstance would be taking gas ratably from all 10 of the wells."
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3567.389,3572.519,"Well it would -- it would follow because of your order, you'd have to do it."
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3572.519,3574.274,"Only if he entered into such a contract, yes."
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3574.274,3578.37,"Yes, but if he didn't do it, he wouldn't get all of his gas."
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3578.37,3580.939,You mean sufficient gas to meet his markets?
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3580.939,3585.47,Creating gas to meet his contract [Inaudible]
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3585.47,3585.901,Yes.
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3587.028,3600.988,So that the effect of it under both circumstances would be requiring him to pay a substantial amount more despite he had agreed upon that is fixed -- approved by the FPC.
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3600.988,3602.255,"Oh, no."
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3603.76,3604.677,Why wouldn't it?
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3604.677,3605.556,Well whatever --
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3605.556,3619.684,"Five -- he has to -- he has to increase his purchase from five and those five will pay requirements, say a 100% more than -- what if he bought from the others so that if the price goes up accordingly --"
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3619.684,3628.829,"Yes, but that -- that contract -- that increased price contract you speak of, the 100% contract, must also be filed by the FPC and approved."
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3629.14,3629.591,[Inaudible]
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3629.591,3630.601,-- within the price wouldn't be higher.
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3630.601,3634.128,But what good would it do if the state could change it by an order.
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3634.128,3636.909,"Oh, the state cannot change the price in any way --"
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3636.909,3641.694,"Well, it couldn't change it by saying we are doing this for change and make you pay more."
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3641.694,3642.115,Right.
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3642.115,3657.607,"But if it's going to accomplish the same thing by leaving those words out and requiring them to bring about a distribution in that purchase which would increase the price for a 100% that would certainly nullify the price fixed by the FPC, would it not?"
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3657.607,3664.515,"Yes sir, because whatever that price is to be by the contract must be approved by the FPC."
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3664.515,3665.193,That's right.
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3680.11,3680.933,I understand.
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3680.933,3682.523,I'm just only getting to the effects of it.
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3682.523,3683.051,Absolutely.
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3683.051,3706.68,"That would not give finality to the original order with fixing -- approving the price at which they have bought the gas, because of the fact that prior to this order, [Inaudible] among those who have small price and those who have a much larger price, his rate might be increased a 100%, wouldn't it?"
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3706.68,3707.77,I don't -- I don't think so but now --
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3707.77,3711.874,"Well, how can you avoid it under those circumstances?"
1962.62,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3711.874,3722.589,"Your argument -- I gather from your brief is that this Kansas order modified pro tanto, the obligation to take under the Republic contract."
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3722.589,3724.74,We stated that as a position.
1962.62,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3724.74,3728.735,"If that is so, I suppose that is the answer to Justice Black."
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3728.735,3730.998,That would certainly answer his contention.
1962.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3730.998,3742.615,"That would answer it to the extent that it could answer it, it modified contract by requiring him to pay more than the FPC had approved the price they must purchase the gas."
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3748.246,3760.307,"It seems to me I maybe missing the position that the Honorable Justice is taking, but it seems to me that each of these contracts you speak of must be approved by the FPC."
1962.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3787.134,3808.06,[Inaudible] taking anything at 20 cents.
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3824.871,3826.502,"Yes, I think it would."
1962.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3826.502,3834.153,"And your position is even though that means he has to pay more money in total for a $100,000 and if he could get it all at the 10 cent rate."
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3834.153,3834.692,That's right.
1962.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3834.692,3847.709,But nevertheless both the 10 and 20 cents rates which are approved by the FPC and the only effect of your order is that he's got to take it and that you constitutionally may insist that he takes it on a ratable basis.
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3847.709,3848.401,Absolutely Your Honor.
1962.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3848.401,3848.881,Is that it?
1962.62,1,19658,charles_c_mccarter,,3848.881,3849.619,That is it.
