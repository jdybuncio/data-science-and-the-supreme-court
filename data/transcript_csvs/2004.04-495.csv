2004.04-495,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.581,"We'll hear argument now in No. 04-495, Reginald Wilkinson v. Charles."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,12.553,14.708,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,36.575,52.921,"General Petro, before you get into the details of why... why you think the process here was all that was due, I'm... I'm more concerned about the preliminary question of whether there was a liberty interest here."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,152.546,153.702,"No... no, we don't, Your Honor."
2004.04-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.702,155.82,So there's... there's no Eighth Amendment problem.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,155.82,156.178,No.
2004.04-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,156.178,160.307,"So if you wanted to, you could put all of your prisoners in maximum security."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,160.621,162.401,"Yes, I agree, Your Honor, that we could."
2004.04-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,162.401,163.399,So where is the liberty interest here?
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,164.054,169.968,We... we made a decision in petitioning the Court that the liberty interest issue was something that we would not raise.
2004.04-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,177.003,188.49,"Well, I understand, but I feel like something of a fool being asked, you know, Justice Scalia, if... if there were a liberty interest here, would these procedures be enough to secure it."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,194.122,199.566,The... the circuit court made a factual determination that there was a significant and atypical deprivation.
2004.04-495,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.459,211.826,"Well, but there is a... there is a question of law involved as to whether there's a liberty interest."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,211.826,212.413,Yes.
2004.04-495,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.413,231.884,"In the Sandin case in 1995, this Court said that prisoners have a State-created liberty interest only where the deprivation or restraint imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,250.881,251.532,That is correct.
2004.04-495,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,269.153,278.731,"Well, do you take the... why don't you simplify it by telling us whether you take the position today that there is or is not a liberty interest here?"
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,278.731,280.346,"--Your Honor, we chose not to--"
2004.04-495,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,280.346,281.577,I know you did.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,281.577,282.048,--petition on that.
2004.04-495,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,282.048,284.187,I'm asking you your opinion.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,284.187,288.982,"Your Honor, I would be most pleased to argue that there is no liberty interest in this instance under Sandin."
2004.04-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,304.667,306.544,What if he were moved from level 1 to level 5?
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,306.544,310.607,"Your Honor, that has not occurred in reality."
2004.04-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,315.262,319.982,But why isn't the comparison the entire prison population rather than just 5 versus 4?
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,319.982,331.08,"Your Honor, it's just typically what occurs, and so there are some circumstances where a level 3 inmate may be moved to 5, but in any event, that inmate would have been moved to 4."
2004.04-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,334.276,342.137,"Well, is it... is it your view that we should consider it the normal practice in the Ohio system to keep people in solitary for 23 hours a day?"
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,342.137,343.95,"--Your Honor, that's not the normal practice."
2004.04-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,344.963,347.16,"Well, then isn't that the standard of reference that we should use?"
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,347.16,355.89,"--Your Honor, it involves a small number of inmates, and those inmates have been determined through a very predictive determination that... that in fact they do pose a threat--"
2004.04-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,355.89,364.097,"So we're... we're dealing with a small number of inmates out of a very large population, but isn't the frame of reference for telling whether it's a liberty interest a comparison to the large population?"
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,364.097,373.527,"--Your Honor, the... the deprivation is... is perhaps marginally greater, but I would suggest that it is marginal, and therefore--"
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,373.527,374.721,"Well, you say it's marginally greater than 4."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,377.718,383.788,"--Your Honor, I would submit that it is... it is more... it is much greater than 4."
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,394.315,415.269,"Well, but the... the point of the case is that the inmate does not expect to be put in solitary confinement for 23 or 23 and a half hours a day for a period of 1, 2, or more years without some process to do it because that is so extraordinarily onerous and so different from the general run of incarceration practice."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,415.269,417.391,"--And... and, Your Honor, we initiated a process."
2004.04-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,423.499,429.205,"That... but that's what... that's what you wanted to talk about, but we're on, first, the preliminary question."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,429.205,429.988,--Yes.
2004.04-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,429.988,441.268,And is... I think you started to say that you regarded atypical and significant as a fact-finding which was made against you--
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,441.268,441.946,Yes.
2004.04-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,441.946,448.021,--based on the extreme conditions of this kind of confinement where you don't see another human.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,448.021,457.348,"Your Honor, we would... I would continue to... to argue that it is not... if it is significant and atypical, it is marginally significant and atypical."
2004.04-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.348,459.813,Wasn't solitary confinement involved in Sandin?
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,459.813,460.757,"Yes, it was."
2004.04-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.757,464.747,Didn't we say in Sandin that solitary confinement was... was not enough to... to create--
2004.04-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,464.747,465.391,For how long?
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,465.391,466.975,"30... for 30 days I believe, wasn't it?"
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,466.975,468.032,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,468.032,469.712,"Not 1 year, 2 years, 3 years."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,469.712,470.347,No.
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,482.522,491.033,But... but typically it has been represented maybe... maybe wrongly... typically it has been represented that they tend to be in there for a year or 2-year periods.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,491.033,495.209,"Your Honor, they are reviewed from a classification standpoint on an annual basis."
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,500.575,504.217,"But in... but in fact, they tend to be in there for the extended periods of time."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,504.595,505.764,"--That... that's correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-495,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,505.764,516.216,"Mr.... General Petro, I for one would like to hear what you have to say about the question presented in your petition for certiorari."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,516.216,517.806,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,540.217,543.07,--May... may I just ask you a question about that?
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,565.144,569.911,"--Your Honor, it gave notice, 48 hours in advance, under the new policy--"
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,569.911,570.631,Notice of what?
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,570.631,573.585,--Notice of the fact that there would be a reclassification.
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,573.585,576.679,But did it give notice of the reason for the reclassification?
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,581.899,587.615,"It doesn't spell out... in New Policy 111-07, it doesn't spell out all the evidence, but it gives a basic--"
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,587.615,589.048,"No, not the evidence, just the reason."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,589.048,592.638,--It gives a basic statement that you're being considered for reclassification.
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,592.638,602.781,"I... I know that, but does it say you're being reconsidered for... considered for reclassification because you hit somebody over the head or because you've shown that you're a member of a gang or some other reason?"
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,602.781,605.218,"It... it as a general rule does not have to do that, Your Honor."
2004.04-495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,605.218,627.634,"What about... I mean, the person, if he reads the regulation, would see that it says that to classify him, the State has to show that through repetitive and seriously disruptive behavior, he has demonstrated a chronic inability to adjust as evidenced by repeated class 2 rule violations."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,627.634,628.093,Yes.
2004.04-495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,628.093,637.911,So I guess he would like to know give me at least a vague idea of what behavior you're talking about and which class 2 rule violations you're talking about.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,640.577,642.912,The notice is very general in its nature.
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,653.456,654.966,"Well, you say he has the opportunity."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,668.448,674.325,--There is... what initiates the reclassification is a report form that would identify to the inmate--
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,674.325,677.995,"I'm asking you what you tell the inmate, not what initiates your process."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,679.611,684.122,"--The inmate, Your Honor, has access to the report form that says specifically what's initiated."
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,684.122,685.881,At which point does he get... at which point does he get access?
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,685.881,686.553,At the point of notice.
2004.04-495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,686.553,696.926,"So... so this... I mean, that's what I don't understand what this case is about because I... I'm amazed that... I think it is too detailed what they're requiring of you, by far."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,733.683,738.183,The new policy gives him the basic information that we are asserting that--
2004.04-495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,738.183,752.396,"Now, already you say that, but I would think the basic information includes some idea of what my disruptive behavior was and some idea of what the class 2 violations that I was convicted of was."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,763.808,767.946,"--Your Honor, he gets the basic reason for the classification and that's--"
2004.04-495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,767.946,769.824,Now... you heard what I said.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,769.824,770.858,"--Yes, I did, Your Honor."
2004.04-495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,770.858,772.052,Does he get what I just said?
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,772.052,772.52,"Yes, he does."
2004.04-495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,772.52,773.276,He does.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,773.276,774.575,He gets the basic information.
2004.04-495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,776.184,779.027,"Well, what does he... can you... can you describe it for us what... he gets 48 hours notice."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,779.027,779.605,Yes.
2004.04-495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,779.605,781.375,Notice that's there's going to be a hearing.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,787.141,789.081,"At the close of the hearing, he... there is--"
2004.04-495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,789.081,789.509,--No.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,795.156,806.681,"--There's going to be a hearing and it's for reclassification, and here is... here is the... the actual report that actually identifies what has triggered this activity for reclassification."
2004.04-495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,806.681,807.288,So he does get the report.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,807.288,807.876,So he gets--
2004.04-495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,807.876,808.325,48 hours--
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,808.325,812.873,--But it's a very bare bones report and it doesn't identify the specific evidence involved which--
2004.04-495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,812.873,814.878,"Now, I don't care that he doesn't have the evidence."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,814.878,815.081,--Okay.
2004.04-495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,815.081,822.788,"I want to know that he thinks he's being sent to this prison because his roommate, Rat Fink, has made up a bunch of stories about him."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,845.028,856.329,"There's an example of the report form that is filled out by the prison officials at the time that a reclassification is going to occur, and the inmate does have access to that report form at the time of notice."
2004.04-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,856.329,857.042,May I ask this--
2004.04-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,857.042,857.726,Perhaps we can be concrete.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,872.488,874.626,"Yes, Your Honor, he does get that notice."
2004.04-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,877.832,887.981,"Not that he's been reclassified, but is the reason... the reason that you are being reclassified is that you are a gang leader."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,891.384,894.978,He gets the... the accusation.
2004.04-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.53,900.662,--May I--
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,900.662,902.941,--that one of those criteria has been asserted--
2004.04-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.941,904.231,--May I ask you this question?
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,904.231,905.185,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,905.185,910.325,I'm just... is the procedure you're describing the procedure that was reviewed by the district court?
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,910.325,911.504,The procedure.
2004.04-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.531,921.077,So the evidence in the record before the district court describes exactly what you're describing.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,921.077,938.176,"The evidence that's in the record was the procedure in place prior to the enactment of New Policy 111-07, and the court choose... chose to review for procedural purposes Policy 111-07 and then make its decision based on New Policy 111-07."
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,948.382,955.187,"General Petro, I... I don't... I'm going to ask you a very tendentious question, but it's something I don't want to make a mistake about."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,982.274,984.423,"--Yes, he does generally."
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,986.565,986.698,No.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,987.285,987.71,--Okay.
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,987.71,988.394,--I'm not worried about evidence.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,988.394,989.015,I understand.
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,989.015,989.794,Just I want to know the charge.
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,992.081,1004.705,"He will get the... there is a form that is completed, a long form that is completed by the prison officials that basically stipulates the predicate act or the predicate acts that really result in the reclassification action."
2004.04-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1004.705,1010.405,"So that in the gang leader example, he will be told that it's because he is accused of being a gang leader that this is occurring."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,1010.405,1012.341,"Yes, because that is part of the form."
2004.04-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1013.446,1014.944,"And the form... and the form is in the record, I take it."
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,1014.944,1015.457,"--Yes, it is."
2004.04-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.314,1016.432,Where?
2004.04-495,0,32312,james_m_petro,,1016.432,1019.93,"--With the Court's permission, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."
2004.04-495,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1019.93,1020.607,"Thank you, General Petro."
2004.04-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.42,1032.744,"Ms. Maynard, before you start, maybe you could answer the question I tried to ask at the end of his argument."
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1034.191,1050.03,"JA-58 is the form, and if you look at that, you'll see that it has a line that says, you are being considered for a transfer for the following reasons, colon, and there's a blank to be filled in."
2004.04-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1083.705,1089.897,Why is it a predictive judgment that a person is a gang leader?
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1128.665,1130.392,"That's true, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.04-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1197.106,1206.706,"But that would be... that would be a what happened question, not what might happen."
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1219.794,1221.362,That's true.
2004.04-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1239.019,1241.83,And suppose neither of those are... are so.
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1241.83,1247.84,"Well, I... as I say, I think in the vast majority of cases, in both the Federal system and Ohio, that is the case."
2004.04-495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1291.546,1295.636,"Well, those two, it seems to me, are all questions of... of fact."
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1329.977,1330.712,--Yes.
2004.04-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.842,1350.146,"Ms. Maynard, this is a class action, isn't it?"
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1350.146,1351.495,"Yes, it is, Justice Scalia."
2004.04-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.495,1366.395,"What if... what if for some of the prisoners, maybe a majority of the prisoners, this... this reality of having a prior factual hearing exists, but for some of it, it doesn't?"
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1370.102,1374.71,"There's... still, the appropriate analysis, when you're talking about... basically what we have at bottom--"
2004.04-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.71,1388.843,"But I mean, suppose I think that a... a trial-type proceeding is necessary, and in fact, it's been given for most of the people in this class action, but not for the rest."
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1390.469,1402.932,"--It seems to me that you hold that... that the procedures here are adequate because... under the Due Process Clause because in the broad range of cases, you're going to have sufficient notice and an opportunity to contest."
2004.04-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1447.711,1451.545,Did you ask for... did the Government move for modification of a decree?
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1462.665,1464.947,--Let me clarify one thing.
2004.04-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1479.838,1482.605,"Well, you talked about something being imposed."
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1482.605,1482.861,Right.
2004.04-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1482.861,1489.277,"And so I want to know what was imposed, first, by whom, by which court, and what... what the order was."
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1489.277,1495.975,The injunction was entered by the Eastern District of Illinois and was affirmed by the Seventh Circuit in a case called Bono v. Saxby.
2004.04-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1515.435,1522.022,"But even so, I mean, you were saying this was forced on... on the... effectively on the Government."
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1542.091,1544.977,"We don't think it's constitutionally required, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.04-495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1588.746,1609.882,"Well, is... is the population with respect to which you have adopted the far more lenient process a... the population of the control unit, which I understand is comparable to the unit we're talking about in Ohio, or is it with respect to the general maximum security population which is housed in conditions less onerous than the control unit?"
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1609.882,1618.164,It is... applies to the general conditions in ADX... the general populations in ADX Florence and USP Marion.
2004.04-495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1618.164,1618.329,"Okay, and--"
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1618.329,1622.549,"But those conditions, Your Honor, are similar to the Ohio State penitentiary."
2004.04-495,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1626.794,1627.311,Yes.
2004.04-495,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1627.311,1634.858,"The... the difference in the general population, the prisoners are out 10 to 12 hours a week for recreation, and in the control unit, they are out 7 hours a week."
2004.04-495,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1634.858,1637.088,"Thank you, Ms. Maynard."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1650.169,1650.869,Yes.
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1672.804,1674.644,"Well, could you answer my question first?"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1679.471,1680.724,I think Mr. Austin got no notice.
2004.04-495,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1680.724,1682.68,Perhaps you can take us through this chronologically.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1684.09,1684.847,Okay.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1705.458,1706.983,Then can you just explain that?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1724.603,1725.381,"--Yes, that they don't get."
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1726.426,1736.985,"--Even though... you mean even though it says that the policy says you should be noticed and you're... it says, attached to the notice will be a copy of the... I'm sorry."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1738.708,1740.329,I think you're reading in the wrong place.
2004.04-495,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1754.558,1756.307,May I... may I... I just want to make sure.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1766.855,1768.189,--They do not.
2004.04-495,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1780.626,1781.734,Yes.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1781.734,1786.435,"So at this... at... at... during the trial, often they didn't get the... they didn't get any notice."
2004.04-495,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1786.435,1786.967,Okay.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1786.967,1788.866,But now they should get a notice.
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1793.042,1804.684,You mean a trial before all the... before they were about to be committed or the hearing at which it was determined whether they would be or not?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1804.684,1808.625,--At the hearing and... they got a notice.
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1828.039,1829.089,"Well, do you think it should be?"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1829.089,1829.799,--No.
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1829.799,1832.636,"I mean, this is a prison classification, for goodness sakes."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1832.636,1832.748,No.
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1833.392,1835.351,He's been found guilty and sentenced to prison.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1835.351,1836.502,"--Right, and we're not--"
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1836.502,1839.436,The question is what procedures are required.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1844.95,1847.813,--And... and we are not asking for trial-type procedures.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1863.408,1865.568,Here is the exact words I... I think.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1878.521,1879.241,No.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1879.241,1881.14,--and a summary of the evidence relied on.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1882.511,1883.828,That's... that's the district court's order.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1888.079,1888.836,All right.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1889.684,1891.059,Where is theirs?
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1891.059,1892.007,--I'm sorry.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1892.594,1897.208,"Their policy is, I believe, on page JA-23."
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1948.935,1950.391,"Well, what's... what's wrong with that?"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1950.391,1951.196,--Because--
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.196,1956.119,"I mean, if he can... if he's not a gang leader, he can tell them why he isn't."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1956.119,1957.419,--He'll say I'm not a gang leader.
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1975.354,1977.125,You... you want a trial-type proceeding.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,1977.125,1980.021,This is a far cry from a trial.
2004.04-495,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2009.823,2033.443,"Well, there is... isn't there the problem... at least Ohio suggested that there is... that if this person is indeed a gang leader and the form says so-and-so and so-and-so effectively ratted on you, those persons who came forward might not live to see another day?"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2033.443,2046.809,"And the district court ordered what Ohio does in all its disciplinary proceedings, what the Federal Government does in its disciplinary proceedings, which is if it's confidential information, you don't have to turn it over because they understand that, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2069.895,2074.646,But was... was this under the old policy that you're talking about what occurred?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2074.646,2075.989,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2076.741,2077.141,Yes.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2091.893,2101.27,"--The... the new policy, which really was in all honesty, Your Honor, a tweaked policy or a modified policy... they took the old policy and they made some changes to it."
2004.04-495,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2107.664,2108.923,"Which was never... never in effect, right?"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2110.016,2110.772,--Never went into effect.
2004.04-495,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2110.772,2116.547,--So all... the evidence relates to the old policy which I think Ohio recognizes was not adequate.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2127.694,2133.256,"It doesn't on... just on the face of it, it doesn't fix the problem that the district court found."
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2137.789,2146.705,"Well, let... you keep talking about what happened in the past, and I'm... I find some difficulty with that because we're being asked to review a new policy."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2155.095,2156.455,--I'll give you a very specific--
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2156.455,2158.913,Could... could you refer to something?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2158.913,2161.92,--Page... look at page 22 and... 23 and 33 of the new policy.
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2162.944,2163.648,Where... where is that?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2163.648,2164.8,JA-23.
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2168.171,2170.698,All right.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2172.612,2185.096,"On 23, you look at the final decision-maker... the Bureau of Classification... the bottom line of the next-to-the-last paragraph... will review the recommendation and any objections filed and make a final decision."
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2189.399,2191.256,Is this happening under the new policy?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2191.256,2192.323,--That's the new policy.
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2192.323,2195.934,"But now, you just were going to say here's what was happening."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2197.992,2198.12,No.
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2204.125,2206.418,"Well, why... why is that the question?"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2213.623,2219.458,"Your Honor, it doesn't meet constitutional standards because it only says the chief has to make a final decision."
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2253.122,2254.823,So I think I've got your point.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2264.418,2265.085,--Exactly.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2265.085,2274.269,"And what the new policy says is, committee, you must give the prisoner some information."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2282.535,2283.09,Exactly.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.09,2285.554,What that tells him is nothing about the facts.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2287.821,2289.388,He's been charged for being a gang leader.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2289.388,2301.468,"Now, the new policy goes on to say, the classification committee shall document information presented by staff and the inmate which is form 2627 and 2628."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2307.585,2309.131,And they don't have to give that to anybody.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2309.131,2310.763,And it just doesn't say anything about them at all.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2310.763,2312.549,And all the district court was saying--
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.549,2315.38,"So your point is in the past, they didn't give them the information."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2315.38,2315.979,--They didn't give them the information.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2315.979,2319.584,Then they promulgated a new policy and the new policy says nothing about it.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2319.584,2320.293,Exactly.
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2326.122,2338.095,--But form 58... I'm... I'm looking at page 58... says that the prisoner will be given this form that says you were referred to the classification committee for the following reasons.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2342.649,2343.987,--And... two problems with that.
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2348.013,2350.429,This is a facial attack.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2361.447,2365.746,--Because you... at trial we showed what the practice was.
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2365.746,2367.239,You showed what happened in the past.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2367.239,2368.722,"And the question is, does this fix it?"
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2423.355,2436.822,"Well, I can understand that you could come on behalf of a prisoner on an as-applied challenge, but to look at this form and tell us it is facially invalid is difficult for me to understand."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2446.64,2450.463,"Well... well, the first thing that's matter with the form is it doesn't require reasons for the decision."
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2450.463,2451.023,It's--
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2451.023,2454.596,"Well, why does the Due Process Clause require reasons?"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2454.596,2470.676,"Even in Salerno, the... the... this Court held that in a preventive case, the bail... the bail reform statute still requires, as a basic modicum of due process, that you give the person the reason--"
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2470.676,2471.907,That... that was a statute.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2471.907,2476.771,"--That was a statute, and the Court relied on that for why the statute was constitutional."
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2490.136,2494.242,"--This form says, state the reasons, and leaves blank space to do that."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2494.242,2494.626,--But that's--
2004.04-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2494.626,2495.239,So what's the matter?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2495.239,2496.263,--That's in the notice.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2498.397,2499.565,"Well, what it says about--"
2004.04-495,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2499.565,2510.785,It... it seems to me that the... the facial attack objection would... would not be... carry much weight if what happened was this.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2541.322,2541.849,Yes.
2004.04-495,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2543.002,2543.509,Could you comment on that?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2543.509,2544.975,--It depends on what you mean by midway.
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2646.142,2652.889,"Well, what's wrong with giving him the opportunity to say why he's not a gang leader?"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2652.889,2668.877,"How is Mr. Roe going to say I'm not a gang leader because I wasn't hit over the head with a spatula because I'm a gang leader, I was hit over the head with a spatula because the guy doesn't like me, unless he knows that that's why they think he is a gang leader?"
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2673.917,2676.732,--But why can't you do that in an as-applied challenge?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2728.507,2745.27,"Your Honor, I think as a facial matter, when you're putting somebody in long-term solitary confinement for years and years in a small cell with no possibility of parole, you're... I think you should give them notice of the reasons in sufficient--"
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2745.27,2746.571,"No, I'm not disagreeing with you."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2746.571,2747.322,--in sufficient detail.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2747.322,2747.675,But you see... yes.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2769.156,2769.487,Right.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2769.487,2772.068,And it doesn't say they won't tell the prisoner.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2774.287,2774.495,Right.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2774.495,2778.02,So why can't I assume they will tell him so he'll know what's going on?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2781.786,2790.004,"Even if, as an abstract matter, you could assume it, when you've had a 1-week trial with witness after witness, and the witnesses say they're not doing this--"
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2790.004,2792.345,That was before the new policy.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2792.345,2794.489,--But the new policy is introduced at trial.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2803.849,2807.465,What I'm now saying is I can understand exactly why you might feel the way you do.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2830.579,2832.877,Maybe you should in an ordinary case.
2004.04-495,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2847.454,2869.587,"Are you... are you saying that what we have before us is this, a trial which showed that the pre-new policy procedures were deficient and the trial judge and you and a court of appeals interpreted the new policies as remedies for past wrongs that were established?"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2873.405,2874.317,That's certainly one way.
2004.04-495,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2874.317,2885.281,"Another way to look at the case is to say that Ohio admitted that there were some improprieties, showed its new policy, and the case turned on the adequacy of the new policies."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2888.155,2893.931,"But to look at it the second way, you have to show that the problems proved at trial were moot."
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2901.802,2909.235,But how can you know whether the problems are ongoing if the new rules haven't been implemented?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2909.235,2911.598,"--Well, they are ongoing at trial."
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2926.391,2934.113,Why... why isn't it a question of as facially in the abstract is it okay?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2934.113,2934.459,Yes.
2004.04-495,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2975.024,2976.346,"May I ask this question, Mr. Lobel?"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2984.5,2991.929,--There... there were findings that... that there were... particular inmates were improperly... were sent with no evidence against them.
2004.04-495,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2991.929,2996.862,"All right, and was there any... any order saying that inmate should get out and go to a different facility?"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,2996.862,2996.973,No.
2004.04-495,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3027.83,3033.525,"And so the State then came back and said we're putting in this new policy, we will give them new hearings under the new policy?"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3033.525,3033.812,No.
2004.04-495,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3053.225,3066.115,"So that even though... if I understand it correctly, even though there had findings that some inmates have been improperly... had had inadequate procedure as a predicate to going into the new facility, they can just stay there until the litigation is over."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3066.115,3069.128,--That's right because the district court didn't move any particular prisoner.
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3071.939,3073.554,Where do... where do we find those findings?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3078.525,3081.592,--They're... they're all through the district court's opinion.
2004.04-495,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3095.287,3105.12,"And as... and as to those prisoners, was there a requirement that the... that the court's procedures be made applicable and so there would have to be a retroactive hearing as to those prisoners?"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3105.12,3106.779,For all the prisoners.
2004.04-495,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3121.439,3123.518,Can you just give me 1 minute on the other issue?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3123.518,3123.747,We're talking about 48 prisoners.
2004.04-495,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3123.747,3128.252,Can you tell us on... on the liberty interest where we started with the--
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3128.252,3128.621,Yes.
2004.04-495,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3128.621,3136.097,"--with the Attorney General, is there a liberty interest in not being transferred from prison 1... level 1 to level 2--"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3136.097,3136.487,No.
2004.04-495,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3136.487,3137.041,"--level 2, that sort of thing?"
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3142.326,3162.816,"We argued here that this was an atypical, significant hardship compared not to level 1, 2, 3, or 4, but compared to the segregation units, any other prison in Ohio, even the segregation units, and for three reasons, all of which in combination the court of... the district court held required a finding of liberty interest."
2004.04-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3179.78,3181.696,I thought there... there was at least annual review.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3182.895,3191.625,"There was an annual review, but the committee that they set up to review it, made up not of law professors, but made up of correctional officials, said--"
2004.04-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.625,3192.691,--And a good thing too.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3192.899,3194.243,"--And a good thing, I agree."
2004.04-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3244.04,3245.592,What does the new policy say about this?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3245.592,3246.008,--Nothing.
2004.04-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3246.008,3246.792,Nothing about--
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3246.792,3247.197,Nothing.
2004.04-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3247.197,3248.275,--about the annual review.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3248.275,3249.783,It says you get an annual review.
2004.04-495,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3306.193,3306.843,Did they have reading materials?
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3307.217,3313.212,"--They had reading materials, yes, Your Honor, and they had televisions so they could watch their favorite programs."
2004.04-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3389.149,3390.499,"That's not the whole class, though."
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3390.499,3391.016,Not--
2004.04-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3391.016,3391.527,You have a class action.
2004.04-495,2,31601,jules_lobel,,3395.9,3405.984,"--Yes, but a... the vast... I believe it's over 90 percent of the people who were in this prison were sentenced under the old rules, under the old parole rules."
2004.04-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3419.35,3422.448,"General Petro, you have 3 minutes remaining."
2004.04-495,3,32312,james_m_petro,,3422.448,3423.537,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2004.04-495,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3600.647,3601.91,"Thank you, General Petro."
2004.04-495,3,32312,james_m_petro,,3601.91,3602.065,--Thank you.
2004.04-495,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3602.065,3603.649,The case is submitted.
