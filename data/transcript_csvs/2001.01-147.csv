2001.01-147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,7.968,9.166,Mr. Roberts.
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,9.166,21.881,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. Stockbrokers like the respondent are the critical link between the National Securities Markets and individual investors who trust brokers to buy and sell securities for their benefit."
2001.01-147,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,46.623,49.867,"Mr. Roberts, could you clarify for me what the government's position is in this case?"
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,74.841,81.324,--That embezzlement would not be in connection with the prior sale under the theory that we are asking the Court to adopt here.
2001.01-147,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,90.362,92.758,We don't have to agree with that to rule for you--
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,92.758,95.813,--You don't have to agree with that to find a violation here.
2001.01-147,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,95.813,104.025,"--Now, the SEC adjudications that you rely upon, what kind of a situation do they involve?"
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,104.934,106.421,"They involve both situations, Your Honor."
2001.01-147,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,106.421,107.164,--Both situations.
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,107.164,107.702,Both situations.
2001.01-147,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,107.702,124.253,Does the SEC routinely audit brokers' accounts or do spot audits to ensure compliance with the theory you are suggesting here or are they just reactive when they find out about a firm?
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,124.253,128.628,I am not aware that they routinely audit the brokers.
2001.01-147,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,144.976,161.322,"And I take it that if the NASD tells the SEC of the existence of a fraud, the SEC can then request the United States Government to prosecute if there is a wire fraud or--"
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,161.322,182.416,"They could request a prosecution, Your Honor, but it's important that the SEC is the federal agency that's charged with maintaining the integrity of the markets and investor confidence in the markets, have direct authority to prevent and to pursue the kind of fraud that's involved here which is very... potentially very unsettling to the markets."
2001.01-147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.617,203.964,"--Well, do you say then that any fraud by a broker in connection with a customer is actionable by the SEC."
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,203.964,209.991,"That goes back to the question that Justice Scalia asked me, Your Honor."
2001.01-147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,218.703,220.105,Does take what position?
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,220.105,234.512,That any fraudulent conversion by a broker from a brokerage account is a violation of 10(b) because it's fraud and it's in connection with the purchase or sale of securities; because the very purpose of the brokerage account is to buy and sell securities.
2001.01-147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.567,238.765,That's quite a leap--
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,238.765,239.424,--for the purpose of--
2001.01-147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,239.424,241.282,--That's a leap from any case we've ever decided.
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,241.282,245.946,--That is beyond any case that I'm aware that you have decided.
2001.01-147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,286.524,291.083,But there were misrepresentations about a particular security.
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,292.552,301.402,"There wasn't a misrepresentation in Bankers Life about a particular security, there was a misrepresentation that the corporation would receive the proceeds."
2001.01-147,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,325.329,337.301,So in this case the fraud could have been avoided under your theory if the broker had gotten in touch with the clients and said I'm going to sell this but I'm going to use the money for myself.
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,340.849,344.027,--That would have turned it from fraud into theft.
2001.01-147,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,349.85,351.457,But it wouldn't have been fraud.
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,351.457,353.648,--It wouldn't have been fraud if there was no deception.
2001.01-147,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,358.516,363.883,"Mr. Roberts, there's one point in your reply brief that I didn't quite grasp."
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,367.327,368.054,Yes.
2001.01-147,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,368.054,371.519,And it hinges on the wrong that was done to the customer.
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,379.487,386.918,"In this circumstance, yes, the customer could have brought a private action against the broker, Your Honor."
2001.01-147,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,429.559,431.128,But this time he did.
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,431.128,432.16,But he did.
2001.01-147,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,432.16,435.132,There's another curiosity in this case.
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,452.676,461.221,"I don't know, Your Honor, why the restitution award in the criminal action was limited to $10,000."
2001.01-147,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.026,512.408,"Mr. Roberts, did the allegations of your complaint in this case accord with the narrower theory that you now say is enough to decide this case?"
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,533.585,540.355,"--It does... it does comport with our theory, Your Honor."
2001.01-147,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.365,571.025,Wait.
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,573.133,611.892,"--In the... in the mutual fund checks, if you look at Page 28A, of the petition, in paragraph 16 of the complaint, it describes the beginning of the fraudulent scheme in May of 1988, shortly after Mr. Wood was hospitalized as a result of his stroke, and notes that between May and June 1988, Zandford, without the prior knowledge or consent of Wood and Okstulski, issued three checks to himself totaling $41,000."
2001.01-147,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.075,622.378,It doesn't say they were later obtained.
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,631.916,639.263,--I think the way that that kind of account works is that it's like a checking account with your mutual funds.
2001.01-147,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,688.22,692.512,"Who gets the recovery, Mr. Roberts?"
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,692.512,712.202,"The recovery goes to the... to the government, but the SEC has a policy of if there are identifiable victims to endeavor to give the victims those... those funds and to make them whole if they are available."
2001.01-147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,715.258,725.949,"Well, isn't it a little odd, you have two different branches of the government, perhaps not branches, but two different proceedings, one a criminal proceeding which authorizes restitution."
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,739.845,764.67,"Well, the restitution, first of all, the purposes of restitution and disgorgement are different in that one is aimed on the... is focused on the making whole the loss to the... to the people that are injured, whereas the other is aimed at requiring the wrongdoer to disgorge any benefit that he got from the scheme."
2001.01-147,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,804.422,815.735,"Well, just to explore the point, is there anything in the record to show that these victims lost only $10,000 and that the broker just made all the rest by churning--"
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,815.735,816.228,No.
2001.01-147,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,826.63,846.792,"--Mr. Roberts, isn't it the case sometimes in criminal proceedings where restitution is ordered that full restitution is not ordered for a variety of reasons, the victim's family... the defendant's family may have certain needs and the Court may decide, well, I'm just going to order a limited amount of restitution."
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,847.89,849.005,"Yes, that certainly happens, Your Honor."
2001.01-147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,850.408,854.373,"And if the family has needs, the SEC doesn't have to worry about it, I take it?"
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,854.373,863.205,"Well, the SEC does its own balancing of what's appropriate to further the interests and it asks for a disgorgement which is an equitable remedy."
2001.01-147,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,875.921,888.636,"It is odd that there was no kind of, apparently no cooperation here, that the criminal case goes on for that limited amount and then the SEC comes in after."
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,895.527,897.591,"Yes, they do talk to each other."
2001.01-147,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,932.763,935.114,"The SEC is an independent regulatory agency, isn't it?"
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,935.114,936.023,"--Yes, it is."
2001.01-147,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,936.023,937.509,So it's not within the control of the President?
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,937.509,939.162,Um--
2001.01-147,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.162,944.402,"So if the Justice Department disagrees with the SEC, the SEC can still go off on its own."
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,947.746,951.172,"--Well, in theory, Your Honor, yes."
2001.01-147,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,964.343,978.915,"Is there any limit, if we have a broker, a licensed broker, is there any limit at all or just any fraud by a licensed broker falls within 10(b)?"
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,978.915,986.384,"Well, again, I'd like to reiterate that to decide this case and under the theory that we are advancing here, you don't need to reach that."
2001.01-147,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1058.458,1067.458,"Suppose the... suppose Zandford were not a licensed broker, he just was pretending to be a broker but he wasn't at all."
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1073.335,1080.916,That would still be... and then he... they gave him the money and he purchased securities and then sold the securities?
2001.01-147,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1080.916,1082.114,"Yes, but he's not licensed to sell any."
2001.01-147,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1082.114,1098.954,"That would still be a violation, Your Honor, because he would have the same fiduciary relationship with them by virtue of them making him their agent for securities transactions and entrusting their assets to him to engage in securities transactions."
2001.01-147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1124.55,1125.498,"Very well, Mr. Roberts."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1127.727,1145.765,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We do not dispute, I don't think it can be disputed, that this conduct obviously is covered by any number of laws, civil, criminal, state, federal, the rules of this self-regulatory organization, and the Court below recognized that as well."
2001.01-147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1193.32,1197.861,"Well, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the SEC as I understand it."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1197.861,1198.4,That's correct.
2001.01-147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1198.4,1202.979,And the Court of Appeals reversed and in effect granted summary judgment for Mr. Zandford.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1202.979,1203.972,That's also correct.
2001.01-147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1203.972,1209.667,"So you have to take the allegations in the complaint as true at that point I think, don't you?"
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1209.667,1214.208,"Mr. Chief Justice, we don't think so, because those allegations were not being considered by the Court of Appeals."
2001.01-147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1239.017,1247.356,"Well, should there have been some reference to the facts in the complaints since they were about to render summary judgment against the SEC?"
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1247.356,1249.957,That may well be the case.
2001.01-147,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1276.995,1279.102,"But wouldn't they have to, Mr. Goldblatt?"
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1290.165,1302.425,"Justice Ginsburg, my point is, is that the question that I think that is presented in this case is whether the SEC by its own actions limited itself to the facts asserted for purposes of summary judgment which were the facts in the indictment."
2001.01-147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1319.802,1324.549,But the government's petition here sets forth some facts.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1332.518,1333.344,"Yes, I did."
2001.01-147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1333.344,1334.004,You did?
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1334.952,1345.893,"I challenged the... in our brief in opposition, we challenged any consideration of any facts beyond the indictment, that any issue with regard to facts in the complaint were not before the Court of Appeals and were not relied on by the SEC."
2001.01-147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1345.893,1348.038,But that just seems weird in a way.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1360.875,1362.156,I absolutely agree.
2001.01-147,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1415.45,1425.275,"Suppose that the customer comes to the broker and says, here's 100 shares of the ABC Company, sell these shares for me and put the money in your broker account."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1434.109,1437.453,"--Under that theory, I would submit there is a fraud."
2001.01-147,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1445.915,1446.286,No.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1451.587,1459.455,"--In that circumstance, if he then sells the security and places it in the account, then he has completed the instructions."
2001.01-147,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1482.406,1487.403,"Well, only in really a Pickwickian sense of the term."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1492.437,1494.75,--Understood.
2001.01-147,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1522.985,1523.728,How does that differ from here?
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1552.791,1561.829,--I think the difference is for purposes of the 10(b) paradigm it requires that the sale be induced by the broker for fraudulent reasons.
2001.01-147,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1564.429,1570.624,"But here we also have, as they have emphasized about 50 times, not simply stealing."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1594.522,1598.237,"--Justice Breyer, here is the distinction that I would draw."
2001.01-147,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1618.094,1618.566,Why don't you?
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1641.128,1646.618,"Because until and unless he actually converts the proceeds, he hasn't violated 10(b)."
2001.01-147,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1648.476,1648.93,He hasn't?
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1658.59,1672.42,"My point is that until he actually converts, while that money is still in the acccount, while the stock has been sold consistent with the directions, until and unless he actually converts the proceeds to his own use, he has not violated 10(b)."
2001.01-147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1672.42,1676.257,"But what about, never mind the taking of the proceeds."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1701.314,1702.596,I think that would be covered by 10(b).
2001.01-147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1702.596,1704.575,"Well, why isn't that the same situation here?"
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1729.095,1741.522,"Justice Scalia, the reason why that doesn't work here is because as the Court of Appeals found, there's no evidence in this record to establish that the sales themselves were inconsistent with the client's interests."
2001.01-147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1747.3,1749.324,"Well, does it have to be inconsistent?"
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1774.709,1778.424,--It might be a breach of fiduciary duty in the trust sense.
2001.01-147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.619,1785.566,It is unauthorized.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1791.594,1794.65,But the sale itself was authorized.
2001.01-147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.402,1826.229,That one I agree with.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1826.229,1831.18,"--In that situation, regardless of what the broker is thinking, he may be thinking I'm going to take the money and run."
2001.01-147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1831.18,1832.378,But that isn't what happened here.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1835.804,1836.753,"No, but--"
2001.01-147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.753,1840.347,The broker has authority to sell but he has authority to sell in the interest of the client.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1849.263,1858.672,"--Justice Scalia, in that regard we point to two decisions from the 7th Circuit in O'Brien and Congregation that deal with discretionary accounts."
2001.01-147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.328,1878.529,"Well, it's true in effect that not every breach of fiduciary duty is a fraud."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1878.529,1880.471,That's correct.
2001.01-147,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1884.557,1889.592,"But in your paradigm, you are saying the authorization is induced by fraud and that's crucial."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1942.719,1960.84,"Justice Souter, my answer to that is this: If it is shown, in other words, assuming you have a discretionary account to invest conservatively, if a broker then goes and buys a penny stock, that is outside the scope of the discretionary authorization and it would be a violation of 10(b)."
2001.01-147,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1961.955,1967.322,"Well, it's outside of the authorization at the beginning because the authorization under no circumstances covered that kind of a sale."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1967.322,1970.007,"--Yes, it was outside the scope of the authority."
2001.01-147,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1970.007,1981.524,"But the term of the authorization that I'm saying is crucial, and what I thought you were saying is crucial in the case that you succeed is the term of the authorization that in effect says, you may sell this stock for my benefit."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2001.047,2005.051,And one of the things that the Court of Appeals found here was that that was not established.
2001.01-147,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2011.838,2012.36,Okay.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2024.249,2031.883,"--In either situation if you can show that the sale itself is a violation of that authorization or a breach of it, yes."
2001.01-147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.804,2047.011,"Yes, but you are going back to the indictment and ignoring the complaint."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2047.011,2053.514,"--Even with the complaint there's really nothing in the complaint that they are relying on other than the mutual fund account, and again--"
2001.01-147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.514,2057.518,"Well, the course of conduct, one transaction after another is relevant; isn't it?"
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2057.518,2059.664,--Not given the time factor.
2001.01-147,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2084.906,2085.549,In the case of churning would you--
2001.01-147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2085.549,2090.501,"--Well, is there any proof that any of the proceeds were ever given to the owner of the principal?"
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2090.501,2103.315,The proof is that the proceeds go to three contracts that were determined by the jury in the wire fraud case to be fraudulent that are agreements that were between Zandford and the clients.
2001.01-147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2114.278,2121.503,You say that there's no evidence that the sale was made for the fraud.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2145.114,2147.593,"I don't believe so, Justice Scalia."
2001.01-147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.166,2153.62,Fine.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2153.62,2154.418,--indication that was wrong--
2001.01-147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2154.418,2157.002,And is the writing of the check what caused the sale?
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2157.002,2159.603,--Positions were liquidated in order to pay the checks.
2001.01-147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2159.603,2160.141,Right.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2160.141,2166.523,But there's no indication that those sales were not a deliberate decision to sell those securities at that point to take the money and put it into something else.
2001.01-147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2173.887,2174.547,It was authorized?
2001.01-147,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2174.547,2176.487,I'm missing something.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2186.724,2193.411,"Well, the sequence of the check is to take the money out of the account and invest it otherwise, which is why you would do it that way or could do it that way."
2001.01-147,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2195.806,2197.953,Doesn't it matter who the check is written to?
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2213.556,2216.983,"--Well, it was payable to the broker or accounts controlled by the broker."
2001.01-147,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2232.671,2240.594,So they can't... you are saying they can't trace any proceeds necessarily from the checks drawn into Zandford's personal accounts or--
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2240.594,2245.674,"Well, they... the way they describe it, it goes to accounts controlled by Zandford."
2001.01-147,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2249.472,2251.906,"--Well, let me just see what your theory is here."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2271.43,2279.111,"If the writing of the check is unauthorized, it's going to be a 10b-5 violation."
2001.01-147,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2279.111,2282.909,Everybody knows he didn't... the client didn't authorize the broker to take a pleasure cruise.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2284.357,2286.707,Then it would be a 10b-5e violation.
2001.01-147,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2293.849,2294.759,But it's alleged properly.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2331.085,2333.08,"--Under my theory, that would allege it."
2001.01-147,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2333.08,2333.602,All right.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2333.602,2334.883,But the Court of Appeals found--
2001.01-147,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2334.883,2335.559,Fine.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2364.166,2365.841,"--No, Justice Breyer, that's not right."
2001.01-147,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2365.841,2366.295,Because?
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2366.295,2367.244,Because two things.
2001.01-147,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2376.986,2377.358,Of course there was no evidence.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2399.278,2402.538,In the ordinary course I would agree with that.
2001.01-147,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2414.693,2426.315,"You mean there is something in this record where the SEC says, by the way, if this criminal case does not provide sufficient evidence, we do not intend to put in any other evidence."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2427.68,2428.628,--It doesn't say that.
2001.01-147,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2446.089,2462.147,You mean it's going to be agreed that there is no doubt that this retarded individual of a very advanced age agreed that his securities would be sold for the purpose of the broker running off with the money?
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2462.147,2464.915,"--Justice Breyer, I think that--"
2001.01-147,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2464.915,2468.009,"I say that with some sarcasm in my voice, because it sounds to me incredible."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2468.009,2470.321,--Obviously these are very hard facts to argue.
2001.01-147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2498.185,2501.362,That's for purposes of their affirmative motion for summary judgment.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2508.383,2511.765,"--I absolutely agree, Justice Stevens, and our only point there is--"
2001.01-147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2511.765,2517.132,"Therefore, we should not ignore the allegations of the complaint that go beyond the indictment."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2517.132,2525.594,"--The only objection I have to that is the fact that they sought rehearing and they sought rehearing and bond, and not one word was mentioned about a remand for dismissal."
2001.01-147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2532.448,2535.049,That's because they were trying to win outright.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2535.049,2535.914,That's right.
2001.01-147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.914,2537.854,But that doesn't justify your winning outright.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2537.854,2540.0,When they file... of course.
2001.01-147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2556.719,2565.801,"Well, when you say we don't know the reason why the Court of Appeals did what it did, I mean, it wrote an opinion, which usually gives the reason why the Court of Appeals did what it did."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2568.79,2586.319,"--What I'm saying is when this comes up for the first time in the opinion of the Court of Appeals and they file for rehearing, and they don't even bring it to the attention of the Court so that the Court can determine whether there is something to be corrected or whether this is the Court's understanding from oral argument that is what their case is."
2001.01-147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2586.319,2592.735,You are saying that the government didn't raise this issue in their petition for rehearing to the Court of Appeals.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2592.735,2593.871,They did not even mention it.
2001.01-147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2593.871,2596.1,"Well, but I don't know that they have to."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2603.325,2606.874,"Ordinarily I would absolutely agree, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-147,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2624.973,2651.994,"But Mr. Goldblatt, the Court of Appeals decision didn't turn on issue preclusion, it turned on a notion that in order to have a violation of 10(b) you had to have some kind of misleading about the merits of a certain security, something tied to the security, and not that they regarded this as a common law crime as theft."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2651.994,2654.8,--The Court concluded--
2001.01-147,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2654.8,2662.973,"I mean, the point they made was it's the same as if what was entrusted to the broker were a car and he sold the car for himself instead of the customer."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2662.973,2665.824,--The point was that the securities were incidental to this fraud.
2001.01-147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2667.143,2669.168,May I just interrupt with one.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2689.601,2693.809,"--Justice Stevens, what I am saying is there is no proof in this record that at the time of the sales--"
2001.01-147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2693.809,2699.465,"Well, maybe there's no proof but the question we are asked to decide is when he does it for his own benefit is it a violation of 10(b)4?"
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2700.83,2704.378,"--I understand that, Justice Stevens, and--"
2001.01-147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2704.378,2705.964,And what's your answer to the question?
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2707.639,2714.697,"--My answer to the question is it is authorized sale, either on the instructions of the--"
2001.01-147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.697,2715.979,"Well, if it's a sale for his own benefit."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2715.979,2725.1,"--And at the same time it is also consistent with the client's instructions, until he converts, he has not violated 10(b)."
2001.01-147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2725.1,2728.732,Even though the sale was for his own benefit at the time he made the sale.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2728.732,2733.069,"Even though he... if it is for his own benefit... in other words, it could be both at the same time."
2001.01-147,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2750.446,2763.655,"But when you say it is consistent with the instruction, you are assuming the instruction simply means you can buy or you cancel, whereas the argument is that the instruction is you can buy for my benefit or you cancel for my benefit."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2772.959,2773.852,"I would disagree, Justice Souter."
2001.01-147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.63,2779.63,"Mr. Goldblatt, before you sit down, would you say something about the fact that you have adjudications by the SEC that adopt the theory that they are arguing before us, why shouldn't we defer if the question is a close one?"
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2779.63,2793.005,As I understand it--
2001.01-147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2793.005,2802.83,These are formal adjudications under the Administrative Procedures Act and they have ruled in accordance with the theory that the government is now arguing.
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2804.484,2825.039,"--Justice Scalia, assuming... and because my time has run out... assuming that Congress in fact delegated the discretion to the Agency, I don't think you can find in any of the various things that they rely on, any rule dealing with 10(b) or Section 10b-5 that speaks to the precise issues that are raised in this case or even close to them."
2001.01-147,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2842.667,2845.184,"So you are saying we can defer it, but there's nothing to defer it to."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2845.184,2845.844,That is correct.
2001.01-147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2916.904,2917.547,"Thank you, Mr. Goldblatt."
2001.01-147,1,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,2917.547,2918.373,--Thank you.
2001.01-147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2918.373,2919.572,Mr. Roberts.
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2931.582,2935.397,"No, Your Honor, we didn't seek review of the reversal of the summary judgment."
2001.01-147,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2992.511,2993.997,Go ahead.
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2996.476,2997.219,--Okay.
2001.01-147,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3016.621,3018.767,But it doesn't say it was without their consent.
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3020.996,3022.604,It says it was part of a scheme and artifice to defraud.
2001.01-147,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3022.604,3023.225,--That's true.
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3024.461,3027.434,So I think that pretty well encompasses that.
2001.01-147,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3027.434,3037.565,"Mr. Roberts, we have apparently some, I would call it a factual disagreement, as to whether any adjudications by the SEC adopt the theory that you are arguing before us today."
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3038.745,3039.505,Okay.
2001.01-147,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3110.82,3115.75,When do you say Rule... or Section 10(b) is violated?
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3130.51,3131.338,--Yes.
2001.01-147,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3131.338,3132.468,--at the time of the sale?
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3132.468,3133.028,Yes.
2001.01-147,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3134.597,3135.257,Okay.
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3135.257,3141.285,The discretionary authority doesn't make the sale authorized because he's authorized only to sell for the benefit of the customers.
2001.01-147,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3141.285,3157.631,"Well, I mean, it seems to me that's logical and that sort of makes me worry about... about the great scope of litigation that we are inviting if you say civil actions not by the Commission but by individuals are also available under this theory."
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3166.382,3169.704,"Two... two points to address that concern, Your Honor."
2001.01-147,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3195.693,3196.929,"Well, the stock's gone up."
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3199.613,3200.44,Right.
2001.01-147,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3200.44,3209.357,"And all the plaintiff has to allege is you really didn't sell it in my interest, you sold it because you were going to run off with the proceeds, and look what happened, the stock went way up."
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3209.357,3210.1,"No, Your Honor."
2001.01-147,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3221.261,3226.091,"Well, are you saying that every breach of fiduciary duty is a fraud under 10(b)?"
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3226.091,3227.561,"No, Your Honor."
2001.01-147,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3232.224,3233.877,What about a standard churning case?
2001.01-147,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3233.877,3237.425,Aren't most breaches of fiduciary duty secret?
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3240.936,3246.137,"Many of them, particularly breaches of the duty of loyalty will be secret, Your Honor."
2001.01-147,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3276.768,3278.747,What happens with standard churning cases?
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3278.747,3282.008,"--This is... this is just like a standard churning case, Your Honor."
2001.01-147,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3284.691,3286.921,"Well, is there authority that this is a 10b-5 violation--"
2001.01-147,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3286.921,3287.581,--Yes.
