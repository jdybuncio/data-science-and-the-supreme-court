2019.17-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.145,10.87500015,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1498, Atlantic Richfield versus Christian. Ms. Blatt."
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,10.87500015,53.12,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves whether the hundreds of thousands of landowners on Superfund sites can bring state lawsuits to implement their own piecemeal hazardous waste cleanups. The answer should be no. CERCLA entrusts EPA to protect human health and the environment by developing a remedial plan that protects the whole community. Respondents are profoundly wrong that removing waste is always better than leaving it in place. Superfund sites contain extremely hazardous substances, lead, mercury, plutonium, to name a few."
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,129.63,140.36,"Ms. Blatt, I've been trying to unpackage this case in my own mind, and I start with the language of the statute."
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,142.52,143.625,"No, we're good."
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,143.625,145.73,Okay. (Laughter.)
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,145.73,146.595,I'm sorry.
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,146.595,147.2,No.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,147.2,178.07,"I am trying to figure out -- let's assume for the sake of argument that the remedial plan that the state court orders supplements, rather than contradicts, the EPA plan, that it was something in top of. I read the savings clauses to permit that."
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,201.535,215.69,"So, in terms of preemption, so it's quite emphatic to understand that Section 122(e)(6) and the over 20 administrative orders impose both a floor and a ceiling on the type of cleanup --"
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,215.69,218.56,If I disagree that it's a ceiling --
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,218.56,219.21,Well --
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,219.21,223.515,-- if I think it's just a flaw -- a floor --
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,223.515,223.88,Sure.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,223.88,234.34,-- and that the EPA has the power to decide whether any plan can supplement its own --
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,234.34,235.41,Of course.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,235.41,236.89,-- where does that leave this argument?
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,236.89,237.24,So you --
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,237.24,239.25,If -- if -- if -- if I believe --
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,239.25,240.11,Sure.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,240.11,246.895,"-- that it's a -- it's a floor only, not a ceiling --"
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,246.895,247.515,Uh-huh.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,247.515,256.89,"-- that the EPA has the right to establish when a plan will be a ceiling, where does that leave this case?"
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,256.89,257.13,Okay.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,267.7,269.28,I'm sorry.
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,269.28,278.155,EP -- federal law requires a specific action level and a specific amount of dirt that can be dug and that no wall could be built.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,279.53,279.92,At the moment?
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,279.92,280.23,Yes.
2019.17-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,291.12,292.3,"But it isn't the law, Ms. Blatt."
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,330.49,342.71,"So that's not correct because, when you said plan -- and maybe I misspoke -- the law is not a U.S. code law. It's a binding administrative order where Atlantic Richfield would incur massive penalties every day if it violated."
2019.17-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,359.61,361.46,But suppose the EPA approves.
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,374.185,380.31,So all of the pillars of their plan violate EPA's order.
2019.17-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,400.225,407.57,"Well, Ms. Blatt, same kind of question, and maybe it goes to a bunch of your arguments."
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,478.06,481.92,"No, and Section 121 deals with this directly."
2019.17-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,528.2,535.555,"So -- so what -- what do they save then? I mean, the savings is all over this statute."
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,541.405,544.33,So let -- let me be very clear how narrow our argument is.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,594.13,594.45,Ms. Blatt --
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,594.45,594.66,-- shovel.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,594.66,613.17,"-- if -- if I have questions about what state law requires, because I -- I can't find anything in the state law that requires a damages remedy to be put in trust for the remediation, that's what the court below said."
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,618.735,619.445,Uh-huh.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,619.445,635.45,"-- number one. Number two, I can't find any state law requirement that the Petitioner has to prove that they're going to actually use the money they're awarded for the purposes that they claim."
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,638.985,639.41,Yeah.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,641.99,643.69,If it is a fair question --
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,643.69,644.34,"Yeah, I was going to answer it."
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,644.34,675.125,"-- why is it preempted, meaning why wouldn't I just remand this case and say you can't make -- you can't award damages unless the other side proves or the side claiming these damages proves that it can get EPA approval of whatever it wants to do, and that it will, in fact, only use that award for those purposes?"
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,675.125,675.45,Right.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,675.79,689.495,"What's wrong with a ruling that's just that basic that says you can get more if you can prove the EPA will give you more, as simple as that?"
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,689.495,690.05,So you know --
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,690.05,690.78,What's wrong with that --
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,690.78,690.94,Sure.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,690.94,691.79,-- kind of opinion?
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,691.79,704.065,"So you took this case on the assumption -- and we cite it on page 16 of our reply brief -- all the places where the Respondent concedes, and the Montana Supreme Court expressly said, that this money has to be used to carry out the remedy."
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,746.95,752.8,So what's wrong with an opinion that we write that says what you're missing is the next step.
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,758.97,759.425,Yeah.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,759.8,764.86,"So, if -- if that's their burden, why do we need to go any further?"
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,764.86,769.07,"So I -- two responses. So, right now, they don't have federal permission."
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,772.31,773.09,I didn't say --
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,773.09,773.86,We're talking about --
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,773.86,778.56,-- they have to show that they will get EPA approval.
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,778.56,783.295,And all I'm saying is you know today. Let me just make one other point as a practical matter.
2019.17-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,813.03,847.76,"The answer -- the answer, I think, is this right, to the question, which is a question I had, too, is that in order to bring an action where the result will be an order to do certain things, dig dirt or do physical things, if they are a potentially responsible party, they have to show not that EPA might approve it, but what it says is unless such remedial action, which is the reaction they're seeking, has been authorized by EPA."
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,847.76,850.41,And you know today that --
2019.17-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,850.41,851.075,It has not.
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,851.075,852.83,"-- not only has it not been, they never ask EPA."
2019.17-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,852.83,866.305,"And, therefore, what we should do if you are right on the potentially responsible party is we should send it back and say they have to get that permission from EPA. And there is no need to answer the other questions."
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,867.76,869.13,That's wrong and I disagree.
2019.17-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,880.47,880.63,Yeah.
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,899.045,899.31,Okay.
2019.17-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,899.31,902.335,"I suspect there isn't, but am I right?"
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,902.335,902.65,Yes.
2019.17-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,911.96,912.34,Fine.
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,920.405,926.93,Because in three -- because they are landowners with -- with hazardous waste on a Superfund site.
2019.17-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,935.46,939.455,But they say they are not potentially responsible.
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,949.95,969.29,"So no, and here is why: Potentially responsible parties has always been understood by this Court and everyone else as a status, not whether you could be liable. And their rule that says could you be liable at any given point in time is not only unheard of, it's unworkable, because you would never know whether a court would accept a defense, including --"
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,969.29,990.415,"Whether they were or they weren't potentially responsible parties, they are landowners, correct? And do I understand correctly, whether they're PRPs or not, if they're landowners, they can't take any -- they can't make any change without EPA approval?"
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,990.415,999.11,"They can't take a statutorily defined term called remedial action that's defined in 101/24, and it defines what a remedial action is."
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1004.76,1023.205,"Whether the PRP is responsible to someone else or to the EPA, whether they're continuous landowners or something else that exempts them, that -- that's my bottom line, which is the mere fact that they want to take some action on their land that's remedial, they would have to get EPA approval?"
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1023.205,1024.36,Absolutely.
2019.17-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1025.86,1038.5,"Can you point me to the provision that says that, that says whether they're PRPs or not, as long as they're landowners, if they're going to take any remedial action on their property?"
2019.17-1498,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1038.5,1044.895,So 122(e)(6) is the one that says PRPs have to have EPA's permission for any remedial action.
2019.17-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1061.84,1074.23,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michel."
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1074.23,1112.74,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States is here because the narrow aspect of Respondents' suit that is before this Court, namely the request for a distinctive state law remedy under which a jury may authorize a plan to clean up toxic contamination at a Superfund site in a way that conflicts with and in many respects physically destroys the EPA plan selected under CERCLA, squarely conflicts with CERCLA and would jeopardize EPA's cleanups at this Superfund site and other Superfund sites across the nation. Now, to go to some of the questions that have -- have been raised already, this is a narrow -- our argument here is narrow."
2019.17-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1170.38,1176.08,"Sorry, are you agreeing with Ms. Blatt that your plan is both the floor and the ceiling?"
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1176.08,1183.63,"So I think it -- not necessarily in every respect, but I think in the respect that matters in this case, it is."
2019.17-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1184.03,1185.765,"No, no, no, let me -- let me go back."
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1188.765,1190.78,"I mean, an EPA --"
2019.17-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1190.78,1196.1,"An owner can come to you and say I want to do more, and you can decide yes or no, right?"
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1196.1,1197.35,"Yes, absolutely."
2019.17-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1197.35,1198.93,So it's not always the ceiling.
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1198.93,1199.85,I mean -- yes.
2019.17-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1201.1,1201.25,All right.
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1201.25,1203.13,"-- as we discussed, as -- as Ms. Blatt discussed at length --"
2019.17-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1203.13,1219.47,So are you reading their state -- are you reading this remedy as requiring the remediation that's awarded no matter what? With or without EPA approval?
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1219.47,1230.31,I -- I think the Montana Supreme Court decision implies that Respondents could move forward with their claim as it now exists even if they didn't have EPA approval. And we think that is --
2019.17-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1230.31,1236.09,"How about if they did, if they could get your approval, if they could show that they could get your approval?"
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1236.09,1242.31,"I mean, if they could get our approval under 122(e)(6), then we wouldn't have a problem with -- with the suit, but I think that --"
2019.17-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1242.31,1242.49,All right.
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1275.615,1282.99,"So I think an important distinction is that if they were found to be a contiguous landowner, that would not take them out of the status of being a PRP."
2019.17-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1286.78,1287.19,All right.
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1303.59,1306.68,And that's an instinct that EPA shares as we quote in our brief.
2019.17-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1313.18,1366.615,"So, Mr. Michel, if I could ask about the PRP status, because there are obvious consequences of labeling somebody a PRP in the way that you suggest, that these sites -- and they can be sites for decades and decade and -- and deprive people of doing some significant things that they want to do to their land. And the question, I guess, is why do you -- why do we think the statute requires those consequences as to a person whom has -- who has never been treated as a PRP by the government, who has never been involved in settlement negotiations, who, under reigning law, including the statute of limitations, has no liability exposure? I mean, it would seem a big deal to take a person like that and say you've lost some significant property rights."
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1367.57,1374.9,"So I think two responses. First, I do want to make clear that 122(e)(6), the PRP provision that we're talking about here, only applies to remedial action."
2019.17-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1377.62,1380.75,But I said some significant things.
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1380.75,1381.14,So -- so --
2019.17-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1381.14,1383.89,"So, you know, look, that you can still, you know, make a garden."
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1383.89,1385.56,"Absolutely, you can still make a garden."
2019.17-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1407.59,1427.6,"So I guess I -- I -- I completely take the point that that might have been a sensible policy decision for Congress to make, but, as I look at these provisions, the only -- the -- the -- where this PRP comes from is -- is -- is in a section that deals with settlement negotiations. And these people were not ever involved in settlement negotiations."
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1437.74,1439.47,"So I -- I don't think so, Justice Kagan."
2019.17-1498,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1499.22,1511.02,"But it seems a very indirect way for Congress to have gone about this, as Justice Kagan says, to, in essence, hinder a landowner from doing any significant action for decades."
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1511.02,1524.52,"I mean, I think on -- it's not that strange to see that an owner of a Superfund site, somebody who lives on a contaminated property, is hindered from taking remedial action, which is a fairly significant action, without EPA approval."
2019.17-1498,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1529.9,1533.94,"So your two answers are, one, it's only significant action and, two, EPA could grant approval?"
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1533.94,1534.665,Absolutely.
2019.17-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1542.525,1569.06,"Then -- then what is your answer to the question Ms. Blatt was asked? If we say the landowners are PRPs and they have to get EPA permission for any restoration that they want to do, if the Court said that, then I don't see that the further questions in this case need to be answered."
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1572.405,1573.73,"I agree with you, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.17-1498,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1581.6,1588.385,What do we do about the government's prior representations that permission might be granted for something like this?
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1588.385,1593.69,"Well, I mean, the government stands ready to listen to EPA -- to any proposals from the landowners."
2019.17-1498,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1602.03,1605.48,So it's still at least possible that the government might approve something like this?
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1605.48,1613.89,"I mean, based on what we know, we've made very clear, we're now in the Supreme Court litigating this case, that we would not approve what we understand their plan to be, but we're not saying never."
2019.17-1498,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1615.86,1622.365,"And I might -- might have missed it, but just when is the government's role here likely to finish in this particular site?"
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1622.365,1635.43,"So I think the government -- the ongoing remediation will continue through 2025, is the latest -- is the latest projection. It may be that, you know, there are continuing operations beyond that, but the active site remediation we expect to continue through about 2025."
2019.17-1498,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1635.43,1647.155,"Is there -- is there a takings claim, do you think, that arises from the government's position that any remediation efforts for a period of, I guess, 45 years is prohibited by landowners?"
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1647.155,1651.02,"I mean, in the literal sense, there's no takings claim because they haven't raised one in this case."
2019.17-1498,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1664.63,1673.41,"Well, it's -- it's -- it's improved the value of the property from its prior state but not -- not to a level that state law would allow."
2019.17-1498,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1673.41,1679.63,"Well, I -- I do think that that's an important point, Justice Gorsuch, is that the EPA plan fully complies with the state environmental laws."
2019.17-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1685.07,1693.135,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Palmore."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1693.135,1708.61,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court lacks jurisdiction, but, if it finds it has jurisdiction, it should affirm. Briefly on jurisdiction: The decision below affirming denial of summary judgment on one damages theory and remanding for trial is non-final."
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1724.58,1726.15,"If we -- I'm sorry, go ahead."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1726.15,1736.875,"-- that CERCLA does not establish a comprehensive remedial framework; instead, it leaves untouched state judgments about causes of action and the scope of liability for property damage."
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1816.06,1861.265,"I -- I still have a problem, which is it seems to me that if you go on a piece of -- if you own a piece of land and you know the EPA has been fixing it up, that whether you're responsible financially for the cleanup, that you shouldn't be able to interfere with the EPA's efforts, meaning you might have a takings claim, as Justice Gorsuch claims, you might have some other claims, but I don't know how you can go about instituting a plan without conflict preemption, instituting a plan that interferes with what the EPA is doing."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1861.265,1866.145,"Your Honor, first of all, and this is critical, there is no interference here."
2019.17-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1900.23,1909.42,"Well, on the ground -- on the groundwater, I understand their position to be that if they did do something along the lines that you're proposing, it would have very significant adverse impacts."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1921.795,1957.04,"A couple answers on that, Chief Justice Roberts. First of all, they decided, and if you look at the actual regulatory materials, and that -- the EPA makes decisions in this area through records of decision, which are official documents, they say they didn't want to do the groundwater remedy, it was a different wall, it was a different one, because it was technically impracticable, which is a term of art under CERCLA for too expensive. In the regulatory materials, there is absolutely no finding that that wall, much less the one that we've proposed which is different, would call any environmental harm."
2019.17-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1971.38,1974.3,So you're talking about the particular specifics in your case.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2009.055,2013.27,"Well, here, Mr. Chief Justice, the issue isn't we'll get to that later."
2019.17-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2022.62,2024.39,I'm trying to move beyond your particular --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2024.39,2032.93,And I understand that. So one can imagine a different case involving a conflict preemption claim with respect to the EPA remedial orders.
2019.17-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2077.88,2091.665,"No, the problem isn't -- I don't think the problem we're stating is anything to do with preemption or anything. It's just whether someone in your position should first have to go and get the EPA's permission. And you're talking about a shovel of dirt or something."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2129.405,2131.685,"Your Honor, a couple answers."
2019.17-1498,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2176.4,2177.835,I -- I --
2019.17-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2177.835,2183.41500005,It's been said they are covered parties.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2223.78999995,2226.385,There could be a number of ways.
2019.17-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2285.64,2299.63,"Well, it did -- it did, Mr. Palmore, but, under your theory, how would you decide whether somebody is a potentially responsible party? It sounds like you would need a court adjudication to do that. And that seems unlikely that Congress meant for that to happen."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2299.63,2302.84,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think it would necessarily need a court adjudication."
2019.17-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2334.99,2344.92,"So you're saying that even in the absence of the statute of limitations issue, these would not be potentially responsible parties because the government is subject to a kind of estoppel principle?"
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2344.92,2362.015,"I'm saying that if there is some concern about how will we know who a potentially responsible party is, the government has tools to at least put people on notice that it thinks they are potentially responsible parties. Now, of course, it might be wrong. But, in -- in this case, though, we never got any of those kinds of notices."
2019.17-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2369.06,2376.295,They are -- they -- they own land that contains hazardous substances.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2392.95,2394.95,"It does, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.17-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2423.83,2424.21,I understood --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2424.21,2424.46,And if that --
2019.17-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2424.46,2435.21,"-- Ms. Blatt, as I -- because I made that point to her, and I thought that she said to me that there are other places in the statute which use the term ""potentially responsible parties,"" so that it's not all about settlement."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2435.21,2466.87,"There are a few others, most of them refer back to the settlement provision, but I think that explains the purpose of 122(e)(6) and also explains why it should be read according to its ordinary plain terms, which ""potentially responsible"" means -- ""potentially responsible"" means like someone who could be liable, which is that when there are settlement negotiations and EPA has notified all the PRPs of the settlement negotiations and included them -- something they've never done here, we've been excluded -- then they don't want these -- these parties who face possible liability and, therefore, are in settlement negotiations to go off and do their own remedial plan."
2019.17-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2466.87,2474.375,But you think a party could be potentially responsible at one point but then at a later point cease to be potentially responsible?
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2474.375,2476.15,"Absolutely, Your Honor, I do think that."
2019.17-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2476.315,2477.03,And what sense --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2477.03,2477.63,-- that's inherent in the --
2019.17-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2477.63,2487.225,-- would -- what sense would that make with respect to a rule limiting the ability of that party to engage in remediation? It's not consistent with the EPA plan.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2487.225,2490.46,"Because, Your Honor, first of all, that's the way statute of limitations work."
2019.17-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2538.1,2550.12,"Can I go back to Justice Kagan's question for a second? If EPA notified landowners early on that they were all PRPs, and you disagreed, how would that be resolved?"
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2550.12,2555.6,"Well, I think we -- we would then -- I think it kind of depends on how it comes up here."
2019.17-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2587.6,2602.54,"I think her question went to it would be odd to think that the statute creates uncertainty about who is subject -- who is a PRP and who isn't, given who needs to get approval from EPA to do improvements on the land."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2615.43,2619.05,"Well, Your Honor, of course, EPA has the ability to provide some measure of certainty."
2019.17-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2626.375,2626.65,Right.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2637.14,2647.47,"Perhaps, Your Honor. But I think that the assumption behind those kinds of questions is that EPA critically needs 122(e)(6) in order to effectuate its goals --"
2019.17-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2647.47,2647.92,Would -- would you --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2647.92,2648.14,-- on a CERCLA run --
2019.17-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2648.14,2648.53,-- think it would be a --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2648.53,2649.23,"-- site, and that's not correct."
2019.17-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2649.23,2665.055,"-- would you think it would be an appropriate rule if basically it were up to EPA to designate potentially responsible parties or at least that there were a strong presumption that, if EPA designated somebody as a potentially responsible party, they were one?"
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2665.055,2683.9,"I -- I -- I don't -- they certainly don't have the -- the power to do it unquestionably, because it's -- it's a defined term under the statute. So they did send us such a letter as a litigation filing, as a letter to counsel, right before the cert petition in this case was filed. And so I don't think that -- that's not binding because they're wrong."
2019.17-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2695.04,2695.18,"Yeah, I --"
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2695.18,2695.4,-- of people --
2019.17-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2695.4,2696.46,-- actually -- you're quite right.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2708.435,2709.53,Absolutely.
2019.17-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2713.03,2722.545,"The problem, knowing your land -- your clients are landowners of land that is polluted, and it's a Superfund site. Now they know that."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2722.545,2723.01,Yes.
2019.17-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2723.01,2727.51,You're a good lawyer. I wouldn't think there was actually a problem of their being ignorant.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2800.94,2803.74,"Perhaps, Your Honor. First of all, a couple answers."
2019.17-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2807.52,2809.68,They did for damages. There is no doubt.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2809.68,2810.27,And for what --
2019.17-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2810.27,2811.11,But is there --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2811.11,2811.2,-- and --
2019.17-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.2,2816.68,-- any indication they wanted physical changes to be made by 40 different entities?
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2816.68,2817.24,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.17-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2838.28,2855.61,"But what, Mr. Palmore, of the argument that what the state court might order conflicts with what EEOC -- that what the EPA, for -- one example was given here."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2892.84,2913.785,"Justice Ginsburg, of course, if EPA thinks that a remedy is going to cause harm, as it said in its invitation, we believe it has ample tools to stop it. Second of all, there is simply in this case -- that might be an issue in another case. In this case, there is no such finding in any of the regulatory documents of -- of environmental harm. They just said we're going to go this far and no further."
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2928.63,2959.465,"Maybe it was a moot question if it's your obligation to ask them, meaning, if you are a PRP and that's what we conclude, it would be your obligation to ask them for permission. So, if Ms. Blatt is right that the award here, assuming you were to get one, were conditioned on you being a PRP and any action you took had to be approved by the EPA, what damage does this do to you?"
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2959.465,2960.71,That would be a question --
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2960.71,2967.2,You -- you would have administrative remedies to challenge their denial of any activity you wanted to take.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2987.065,2992.09,"Well, Your Honor, of course, our position is we're not required to get approval because we're not PRPs."
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2998.2,2998.86,I don't have to decide that.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2998.86,2999.49,-- of the definition of owner --
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2999.49,2999.9,That -- the Court --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2999.9,3001.53,"Well, their argument is all owners are PRPs."
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3001.53,3002.02,Whether --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3002.02,3002.76,If we're not owners --
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3002.76,3003.18,-- whether --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3003.18,3003.66,-- we're not a PRP.
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3003.66,3004.46,-- just assume --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3004.46,3004.67,If you --
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3004.67,3005.26,-- that we rule that you're --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3005.26,3009.61,"-- assume away all of that, then it's really a state law question. This is a state law question."
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3009.61,3011.1,"No, it's not a state law question."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3011.1,3011.61,It -- it --
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3011.61,3024.695,"We would hold that it would -- it would conflict with federal law, with federal rules, if you go ahead with that -- with remediation without EPA approval."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3035.61,3053.96,"The reason that would be a remand question, Justice Sotomayor, is because we haven't asked the EPA for that permission because we've -- we don't believe we are PRPs. And, in fact, EPA itself took no position on whether we are PRPs in this very case. So we might be able to get in the district court in Montana --"
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3053.96,3055.33,I thought their whole brief said you were --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3055.33,3068.845,"In the district court in Montana, the U.S. Government said we take no position on whether landowners here are PRPs. Their position has changed dramatically over time. What I'm saying is we never had any reason to seek their permission."
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3084.0,3085.22,"No, it's not a state law question."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3085.22,3086.26,It's embedded -- it's a federal question --
2019.17-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3086.26,3088.21,"We have said there's a conflict, it's a federal question --"
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3088.21,3099.13,It's a federal question embedded in a state law question because the state law question is: Do we intend to use this money to clean up our land? And that prevents windfalls.
2019.17-1498,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3117.545,3117.74,Can --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3117.74,3119.63,If I could return to Justice Breyer's question.
2019.17-1498,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3119.63,3124.085,"Well, okay, before you do that, I just was hoping you might return to Justice Ginsburg's question."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3151.795,3152.77,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.17-1498,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3154.2,3155.4,"Because 122 won't work, right?"
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3155.4,3156.49,You don't have to take my word for it.
2019.17-1498,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3174.05,3177.955,Can it do that even with respect to somebody who's not a PRP?
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3177.955,3178.82,Absolutely.
2019.17-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3228.775,3245.93,"Am I right that your answer to Justice Gorsuch's question really just turns on who has the burden? Under your theory, EPA has the burden to initiate proceedings; under the other side's argument, the landowner has the burden to go to EPA first? Is that an accurate way of looking at it?"
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3245.93,3247.01,"That is, Your Honor."
2019.17-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3257.92,3260.96,The question is whether CERCLA displaces that presumption.

2019.17-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3263.435,3263.74,Right.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3263.74,3267.82,"Right? A thousand years from now, under their view, we would -- if we wanted to remove a shovelful --"
2019.17-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3267.82,3268.35,But either --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3268.35,3268.71,-- of dirt --
2019.17-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3268.71,3270.15,-- way -- sorry to interrupt.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3277.34,3281.735,"Yeah, but I think the default rule is critical, right? I mean, we have the bundle of property rights --"
2019.17-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3281.735,3281.93,Yeah.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3281.93,3286.91,"-- and if we, you know, commit an environmental offense, then EPA as a regulator can use its power --"
2019.17-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3286.91,3287.24,What would the --
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3287.24,3287.62,-- to go after us.
2019.17-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3287.62,3293.31,-- government have to show? What's the -- what would -- what would the test be? What would the legal standard be?
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3293.31,3303.61,"If -- if they went after us, it would be a violation of -- of CERCLA. These are the -- this is what -- and the government itself took the position that those tools are fully adequate here to protect the integrity of the remedy."
2019.17-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3303.61,3306.035,These things are likely to be pretty complicated.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3347.495,3347.75,Right.
2019.17-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3351.23,3361.83,"And it might have used the words potentially responsible person has to go to EPA and, by that, meant that those people who live or own property on a toxic waste center."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3362.73,3366.31,"Right, Your Honor, their position is that every single private property landowner --"
2019.17-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3366.31,3366.37,Yeah.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3366.37,3372.43,-- in this vast 300-square-mile Superfund site has to get their permission to remove even a shovelful of dirt from their own backyard.
2019.17-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3372.43,3373.67,"No, I don't know that they --"
2019.17-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3373.67,3375.16,"Well, but that's the reason, though --"
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3375.16,3376.99,That is page 34 of the Blue Brief.
2019.17-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3398.76,3399.85,And are you saying also it's an --
2019.17-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3399.85,3403.01,"Well, you can say dig out -- you can say dig out part of their backyard."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3416.85,3417.01,And if --
2019.17-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3417.01,3422.615,"-- on your land, but you can't overlook the fact that that is going to have harmful effects on everybody else around you."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3422.615,3427.86,"And if you assume that harm that's assumed, embedded, in your question, they have the tools to go after that."
2019.17-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3434.36,3434.69,I guess the --
2019.17-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3434.69,3434.81,Just --
2019.17-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3434.81,3439.725,"-- question, though, is -- and, you know, you might say, look, this is a policy matter and Congress decided it."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3453.665,3457.46,"Well, EPA is, of course, all over this site, and it can enforce the law here."
2019.17-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3482.84,3490.16,But your -- your -- your parade of horribles can still come true with EPA being aggressive in getting to all those places.
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3490.99,3492.73,If -- if they want to come out -- you're right.
2019.17-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3492.73,3502.715,"-- the question Justice Breyer asked is does it make sense to have you go to EPA first so that they can maintain control? ""Comprehensive"" is the word in the statute after all."
2019.17-1498,2,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3502.715,3513.035,"Your Honor, there's no evidence that Congress intended this obscure corner of Section 122 about settlements to give EPA that kind of vast control forever over private property."
