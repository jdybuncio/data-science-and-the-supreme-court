2018.18-389,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.195,7.825,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-389, Parker Drilling Management Services versus Newton. Mr. Clement."
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,7.825,19.93,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: California wage-and-hour law is neither applicable on the Outer Continental Shelf nor consistent with the federal Fair Labor Standards Act."
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,55.92,56.62,Not -- not quite.
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,56.62,57.125,-- judgments --
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,57.125,58.09,Not quite.
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,88.705,108.89,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think some of the unusual characteristics about state law when it's borrowed and then sort of transformed into federal law on the shelf actually, I think, help provide the context that informs the meaning of the word ""applicable."" I -- I don't think there's any real doubt here that ""applicable"" means suitable or appropriate or fit for a purpose."
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,118.33,121.06,But tell me why -- when it's not inconsistent.
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,138.96,155.95,"Well, to -- I want to answer your question, Justice Sotomayor, but I -- first, I do want to point out I view the statute as really having two requirements, that it has to be state law applies to the extent it is applicable and not inconsistent. Now, to talk to the non-inconsistent piece, here, I think the inconsistency is pretty glaring."
2018.18-389,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,289.25,289.43,Mister --
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,289.43,291.38,The Fair Labor Standards -- sorry.
2018.18-389,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,291.38,292.8,Finish your sentence.
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,292.8,299.02,The Fair Labor Standards Act is an ordinary savings clause which I think accommodates federalism but wouldn't apply in the -- a federal enclave.
2018.18-389,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,299.02,313.465,"After all that, I'm going to take you back to the work -- word ""applicable."" The language here is clearly not the clearest way of expressing what you want to express, which is that state law applies when there's a gap in federal law."
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,333.41,335.65,I would really say I have two principal arguments.
2018.18-389,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,375.895,388.68,"Well, possibly because you know that you want this to be administered by federal agents, and if it's going to be administered by federal agents, it should be federal law. So -- and let -- let's just go to the enclaves business --"
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,388.68,388.81,Sure.
2018.18-389,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,388.81,414.825,"-- because I think that that's an important part of your argument, and -- and it's something on which people seem to disagree, and it seems as though it should have a clear answer, but I'm honestly not finding it. So, as I understand Mr. Frederick's position, he says that, apart from the ACA, the crimes act, that -- that, in fact, in federal enclaves, state civil law is applied."
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,416.595,459.15,"We do think that's wrong, and, you know, I think fortunately for me, the federal government agrees with me and has agreed with me in an unbroken chain at least since about 1958, when they put together that exhaustive survey, which the Solicitor General cites, which is roughly contemporaneous with OCSLA, and the Justice Department was up there testifying in front of Congress. So I tend to think that I'm in pretty good company on my understanding of federal enclave law, but I do understand federal enclave law very -- very succinctly as this, which is, when you have a new federal enclave, you don't borrow state law as a general matter and you specifically don't borrow state law when there's federal law on the same matters, which I think is the language right from McGlinn."
2018.18-389,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,459.15,461.7,Even as to preexisting state law?
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,461.7,463.67,Even as to preexisting state law.
2018.18-389,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,465.83,475.82,And do -- how do we know that? Where do -- where is that coming from? Do we have cases that say that? Do we -- is there some like federal manual that says that? What -- what's --
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,475.82,476.31,So --
2018.18-389,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,476.31,482.26,"I feel as though people -- this should be something with an answer, and all we have is sort of assertions on both sides."
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,482.26,484.75,So there's -- there's three places I would look.
2018.18-389,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,572.52,576.26,Are there -- are there federal enclaves inside California?
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,576.26,577.275,There are.
2018.18-389,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,577.275,580.88,And what is the labor law regime there?
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,580.88,587.98,The -- the majority view is that the Fair Labor Standard Acts -- Act does not apply to the federal enclaves when they are within a state.
2018.18-389,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,639.38,640.91,And it would be the state law?
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,640.91,641.86,"No, no."
2018.18-389,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,688.48,690.01,Can we -- can we go back to something --
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,690.01,690.175,Sure.
2018.18-389,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,690.175,706.085,"-- Justice Sotomayor suggested, and I wonder if you agree with it, that there's no problem because the Secretary can knock out any state reg -- any state law it doesn't -- doesn't want by regulation."
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,706.085,708.26,"We -- we don't agree with that, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.18-389,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,749.41,749.95,"Well, but isn't it that --"
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,749.95,752.23,Is there anything but leasing on the continental shelf?
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,752.23,752.735,I'm sorry?
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,752.735,759.065,Is there anything but leasing on the continental shelf? Nobody owns those operations.
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,763.715,797.18,"Sure, but -- but the specific term says the leases, not leasing. And, again, you know, I don't want to say that I couldn't make an argument, but I -- I would say based on the plain language of the regulatory authority, I don't think the Secretary of Interior has that authority, and I think it would be a little weird, frankly, for the Secretary of Interior to effectively have to take action to vindicate the judgment of the wage-and-hour division regulators, who looked at the specific issue of how to treat sleep time and came to a considered conclusion that sleep time, we don't want to make automatically part of hours worked."
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,797.18,827.28,"One -- one of the difficulties I have here is, how do you define void or gap? So let's talk about that, because you can always define it broadly or narrowly. If there's a state law that says you can't fire somebody for going to jury service for a state calling, not a federal, is that a void or gap that the federal law doesn't do that?"
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,827.28,848.0,"I -- I -- I would probably say in that situation that there's not a gap in federal law because federal law addresses the general subject of sort of employment discrimination and the like. I -- I actually think that -- I mean, obviously, the jury service example's probably uniquely unlikely to arise directly on the Outer Continental Shelf and it also might be the kind of thing --"
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,848.0,848.3,Not quite.
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,853.195,853.69,Yeah.
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,854.06,859.985,"And you go to your employer and you say, out on the shelf: I got to take a week because I've got to go serve."
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,859.985,861.43,"And -- and -- well, and so there's a --"
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,861.43,864.225,"And to you, that's not -- can you see the other side of that argument?"
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,864.225,867.21,I -- I can see the other side of that argument and I can also see that that --
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,867.21,889.185,"So that -- that -- that begs the question, which is, I know conflict preemption and I know that some of my colleagues don't like it, but at least there's a well-defined body of law. Under your views, we're back to now defining a different kind of conflict preemption, one that has to do with voids and gaps."
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,889.185,890.93,"Well, so, Justice Sotomayor, a couple --"
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,890.93,897.94,So why isn't a statute of limitations or a failure to have one not a void? There is a federal common law.
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,909.745,917.195,"Well, specifically, in that case, you were -- you were looking at the question of whether you should borrow a statute of limitations from federal common law."
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,924.16,928.885,How about the high seas -- Death on the High Seas Act? That was federal law.
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,928.885,931.13,That -- that's right. And -- and this --
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,931.13,932.975,And we still borrowed state law.
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,932.975,933.675,Exactly.
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,942.94,944.17,But we had federal law that answered --
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,944.17,944.93,-- to the Death on the High Seas Act --
2018.18-389,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,944.93,947.32,-- but we had federal law that answered the question.
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,947.32,948.15,Exactly.
2018.18-389,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,990.945,1015.77,"Just on that, Mr. Clement, and I apologize, but I think people are a little bit overreading the Fifth Circuit decision or let me just put out the possibility that that's true. The Fifth Circuit decision, when it talks about these gaps, is really saying that there's a federal remedial scheme that covers a problem and so that there's no need to look for remedies anyplace else. And that's a very different kind of situation than the one we have here, isn't it?"
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1015.77,1035.325,"No, I -- I think this is exactly the same situation, which is you do have a federal remedial regime that provides a remedy for overwork, and you don't need to look to state law to borrow a different regime that you would then make a second and duplicative and I think inconsistent federal minimum wage statute."
2018.18-389,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1035.325,1040.67,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.18-389,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1040.67,1045.86,Thank you.
2018.18-389,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1045.86,1047.35,Mr. Michel.
2018.18-389,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1047.35,1057.755,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: More than 70 years ago, in United States versus California, this Court clarified the federal government's paramount sovereignty over the continental shelf."
2018.18-389,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1104.7,1118.03,How would federal officials enforce the state law? Are there sort of administrative responsibilities with respect to the state employment law that the federal officials would have to undertake or --
2018.18-389,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1118.03,1123.04,That -- that is -- it's a -- that is a big concern that -- that -- that we have.
2018.18-389,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1140.7,1155.925,"But, I mean, I -- are they filling out forms, are they enforcing? I mean, I don't quite know what you're talking about when you say federal officials will have to administer. I mean, it -- are they just simply checking to make sure that they're being paid whatever it is, $12 or --"
2018.18-389,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1155.925,1156.75,"I see, yeah."
2018.18-389,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1220.41,1223.495,"The -- what -- one -- two questions, but one is minor."
2018.18-389,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1241.32,1242.49,I have a pretty quick answer.
2018.18-389,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1244.55,1245.93,"Ninety-seven percent, okay."
2018.18-389,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1315.8,1326.1,"So I -- I think, to start, there is a default federal enclave rule. And I -- and I -- my friend is correct that you can customize enclaves in different ways."
2018.18-389,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1331.71,1335.235,"Yeah, yeah, but I'm thinking of civil and I'm thinking of regulatory."
2018.18-389,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1335.235,1352.86,"And -- and on the civil side, the -- the law, at least since 1885 in this Court's decision in McGlinn, is that federal law is exclusive in the enclave, with the exception of preexisting state law that is not in conflict with and not inconsistent with federal law."
2018.18-389,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1352.86,1361.59,"Oh, so I understand you and Mr. Clement to have a little bit of a gap there, because I understood Mr. Clement -- (Laughter.)"
2018.18-389,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1361.59,1371.15,"I understood Mr. Clement to say that even as to preexisting state law, that that did not apply of its own force as the default rule."
2018.18-389,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1376.61,1378.41,I -- I think that's -- that's the rule of McGlinn.
2018.18-389,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1388.44,1433.75,"Yeah, but we do have to confront it, I think, because, after all, it -- there is a lot of preexisting state law in respect to many federal enclaves. And so, if the rule was no gap is necessary, all we look to see is preemption, then there was a vast amount of non-preempted state law that federal enclaves had to accept as theirs, namely, all preexisting. And so why would there be a different rule where the statute is different and the words don't require a gap -- they might -- why would you want to have, though, a different rule for a subsequent state law? I mean, of course, if it's preempted, it's out."
2018.18-389,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1433.75,1434.44,Yes.
2018.18-389,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1434.44,1435.685,But I mean non-preempted.
2018.18-389,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1435.685,1436.18,Right.
2018.18-389,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1472.69,1474.5,My question is not about preemption.
2018.18-389,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1500.91,1505.62,"Yeah, I -- I think it goes to -- to the core nature of a federal enclave, Justice Breyer."
2018.18-389,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1523.56,1539.11,"Could you address the -- the Secretary of the Interior's -- the extent of the power as you see it? Do you agree with Mr. Waxman that it's limited to just leasing or leases, or do you think it's a broader power?"
2018.18-389,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1539.11,1542.85,"I think it's a little broader, but I'm relying on the same provision that my friend did, which is 1334(a)."
2018.18-389,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1591.465,1602.98,"Mr. Michel, if -- if you are right, what work is the word ""inconsistent"" doing? In other words, how can a state law be inconsistent with federal law if there's a total void in federal law?"
2018.18-389,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1602.98,1612.81,"So I -- I agree with you that, you know, the -- the -- the two words shed a lot of light on each other, and -- and there may not be a huge gap, so to speak, between them, but I do think there are some examples."
2018.18-389,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1648.42,1651.29,I guess I'm having a little bit of a hard time -- sorry.
2018.18-389,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1651.29,1651.83,Go ahead.
2018.18-389,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1651.83,1655.52,"Well, just understanding that example and the ones in your brief."
2018.18-389,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1665.365,1674.665,"I think it's both. Federal law is the most obvious example, but the cases have also referred to federal policy. So inconsistency with either, we think, would be a reason not to assimilate the statute."
2018.18-389,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1674.665,1680.915,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick."
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1680.915,1703.36,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our position is that the plain language of OCSLA and the Fair Labor Standards Act control this case and that the Ninth Circuit was correct in determining that the California Labor Code provisions at issue here are both applicable and not inconsistent with federal law."
2018.18-389,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1708.11,1721.925,"How -- how close does your position come to the one thing we know Congress rejected; that is, direct application of state law? Instead, state law is incorporated as federal law."
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1724.285,1725.225,Yes.
2018.18-389,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1836.34,1843.27,Which -- which federal agency has Congress given preemptive authority with respect to the Outer Continental Shelf?
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1843.27,1844.535,The Interior Department.
2018.18-389,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1844.535,1853.51,"So, even on a question of labor law, the Interior Department could issue regulations that of their own force would preempt the California rules?"
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1853.51,1854.66,"Yes, yes."
2018.18-389,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1898.55,1898.87,How -- how is a --
2018.18-389,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1898.87,1909.66,"On the consistence -- on the consistency point, I understand what -- I understand it to be our basic rule in preemption analysis that something like this would generally not be inconsistent."
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1945.445,1946.18,No.
2018.18-389,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1947.34,1950.08,I thought you might say that. (Laughter.)
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1950.08,1953.265,"Well, and let me refer you to one of your cases, Your Honor."
2018.18-389,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1978.31,1990.245,"But was that a consistency analysis that -- of the sort that you would apply in -- it couldn't have been under the normal preemption cases, because it's two different sources of federal law, whether -- rather than federal or state."
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1990.245,1997.36,"No, but let me refer you to the savings clause plain language, because, again, I think that the statute operates in our favor."
2018.18-389,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2056.6,2059.38,But how does that apply to this particular case?
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2059.38,2074.34,"It applies to this particular case because California has issued wage orders that provide for more generous minimum wage per hour standards, as well as definition of what a work week is and the per hour --"
2018.18-389,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2074.34,2077.175,"Well, I thought the dispute was about the definition of a work week."
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2077.175,2107.29,"It is in part a dispute about the definition of a work week and in part a definition of whether or not certain things that are done within that work week, time spent, for instance, meal allowances, how sleep time is calculated, et cetera, are within the word -- within the limit. And so, to that extent, Your Honor, what we have in the Fair Labor Standards Act are some provisions that do speak to the question with the savings clause and some that do not speak at all."
2018.18-389,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2139.29,2139.53,If your --
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2139.53,2140.16,-- with the standards.
2018.18-389,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2140.16,2160.33,"Mr. Frederick, on the savings clause, I thought the savings clause was meant to allow a state to apply its own more protective regime in a domain over which the state is sovereign, but a state is not sovereign over the Intercontinental Shelf."
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2160.33,2203.08,"That's correct, but what -- in -- in the same way, Your Honor, that in Powell, this Court determined that one federal statute provided for a higher minimum wage than what the FLSA did, we're not arguing which sovereign gets to determine the rules. What we're saying is the content of those rules varies depending on the source. And, here, the source -- just because the source of that happens to be California law doesn't affect things. You asked earlier about enclaves in California, and let me give you a different answer than the one my colleagues on the other side gave. There is a district court decision called Korndobler which we cite in our brief and we discuss."
2018.18-389,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2247.45,2251.99,That just -- before -- that's an awful lot of weight to place on one unpublished district court decision.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2251.99,2264.12,"Well, it was answering -- and the reason why the three cases that he cites are not apposite is because, there, the state law came into existence after the creation of the federal enclave."
2018.18-389,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2356.1,2395.405,"Mr. Frederick, can I take you back to a -- a question I think Justice Alito was pursuing a moment ago? And I understand one of the important parts of your case is the definition of the work week and whether stand-by hours should be incorporated. California's treatment of them is subject to the minimum wage requirement. But the savings -- the savings clause, at least as I understand it, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, while it preserves the ability of states to raise the minimum wage, it doesn't allow them to define the work week differently than federal law does. So how do we deal with that? Why isn't your client's claim at least inconsistent with federal law to that extent?"
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2395.405,2426.465,"Well, what the -- as the Seventh Circuit has held in terms of determining what is a minimum wage, you have to look at both the pay rate and what you're multiplying that pay rate by, which is what constitutes a working hour. And a working hour is what we're dealing with when we deal with situations like is the worker under the control of the employer, subject to the employer's call-back or emergency call, et cetera."
2018.18-389,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2432.13,2435.66,Do you agree that federal law and state law differ in how they define that?
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2435.66,2449.805,"I -- they do differ, except insofar as what the Labor Department has determined is not a difference in work week. Just so we're clear about that, the 40 hours applies and the federal standard applies."
2018.18-389,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2449.805,2449.96,Right.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2450.31,2452.49,But what constitutes a compensable hour?
2018.18-389,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2452.49,2452.845,Yeah.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2452.845,2466.09,And it's that hour and what the Department of Labor's regulations say is that there is a multi-factor test for determining when a worker is under the control of the employer.
2018.18-389,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2466.09,2467.01,I -- I understand that.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2467.01,2467.31,Yes.
2018.18-389,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2467.31,2473.165,But I guess my question is still don't federal -- federal law and its definition is different than --
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2473.165,2473.48,I don't --
2018.18-389,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2473.48,2475.36,-- state law? Is that -- is that not right?
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2475.36,2478.41,"I -- I -- I -- I -- well, I would say two things about it, Justice Gorsuch."
2018.18-389,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2490.21,2491.91,"I -- we're on the same page, right?"
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2491.91,2492.17,"Yeah, yeah."
2018.18-389,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2492.17,2492.585,We are.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2492.585,2498.36,"Yeah, but -- but the issue is what constitutes a compensable hour. That actually is a fact question with --"
2018.18-389,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2498.36,2504.33,"I -- I understand that, but we have a federal law standard and we have a state law standard and they're different, arguably."
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2504.33,2504.85,Yes.
2018.18-389,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2504.85,2514.27,"And the savings clause doesn't speak to this particular issue, right? It speaks to what you multiply that by, $12 or 7, whatever."
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2514.27,2514.485,Right.
2018.18-389,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2514.485,2515.98,It doesn't deal with this issue.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2519.61,2519.72,It --
2018.18-389,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2519.72,2520.985,What -- what do we do about that?
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2520.985,2534.5,"Well, what the Labor Department has done is issued regulations and guidance where there is silence in the FLSA, and what it says is where there's silence, you incorporate or you deal with the state law and how the state law applies."
2018.18-389,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2534.5,2535.22,"Mr. Frederick, I have --"
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2535.22,2537.085,And we've got those regulations in our brief.
2018.18-389,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2537.085,2548.495,"-- I have poor memory on this issue, but didn't the court below remand to see whether there were actual inconsistencies with certain of your claims?"
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2548.495,2548.955,Yes.
2018.18-389,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2548.955,2568.625,"Number one, which were they? And, secondly, how do you deal with Mr. Clement's point that your view basically makes this identical to normal state conflict preemption? What differences do you see in the two?"
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2568.625,2569.35,Okay.
2018.18-389,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2570.77,2578.155,Why would your reading still result in a difference between normal -- the normal conflict preemption situation?
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2578.155,2580.68,"Well, let me start with the second one first then."
2018.18-389,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2615.69,2620.135,But that means that California then extends 200 miles out to sea.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2620.135,2620.49,So --
2018.18-389,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2620.49,2630.76,"And Congress could have just said that and said California extends 200 miles out to sea; however, within this part of California, federal officials will enforce the law."
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2630.76,2641.03,"So, remember, Justice Alito, that our client's shift begins and ends in California onshore in the uplands."
2018.18-389,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2654.345,2655.37,But I -- I don't think --
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2655.37,2655.785,-- and so --
2018.18-389,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2655.785,2669.91,"-- respectfully, that's responsive to the question, which is, if -- if your position were correct, then ordinary preemption principles would apply and this -- a lot of this language would seem pointless."
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2669.91,2689.215,"Well, let me try to wrap it together in this way, Justice Kavanaugh, which is that if you're looking at the substance of the law, looking at whether there's conflict and inconsistency, the preemption cases give you an intellectual way to understand the substance of that. I'm not here to argue that California controls the outcome."
2018.18-389,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2700.71,2705.435,Is -- is that what you think the principal difference is? Because I have the same concern here.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2740.19,2764.505,"Well, number one, who decides? That's a big difference in terms of what regulatory power is given to displace a state standard. Number two, you have a decision, and you talk about the compromise, but let me give you the other part of the compromise, which was that it was advocated to have federal admiralty law apply to the Outer Continental Shelf, and the Court -- Congress said no."
2018.18-389,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2880.2,2881.79,That makes sense.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2907.525,2908.13,Yes.
2018.18-389,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2908.13,2922.2,"I don't know if it's determinative, but I'm slightly worried about overturning a set of court of appeals decisions under which industry and labor and everyone have worked, 97 percent of them, for 50 years."
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2922.2,2922.45,Let me --
2018.18-389,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2922.45,2922.6,All right.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2923.14,2923.21,Yeah.
2018.18-389,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2923.21,2924.57,I do want to hear what you have to say.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2924.57,2940.32,"I -- I do, and I have a number of things to say, Justice Breyer, and I appreciate you raising this so that I can address them orally. First, the Fifth Circuit decided that gap standard in a case called Continental Oil, which was a classic maritime law case."
2018.18-389,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3102.67,3109.69,"Why -- why doesn't ""not inconsistent with"" suggest gap-filling in this context, in this statute?"
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3109.69,3130.35,"Well, for the reason that this Court in Powell explained why and also why this Court in Guerra explained why. ""Not inconsistent with"" in its ordinary parlance would mean not incompatible with. And ""incompatible"" is a word that is stronger than simply the creation of a void or a gap."
2018.18-389,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3135.31,3140.13,"Well, I would say in ordinary parlance, two different requirements are not consistent with one another."
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3140.13,3149.395,"Well, you look at whether or not the two requirements that may be different can be accommodated to each other. And that's why in --"
2018.18-389,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3149.395,3151.045,That sounds like impossibility.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3151.045,3179.625,"No, in -- in Guerra, the Court looked at the application of California's standards regarding pregnancy relief and discrimination and the federal standard for pregnancy and it determined that they were different, but the fact that the California standard was more protective meant that it was not inconsistent with what the federal law was. And so, for that reason, I think that case is the most closely on point to the actual words that we have to work with here."
2018.18-389,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3195.7,3208.115,"Well, if I think that not inconsistent is -- is consistent -- is -- can be interpreted either the way you interpret it or the way Mr. Clement interprets it, where do I go from there?"
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3208.115,3213.0,"Well, Mr. Clement doesn't give a definition in his opening brief."
2018.18-389,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3213.0,3213.17,All right.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3213.58,3214.39,In his open -- in his closing brief --
2018.18-389,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3214.39,3215.55,Then I'll amend the question.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3227.18,3231.45,"Well, I think then you look at the source of the law that's supposedly different."
2018.18-389,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3242.26,3250.99,"I don't know what you can get out of ""applicable."" Is it -- can -- can you conceive a situation in which somebody is directed to apply law that is inapplicable?"
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3250.99,3272.805,"Well, the -- the best example that I could give, California in its public resources code has quite extensive rules concerning drilling and mining on land. And one could well conclude that the word ""applicable"" could be used to say those standards don't apply to the marine environment of drilling offshore."
2018.18-389,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3325.43,3325.85,"But, if -- if there are --"
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3325.85,3327.215,-- to the concern that you're expressing.
2018.18-389,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3327.215,3356.45,"-- to pick up on Justice Alito's question, if there are two different ways one could imagine interpreting ""not inconsistent with,"" why isn't the better answer to look at the overall context here, which, as Justice Kagan said, the overall context is a clear preference, a clear congressional choice to make federal law the primary, and so that you would choose the interpretation of ""not inconsistent with"" that says different from? So what -- what's your response to that?"
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3356.45,3361.95,"Well, I think that this Court's cases have said otherwise, in both Powell and Guerra."
2018.18-389,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3385.865,3389.54,And you think the Secretary clearly has that authority under that language?
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3389.54,3396.05,"That's -- under a plain reading of the statute, Justice Kavanaugh, the Secretary does have that."
2018.18-389,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3459.95,3462.93,Do you know what happens now with worker's comp?
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3462.93,3463.635,Yes.
2018.18-389,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3463.635,3472.07,What -- what happens on the Outer Shelf with worker's comp? Because there's no FLSA rules related to that.
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3472.07,3472.61,Yes.
2018.18-389,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3472.61,3474.72,So how does it happen?
2018.18-389,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3474.72,3499.13,"In Valladolid, what this Court considered was the overlap between state worker's comp and the Longshore/Harbor Workers' Compensation Act as it was incorporated. The solicitor general at the oral argument -- and I invite you to look at the transcript -- said: Both state worker's compensation law and Longshore/Harbor apply and the worker can get the benefit of whichever one is more generous."
2018.18-389,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3507.065,3511.76,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, you have three minutes remaining."
2018.18-389,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3511.76,3513.47,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2018.18-389,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3551.925,3554.955,"It begs the question, why is that a gap?"
2018.18-389,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3554.955,3555.95,"Well, they're -- they're --"
2018.18-389,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3555.95,3556.19,I -- I --

2018.18-389,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3557.64,3558.41,You get paid for working.
2018.18-389,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3568.03,3577.37,"Because there's a specific federal statute that operates as a super-savings clause specific to federal enclaves, and that's what's missing in the A few other points just to make."
