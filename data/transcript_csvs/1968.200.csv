1968.200,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.521,"Number 200, Frank -- Ben H. Frank, petitioner, versus, United States."
1968.200,0,32245,john_b_ogden,,11.521,15.827,"We're ready, Mr. Chief Justice and member of the Court."
1968.200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.55,636.419,"Do you think that, act of Congress, a judge is permitted to, not to sentence but just to put on probation, may suspend sentencing and just put a fellow on probation?"
1968.200,0,32245,john_b_ogden,,636.419,639.573,"Well, if Your Honor please, I'm awfully sorry."
1968.200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.046,650.944,It does say -- it does distinguish between suspending the imposition it's in and the execution.
1968.200,0,32245,john_b_ogden,,650.944,653.453,"Yes, sir, but -- now, just let me call this --"
1968.200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.453,654.726,"So, there's really no difference between these?"
1968.200,0,32245,john_b_ogden,,654.726,658.793,"There's none whatever for this reason, if Your Honor please, I'll show you why."
1968.200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,724.779,728.136,Are you familiar with Mensa v. Ray?
1968.200,0,32245,john_b_ogden,,728.136,731.352,"Now, if Your Honor please, I don't -- I'm not, I'm sure."
1968.200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.825,753.26,"I thought that, there, the District Court recognized that the constitution requires a judge might, in conclusion of a criminal case, have to suspend the imposition of sentence, that is, postponing sentencing to put the man on probation."
1968.200,0,32245,john_b_ogden,,764.886,770.675,"Well, if Your Honor please, may I just say this in Court on that regard, the way I look at it."
1968.200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.362,781.807,Three years on probation?
1968.200,0,32245,john_b_ogden,,781.807,783.177,"Yes, three years on probation."
1968.200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,783.177,799.352,"Didn't the ju -- you did not know how long this in turn will be if he violates -- this gentleman violates these probations, and then the judge comes in and he comes back before the judge, do you?"
1968.200,0,32245,john_b_ogden,,799.352,803.709,"Well, I would just assume, if Your Honor please, I don't have any way of knowing, of course, but I would say --"
1968.200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,803.709,804.19,You did not say --
1968.200,0,32245,john_b_ogden,,804.19,808.088,"Three years, that bound to be some reason to put the three years."
1968.200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.088,823.976,"Yes, but just as a prior judge, do you think that if you've never sent one to jail where he's going to be and the man violates his probation and he comes back to Court, you'll want to throw him out of Court for his probation violation."
1968.200,0,32245,john_b_ogden,,828.412,842.194,"Now, if Your Honor please, that, I've always considered if you put somebody on probation for three years or five years, that any time during that period of time, if they violated the probation, they just had to go serve the three years."
1968.200,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1065.722,1078.042,Mr. Strauss.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1078.042,1081.354,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1394.199,1395.854,What you said --
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1395.854,1396.439,"Excuse me, sir?"
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1396.439,1397.184,Petty offense?
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1397.184,1397.876,"Yes, that's right."
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1397.876,1399.173,Why did you say that?
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1399.173,1400.044,I did say that.
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1400.044,1401.188,"I said, why?"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1401.188,1402.021,Why do I say?
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1402.021,1402.755,Yes.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1402.755,1427.994,"Well, in the statutory sense first, the federal probation statute, which is Section 3651 of Title 18, states without any qualification that any offense which is not punishable by life imprisonment or the death penalty may, instead, be treated by a sentence of probation."
1968.200,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1440.646,1442.712,That's five years.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1442.712,1448.604,The statute does authorize the imposition of a term of probation of five years in petty offenses.
1968.200,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1452.628,1456.835,You would still say -- suppose it wasn't on probation.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1458.475,1459.915,If he were in jail?
1968.200,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1459.915,1461.169,Yes.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1461.169,1463.072,"Quite plainly, it would be improper."
1968.200,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1464.765,1465.232,"No, that's the distinction --"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1465.232,1466.29,For five years.
1968.200,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1466.29,1471.157,Between a probation and a real -- a sentence that has to be served.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1471.157,1473.965,"We draw that distinction but, more importantly, we believe Congress has drawn that distinction."
1968.200,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1473.965,1478.922,"Not to take it from what we have several years ago, I haven't looked it up."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1487.748,1490.779,"Well, I think you're referring to Jones versus Cunningham."
1968.200,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1495.322,1496.381,What did we hold?
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1496.381,1497.666,You held that there was constraint.
1968.200,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1497.666,1498.601,There was constraint.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1498.601,1502.017,"And, we do not deny that there is constraint in this case."
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1515.932,1519.635,"Well, that's pretty serious, isn't it, to be under constraint for three years?"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1519.635,1523.594,Well all I think one has to take into account the sort of constraints which are involved.
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1524.354,1533.783,What about one -- what about reporting every Monday and have to tell everything you do be subjected to the call by the judge any time if he thinks you violate it?
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1533.783,1539.487,"Well, I think most of us would prefer that to having to report every morning at 6:45 inside a cellblock."
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1539.487,1542.821,"Yes, it might be a little less."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1542.821,1545.59,"Well, I agree that that is the question in this case."
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1552.565,1553.869,"Oh, it was 10 years --"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1553.869,1554.143,Is awfully --
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1554.143,1556.202,He's on probation for 10 years.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1556.202,1558.46,"We don't have to argue that case, thankfully."
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1558.46,1559.098,What?
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1559.098,1561.01,"Thankfully, we don't have to argue that case."
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1561.01,1566.034,"Well, it's kind of a logical descendant of this, isn't it?"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1566.034,1569.547,"Well, no, Your Honor, it's not, and for this reason."
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1637.628,1638.849,And to others.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1638.849,1643.826,"And to others as well, but to petty offenses in particular which is the question here."
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1647.398,1649.253,What was the punishment at any time?
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1655.24,1656.756,I'm not sure I understand the question.
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1656.756,1660.564,"Well, you say they have a five year sentence."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1660.564,1661.798,To probation or to jail?
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1661.798,1665.174,"I'm not talking about probation, a five year sentence."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1665.174,1670.306,"Any sentence to jail in excess of six months in a contempt case, under this Court's ruling in Cheff --"
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1670.306,1671.326,"Well, I'm not -- not any other --"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1671.326,1673.616,Would be improper.
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1674.353,1676.196,Well it's petty or not.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1676.196,1676.787,Excuse me?
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1676.787,1680.454,"Petty or not, don't you judge by what they're sentencing?"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1680.454,1686.349,"Yes, but I believe that -- Your Honor, that that question -- well, let me put it another way, if I may."
1968.200,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1756.983,1767.043,What's your view in an offense of carrying who might be a sentenced to jail --
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1767.043,1769.853,If -- if it might be a sentence of three years in jail.
1968.200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1769.853,1774.867,"And, suppose the judge had sentenced three years by suspension?"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1774.867,1781.744,"I think there's no question but that, under this Court's holdings last term, that would be an improper judgment."
1968.200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1784.986,1787.169,"No, I ask you that personally."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1805.51,1806.87,Six months.
1968.200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.08,1830.514,"I understand that if -- that, until the judge actually sentences, imposes the jail sentence, you don't know how serious he considered the offense to be."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1830.514,1832.365,"Well, I know I wouldn't take that position, Mr. Justice White."
1968.200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.365,1845.822,"And, if he had imposed for cont -- a cont -- a sentence for contempt of two years in jail and then suspended it, you would say that, under Cheff, that's improper."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1845.822,1855.409,"I would say, under Cheff, that's improper, but I also say, under Cheff, that once a judge has denied jury trial, if he then at least --"
1968.200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.409,1856.211,I agree.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1856.211,1866.005,"Goes on without giving indication that he is -- does not understand that opinion, once he has denied a jury trial, he has limit himself to six months."
1968.200,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1866.005,1866.411,And --
1968.200,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1866.411,1866.876,I had worked--
1968.200,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1866.876,1877.199,"Indeed, a copy of this I gather, and denial him of jury trial, as I understand your argument, means necessarily that he's regarded the alleged contempt, isn't it?"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1877.199,1877.854,That's right.
1968.200,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1877.854,1878.273,Yes.
1968.200,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1878.273,1888.104,"Well, what about -- the trouble I have is two years later, he violates his parole and the judge gives him six months."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1888.104,1889.355,"That is a possibility, Your Honor."
1968.200,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1889.355,1896.284,"Well, isn't that a violation of the Cheff, because I understand Cheff to say you can't give anything more than six months?"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1899.966,1901.352,"Well, I'm not sure that --"
1968.200,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1901.352,1903.532,That's a problem that I have.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1903.532,1905.021,I agree that that's a problem.
1968.200,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1952.943,1955.163,"Further, the judge wouldn't have to give six months."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1955.163,1956.226,"And, he wouldn't have to give six months."
1968.200,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1956.226,1957.21,He could give less.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1957.21,1958.109,He could give less.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1966.795,1968.231,Mr. Strauss --
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1968.231,1968.601,Yes?
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1968.601,1969.744,I beg your pardon.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1982.187,1985.086,"Yes, I believe there is."
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1990.844,1994.774,For suspending the imposition of sentence?
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1996.64,2013.404,"Yes, upon entering a judgment of conviction of any offense not punishable by death or life imprisonment, and it continues, any Court having jurisdiction to try offenses against the United States, of course that includes petty offenses, may suspend the imposition or execution of sentence."
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2022.529,2024.489,Right-- right
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2024.489,2025.502,Drew that distinction.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2025.502,2031.759,"Now, let us suppose that this petitioner violated probation."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2052.311,2053.955,"I'm not sure I follow, Your Honor."
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2054.134,2058.802,"Well, what could've -- suppose the petitioner violated the probation?"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2064.559,2065.887,Right.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2065.887,2068.4,By -- in violation of the terms of his probation.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2073.498,2079.455,"The judge in this particular circumstance may revoke probation, although he's not required to do so."
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2079.455,2080.195,"Now, what happened?"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2083.19,2083.841,"Where, in this --"
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2083.841,2085.591,"Here, right here under this --"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2085.591,2089.886,He then proceeds to sentence which he has previously suspended.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2089.886,2092.984,"Well, he hadn't susp -- he suspended the --"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2092.984,2094.625,He had suspended the imposition of the sentence.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2094.625,2096.862,Imposition of the sentence.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2102.459,2109.703,"No, I take it, that would require -- if it were a penal offense, that would require a criminal trial in itself."
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2109.703,2116.313,So the only thing that he can do at that time is to impose sentence for the initial offense?
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2116.313,2117.467,That's right.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2117.467,2125.827,"And, it's your theory then that the most he could impose then would be six months in jail?"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2125.827,2126.682,That's right.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2126.682,2151.219,"I suppose that, I think Mr. Justice asked you this and -- but if he used a different form of sentence and imposed -- judgment and imposed the sentence of three years and then suspended it, you say the consequences would be different and that, then, he was -- he would have to retry it."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2151.219,2156.544,We think that would affirmatively show that he had misunderstood this Court's ruling in Cheff.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2156.544,2158.403,Or that he had --
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2158.403,2159.315,Or that he had determined --
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2159.315,2166.088,Had decided that it was -- this was more than a petty offense is more punishment than six months?
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2166.088,2179.716,"Well, I take it, Your Honor, that if that should ever occur to a judge in the course of a trial of a contempt he had thought would be petty, what he would probably do would be to declare a mistrial at that point."
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2179.716,2180.438,And then convene a jury.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2180.438,2183.363,And convene a jury.
1968.200,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2183.363,2190.028,What was that Section you read us about suspending judgments?
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2190.028,2192.908,That's Section 3651 of Title 18.
1968.200,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2192.908,2195.443,"3651, thank you."
1968.200,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2202.125,2205.711,Mr. Strauss.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2205.711,2208.534,May it please the Court.
1968.200,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2309.013,2312.0,Who asked if it could be brought on behalf?
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2312.0,2316.483,"No one asked, but I thought I should make that clear."
1968.200,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2316.483,2320.289,The caption here is “Frank against the United States.”
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2322.303,2347.603,"The contempt action was brought by the -- an attorney for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States attorney acting together and, as it was a criminal action, I suppose it would be under the caption “United States versus Frank,” but the original con -- the original injunction which is what would be relevant to 3691 was brought in the name of the Securities and Exchange Commission."
1968.200,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2388.157,2403.218,"Does that mean that, in every one of these cases that are similar on its facts to this that we must examine the record to see what the severity of the probation commissions are?"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2403.218,2404.705,"No, Your Honor, I don't think so."
1968.200,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2435.874,2452.226,"Well, I understood you to answer Justice Black to the effect that these particular conditions were not honorous and that it might be different if they had been."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2452.226,2455.413,"No, I think I was trying to make a slightly different point."
1968.200,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2455.413,2458.56,"I see, alright."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2458.56,2465.727,"Well, from this perspective, looking at the national scheme as a whole, we think the results are quiet striking."
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2524.759,2539.328,"Do I understand you, Mr. Strauss, to say in response to a question by Mr. Justice Black, that if the probation period here had been five years, it might -- you might regard it differently?"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2539.328,2539.445,"No, I'm still --"
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2539.445,2541.043,So i as I mistaken in that?
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2541.043,2545.793,I believe his question was whether I would regard it differently if the probation period was 10 years.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2545.793,2546.715,"Well, would you?"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2546.715,2547.823,Yes.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2547.823,2547.968,If there were --
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2547.968,2551.363,There's no statutory authorization that I'm aware of for such a term.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2551.363,2553.03,"No, but -- forget that."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2565.901,2566.638,Yes.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2566.638,2569.646,And as a different in --
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2569.646,2570.249,"Yes, I would."
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2570.249,2571.851,The purposes of our problem.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2573.239,2574.241,"No, I do not regard five years is --"
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2574.241,2575.957,How about eight years.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2575.957,2577.628,I would regard eight years is different.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2577.628,2578.64,Six?
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2578.64,2580.94,I regard six years as different.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2580.94,2582.516,"Well, then, I don't get you."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2582.516,2590.065,"The point is, as this Court admonished last term in the Bloom case, that we are to look to the nation's law and practices."
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2600.925,2601.912,But the question is --
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2601.912,2602.001,For education.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2602.001,2604.003,That doesn't answer the question.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2621.611,2621.826,Yes.
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2621.826,2622.638,Before us?
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2622.638,2623.277,"But, I think that question --"
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2623.277,2630.926,"And then now you, if I correctly understand you, you said you would assimilate five years to it."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2637.552,2639.847,"Well, I think the reason is important, Your Honor."
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2645.356,2656.469,"Well, I know, but those are not tests of what is and what's not a -- to be regarded as a petty offense for purposes of contempt."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2693.87,2694.672,Well --
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2694.672,2733.72,"And, I -- it seems to me, that comparison, that reference to the maximum permitted time for -- upon which a person may be placed on probation does not provide us with a guide for this purpose, which is, shall the six months -- shall the three year probation here be assimilated to the six months sentence, six months imprisonment, in called petty offense for purposes of Cheff against Schnackenberg."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2733.72,2756.431,"Well, it's true, Your Honor, that I have assumed that the constitutional questions which were decided last term in Bloom and Duncan were the questions which, principally, would be decided in connection with what I agree is, strictly speaking, a question of Cheff versus Schnackenberg which was not, as stated, a constitutional decision."
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2777.045,2801.594,"Well, your ad -- I know, but your adversary points out that this man, during the period of his probation, is required to report every Monday, he's required to notify the authorities when he changes jobs, he -- if he's -- I suppose, if he's arrested for whatever offense, then his whole probation is in danger."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2806.298,2807.239,"Yes, that's right."
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2807.239,2827.82,And the question is whether that is or is not to be regarded as in the same light as a petty offense as defined in Cheff against Schnakenberg and in the statute for purposes of a jury trial in a contempt case.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2827.82,2828.036,Well --
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2828.036,2846.933,"And the referee -- even if the states all permitted probation without limit, I don't think that would settle it, just as if it wouldn't settle it in my mind if the state said that “Two years is a maximum amount.”"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2846.933,2851.459,"Alright, there may be -- there are perhaps several ways in which I can answer that."
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2864.461,2865.16,For petty offenses.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2865.16,2867.085,"For petty offenses, necessarily."
1968.200,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2948.568,2950.9,"That's a theory about prison, too."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2968.993,2974.752,"If I may respond to that, Your Honor, I see my time is up."
1968.200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3012.715,3013.56,Mr. Strauss.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,3013.56,3015.396,Yes?
1968.200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.396,3034.591,"If you're going to count probation as equivalent to sentence or as a prison term, I suppose that if you suspended imposition of sentence, you could -- and was going to put a man on probation, you could only put him on probation for six months, if you were going to count probation as equivalent to prison terms?"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,3034.591,3036.713,"I suppose it would have to be less than that, Your Honor."
1968.200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.713,3047.287,"Well, it would have to be less than that, either that or, if at the end of five months he violated his probation and he came in for his sentence, he'd only be sentenced for a month."
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,3047.287,3049.108,You'd have a sort of declining --
1968.200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.108,3050.112,That's right and if you --
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,3050.112,3051.299,Enforcement demise.
1968.200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3051.299,3059.496,"If you actually sentenced him to six months, imposed the six months sentence, and then if you wanted to suspend execution --"
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,3059.496,3059.861,You couldn't do that.
1968.200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3059.861,3060.847,You said you couldn't do that.
1968.200,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,3060.847,3061.543,"No, you couldn't."
1968.200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.543,3065.334,"Yes, thank you."
1968.200,2,32245,john_b_ogden,,3065.334,3076.862,"Your Honor, if the Court please, I'll just say this and I'll be very brief because I said all I think that I care to say or should say in connection with this matter, but, now, here's a man."
