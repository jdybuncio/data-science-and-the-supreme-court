1986.85-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.706,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-1180, Edwin Meese, Attorney General of the United States, versus Barry Keene."
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,11.772,15.057,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.229,208.265,"Which sections are those, Mr. Ayer?"
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,208.265,221.905,"They're Section 611(j), which is the definition of 614(a), (b), and (c), which pertain to the dissemination report requirements and the labeling requirements."
1986.85-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,221.905,225.892,"Well, also the public inspection requirements, I gather."
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,225.892,226.376,That's correct.
1986.85-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,226.759,229.794,That although the statute says that
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,239.983,243.285,"I believe that's Section (c), Your Honor, and that is correct, yes."
1986.85-1180,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,392.983,407.66,"Mr. Ayer, in that regard I guess Senator Keene submitted uncontroverted affidavits that exhibiting the films would harm his re-election efforts."
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,417.016,433.291,"Well, when one looks at the declarations that were filed in this case, declarations in particular by Mr. Bistrin and Mr. Freed and Mr. Peterson, at least two of those, Bistrin and Peterson, deal with the re-election campaign problem."
1986.85-1180,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,451.67,461.711,"Well, he submitted affidavits showing third party resentment or consequences to him if he exhibited the films, isn't that right?"
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,461.711,464.58,"--Well, I think in a sense yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,542.33,545.299,"May I ask one other question on standing, Mr. Ayer."
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,554.57,556.253,"--No, he does not."
1986.85-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,567.128,570.846,So that all they're really complaining about is the reputational harm?
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,570.846,573.881,"That's correct, yes."
1986.85-1180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,573.881,602.798,I gather that there wouldn't have been this case if all that was required was that this label be put on and with respect to some material that was otherwise described?
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,602.798,604.317,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.204,645.91,What about... you don't think the label itself is what was annoying the plaintiff?
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,645.91,647.846,"Well, a couple of points on that."
1986.85-1180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,647.846,656.0,"If that identified him with some foreign source, wasn't that what he was complaining about?"
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,656.0,661.254,"Well, I think at one point in the case an effort was made to complain about that."
1986.85-1180,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,780.516,786.337,How would you distinguish the Lamont versus the Postmaster General case?
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,793.424,810.016,"Well, I think in Lamont that the main distinction that was drawn by the Court was the requirement of some affirmative action, which I take to mean something more than private affirmative action like snipping the label off of a film."
1986.85-1180,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,829.863,840.82,Would this be a different case if we were dealing with something that the Congress had labeled communist political propaganda on these films?
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,840.82,844.856,"It would be a different case, but I think the outcome would be the same."
1986.85-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.977,909.262,"Mr. Ayer, I think that goes to the merits rather than the standing question."
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,935.58,945.019,--I think it would require an analysis of the extent of the harm that might result.
1986.85-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,945.019,949.304,"He comes in and alleges, a lot of people say you're a bad man because you show obscene films."
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,957.541,959.493,And your question is whether that would--
1986.85-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,959.493,963.861,Whether he's have standing to object to that kind of a definition in a federal statute.
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,963.861,973.301,--I think if the word was defined in a way that was consistent with a conventional meaning such that Congress was not making it up--
1986.85-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.301,979.788,"In other words, it seems to me that whether the definition is a good one or not goes to... you say that determines the standing as well as the merits?"
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,979.788,990.528,"--Well, I think in standing what we're trying to look at is the nature of the injury, and we're trying to determine whether there is a cognizable injury, whether it rises to a sufficient level that it's recognizable."
1986.85-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.878,996.599,"You think in my obscenity example it would depend on how good, how accurate the definition was?"
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,996.599,997.951,--I think that would be a factor.
1986.85-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1005.288,1017.18,"Well, he alleges in his complaint that the definition is an inaccurate one, as I guess this... here he concedes that the definition of ""propaganda"" is a neutral definition, does he?"
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1024.382,1028.868,--I don't know whether the... I think the plaintiff may not concede that it's a neutral definition.
1986.85-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1029.752,1042.877,So in my hypothetical he's challenging the accuracy of the definition of obscenity and he also says that it harms his reputation because he wants to show some films that would fit within the definition.
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1044.994,1069.244,"I think I can't answer that without going to another question, which I think ultimately the Court doesn't have to resolve here, and that is the question of whether Government speech in pursuit of any goal that Government, Congress, whatever, has the power constitutionally to pursue, whether that speech may ever be attacked on First Amendment grounds."
1986.85-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1075.267,1077.883,"Well, but even if it can't, that again would be a merits answer, wouldn't it?"
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1096.93,1100.132,"--Well, I'm not saying that there would never be standing."
1986.85-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.132,1102.565,"Well, I'm only inquiring about the standing at this point."
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1102.565,1113.79,"I guess my answer... maybe it's not at all a complete one, but my answer is that you would have to look at the particular case, at the nature of the harm that is being alleged."
1986.85-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.865,1135.555,"Well, I could change the hypothetical to say it is a general regulation of obscene materials, and they have one chapter in the statute that does just like... that's a counterpart to this one on progapanda."
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1141.09,1157.301,"--Well, I think you would have to analyze the nature of the harm, and in that case I think, assuming a power in Congress or in the legislature you're talking about to regulate obscenity, I think the Government would have the power to do that."
1986.85-1180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.66,1248.109,"Well, suppose a pollster took a poll in the community and said: When you see a label, when you see the following label do you know what it means, and suppose half the people in the community said: Yes, we know that when we see that label that there's a foreign source, we know the Attorney General has classified it as political propaganda."
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1250.244,1262.952,I would think that a person might be able to put together affidavits that would give him standing to come in and make that kind of an argument.
1986.85-1180,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1272.075,1289.852,"Well, wasn't there a Gallup poll in this case and affidavits of even Republicans as well as Democratic campaign managers going to the effect on this particular respondent's campaign?"
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1289.852,1294.44,"Well, I think the answer to that is basically yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1180,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1312.302,1324.192,"Do you disagree with the standing analysis that Justice Scalia, when he was serving as Judge Scalia on the Court of Appeals, wrote in Block against Meese?"
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1324.192,1330.179,"No, Your Honor, we don't, and we think it supports the position that we are taking here that there is no standing."
1986.85-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1380.879,1385.033,"Mr. Ayer, do you plan to discuss the merits as well as standing?"
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1385.033,1385.9,"I would like to, Your Honor."
1986.85-1180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1549.889,1558.661,"Does it make any difference if there was no definition of ""political propaganda"" in the statute?"
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1562.03,1570.452,I think if there were no definition there would be a stronger argument that Congress intended to state a negative view by relying on the negative connotations.
1986.85-1180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.837,1586.43,"So the incremental effect would just be, would just result from people who knew it was labeled ""political propaganda"" but didn't know what the definition was?"
1986.85-1180,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1586.43,1592.984,"Well, it would result from the entire... the incremental effect would, that's correct, yes."
1986.85-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1596.353,1598.572,"Very well, Mr. Ayer."
1986.85-1180,1,29959,john_g_donhoff,,1600.005,1611.029,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1986.85-1180,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3384.006,3398.35,"Mr. Donhoff indicated that it would be a mistake to determine these issues piece by piece in this instance by singling out the words ""political propaganda"" and taking them in isolation."
1986.85-1180,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3479.67,3481.204,"Thank you, Mr. Ayer."
