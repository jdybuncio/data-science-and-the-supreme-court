1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1191.692,1199.639,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1957.395,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1321.039,1322.926,Before -- are you moving on from there?
1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1322.926,1323.838,Yes.
1957.395,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1323.838,1326.125,I would like to ask you this.
1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1360.522,1363.109,"On the merits, yes."
1957.395,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1380.996,1382.117,I'm sure I understood you.
1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1390.647,1392.5,Or perhaps I did --
1957.395,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1392.5,1392.743,You meant (Voice Overlap) --
1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1392.743,1395.612,Perhaps I misunderstand -- misunderstood Your Honor.
1957.395,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1398.841,1400.015,Have made the complaint --
1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1400.015,1402.811,-- if the complaint had raised the lien theory --
1957.395,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1402.811,1404.476,"Well, I didn't -- I want to be the -- as specific."
1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1404.476,1405.342,Yes.
1957.395,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1405.342,1416.818,"The complaint just embodied what is now the stipulation and the Government said wherefore we have a lien and want the execution of it, would that have been all right?"
1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1416.818,1417.823,Then I think --
1957.395,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1417.823,1418.746,"I mean, would that (Voice Overlap) --"
1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1418.746,1420.901,The lien would have been pleaded.
1957.395,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1422.634,1429.775,"Because of the wherefore, because of the antecedent fact justifying the wherefore?"
1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1430.076,1433.439,"Oh, I -- oh, I am sorry, I -- no."
1957.395,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1444.756,1460.819,Is that the way you escaped from or rather that's the basis on which you say that the document Mr. Davis invoked that a judgment -- a judgment can be supported by anything that supports it.
1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1460.819,1461.515,That is correct Your Honor.
1957.395,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1461.515,1465.389,"But he isn't supporting your judgment, is he?"
1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1465.389,1465.996,Yes.

1957.395,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1478.431,1478.886,All right.
1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1478.886,1480.386,That is correct.
1957.395,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1480.386,1480.628,What is -- what is the answer --
1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1480.628,1481.347,It might --
1957.395,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1481.347,1487.386,-- to his claim that he can sustain a judgment on any theory that legally can sustain it.
1957.395,1,36429,morris_j_oppenheim,,1487.386,1490.218,My answer to that is this.
1957.395,2,30073,john_f_davis,,2840.859,2842.935,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please."
1957.395,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2842.935,2844.301,"You're under no such difficulty, isn't it?"
1957.395,2,30073,john_f_davis,,2849.363,2858.548,"Mr. Justice Brennan asked the, how much of the liability in this case was covered by the lien."
