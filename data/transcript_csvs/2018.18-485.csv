2018.18-485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.52,5.82,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 18-485, McDonough versus Smith. Mr. Katyal."
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,5.82,17.695,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: McDonough's Section 1983 suit claimed that Smith brought and maintained criminal proceedings against him based on fabricated evidence."
2018.18-485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,35.38,43.515,"Mr. Katyal, is your claim allege a -- require the finding of probable cause?"
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,43.515,44.07,No.
2018.18-485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,44.215,45.38,Or the absence of it?
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,45.38,45.89,It doesn't.
2018.18-485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,73.95,74.52,So why do you --
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,74.52,75.35,-- that the indictment --
2018.18-485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,75.35,82.34,-- why do you need an acquittal? That at least is the government's position.
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,98.96,101.17,"It's not at all necessary, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.18-485,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,127.4,127.76,"Well, Mr. Katyal --"
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,127.76,128.56,And that's all you have to do.
2018.18-485,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,128.56,131.18,-- this case -- this case has my head spinning because --
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,131.18,131.44,Mine too.
2018.18-485,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,131.44,165.49,"-- you were asked to determine when a claim accrues, but I don't know what provision of the Constitution this is based on, and, therefore, I don't know what the elements of this claim are. And depending on the elements, that -- they may point to different accrual rules, and, certainly, they might point to different common law analogies. So can you clarify this? I mean, you say it's based on the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth -- the due process, I don't know whether it's procedural or substantive or both, it's based on the Sixth Amendment. So what's it based on?"
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,165.49,185.74,"So -- so, Justice Alito, we agree with the Solicitor General that in this case, you don't need to specify because the Fourth and Fifth Amendments -- Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause swim to exactly the same result. That is, you can have a common law analogy like malicious prosecution that covers both Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment purposes."
2018.18-485,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,185.97,189.31,Why -- why -- why do they -- I'm not sure they swim to the same result.
2018.18-485,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,189.31,193.615,I'm pretty sure they don't swim at all. (Laughter.)
2018.18-485,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,193.615,201.905,The -- the Fourth Amendment usually is satisfied if there's probable cause.
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,223.13,223.425,Right.
2018.18-485,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,223.91,225.77,-- you still can't tell me what it's based on?
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,225.77,226.56,"No, we -- we have --"
2018.18-485,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,226.56,227.95,Is this penumbras and emanations from all kinds of things?
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,227.95,232.94,"-- Justice Alito, we have identified the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments time and time again."
2018.18-485,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,263.71,263.86,May I --
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,263.86,266.515,And that's why they never made these arguments below.
2018.18-485,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,272.15,272.58,May I -- may I try --
2018.18-485,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,272.58,288.99500005,"If we're not talking about hypothetical cases, is the argument that you're presenting -- is it in the end academic because the defendant is the prosecutor and the prosecutor would be immune?"
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,288.99500005,296.5,"Absolutely not, for reasons, again, the Solicitor General said absolute immunity's not before this Court and it hasn't been passed on below."
2018.18-485,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,348.16,383.04,"But -- but, if I could, it's a similar question to what exactly you're claiming, because you had a malicious prosecution claim in the original complaint and that was the one that the courts below dismissed on these prosecutorial immunity grounds. So how is this claim different from that claim? And I guess I had thought that one way it would be different was that this claim is just about the use of fabricated evidence. Is that what you're claiming? And, if not that, how is it different from the original malicious prosecution claim?"
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,383.04,387.38,"It's -- it's -- as I said at the outset, it's the use and maintenance of the criminal prosecution."
2018.18-485,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,394.65,403.3,But is -- is that to say that the difference between your two claims was one was about the initiation of proceedings and the other was about the continuation of the proceedings?
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,403.3,404.07,"No, they're -- they're different."
2018.18-485,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,460.615,466.185,"When you allege the fabrication of evidence, you're saying you're not necessarily alleging malice?"
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,466.185,475.87,"It's -- it's not necessarily an element of the complaint -- of -- of a -- of a fabrication of evidence claim. That's how every lower court, to my knowledge, has interpreted it."
2018.18-485,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,485.62,493.005,So you think that the -- the reckless presentation of evidence that turns out to be false constitutes the fabrication of evidence? That would support your claim?
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,493.005,494.27,"It certainly could, Your Honor."
2018.18-485,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,514.92,515.21,"Well, how do we --"
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,515.21,516.05,-- and duplicative proceedings.
2018.18-485,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,516.05,536.065,-- how do we adopt a favorable termination requirement for purposes of a limitations analysis only? It would seem to me it's either part of the claim or it's not part of the claim. And I would have thought that plaintiffs in -- in your client's position normally would say it's not part of the claim because that's a higher burden.
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,547.735,548.08,Right.
2018.18-485,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,548.08,571.755,"And it -- it -- I just wonder whether we're kind of coming at this one backwards, and before deciding how long the limitations period is, we ought maybe to take a case where we decide whether it exists and what its elements are, without the complication of addressing the limitations period, where litigation interests may be slightly different than they would be in the ordinary case."
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,571.755,581.02,"So, Justice Gorsuch, this Court has said several times that the -- there is sometimes daylight between the limitations period and when a cause accrues."
2018.18-485,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,582.92,584.67,"Pretty unusual -- pretty unusual, though, right?"
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,584.67,585.48,It -- it is unusual.
2018.18-485,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,590.45,596.08,"We usually say, though, the limitation period starts to run when all of the elements are present."
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,599.615,601.0,Not where I went to law school.
2018.18-485,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,601.5,602.2,"Well, that may be true."
2018.18-485,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,603.26,612.31,"And -- and -- and -- and I -- I -- I -- you know, maybe not where I went to law school either, but -- but one should learn that in the first year of law school."
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,613.3,667.92,"We -- we -- well, we do agree that is the standard rule, but for claims like this, actually, it makes a lot of sense. Think about Wallace because, in Wallace, the Court said there is daylight and the reason for that is it cited Section 187 of the Wood treatise, and that very sentence it cited said, yes, there's daylight not just for the false imprisonment claim that was at issue in Wallace but also for malicious prosecution. It's the same sentence, and it makes particular sense here because the reason for malicious prosecution's favorable termination requirement is not really that it's an element of the offense but, rather, that it voids all of the policy concerns that -- that -- that we talk about in our briefs. So, if you look at Keyton's treatise at page -- this is cited in our reply brief at page 8, it says the following: ""The requirement of termination is probably a matter of ripeness, a belief that malicious prosecution actions should not be tried at a time when they try to chill testimony."
2018.18-485,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,702.26,707.275,What about just staying the civil proceeding until the criminal prosecution is over?
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,707.275,749.29,"So it's possible, I think, sometimes to stay, but, as the government points out, stays are discretionary at the district court and there have been example after example in which criminal and -- in which the civil litigation has not been stayed. And I think it's important to note that the only policy argument they've been able to come up with, Justice Ginsburg, for that stay idea is the idea of faded memories or something like that. But, here, you've got the Government of the United States representing most prosecutors, the lion's share of prosecutors saying no, we're not as concerned about that, and those problems of faded memories occur just as much under their rule because they adopt a discovery -- they adopt a discovery rule."
2018.18-485,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,778.82,784.705,What torts would you bring -- tort suits would you bring under state law under -- on these facts?
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,784.705,789.38,"Under state law, we'd bring something like the tort of malicious prosecution."
2018.18-485,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,789.38,791.72,There is no separate tort?
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,791.72,795.31,I -- I don't know that there's a fabrication of evidence tort.
2018.18-485,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,829.78,839.84,"But before you -- you go to that, Mr. Katyal, and maybe I'm just being dense here, but I'm still trying to figure out, you said it's a -- for a state tort, it would be malicious prosecution."
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,860.355,870.66,"Well, because I think, for 1983 purposes, when this Court does the analysis that you prescribed in Manuel, going back to Carey versus Piphus, you use that as the starting point."
2018.18-485,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,882.83,883.03,Right.
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,895.24,903.31,"Well, there -- there are two different claims here, the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, as I was saying to Justice Alito. Here, I don't think it matters, but I could imagine --"
2018.18-485,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,903.31,903.38,No.
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,908.06,908.52,Yeah.
2018.18-485,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,908.52,911.12,How is this different from the one that was dismissed?
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,911.12,923.33,"It's different because, as I -- as I said earlier, the elements for a fabrication claim, at least for 1983 purposes, are different, because they involve -- they don't involve malice and things like that."
2018.18-485,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,924.55,928.755,"What are the things like that? Because the malice, I don't know. I mean, really?"
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,928.755,941.05,So -- so malicious prosecution requires four things: the initiation or continuation of a criminal proceeding against a plaintiff; termination in the plaintiff's favor; lack of probable cause; and actual malice.
2018.18-485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,948.04,948.53,Thank you.
2018.18-485,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,948.53,953.535,Fabricating evidence -- deliberately fabricating evidence isn't malice?
2018.18-485,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,953.535,959.52,"It -- it -- it often is. It's just -- our only point is it's not always. That's all, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.18-485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,959.52,970.355,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall."
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,970.355,977.23,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The parties' presentations may make this case seem more difficult than it is."
2018.18-485,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1018.45,1022.36,"So it's always an element now? Before, it was sometimes an element."
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1023.88,1031.32,"Oh, Petitioners on -- on -- I understand Petitioner's first theory to be that it's sometimes an element or you can borrow --"
2018.18-485,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1031.32,1032.17,It swims in and out?
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1032.17,1034.46,"To be clear, that has never been the United States' theory."
2018.18-485,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1037.115,1051.675,"Why wouldn't we be better off, before trying to figure out what the limitations period is, actually take a case and figure out whether this tort exists and what its elements actually are? Because even you and the Petitioner cannot agree on the elements of this claim."
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1051.675,1054.01,"Well, I guess, Justice Gorsuch --"
2018.18-485,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1054.01,1055.77,And we don't know where it swims from.
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1055.77,1057.66,I don't want to speak for Petitioner.
2018.18-485,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1088.75,1092.98,"Well, but -- but that's a great argument for a case in which the -- the matter's actually before us."
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1095.23,1095.4,"Well, if --"
2018.18-485,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1095.4,1096.41,-- that it's just a procedural process claim.
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1096.41,1098.04,"Justice Gorsuch, if there were a circuit split on that --"
2018.18-485,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1098.04,1098.54,So shouldn't we maybe --
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1098.54,1112.84,"-- or some reasonable disagreement, but the Court has held that there is a procedural due process claim with respect to fabricating evidence to obtain a conviction. The only question then is, well, what if they deprive your liberty in other ways short of a conviction? The courts of appeals have said that's also a Fourteenth Amendment claim."
2018.18-485,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1120.94,1121.52,"Well, now you've confused --"
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1121.52,1122.18,-- I'm happy to talk about it.
2018.18-485,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1133.08,1138.8,"Except you think that the element also includes favorable termination, and your compatriot doesn't."
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1152.125,1154.515,"So, Justice Gorsuch, two things."
2018.18-485,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1173.59,1176.9,"If you're attacking collaterally the conviction, but maybe sometimes you're not."
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1176.9,1200.205,"Well, but I think all of the reasons there why you're attacking the state judicial process are why the common law tort, the analogous tort of malicious prosecution, adopted this favorable termination requirement, out of respect for the ongoing state criminal proceeding and out of a belief that that was the proper role for habeas, not for damages claims. So I agree with you, favorable termination is not an element of the constitutional claim."
2018.18-485,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1205.82,1206.0,What -- what --
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1206.0,1209.09,"-- no matter how the trial ends, but it is an element of the damages claim under 1983."
2018.18-485,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1209.09,1221.68,"Can I -- can I pick up on Justice Kagan's question from earlier? How is a fabricated evidence claim different from a malicious prosecution claim? It would seem every fabricated evidence claim is a malicious prosecution claim, not the reverse."
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1221.68,1230.93,"Oh, I think there is overlap in the sense that you'll often have a constitutional claim and you'll have a common law claim, but the -- the elements are different. So, as the Court's been exploring, at common law --"
2018.18-485,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1230.93,1237.155,You don't -- you think there's a fabricated evidence claim that would not fall within the usual elements of malicious prosecution?
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1237.155,1240.08,"Well, in malicious prosecution, you had to show a lack of probable cause."
2018.18-485,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1263.19,1266.815,But don't you have to show causation if it's a procedural due process claim?
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1266.815,1268.59,"You have to show materiality, Justice Alito."
2018.18-485,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1272.17,1274.775,And what's the difference between that and probable cause?
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1274.775,1287.815,I think that what Kyles suggests is it's not just a question of whether there was probable cause that a juror could have found a grand juror to hold you over for trial or a petit juror to -- to convict you on the basis of the evidence.
2018.18-485,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1310.695,1322.9,"Do you think that there's a possible claim which is just there was a introduction of fabricated evidence that was so awful, it's itself a violation of the Constitution, kind of shocks the conscience?"
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1322.9,1325.18,"We -- we don't think for two reasons, Justice Kagan."
2018.18-485,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1343.32,1348.01,"If there were such a claim, that would not have as an element favorable termination, correct?"
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1348.01,1357.79,"No, I -- I think we would -- even if you said, look, this sounds in substantive due process rather than procedural due process, I think we'd still say, look, that's about something the prosecutor did to you."
2018.18-485,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1384.6,1390.53,And what is the deprivation of liberty for a person who is not in detention and is going to -- and has been acquitted?
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1390.53,1398.855,"I think, here, the -- the obvious one that the Respondent conceded below, so I don't think it's before the Court, is the travel restrictions, the surrendering of the passport and all the rest."
2018.18-485,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1428.91,1429.31,Mr. Wall --
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1429.31,1432.14,"-- assuming it's procedural due process, how does the limitations period run?"
2018.18-485,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1432.14,1476.26,"-- I -- I worry about importing the favorable termination rule for malicious prosecution because it has a lot of history behind it, including what counts as a favorable termination. If there is proof that evidence has been fabricated, that it was material in the sense that it made a difference in the proceedings, why should I, as we do in malicious prosecution that has a totally different set of policy principles underlying it, why should we import all that history into this false fabrication claim or tort?"
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1476.26,1477.9,"So two things, Justice --"
2018.18-485,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1477.9,1484.095,I -- I understand importing the statute of limitations on a Heck-Preiser principle.
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1491.145,1505.815,"So I think that's my problem, Justice Sotomayor, is because when you're looking to the common law -- and Heck is clear about this, if you look at pages 484 and 489-90 of Justice Scalia's opinion -- you're not just kind of borrowing in some loose sense what the common law did."
2018.18-485,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1560.46,1560.76,It's not quite --
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1560.76,1562.05,-- and we know from Heck the way to do that.
2018.18-485,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1562.05,1571.565,"-- because you just said to me that the use of fabricated evidence, whether someone's convicted or not, is, standing alone, wrong."
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1571.565,1574.88,"Oh, it is wrongful for a prosecutor to do it."
2018.18-485,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1590.09,1592.2,"But why does that matter, is what I'm saying to you."
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1615.06,1615.3,Oh --
2018.18-485,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1615.3,1616.645,"Very briefly, Mr. Wall."
2018.18-485,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1616.645,1626.245,"For all the same reasons they have to show it when they are attacking any other part of the state judicial process, which is to say the policy reasons that Justice Scalia gave in Heck and that we set forward in our brief."
2018.18-485,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1626.245,1639.3,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. O'Connor."

2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1673.765,1675.19,It's what common law --
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,1675.19,1675.51,We have --
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1675.51,1680.07,-- what common law crime was most analogous.
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,1692.52,1694.37,There is none.
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1694.37,1704.13,There is no claim at common law when a prosecutor deliberately falsifies evidence in order to convict an innocent person?
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,1704.13,1720.61,"I think -- I'm not sure there is one, and I think that this type of conduct is so stunning and so in contradiction of our basic fundamental policies that it stands alone --"
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1720.61,1721.49,Then --
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,1721.49,1724.625,-- as a constitutional violation.
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1724.625,1726.065,Then --
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,1726.065,1755.35,"Now there are, of course, those criminal cases where, after a conviction, as a result of perjured testimony, that, of course, is a preeminent due process violation. However, in those cases, and I hark back to Justice Alito's exchange, the word ""materiality"" used in those cases is not used in the evidentiary sense."
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1763.08,1793.345,"Well, you say that, if there's a -- if there's a due process claim, it's substantive, and I find that very hard to fathom, because isn't it -- fundamental fairness -- a fundamentally fair trial is what you're entitled to as a matter of procedural due process, and how can your trial be fundamentally fair if the prosecutor has just made up evidence to convict you?"
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,1793.345,1796.605,"Well, I understand your point."
2018.18-485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1863.81499995,1883.47,"I -- I'm not sure I understand your point, that you -- maybe this is repetitious, but you think there is no cause of action in a situation like this?

2018.18-485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1902.02,1910.195,"Do you think there is one? If you were representing the other side, what -- what would you say is the -- is the claim? Is there -- is there a claim in a case of this sort?"
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,1910.195,1916.09,There may be a claim under what I perceive to be the substantive due process clause.
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1916.09,1919.175,"Then, well, let's go back to my question."
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,1937.69,1939.06,"Well, of course, you're right."
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1961.34,1966.71,But it was -- that's what made it a corrupt process.
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,1966.71,1968.235,Okay.
2018.18-485,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1972.77,1975.64,So what remains of your argument if that's true?
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,1975.64,1976.765,"Pardon me, Judge?"
2018.18-485,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1976.765,1987.615,"If it's a procedural due process violation, what remains of your argument? If you accept Justice Ginsburg's view --"

2018.18-485,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2000.52500005,2001.57,All right.
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2009.865,2010.87,In the --
2018.18-485,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2010.87,2014.78499995,So it's a procedural due process violation.
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2037.64,2043.21,"Well, first -- first of all, my view is that it is not a procedural due process violation."
2018.18-485,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2043.21,2044.235,I -- I accepted that.
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2052.32,2061.01,"In that -- in that scenario, each use would be a -- a violation of the due process clause."
2018.18-485,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2074.88,2112.1,"Mr. O'Connor, is what you're saying -- and -- and tell me if I'm wrong about what you're saying, because I might very well be wrong about what you're saying, but I'll just hazard this theory of it, which is, when the claim has as one of its components that there's a deprivation of liberty, then it makes some sense to have a favorable termination date as part -- as an element of that claim. But you're suggesting -- as I hear you, you're suggesting that there's a claim that doesn't have anything to do with a deprivation of liberty."
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2132.34,2132.63,That's right.
2018.18-485,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2132.63,2134.01,The claim is only about the use.
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2137.78,2138.41,That's correct.
2018.18-485,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2143.425,2149.17,So -- but the -- what -- the problem is that the Petitioner says it's not making that claim.
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2149.17,2153.11,It's hard to say what claim the Petitioner is making.
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2188.96,2212.8,Go back to our original -- our original colloquy is not whether this is a malicious prosecution claim. This is a fabrication of evidence in order to convict. What is the closest analogy at common law? And you -- you said there is none in answer to my prior question.
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2220.525,2224.5,I'm not sure there is a closest analogy.
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2226.35,2229.1,Does that mean there is no such claim?
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2229.1,2230.615,"Pardon me, Judge?"
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2230.615,2234.63,Then -- then there's no -- no -- there's no claim at --
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2234.63,2252.57,"There doesn't have to be a common law analogue for there to be a constitutional claim, particularly in this instance, where the claim is committing perjury either during the grand jury presentation or during trial."
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2252.57,2260.23,But don't we have to analogize it to something in order to determine what limitation period will apply?
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2260.23,2281.76,"I don't think that's necessary, no, because if -- if it is a self-standing claim that is indifferent to probable cause or favorable termination or any termination, then the presumption is that the standard accrual rule would apply. But, as I --"
2018.18-485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2281.76,2317.785,"It's a presumption, but in this case, if you let people to bring lawsuits while a criminal trial is going on at the same time, they're bringing a civil lawsuit against some of the people who are heavily involved in the case, and you're -- you're going to mix up many cases, and people will watch what they say or -- who knows. But there's a pure policy reason for saying, however you characterize this suit, wait until the case is over until you bring it. And, therefore, the statute of -- you can't bring it while the case is still going on."

2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2325.395,2333.395,-- the Second Circuit acknowledges this type of a claim --
2018.18-485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2333.395,2333.98,Uh-huh.
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2333.98,2350.46,"-- in limited circumstances, for example, where, although there is sufficient evidence to satisfy probable cause, the 1983 plaintiff alleges that there is unrelated independent evidence that is fabricated."
2018.18-485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2350.46,2353.815,And I'm not asking something complicated.
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2394.49,2395.88,In both Heck --
2018.18-485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2395.88,2402.585,Whatever you want to call it in terms of characterizing the action. I'm not interested in that for the moment.
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2408.875,2424.105,"In -- in Heck and Wallace, this Court envisioned the criminal case and the civil case being pursued at the same time."
2018.18-485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2445.985,2483.32,"Well, but, I mean, it's still problematic even with a stay. You have a -- a complaint. I mean, I think it's -- it is a serious concern while the criminal prosecution is going on to say, well, let's file a lawsuit against, you know, the -- the assistant district attorney, and, you know, that might -- see if that makes him a little less inclined, you know, to -- to enter into a plea agreement or -- or other situations. It does complicate all that's going on in what, for a criminal defendant falsely accused, as it turns out, is also -- is already in a pretty dire place."
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2489.73500005,2501.15,"Well, in -- in the Second Circuit, the prudential stay has been in use for decades with no -- no untoward results. And --"
2018.18-485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2501.15,2507.585,"Well, how do you know that? I mean -- I mean -- by a prudential stay, you mean -- presumably, you have to file a complaint before you can get a stay, right?"
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2507.585,2508.125,Yes.
2018.18-485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2508.125,2511.39,"Well, then that seems to present most of the problems that are -- are at issue."
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2521.865,2540.57,"Well, I think there are -- requiring the case -- requiring -- using the traditional accrual rule provides a prompt appraisal of what possible misconduct may be going on."
2018.18-485,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2584.97,2601.785,"I'm sorry, if this behavior, if it's true -- I'm not assuming anything -- if a prosecutor fabricates evidence -- and you said it's stunning and shocks the conscience, that's how you described it --"
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2601.785,2602.68,Yes.
2018.18-485,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2602.68,2638.615,"-- why would we care about how long it would take to seek redress from that prosecutor? Something that shocks the conscience appears to me to be so egregious that we should ensure, even with delayed time, that the victim of that conduct would not be deprived of a day in court because of a hastily imposed statute of limitations."
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2638.615,2648.63,"Well, first of all, that would be just an allegation, which is why a prompt investigation would be needed."
2018.18-485,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2654.62,2686.995,"Well, it seems to me that most prosecutors in a contested trial know that the defendant is still claiming his or her innocence and, by implication, is still claiming that the evidence at the trial -- that there's something wrong with it. So it's not as if speed is in the essence in notifying the prosecutor that there's a potential claim there."
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2686.995,2729.04500005,"Well, let me -- in this case, after the -- after the defendant was acquitted in this case, he had two years and three months to file this action in a timely manner, embracing both of the claims. So the idea that because you're using the traditional accrual rule, that you're -- you're putting the defendant's back against the wall as a practical matter is not true."
2018.18-485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2729.04500005,2734.89,"Well, it may not be true in this case, but it depends in other cases when the accrual would occur."
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2744.445,2745.12,Granted.
2018.18-485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2787.035,2788.59,"Well, we're trying to figure that out."
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2801.72,2804.12,"Well, I -- I understand."
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2804.12,2808.83,"You do say something in your brief, I think, that was puzzling."
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2836.535,2862.51,"Yes, but, again, I -- I think that falls for the most part within his Fourth -- Fourth Amendment claim, which was dismissed. So, to continue with my argument --"
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2862.51,2872.42,"So -- but -- but now -- now you're saying he -- he was deprived of liberty, but not for due process purposes, only for Fourth Amendment purposes?"
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2872.42,2874.16,"I'm sorry, Judge."
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2874.95,2878.015,You said -- you said he was deprived of liberty.
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2888.21,2896.665,I'm not sure that just being compelled to undergo a trial constitutes a deprivation of liberty.
2018.18-485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2896.665,2913.36,What about all the time that he lost? Let's say he's a contractor and he -- he can't take a long-term contract because he might be in prison while the contract would still be running its course.
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,2913.36,2914.06,Sure.
2018.18-485,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2943.21,2950.675,I thought that that division of labor was about things that happened prior to a judicial process starting and things that happened afterward.

2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,3033.68,3033.81,Now --
2018.18-485,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3033.81,3043.19,-- your rule could encourage -- correct me if I'm wrong -- could encourage the filing of 1983 suits while the criminal process is ongoing?
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,3043.19,3045.74,"I didn't hear the beginning of your question, Judge."

2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,3059.54,3060.35,That is correct.
2018.18-485,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3062.35,3077.795,"And that's not a problem, you don't think, to -- in the orderly division of how this should proceed, to have the criminal process come to a conclusion and then, if there's going to be a tort suit, to have that follow on? Why isn't that not a more orderly --"
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,3077.795,3080.595,"It may be more orderly, but it's incorrect."
2018.18-485,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3092.24,3114.535,"Well, just if the -- if the law is murky, and we're -- we can choose one path or another reasonably as a matter of law, wouldn't we choose the more orderly, practical approach, which would suggest, I think, let's not encourage the filing routinely of 1983 suits in the midst of the criminal process?"
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,3114.535,3118.92,"It's kind of a loaded question, Judge, I think."
2018.18-485,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3133.13,3140.705,"Well, on the rigor, you -- you say that a stay is routinely granted in the Second Circuit, I believe you said."
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,3140.705,3143.81,It is used in -- in the appropriate cases.
2018.18-485,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3143.81,3154.01,And doesn't the stay reflect the concept or the idea that it would not be orderly to have these two things going on simultaneously?
2018.18-485,2,63120,thomas_j_o_connor,,3154.01,3161.315,I think it's more based upon a review of the claims in the specific case.
2018.18-485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3284.175,3287.60499995,"Four minutes, Mr. Katyal."
2018.18-485,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3287.60499995,3290.88,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I -- I just have one point."
2018.18-485,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3390.24,3392.89,Is what you're arguing for really a form of equitable tolling?
2018.18-485,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3392.89,3407.84,"Well, I think equitable tolling is different for reasons -- it's a different strand, as this Court recognized in that 1985 case, Wilson versus Garcia, but I guess we wouldn't have an objection if the Court wanted to fashion an equitable tolling rule. We don't think you have to here."
2018.18-485,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3426.61,3430.93,"Just -- just to clarify for my own thinking, what are the elements of your claim?"
2018.18-485,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3430.93,3451.51,"The elements of the claim are the -- are -- are -- are the four that I read to you earlier, so it's initiation or continuation of a criminal proceeding; termination of the proceeding; lack of probable cause -- oh, excuse me, it's -- sorry, that's the malicious prosecution. For -- for fabrication of evidence, it's fabrication of evidence caused a deprivation of liberty."
2018.18-485,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3462.71,3469.315,"So, in -- in every case in which someone is prosecuted, will there not be the deprivation of liberty under your understanding?"
2018.18-485,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3469.315,3473.76,"Well -- well, there -- there -- there could be some deprivations of liberty but often not."
2018.18-485,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3478.48,3489.46,"So, if they're just -- if they're just released on their own recognizance, then there would be no deprivation of liberty, but if there are any other restrictions, every other case where there are any restrictions imposed, there would be the deprivation of liberty?"
2018.18-485,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3489.46,3490.81,"Well, I -- I -- I think there might or might not."
2018.18-485,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3495.98,3497.13,"No, I'm just trying to understand --"
2018.18-485,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3497.13,3497.22,Yeah.
2018.18-485,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3497.22,3500.68,"-- the elements. So, really, the only important element is the fabrication of evidence."
2018.18-485,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3500.68,3503.84,"And causation, which turns out to be crucial in a lot of these cases."
2018.18-485,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3503.84,3504.785,Causation of what?
2018.18-485,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3504.785,3509.485,So -- cause -- you have to show that the fabrication itself caused a deprivation of liberty.
2018.18-485,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3520.315,3521.285,"Thank you, counsel."
