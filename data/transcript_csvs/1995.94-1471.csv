1995.94-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.356,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-1471, Varity Corporation v Charles Howe."
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,16.51,20.128,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,84.468,93.724,"Well, Mr. Abrams, in your view, if you prevail here, would the respondents have some sort of remedy for these rather obviously fraudulent statements?"
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,93.724,99.561,"If we were to prevail in this court, respondents would have the following potential remedies."
1995.94-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,117.589,120.324,And your position is that those claims are preempted?
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,120.324,123.093,"Actually, we have not argued that those claims are preempted."
1995.94-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,151.095,168.89,"Did those go to the group to whom no misrepresentations were made but who were under a plan... unknown to them, they are placed under some other plan in another entity that proves insolvent?"
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,193.922,201.361,"There's no provision in ERISA, and there is no provision in any contract in this case, providing for notice."
1995.94-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,205.147,205.88,But this wasn't a terminate.
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,205.88,211.384,It was... what happened here in fact was a termination and--
1995.94-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,211.384,213.353,Let me ask you this--
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,213.353,213.653,--Yes.
1995.94-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,213.653,217.705,"--so we can be very clear that we're talking about the same, not entirely hypothetical case."
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,260.5,263.852,That is absolutely what you cannot do under a pension plan.
1995.94-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,272.708,276.66,"But when you terminate, don't you have to give people notice so that they can find other insurance?"
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,276.66,279.945,--This is not a case involving an alleged failure of disclosure.
1995.94-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,282.397,285.031,I'm not asking you about disclosure.
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,286.048,286.598,If they're--
1995.94-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,286.598,297.489,"--we're in the termination mode, if you terminate a plan, don't you have to give the beneficiaries notice that they're being terminated so that they can get alternate protection for themselves?"
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,297.489,304.56,"--If they're entitled to benefits, it is our position the place to go is the benefits section of ERISA."
1995.94-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,307.179,335.781,"Are you... I just... if you tell me that that's what your position is and that's what the law is, that there is nothing in the whole of ERISA that stops an employer from putting people under an umbrella that is going to be swiftly bankrupt without telling them, that there's nothing in ERISA that stops that, and moreover, because ERISA is preemptive, these people have nothing to complain about--"
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,335.781,337.9,"Well, what I'm--"
1995.94-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,337.9,342.685,--Is there nothing in ERISA... what happened here with respect to the ones--
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,342.685,343.485,--Yes.
1995.94-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,343.485,347.756,"--who were already retired, where they got no notice of this transfer--"
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,347.756,353.326,"Retirement, as I understand it, is not a vesting point under ERISA."
1995.94-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,379.393,388.499,--So you're saying that the Employees Security... Income Security Act allows an employer to do this.
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,392.418,396.689,"--The misrepresentations, indeed, are beside the point with respect to these people."
1995.94-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,402.424,423.672,"So that Congress, when it set up the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, gave employees no security against what happened here, against waking up one morning and find that they have no coverage because they are now under some umbrella that they never heard of."
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,423.672,429.326,--No more protection than waking up some morning and finding they have no coverage at all.
1995.94-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,436.147,437.48,"All right, I think I have your answer."
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,437.48,437.814,--Sorry.
1995.94-1471,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,437.814,443.384,"They don't have to get any notice so that they can get... that ERISA simply allows this to happen, and that's--"
1995.94-1471,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,443.384,446.086,"That is my position, and that ERISA--"
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,1624.435,1627.554,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1663.81,1685.074,"I think his point was simply when you're dealing with a statute that permits termination, it's very hard to think that somehow employees have been deprived of statutorily required security by not being given notice of the transfer to a new company."
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,1696.548,1704.637,"--The statute did, Justice, and they could have been, and they chose not to do that to further their own interests."
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1725.384,1735.739,It's justification for saying that you cannot reasonably argue that they have been deprived of some security interest which the statute guarantees to them.
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,1735.739,1742.262,"That's correct, if I understand it, and that moves us to what our (a)(1)(B) claim was."
1995.94-1471,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1786.208,1791.426,"But you don't argue that you were guaranteed any benefits under that plan, do you?"
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,1801.468,1802.768,"--Exactly, Justice."
1995.94-1471,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1864.758,1894.361,"Mr. Smith, what is your response to the argument that as to the 10 plaintiffs who never worked for MCC, that no misrepresentations were made to those individuals in connection with the transfer of their coverage to MCC, so there's no basis for affirming the decision below, your opponent argues, with respect to that belief, because they weren't told anything."
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,1894.361,1894.894,I--
1995.94-1471,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1894.894,1896.328,No misrepresentations were made to them.
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,1896.328,1898.146,"--Justice, I agree with the first part."
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.024,2008.617,"Yes, but I mean, indeed, except, of course, any breaches of fiduciary duty that result in loss of benefits to the individual, which he can recover for under (a), (a)(1)(B)."
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2015.121,2037.653,"Well, it would... assuming it constitutes a breach of contract that you could under contract principles recover (a)(1)(B), but Justice, there's many other things... in fact, one of the most fundamental things about administration is determining who is a participant that has a right to make claims under (a)(1)(B), and you have these--"
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.653,2060.168,"Mr. Abrams' argument is not to deny that there are not individual rights that one would ordinarily have against a trustee, which are eliminated here, but rather to say their elimination is part of the scheme of the statute, just as the ability of the employer to simply terminate unilaterally, which is extraordinary, is part of the statute."
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2073.643,2106.982,"--Justice, it's just not common sense that if Congress intended the exclusive remedy for private harm to participants and beneficiaries to be under (a)(1)(B) on contract principles, why would they make administration a fiduciary activity, why would they make it fiduciary conduct, why would they incorporate in section 404 duties out of the common law that run directly to beneficiaries, and having done all that, why would they--"
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.982,2109.768,Where does it say that run directly to beneficiaries?
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2121.659,2122.509,--For... where we--
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2122.509,2123.876,--because that's the title of 409.
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2123.876,2124.528,--That's correct.
1995.94-1471,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2177.627,2188.249,"May I ask this: do you contend that the breach of fiduciary obligations that you have proved in this case, or alleged, were violations of duties defined in 404?"
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2188.249,2188.899,Correct.
1995.94-1471,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2188.899,2193.851,So you do say that 404 is the source of the fiduciary duty.
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2193.851,2194.484,Correct.
1995.94-1471,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2194.484,2195.636,All right.
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2216.882,2222.12,"Yes, and I'm pausing... I know Mertens was a nonfiduciary."
1995.94-1471,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.374,2232.309,But they were suing for damages there.
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2232.309,2236.296,I don't think they could have recovered damages under 502(a)(3).
1995.94-1471,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2236.296,2240.498,So one of the keys to your case is that you contend here you're getting equitable relief.
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2240.498,2240.815,Correct.
1995.94-1471,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2240.815,2242.867,And that's what distinguishes Russell.
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2242.867,2249.288,"That's right, and we can only obtain equitable relief under 502(a)(3)."
1995.94-1471,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2250.721,2261.327,And we have no issue before us here as the case comes to us about whether what you did recover fits that description.
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2261.327,2261.843,--Correct.
1995.94-1471,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2267.164,2268.747,It looks a lot like damages.
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2268.747,2279.805,--Justice Hanson at the circuit level in the dissent had some thoughts along that line and wanted it sent back to have a better record developed on that.
1995.94-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.145,2351.234,But there is some... certainly some language in Russell that suggests the plaintiffs wouldn't have fared any better under 502(a)(3).
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2351.234,2387.907,"Well, that's correct, and the concurring opinion points that out, that it's broader than it needs be, but I think that can be explained by the argument that was being presented to get a private cause of action under 409, where they were focusing on... they recognized it said, losses to the plan, so they focused on the catch-all at the end that said, other equitable or remedial relief, and they said that means that Congress wanted to have private cause of actions there, and I believe it was in that context that the Court used that broader language as it did."
1995.94-1471,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2387.907,2391.192,"In any event, we do have a footnote 5--"
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2391.192,2392.042,Correct.
1995.94-1471,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2392.042,2395.846,--that says that exclusively that we're not passing on that question.
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2395.846,2397.729,That's right.
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2454.149,2459.919,"I don't see... I mean, what they're contesting is whether it is part of the administration of the plan."
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2471.977,2472.277,--We--
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.277,2475.729,"--The point is, was this part of the administering of the plan."
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2475.729,2485.085,"--You're exactly right, and we don't base it being fiduciary conduct and that they were acting as a fiduciary because they lied, although I think that could be a legitimate basis."
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.085,2485.518,Why?
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2488.287,2488.837,Well--
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2488.837,2494.023,How can the fact that you're lying cause it to be administration when if you were telling the truth it wouldn't be administration?
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2494.023,2498.642,"--Justice, that two hats doctrine, they always have both hats in their hand."
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.591,2522.46,"Well, I worry that it's your case."
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2554.312,2559.899,"--For purpose of affirming, I do... we do not urge the rule that it be based on lying."
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2584.081,2585.283,What were those findings based on?
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2588.152,2590.604,You have the words that they said--
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2590.604,2591.504,And what were those words--
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2591.504,2592.437,--They said--
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.437,2593.12,--that you're relying on?
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2593.12,2596.841,--your benefits will continue unchanged.
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.841,2597.408,That's true.
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2599.71,2601.693,"Well, it certainly is."
1995.94-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2603.078,2603.994,The plan benefits were changed?
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2605.211,2612.767,"No, we didn't... if I said plan benefits, I misspoke, because we agreed we're not attacking the plans."
1995.94-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2630.478,2640.517,"--I'm sorry, I don't mean to... I thought that there is a piece of paper, questions and answers, what happens to my plan benefits, pension, et cetera?"
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2661.165,2662.367,"Exactly, Justice--"
1995.94-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2662.367,2662.983,"I mean, I--"
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2662.983,2666.434,--and it was in the four documents that was presented to them--
1995.94-1471,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2666.434,2675.373,--The misrepresentation is not that the new piece of paper on which the new plan is written has the same words as the old piece of paper.
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2685.896,2698.822,"--That's exactly right, and it's in that context and in the context that in the short, brief meeting they said, you need to sign this today to transfer so you be sure those benefits will not be interrupted."
1995.94-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2698.822,2713.581,"But the question on that point is simply that the ponit about the Massey Combines Corp. comes in response to the next question and on a separate page, so is he still answering with his hat as the fiduciary?"
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2713.581,2714.448,That's correct.
1995.94-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2714.448,2716.283,"Oh, I'm... that's not correct, that's a question."
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2717.133,2729.591,"You're asking that if, when they switch over to talking about the business matters, that they're still talking about, and I say yes, that's true, they're still talking as a beneficiary."
1995.94-1471,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2766.883,2781.66,"But it was because... I think you're saying it would have been very odd... it would have been unreasonable for employees to say, oh, now that he's talking about the rosy future, he's not making any statement that might be relevant to my decision about joining the new plan."
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2781.66,2782.226,--That's--
1995.94-1471,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2782.226,2784.012,Isn't that the nub of what you're saying?
1995.94-1471,1,28168,h_richard_smith,,2784.012,2784.462,--That's correct.
1995.94-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2784.462,2787.629,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
1995.94-1471,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2789.113,2800.187,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1471,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2858.56,2859.126,But that's not the point.
1995.94-1471,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2873.235,2874.352,Yes.
1995.94-1471,3,23503,floyd_abrams,,3418.304,3428.379,"I'd like to return to Justice O'Connor's observation earlier, when you said that it looked a lot like damages."
1995.94-1471,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3552.174,3552.624,"Thank you, Mr. Abrams."
1995.94-1471,3,23503,floyd_abrams,,3552.624,3553.224,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1995.94-1471,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3553.224,3554.224,The case is submitted.
