1974.73-1462,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.359,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1462, White against Regester."
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,50.105,53.309,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1974.73-1462,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,207.296,214.422,"Counsel, what was the issue when this case was remanded here?"
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,219.247,221.027,"Basically, Your Honor, that is correct."
1974.73-1462,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,224.81,227.334,But they existed only in certain areas?
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,227.334,231.052,They exist -- there were 11 remaining multimember districts.
1974.73-1462,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,233.271,243.516,"But if relief was given in each -- if all of the multimember districts were made single-member districts, nothing would happen to all the other districts in the state."
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,243.516,247.932,"That is correct, Your Honor, depending on how the single-member districts were created."
1974.73-1462,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,269.361,277.783,"Why was this multimember district issue, since it affected only certain localities in the state?"
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,280.796,305.615,"Your Honor, I believe that one of the major reasons that it is a three-judge court issue is that this case attacks all of the remaining districts which is a statewide policy, and as this Court has so recently held in Chapman versus Meier, subject matter of this kind is regular grist for the three-judge court, and that route typically has been employed under conditions similar to those present here."
1974.73-1462,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,307.89,313.459,If it only concerned maybe one of the multimember districts out of several it might be different?
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,313.459,320.529,"It maybe different, Your Honor, but I don't believe that the posture of this case is attacking just one or just another."
1974.73-1462,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,335.289,342.082,And all of them -- all of the multimember districts without exception were under attack on this remand?
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,342.082,343.156,"Yes they were, Your Honor."
1974.73-1462,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,441.775,443.078,What kind of a matter?
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,443.078,445.798,In a “get one win three” manner.
1974.73-1462,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.968,453.449,Then we get the other two along with it?
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,453.449,457.487,"You automatically get the other two, so it adds up to three and thereby you win the game."
1974.73-1462,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,457.487,460.529,I think they are not distinct or separate?
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,460.529,464.076,"Independent, they are functions of each other, basically."
1974.73-1462,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,605.051,634.361,"Just as before you leave this one factor, suppose there's a ten-man multimember district, ten representative multimember district, and each election, one party slates three out of the ten as -- slates three Negroes our of the ten, which is roughly proportional to the population, I assume, and there is an opposing slate from another party."
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,660.011,665.611,"I think, Your Honor, that that is relevant access, I mean, relevant evidence of access."
1974.73-1462,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.324,679.511,"Yes, but we didn't have any -- in Whitcomb, you suggest Whitcomb, but Whitcomb never had anything like that."
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,684.159,684.622,I submit --
1974.73-1462,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.622,689.221,"And in the example I just gave you, the minority didn't win even if the party wins."
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,689.221,695.878,"Your Honor, I submit to you that we don't really have the situation that you're suggesting in this case either."
1974.73-1462,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.436,700.201,What if you did though?
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,700.201,703.146,"If you did, I believe that first of all, the fact that the minority was slated --"
1974.73-1462,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.146,711.599,"Because arguably that is the situation in some of these, at least it's argued to be the situation in some of these?"
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,711.599,714.127,"It is argued to be the situation, yes."
1974.73-1462,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.663,722.896,Yes.
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,722.896,728.448,But I believe you also have to look to why some of these candidates were not elected.
1974.73-1462,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,887.942,900.7,Will you conceive that the court may appropriately take into account what the label and for purposes of this case are racist to campaign tactics?
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,900.7,919.564,"I believe that they could take it into account, Your Honor, but I do not believe it could be one in a factor -- checklist of factors the way these are set up, that would especially if they had not been successful as the record generally shows, that it would rise to the level of proof which this Court has required."
1974.73-1462,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,919.564,923.362,"Well, for what purpose could the district court take it into account?"
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,923.362,939.946,"I believe, the reason it could be taken into account would be to show that black or brown, minority candidates could never be elected or that their election was totally impossible in especially a large district."
1974.73-1462,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,943.975,948.807,This position doesn't give you any trouble with the First Amendment?
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,964.21,967.609,"I believe that everyone can say what they want to say in a campaign, Your Honor."
1974.73-1462,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,967.609,978.185,Couldn't a Negro candidate go out in campaign directly attacking Whites as Whites and couldn't Mexican-American do the same thing or a White?
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,978.185,981.13,"I believe you would have the possibility of doing that, Your Honor."
1974.73-1462,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,981.13,996.067,Then are you saying that the court may take into account conduct which is protected by the First Amendment to -- in this formula as the court obviously did here?
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,996.067,997.519,Taking into account conduct which is--
1974.73-1462,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,997.519,1005.573,"Took into account, what are labeled in this case as racist campaign tactics?"
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,1005.573,1023.187,"Your Honor, I do believe that the court can take this into account, but as I said the way this court used a checklist factor, the use of these candidate -- and adding it all up supposedly independent of each other, the factors didn't work that way."
1974.73-1462,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1044.794,1056.367,"Well, certainly the meaning of a Democratic government, I would think is that when I go into the ballot box and vote for a candidate, I can vote for him for a good reason, a bad reason or for no reason at all."
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,1065.091,1067.828,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1462,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1072.828,1089.791,"what difference whether [Inaudible] consistent voting [Inaudible] against any kind of minority and that's the reason to disestablish a multimember district, that's the question?"
1974.73-1462,0,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,1089.791,1094.796,"No, Your Honor, I do not believe on its own grounds that is enough of a reason."
1974.73-1462,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1345.324,1346.41,Mr. Richards?
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1346.41,1351.899,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1974.73-1462,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1596.866,1599.234,How many representatives are there in Jefferson County?
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1599.234,1599.947,How --
1974.73-1462,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1599.947,1600.948,How many representative in Jefferson County?
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1600.948,1602.433,Three I am sorry.
1974.73-1462,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1616.546,1618.017,Is it one of the Beaumont and Port Arthur?
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1618.017,1624.853,"That's Beaumont and Port Arthur or the towns, both Beaumont and Port Arthur are within the multimember district."
1974.73-1462,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1667.132,1669.035,What areas of the McLennan County or which city?
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1669.035,1672.53,It is in central Texas on the Brazos river.
1974.73-1462,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1672.53,1674.023,Any town or city of --
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1674.023,1683.51,Waco is the county seat and occupied essentially the entire legislative district.
1974.73-1462,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1968.941,1973.132,"hat had been the history of McLennan before 1971, as to number of districts?"
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1973.132,1976.724,It had been a multimember district before 1970.
1974.73-1462,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1983.001,1984.574,"-- two, wouldn't it?"
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1984.574,1986.733,"With two at one point, yes."
1974.73-1462,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2274.51,2277.677,You were speaking about evidence in these counties.
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2285.805,2286.751,I can tell you some of it.
1974.73-1462,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2288.685,2302.754,"Minority citizens, it can be said that the members of the legislature from El Paso were not responsive to the needs of 60% of the people to whom they represent?"
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2302.754,2314.497,"First let me point -- I mean, at least point out first, the fact that there was perhaps a numerical majority was also the argument made by the state with respect to Bexar County in the initial case."
1974.73-1462,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2367.17,2373.906,What evidence is there that the members of the legislature were unresponsive to a majority of the population?
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2373.906,2375.624,Well --
1974.73-1462,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2375.624,2380.161,Is there evidence in the record?
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2380.161,2384.524,I would not argue as to the current delegation of the legislature.
1974.73-1462,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2416.437,2442.698,"Why shouldn't the district court pay attention to the actual current situation when it makes its judgment, if at the time it decides there are representatives of the minority being slated in and elected in a district, should the district court nevertheless say that historically this hasn't been so and therefore we're going to disestablish the multimember district?"
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2442.698,2461.323,"Well, excuse me, I think it should pay attention and I think it did pay attention, and I am saying to you that in the El Paso County for example, the time this case was tried, no Mexican-Americans were elected among the four-member delegation or five-member delegation, actually from El Paso County served the Texas legislature, and that was part of the facts of that case."
1974.73-1462,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.213,2465.876,"It was at the time of the court's opinion, is that true?"
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2465.876,2468.484,"Yeah, that is true, I'm sorry, that is the fact, at the time of the court's opinion."
1974.73-1462,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2482.55,2487.644,What between decision and appeal the facts of situation changes dramatically?
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2487.644,2488.568,Alright.
1974.73-1462,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.69,2497.166,"Let's assume that they did, what would you suggest that appellate court should do?"
1974.73-1462,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2497.166,2503.512,"Well, I suppose the facts could change to moot the case, the facts could change so dramatically that it might require a reconsideration."
1974.73-1462,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2561.038,2565.323,"Very well Mr. Richards, Mr. Gladden?"
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2565.323,2568.182,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1462,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2592.971,2595.089,"Before you get on to that, let me ask you this."
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2614.452,2617.449,If a 60% majority --
1974.73-1462,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2617.449,2624.007,"Minority, consistently elects someone not in the minority group?"
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2624.007,2628.203,"I don't understand the quote, I'm sorry about the 60% minority, and minority --"
1974.73-1462,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2628.203,2632.819,Suppose a district has 60% combined Mexican-Americans and Negroes.
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2632.819,2633.407,"Oh, okay."
1974.73-1462,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2633.407,2638.336,"But they consistently elect twice, what point has to be made in that?"
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2638.336,2654.703,I don't think that situation exists in Texas unless it perhaps exists in Hidalgo County where there is a substantial Mexican-American in essence the majority and they elect both Whites and Mexican-Americans.
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.044,2731.592,"Are elections there, are they by party?"
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2731.592,2732.789,No Your Honor--
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2732.789,2739.189,"The one party is the one party operation, but it's just that, that had races."
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2739.189,2743.796,We have a primary system in Texas.
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2757.922,2760.77,How difficult is it to get on the primary ballot?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2760.77,2763.784,It is not difficult at all to get on the primary ballot.
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.088,2771.038,Only the signatures is required?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2771.038,2775.622,"No, you can just go in and sign up and get on the ballot, but we --"
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2775.622,2777.412,They can sign up for a place in the --?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2777.412,2778.672,Yes you do have.
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2779.499,2781.309,You have to pick your opponent.
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2781.309,2784.141,This is a place system or your opponents picks you.
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2786.79,2789.963,You're not going to get picked unless you're in?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2789.963,2791.739,That's very true.
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2828.257,2834.13,You say that -- you must say that there's complete access to the ballot?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2834.13,2837.455,"Don't think that there is any question, but what Blacks in --"
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2837.455,2842.213,Slating is beside the point as far as access to the ballots is concerned?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2842.213,2842.677,"No, slating--"
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2842.677,2845.341,It may not be beside the points as to who wins?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2845.341,2850.583,"Slating is our concern, only on who wins not as to access of the ballot."
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2850.583,2852.653,For complete access to the ballot.
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2852.653,2853.465,No question about--
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.465,2853.527,The only thing is--
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2853.527,2857.141,"-- any black, any Chicano has that --"
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.141,2863.618,So you say that it really is the function of the discriminatory voting that has kept Blacks off the --
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2863.618,2865.071,"No, I do not Your Honor."
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2872.253,2878.191,"I know, but then this all a Negro has to do is to go ahead and pay $100, he's on the ballot?"
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2878.191,2878.701,Okay.
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.11,2895.159,"I know but Nevertheless, whatever the results are, they can't keep Negroes off the ballot?"
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2895.159,2896.052,That's very true.
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.052,2898.319,All they can do is organize the vote?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2898.319,2900.337,"All they can do is just keep them from wining, Your Honor."
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2900.337,2902.211,That's what's what I mean.
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2906.276,2907.788,"Yes, there is no question about that."
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.788,2922.382,"And you're suggesting that the consistent discrimination at the polls against Blacks who are running for office, a systematic discrimination is a sufficient reason for disestablishing a multimember district?"
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2922.382,2924.398,Taking into consideration all the other fact --
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2924.398,2926.946,It wasn't a issue at all in Whitcomb?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2926.946,2928.637,"No, it wasn't a issue on Whitcomb."
1974.73-1462,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2945.03,2946.027,Or by the Seventh Street.
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2946.027,2948.402,Or by the Seventh Street group.
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2948.402,2951.29,Or in a number of all.
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2951.29,2978.218,"Well, the evidence is that you don't get enough polls and the state witnesses when called upon to cite one example of one legislator who had been elected from Tarrant County that did not have either one, the business community on the one hand, or the labor literal community support slating on the other hand, and Representative Gabe Lewis (ph) thought and thought and thought and could not come up with one single member of the legislature in the history he'd been aware of politics."
1974.73-1462,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2988.169,2998.797,"It's a little bit like the situation would be in many states, you have to be supported by the Republicans or by the Democrats?"
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,2998.797,3000.684,"This is very true, this is very true."
1974.73-1462,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3002.137,3004.818,"In order to realistically, have a chance of being elected?"
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3004.818,3013.914,"Yes, and again from a meaningful opportunity of getting your name on the ballot and meaningful opportunity to be endorsed and elected is the question."
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3016.299,3018.373,Did a black ever slated?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3018.373,3020.585,Blacks were slated twice.
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.585,3021.909,Were they elected?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3021.909,3024.334,No Your Honor.
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3043.989,3048.674,So I guess the fellow from the other slate won?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3048.674,3051.286,"Yes, the fellow from the business slate won."
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3053.055,3057.544,What's interesting is that both slating organizations slated the blacks?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3057.544,3060.992,"It sure would, but the business slate has never slated a black."
1974.73-1462,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3109.658,3124.777,"Is this any different than, if you have instead of seven-street group and the liberal labor, republican and democratic parties and your argument was, neither one is ever -- has ever chosen a Negro?"
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3124.777,3134.301,"In essence is, and it's also the same circumstance that Justice White raised about the fact that if you do slate a black, does he ever win?"
1974.73-1462,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3160.427,3161.573,[Voice Overlap] my question.
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3161.573,3164.211,"I'm sorry, would you repeat the question?"
1974.73-1462,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3164.211,3167.298,"Well, I won't repeat it at all, I'll ask you another one."
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3185.372,3198.861,"I think that if in Forth Worth if in a multi member district, where you see a submergence of a minority interest that does not have access to the slating process, yes, I feel like --"
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3198.861,3208.285,"So you wouldn't say the same thing, if the multimember district was just established and the same thing occurred in the single member districts."
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3221.415,3222.392,I would say it was --
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3222.392,3228.425,"And the state can make it happen even in single member districts, and then you wouldn't have [Attempt to Laughter] much different plan at all?"
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3228.425,3230.388,"I would say, if it was done with intent --"
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3230.388,3232.585,I doubt if you could win?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3232.585,3238.055,I would say if it was done with intent to dilute the minority strength that it would --
1974.73-1462,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3238.055,3246.94,"Intent to dilute like somebody intensely intense to beat a Negro at the vote of the polls, you're not going to upset that very easily?"
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3246.94,3251.03,"Well, this is very true, now then if I may -"
1974.73-1462,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3251.03,3252.966,"Mr. Gladden, before you leave this point --"
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3252.966,3253.695,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-1462,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3253.695,3259.53,Has a republican ever been slated in Fort Worth?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3259.53,3263.427,Not to my knowledge by the business group or the labor group.
1974.73-1462,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3263.427,3266.684,But you said there has never been one elected --
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3266.684,3271.064,Well there never have been any serious challenges in house races.
1974.73-1462,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3284.564,3287.861,Are republicans a party to this litigation?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3287.861,3290.541,Republicans were parties plaintiffs to this litigation.
1974.73-1462,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3290.541,3292.596,Are they still in the case?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3292.596,3295.84,"Yes, and they file plans and --"
1974.73-1462,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3295.84,3307.437,Which counsel represents that?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3307.437,3312.086,"Mr. Jim George of Austin, Texas Your Honor, represented the Republican party claim."
1974.73-1462,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3312.086,3317.004,So you make the same claim of discrimination against Republicans that you are against minorities?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3317.004,3319.145,"The Republicans made that same claim, Your Honor."
1974.73-1462,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3319.145,3321.26,Are you making it?
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3321.26,3323.105,"We carry it forward, yes."
1974.73-1462,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3324.964,3326.283,You are making it.
1974.73-1462,2,20896,don_gladden,,3326.283,3327.24,I think so.
1974.73-1462,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3334.289,3336.006,Very well.
1974.73-1462,3,22640,elizabeth_b_levatino,,3338.952,3344.956,"Yes, Your Honor, I would like to state few very short and brief comments."
