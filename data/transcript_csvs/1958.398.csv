1958.398,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,14.472,"Number 398 Louisiana Power & Light Company, petitioner versus City of Thibodaux."
1958.398,0,31920,j_raburn_monroe,,16.251,20.805,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1958.398,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,175.767,183.629,(Inaudible)
1958.398,0,31920,j_raburn_monroe,,183.629,189.549,"That was -- I was going to come to the specific answers, yes."
1958.398,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1026.527,1048.62,"Although the – the one thing I am – would like you to enlighten me, -- what questions there are in this litigation, that have any substantiality on which state law determinations become important."
1958.398,0,31920,j_raburn_monroe,,1048.62,1048.842,Well --
1958.398,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1048.842,1058.084,"Other way around, if you dispel claim that there is nothing here on which the state court could shed light?"
1958.398,0,31920,j_raburn_monroe,,1058.084,1058.394,Yes --
1958.398,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1058.394,1063.86,Isn't that at the heart of this (Inaudible) in this case?
1958.398,0,31920,j_raburn_monroe,,1063.86,1065.7,"That's right, in other words its --"
1958.398,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1065.7,1068.397,(Inaudible) is comparable --
1958.398,0,31920,j_raburn_monroe,,1068.397,1072.925,There is -- it begins with Act number 1011 of 1900.
1958.398,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1091.056,1095.887,"Is that provision is set out in your brief, provision of the Act?"
1958.398,0,31920,j_raburn_monroe,,1095.887,1097.307,It's quoted in the appendix to the --
1958.398,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1097.307,1103.388,(Inaudible) controversy is that whether that should be send back to the State Court to conclude?
1958.398,0,31920,j_raburn_monroe,,1103.388,1104.944,"Yeah, that's the question."
1958.398,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1104.944,1106.206,(Inaudible)
1958.398,0,31920,j_raburn_monroe,,1106.206,1128.962,"The Act is printed in the appendix to the city's briefs, the bound -- Now we say this is an -- we have raised quite a number of questions under this, because since 1900 there have been a number of accidents which apparently conflict with this -- this Act."
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,1876.743,1882.049,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2109.21,2125.868,"First thing is the disposition that was made by the District Judge, what you denominate a refusal to decide or does he just stays his hand and wait determination by the state court of these supposedly state issues."
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2125.868,2126.79,Your Honor --
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2126.79,2127.691,(Inaudible)
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2127.691,2143.604,"No Your Honor that's correct and he presumably would eventually pass on the federal issues involved if there are any and he would eventually pass on the question of a quantum, the amount of the award for condemnation."
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2156.021,2166.815,"Would he have to defer to State Court's decisions on those issues, if in fact they had been in existence through decisions of your Supreme Court."
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2166.815,2172.678,"Under Erie versus Tompkins Your Honor I think he would have to follow them and apply them, yes."
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2172.678,2186.226,"Well you, as I gather from what you said, you agree that there are circumstances, exceptional circumstances on which the court should stay the issues and hand such state issues back for determination (Inaudible)"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2186.226,2201.018,"That's correct You Honor, provided that it is done either in suit in equity, that is a refusal to enjoin state action, that I think a court of equity has the power to do."
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2201.018,2202.553,Is that (Inaudible)
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2202.553,2216.299,"No it go further, it admits these exceptional cases in bankruptcy, admiralty and the cases where the preliminary agency determination, whether it's a state agency or a federal agency is necessary to the District Court's decision."
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2216.299,2233.643,"(Inaudible) the case has indicated that if there are issues to be decided, there is a (Inaudible) consideration that the court does now refer those issues to state --"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2233.643,2255.393,"Well Your Honor, there is no decision by this Court in which this type of case, that is an ordinary law case has -- and in which there is no statute involved which requires a preliminary determination, there is no decision by this Court authorizing such as stay of proceedings in this certain case."
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2255.393,2259.401,Very close to it is of course is the bankruptcy case if you can --
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2259.401,2260.051,That's correct.
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2260.051,2263.175,(Inaudible) I mean in (Inaudible)
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2263.175,2265.678,Yes which is essentially equitable.
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2265.678,2277.421,"And I hope you will discuss, before you sit down (Inaudible) as suit, the court does have that power, why should they not do it?"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2311.33,2324.572,"Well Your Honor, pre-emitting the question of power and getting simply to the second question presented, which is whether the Court in this particular instance abused, the District Court abused its discretion or not?"
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2324.572,2325.44,(Inaudible) those words.
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2330.35,2332.291,Well for several reasons.
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2369.521,2371.782,Do you have a question of construction?
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2371.782,2396.324,"Well, as to whether or not its difficult to apply this law, it's alleged that this is an old law since 1900 and that it has never been interpreted in the last 59 years, that appears to be true, though no one knows whether the District Courts of Louisiana have applied this law many times or few times, it has never been appealed, that's all we can say."
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2462.641,2471.863,What are the practical injuries that will occur to the city of – here if this is sent back to state to interpret its law --
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2471.863,2484.598,"Your Honor the -- now I have to go somewhere out of the record, well this much is in the record here the city files its suit in State Court expecting to have the matter determined there."
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2516.64,2518.101,(Inaudible)
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2518.101,2521.083,"Well, it's -- first it's time consuming."
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2558.683,2560.753,(Inaudible) stand for that?
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2560.753,2570.723,"No, but we would have to then go back to Judge Wright and ask him now is this sufficient for the judging this particular parish."
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2570.723,2586.228,Have you suggested to the opposing counsel at any time since they moved the case in there and they want federal judges instead of the State Court to pass on that case (Inaudible)
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2586.228,2588.853,"No, Your Honor we have not, we --"
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2588.853,2592.095,"The reason, would it be much delay if they were demanded?"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2592.095,2602.774,Yes Your Honor because the question is now ripe for decision in the District Court assuming that the judgment of the Court of Appeal were (Inaudible).
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2619.725,2656.492,"May I ask you on the assumption that this came as a surprise to both sides that you are right – decide to have a State Court interpretation after he directed -- suggested or directed I suppose that State Court interpretation be sought, did your parish make the representations you now make here or the suggestions of all the difficulties in carrying out his -- desire to be informed rather than grope in the dark?"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2656.492,2657.588,"No, Your Honor we --"
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2657.588,2658.909,This did come as a surprise to both of you? --
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2658.909,2660.008,"It did, it did and --"
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2660.008,2671.882,And this came as an exercise of judicial discretion by a judge who is not I believe notorious (Inaudible)
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2671.882,2673.581,"No, Your Honor, you are right."
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2673.581,2674.798,Who appealed?
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2674.798,2682.226,"We appealed, the city appealed Your Honor, I believe simply on the question of whether the stay order was proper enough."
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2733.399,2736.908,"Suppose you tried and they wouldn't do it, then you could go back to --"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2736.908,2746.746,"Well, I suppose we have no alternative what to ask Judge Wright for a modification of his ruling or a withdrawal of it, I don't know how you can modify it to help us."
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2746.746,2759.181,"I presume if you took it back there and the other side objected, go to the State Court, Federal Court wouldn't hesitate very long, and go ahead and try the case."
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2759.181,2776.367,I suppose Mr. Monroe (Inaudible) we have more confidence than the average judge in the parish could (Inaudible)
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2776.367,2781.865,And quite understandably the company was delighted with the delay produced by the ruling.
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2799.132,2803.697,Is there any question about the ability of the city to pay?
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2803.697,2808.592,No Your Honor the money has already been appropriated through a bond issue and is set aside and is --
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2808.592,2810.197,"Then it's a question of power, isn't it?"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2810.197,2811.129,It's completely a question of power.
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2811.129,2817.187,Anything been said about a bond or an injunction?
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2817.187,2817.618,In –
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2817.618,2829.484,"In (Inaudible) the city is being held up in gravy I should suppose the city might have raised some question about applying a bond, but (Inaudible)"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2829.484,2839.872,"Well, yes the judge himself is responsible for the stay orders, the company is not."
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2839.872,2843.701,"Well, that wouldn't have prevented you asking the judge --"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2843.701,2847.12,"Well, it's not so much a matter of the bond, Your Honor."
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2977.15,2994.726,But in gamut of obligation (Inaudible) depends so much on the conception of allegedly conflicting state laws and it's the state law (Inaudible)
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,2994.726,2995.811,"Well, Your Honor --"
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2995.811,3004.919,"-- strange, from my point of view, very strange construction as to what the state committed itself and they have got (Inaudible)"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3004.919,3019.671,"Well, Your Honor here the only admitted claim of the company is a franchise which is a perfectly ordinary limited franchise to operate over the roads of the parish and put up their telephone poles and lines."
1958.398,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3120.319,3128.347,"May I ask you and your Louisiana jurisprudence have a -- have the distinction between law and equity and suppose you don't, do you, it is not based on --"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3128.347,3129.036,"No, we do not."
1958.398,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3129.036,3131.683,-- this law?
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3131.683,3135.038,I think Your Honor asked the question in connection with the Leiter case.
1958.398,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3135.038,3145.835,In the Leiter case and many of these cases where this whole doctrine has generally been referred to accurately or inaccurately as one of equitable abstention.
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3150.433,3155.204,Well I don't know that the distinction would have to be recognized by Louisiana law.
1958.398,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3187.24,3202.188,"Well I gather that -- the key problem here is the power of the municipality under these several Louisiana statutes to do this, that is whether that has been delegated to the municipality this power --"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3202.188,3204.418,That is the problem Your Honor before the District Court.
1958.398,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3204.418,3206.233,"That's really the basic one, isn't it?"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3206.233,3206.758,That's right.
1958.398,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3206.758,3214.545,Well now do you can consider it'd be pretty difficult job for the District Court to decide what the Louisiana law is in that regard?
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3214.545,3223.096,We have argued in our brief and I think I tried to explain that there is no real difficult problem of interpretation here.
1958.398,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3225.689,3228.665,What about the conflicts with later statutes which Mr. Monroe --
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3228.665,3232.381,They were -- there are no conflicts with later statutes.
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3252.301,3256.03,(Inaudible)
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3256.03,3298.43,"Judge Wright did not seem to find any difficulty with any question except this one which is that in 1900 so the Judge (Inaudible) without any evidence, the municipality -- the electric and other public utilities were largely located within the boundaries of the municipality and that therefore what this statute contemplated was the taking of that property within the city limits and that it was difficult to apply that old statute in visiting that situation to the modern situation where you have an electric company operating throughout the state."
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3298.43,3303.497,(Inaudible)
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3303.497,3317.785,"Unless we could find a – well, I think it would be safe to say that the city would have no claim to condemn the property if it goes, it must rely on statutory authority not being sovereign itself."
1958.398,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3317.785,3329.672,"Is there any case in which, that you know of, that you run into in which the district judge on his own motion did what this judge did?"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3329.672,3352.963,Well Your Honor it's difficult to tell from the -- some of the decisions whether the judge did it on his own motion or not but I had found none in which it is clear that the judge did on his own motion and I am persuaded that Judge Wright did it in this case because he had been reversed – finally reversed in the Leiter case.
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3355.041,3364.982,I thought that the question really should be decided by the state Supreme Court.
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3372.94,3382.67,Well I think the judge was somewhat taken aback by the Leiter decision and quite understandably became less hesitant to decide state law questions thereafter.
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3382.67,3391.375,(Inaudible) I inferred what you said that he was -- that there was question in his mind in the construction --
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3391.375,3391.535,Well --
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3391.535,3393.033,-- a statute.
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3393.033,3405.361,"Let me say this also, the judge's doubt was based partly on the opinion of the Attorney General which has been referred to, Louisiana Attorney General, which is cited in appendix in the brief of the petitioner."
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3432.645,3443.397,"So he might, it is conceivable that even your Supreme Court might find might describe (Inaudible) that is conceivable isn't it?"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3443.397,3446.505,"It is always conceivable, Your Honor but not very likely."
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3446.505,3449.758,You mean you would never find a flaw in the decisions of lower court?
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3449.758,3489.242,"I wouldn't say that Your Honor, but in the opinion goes far beyond any flaw that our Supreme Court (Inaudible) If I may conclude with this quotation from public utilities commission of Ohio versus United Fuel Gas company an opinion written for a unanimous -- for the majority by Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointing out the times when you do, when the times when you don't issue these stay orders."
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3537.755,3543.928,"We dissented in that case, but I assume what you are saying is I am bound by that now."
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3543.928,3544.857,(Inaudible)
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3544.857,3553.027,"-- I think the demand, I think your litigation is a model of these compared to that Ohio case."
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3553.027,3554.161,Well that was on the --
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3554.161,3558.341,I forgotten (Inaudible)
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3558.341,3558.852,It is only --
1958.398,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3558.852,3564.514,"If I remember that that really was a snail like process, wasn't it?"
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3564.514,3574.926,"Well it was only two years, Your Honor in the quotation I just read, it says more than two years but in our case it's also more than two years, that was all."

1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3630.033,3634.8,You mean it did not require an action within a reasonable time?
1958.398,1,34256,louis_fenner_claiborne,,3634.8,3637.262,"That is correct Your Honor, it's an indefinite order."
1958.398,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3637.262,3639.658,What did it require?

1958.398,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3741.881,3744.858,There is a controversy and they are trying to condemn.

1958.398,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3801.669,3806.645,Does that go far enough to say that you will join (Inaudible) declaratory judgment.

1958.398,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3946.633,3951.651,"What I understand by that, that you are not going to initiate in a state court (Inaudible)"
1958.398,2,31920,j_raburn_monroe,,3951.651,3956.177,"Well, I think I would do so if this Court said that was essential."
1958.398,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3956.177,3977.361,"Is there any evidence controvert with the state, the Judge Wright was within administrative judicial discretion so (Inaudible) would the state have any reason for not -- for blocking this?"

1958.398,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3983.112,3983.9,I should think --
