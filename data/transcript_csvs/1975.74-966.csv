1975.74-966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.676,"We will hear arguments first this morning in number 74-966, American Foreign Steamship Company against Matise."
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,17.586,21.399,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,187.117,195.108,You say that it is conceited that the sailor or seaman owed to the shipowner for the airline ticket?
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,195.108,200.728,"This is further as the counsel concedes or not, I do not know, he did concede it in the District Court."
1975.74-966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,207.651,218.03,"Even though the ship was obligated to get him out of Vietnam under the law, nevertheless, that did not mean that they had to pay his way home?"
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,218.03,230.903,"May I say this is true, but before I say it is true, may I say that the Court of Appeals refers to Vietnam treaties and obligations of the shipowner to bring him home."
1975.74-966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,232.156,238.644,"Well, they can get him out of Vietnam, but that does not mean that they have to get him out of their own expense."
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,242.886,252.245,"The Court of Appeals said it was the -- the money was the seaman’s obligation, that went further and I had some discussion about Vietnam treaties and the shipowner’s obligation to put to their sole support for the --"
1975.74-966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,252.245,261.132,"For the Court of Appeals -- it did not seem to make any difference to the Court of Appeals whether it was his obligation or not, whether it was or whether it was not, this penalty was to be invoked?"
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,261.132,262.197,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-966,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,262.197,268.724,"And also, while under treaties it might have been the shipowners’ obligation to get him out of Vietnam."
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,276.086,277.081,If one assumes --
1975.74-966,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,277.081,278.005,It was part of the treaty?
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,278.005,282.964,"If one would assume that there was a treaty obligation, that is correct."
1975.74-966,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,282.964,286.956,It could not have gone beyond an obligation to get him out of Vietnam?
1975.74-966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,286.956,294.019,Why is not the payment for the air fare made in Saigon treatable as a partial payment of wages?
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,294.019,299.431,"This is exactly the shipowners’ position, Your Honor, exactly."
1975.74-966,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,299.431,300.057,Why is it not?
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,305.222,314.047,"Well, may I -- the -- I have spent many hours attempting to understand the Court of Appeals' first opinion."
1975.74-966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.382,435.4,"If the seaman had gone with them to the airline office then they had given him the cash, the seaman the cash and said this is part of your wages and the seaman had bought his own ticket, there would not have been any problem, I guess there?"
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,435.4,436.288,There should not have been.
1975.74-966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,436.288,453.704,"He might have violated Vietnam law, giving him the cash having the currency there, but nevertheless there would not have been any problem. The real problem is paying a third party what the lawyer claims to be what the seaman owed him?"
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,453.704,461.703,"I think there is no question under the record that we have in this case that the seaman in fact did go to the airline office, accompanied by the agent."
1975.74-966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,463.541,465.033,(Inaudible)
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,465.033,481.31,"This could be and here we have the fines or problem that the shipowner faces, that if had given the cash to the seaman one second before he gave it to the agent, theoretically they are on that side, you have a technical violation."
1975.74-966,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,481.31,492.306,"If you do not prevail on your submission that the this was a wages, that were paid when he got the airline ticket."
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,503.944,533.884,"Assuming that this did not constitute legal payment then we will come to the question of the quantum of the penalty, is that correct Your Honor? I think there is a very, very serious question and here we have, I do not intend this as a digression, but this brings, I think into play, the entire subject of this group of statutes, and how they are being handled and what is to be done in fairness on both sides."
1975.74-966,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,716.826,722.804,Does the record indicate how they got -- how it was that they were present?
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,722.804,742.155,"The record does not indicate who called whom, but that record does indicate that the Vice Consul was inquiring into the circumstances of the discharge into the loggings, that he performed all the duties which the statute requires him to perform, including the issuance of a certificate of discharge to the seaman, reassuring that he had received a wage voucher."
1975.74-966,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,778.918,781.089,And the coast guard?
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,781.089,790.758,"The coast guard, I suspect, and the record does not disclose except that they all came."
1975.74-966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.187,828.527,"Let us assume that it was determined after studying whatever laws or treaties there are that it really was the shipowner's duty and also his financial obligation to return him to the United States, that it was to be on his pocket, not the seaman’s and they just made a mistake, you have just been wrong."
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,837.04,841.283,"I did not, I believe, give adequate or a proper answer."
1975.74-966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,892.906,898.234,"That may be so, but what about the penalty up to that time?"
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,911.824,917.249,I would think that up to date of the trial in a case where the District -- I think --
1975.74-966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.249,928.205,"(Voice Overlap) in the understanding that you were paying him, that you had paid him, and you were advised that you would -- that you have paid him, and that it was his cost, not yours?"
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,928.205,971.238,"And so far as the calculation of a period of time is concerned, I would think that certainly through the decision, through the two decisions of the trial court of course, the first one found that we had paid, I would say that through that one, we are affirmed in the sufficiency of our cause and persisting in our, we are assuming, a wrongful belief, and I would say that, certainly, in applying the rule of reason that the courts have applied, and I would say that this Court applied in the Smith case, we were entitled to persist in this assumed, erroneous course, certainly up to the time of the opinion of the Court of Appeals."
1975.74-966,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,995.687,996.977,(Voice Overlap) about that.
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,996.977,997.863,I am sorry sir.
1975.74-966,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,997.863,1005.21,"If you were right about that, assuming you had some penalty to pay, how much would the penalty be?"
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,1005.21,1021.923,The penalty calculates at the rate of approximately $29.00 per day and presumably would -- the -- I am sorry I do not have at the moment the date of entry of the trial court judgment.
1975.74-966,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1031.256,1033.743,As against 35?
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,1033.743,1038.061,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-966,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1109.582,1116.851,I gather your first position is that he was paid full wages and therefore there is penalty involved at all?
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,1116.851,1117.822,That is correct.
1975.74-966,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1117.822,1127.406,"And if you are wrong about that -- your second argument is that in any event you have a good faith defense (Inaudible), is that it?"
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,1127.406,1152.428,"That is correct, Mr. Justice and this statutory provision that I just adverted to, I think points out the absurdity of the result because of the shipowner, in this case, as it did not, had discharged the seaman wholly without cause, the shipowner's obligation would have been to pay one months’ wages or to find him a work-away job on another ship."
1975.74-966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1157.298,1189.165,"Mr. Tetreault, if you take a look at page 5 of the tan appendix, where there is the statement apparently furnished by your client to the respondent of deductions and look down the lower half of the page where it says first and half deductions transportation Saigon to San Francisco, $510.00 and then right below that says advances such and such then beyond that it says, slop chest, $51.00."
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,1200.459,1202.865,"That is correct, Your Honor and I --"
1975.74-966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1202.865,1205.215,"Well, what is the authority?"
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,1214.168,1219.601,"That is, I believe the Statute is 46, Section 670."
1975.74-966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.957,1265.739,Consent is enough without specific statutory authorization?
1975.74-966,0,24716,francis_l_tetreault,,1265.739,1268.267,This is the case in connection with the slop chest.
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,1493.591,1498.351,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1616.986,1618.449,Where you referring to --
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,1618.449,1621.254,"They appear in the transcript to page 44, line 12."
1975.74-966,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1621.254,1625.53,Transcript or appendix?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,1632.622,1633.453,"Yes, they are, Your Honor."
1975.74-966,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1633.453,1634.654,44?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,1634.654,1634.91,No.
1975.74-966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1726.443,1738.784,Do you suggest that we are entitled to decide this case on the assumption or accept the finding that it was the seaman’s obligation to pay air fare home?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,1744.377,1752.076,"Well, Your Honor, I want to say that I consider that to be completely erroneous, but that this Court’s decision would be the same in either event."
1975.74-966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.076,1753.287,Alright.
1975.74-966,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1756.497,1761.81,Let us move to the top of page 9 following the paragraphs you were talking about.
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,1791.284,1810.17,"Yes, Your Honor and I think that it is completely erroneous, and I say that without resorting to (Inaudible) it is completely erroneous in view of the statutory protections which Congress established for a seaman in order to prevent precisely this kind of a finding being made by a court."
1975.74-966,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1810.17,1813.655,Does it bear on a good faith defense aspect of this case?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,1813.655,1814.121,I am sorry.
1975.74-966,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1814.121,1820.037,Does it bear on the good faith defense issue in this case?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,1820.037,1822.381,I think that it definitely does.
1975.74-966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1869.115,1878.222,What if the seaman agrees as in the case of the case of a slop chest that he has bought so much and agrees to have it deducted consensually?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,1881.017,1881.766,"No, Your Honor."
1975.74-966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1914.703,1922.701,But the statute does not authorize a deduction from wages for the slop chest purchases?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,1922.701,1938.794,"I believe that it would be reasonable to say that a statute that creates a slop chest limits the percentage that the captain can charge in terms of profit, specifies sold items that the slop chest must carry under penalty or fine."
1975.74-966,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1965.455,1974.796,"Mr. Schmidt, are you arguing that under no circumstances could the seaman consent to payment in kind?"
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2004.275,2005.841,"Absolutely, yes Your Honor."
1975.74-966,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2005.841,2007.385,Under nothing?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2007.385,2017.263,"Under the statutes enacted in 1872, Shipping Commissions Act of June 4, 1872, a seaman cannot agree."
1975.74-966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.263,2024.858,What are the U.S. code citations to the statute that you rely on?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2024.858,2034.735,Contracts are forbidden by Section 600 of Title 46.
1975.74-966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2078.801,2083.35,"Well, that does not say it does not seem to me what you said it said."
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2101.349,2115.243,No seaman shall by any agreement other than as provided by Title 53 of the revised statutes forfeit his lien upon the ship or be deprived of any remedy for the recovery of his wages to which he would otherwise have been entitled.
1975.74-966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2115.243,2123.395,"Well, that is talking about remedies for the recovery of wages not to the substantive question of whether the wages are due and owing or not?"
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2123.395,2132.687,"But Your Honor the cases have -- I can cite I believe Selman offhand, the cases have interpreted this language to me that a seaman cannot contract."
1975.74-966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2132.687,2136.706,Cases from this Court?
1975.74-966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.706,2144.292,But it does require a contract it or not that section does not answer the question where the wage is paid in this case?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2144.292,2145.623,That is true.
1975.74-966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2145.623,2153.256,"(Voice Overlap)The issue is was the wages paid -- were the wages paid by buying an airline ticket, that is the question."
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2153.256,2160.569,"I would like to invite the Court to note Section 644, rules for settlement."
1975.74-966,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2191.505,2200.232,Did you not have a coast guard official present in Saigon and a U.S. Commissioner present in San Francisco when these vouchers were signed?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2200.232,2211.044,"I think nothing -- to answer Your Honor there were two coast guards hearing officers, not hearing officers, investigating officers present at the time that the man was discharged in Saigon."
1975.74-966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2264.56,2267.625,That is a District Court case?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2267.625,2272.268,"Gonzalez was an Appellate Court case, I believe."
1975.74-966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.268,2276.543,What if the employer pays in advance to the seaman cash?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2291.459,2299.319,The usual situation of that kind would involve the seaman signing an entry in the official logbook that he had received in advance of his wages.
1975.74-966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.319,2303.736,"Well, then when they finally pay him off in San Francisco, they will deduct that advance?"
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2303.736,2304.735,That is correct.
1975.74-966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.609,2312.931,"That advance is quite alright, you say, but an advance to buy an airline ticket is not?"
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2312.931,2315.043,"Yes, that is what I am saying."
1975.74-966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.592,2328.486,That is the way to do it.
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2342.09,2343.9,And the seaman had signed it.
1975.74-966,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2349.508,2352.74,Is that advance agreement?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2352.74,2353.515,Pardon.
1975.74-966,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2353.515,2361.822,"Is he signing that an agreement because you say he cannot make an agreement, well, he did not make it in your case?"
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2361.822,2371.165,"The law permits him to obligate wages for allotments to be sent to his family, for slop chest purchases, and for wages."
1975.74-966,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2371.165,2375.667,"I thought you said he could make any agreement, from what you read?"
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2375.667,2378.854,"Well, this is provided for by statute."
1975.74-966,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2384.101,2391.051,"(Voice Overlap) statutes you read said, any agreement except those covered by revised statutes some number?"
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2391.051,2391.869,Yes.
1975.74-966,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2391.869,2395.169,"Well, does the advance in that statute?"
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2395.169,2396.789,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-966,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2402.943,2407.319,Of that revised statutes you are talking about?
1975.74-966,1,23237,eric_j_schmidt,,2407.319,2411.991,"Well, this is the number given by the amendment I think of 1915, the Seaman’s Bill?"
