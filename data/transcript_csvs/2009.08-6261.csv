2009.08-6261,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.404,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-6261, Robertson v. United States, ex rel. Watson."
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,7.254,10.106,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,42.974,43.541,Excuse me.
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,57.968,61.753,--His complaint below was that he had a plea agreement with the United States.
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,61.753,62.236,Right.
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,62.236,74.679,"And that the only lawful or constitutional way he could have been prosecuted was in an action brought by the United States; that the local statute didn't authorize a private right of action, and that the Constitution could not--"
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,74.679,79.047,He made the constitutional claim below?
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,79.047,103.763,"--He said below that -- that a private right of action was neither lawful under the local statutes nor constitutional, and the parties responded that it was; and the lower court held it is authorized by local statute; it's constitutional; in fact, this was a private right of action prosecuted by Ms. Watson on her own behalf and therefore your plea agreement fails."
2009.08-6261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,146.791,147.308,Excuse me.
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,207.516,214.17,"Well, it's important to clarify, because there is -- there is a lack of -- it is not parallel to the Federal system."
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,228.929,229.412,Excuse me.
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,233.364,234.38,--No.
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,241.22,241.72,I got you.
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,241.72,249.89,"But in the District of Columbia, only the United States Attorney prosecutes criminal offenses of the type that occurred here."
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,271.37,272.488,That did puzzle me.
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,284.796,287.498,--There is -- there is not coordinate jurisdiction.
2009.08-6261,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,412.877,420.815,"Is this law unique to the District or do other States -- I mean, the problem that they are trying to get a handle on is domestic violence."
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,438.694,444.281,I -- the -- the same procedure is a question of how that is defined.
2009.08-6261,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,457.773,487.023,"I -- I mean, however you describe it in practical terms, are there other places that say, abused person, you can initiate this and you can have your lawyer present it, whether it's on behalf of the State or -- but just the practical of how you go through the motions; are there other States that allow the victim?"
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,487.023,506.437,"--Yes, there are other -- there are other States that allow the complainant to either bring it to the attention of the court in the form of a request for an order to show cause and to actually prosecute as a private prosecutor, the way, let's say, in Young, they would have characterized a private prosecutor--"
2009.08-6261,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,506.437,526.5,"In criminal cases, because I -- I -- correct me if I am wrong, but my -- my recollection is that orders to show cause for contempt in the civil -- on the civil side occur frequently, and that allows a jail sentence in California I think of 5 days -- and this is civil, because it's coercive."
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,529.119,530.169,--I am.
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.6,577.2,"And, of course--"
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,577.2,578.3,--and who can nolle the case.
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.3,587.556,"--the States don't have the same compulsion that the Federal Government has, which arises from the separation of powers."
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,623.247,624.114,That's absolutely true.
2009.08-6261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.302,660.254,Am I right that the District has been following this procedure for quite some time?
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,660.254,661.872,Yes.
2009.08-6261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.776,682.017,"Well, where a private party initiates, the beneficiary of an order of this kind, initiates a contempt proceeding against a person who violates it, and seeks a punishment for it, not just discontinuance."
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,682.017,683.286,--Yes.
2009.08-6261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,718.959,727.898,It doesn't say to me that the plea agreement goes to the question of whether there is sort of an inherent violation of the Constitution by adopting this procedure at all.
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,727.898,730.432,--I -- I--
2009.08-6261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,730.432,736.836,I have trouble figuring out whether the plea agreement has any relevance to the kind of basic argument you are making.
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,736.836,743.34,"--Well, we actually see two arguments, and maybe that's -- that we are making, which may be part of the confusion."
2009.08-6261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,806.148,808.85,Or just to say the lower court was wrong--
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,808.85,809.783,--The lower court was wrong.
2009.08-6261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,809.783,811.066,--on that premise.
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,811.066,811.967,Well--
2009.08-6261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,811.967,829.061,"We have another option, once we say they were wrong on that premise, to send it back and let them look at the second question, which is whether or not a private party can bring an action in the name of the sovereign."
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,829.061,843.904,"--Well, I think that the second way to view it, as -- as I was going to say, is what the Solicitor General of the United States now agrees -- they thought below that it was Constitution, but they now agree that the Constitution cannot tolerate private criminal rights of action."
2009.08-6261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.904,850.26,"And if -- if that's true, they have been following an unconstitutional practice for about 25 years; is that right?"
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,850.26,852.193,I believe--
2009.08-6261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.193,855.295,And nobody thought about it in all this time?
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,855.295,860.799,"--And certainly since, you know, since they made the argument to the lower courts."
2009.08-6261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.799,865.27,"Because it is done many, many times, as I understand it, over the years."
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,865.27,886.683,"It was done many times, received -- when the original -- when the interested prosecutor decision was made, it was made on the same foundational premise as Young, which was let's look and see if we are concerned about conflict of interest."
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,894.02,895.872,This wouldn't be allowed under Young.
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,904.745,905.328,That's true.
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,906.78,909.382,So don't -- don't -- don't say that Young would have allowed it.
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,909.382,910.149,"--No, no, no, no."
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.468,971.289,Does -- does the Justice Department concede that the sovereign here is the United States?
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,973.539,974.324,--I believe--
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,974.324,984.113,--that there can't be a separate prosecutor from -- from the Assistant United States Attorney and that is the prosecutor for the District of Columbia?
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,984.113,987.232,"--I -- I don't want to speak for the Justice Department, but I do believe--"
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.232,989.001,You don't understand them to be saying that?
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,989.001,994.785,--I do believe that they -- that they concede that the -- the relevant sovereign is the United States.
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,994.785,995.47,Okay.
2009.08-6261,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,995.47,996.803,"Well, we can ask the government."
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,996.803,997.37,Yes.
2009.08-6261,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1042.784,1050.605,"Have -- have we had cases that said that Federal separation of powers principles are binding on territorial governments, for instance?"
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,1050.605,1061.346,"You know, I -- I think that the question is -- I don't think -- I disagree with the government, with Respondents that this Court has said it hasn't."
2009.08-6261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1087.58,1088.413,Is the District a territory?
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,1088.413,1089.932,"--I don't think we are a territory, no."
2009.08-6261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.948,1169.432,Could I -- I have this question.
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,1195.25,1197.118,--For criminal contempt?
2009.08-6261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.118,1197.951,Yes.
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,1197.951,1198.734,Yes.
2009.08-6261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1206.14,1216.079,"So, no, the question would be whether the lawyer for the -- the party who entered into the settlement could bring a contempt proceeding against the adversary who had violated the settlement."
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,1216.079,1217.448,--On their own behalf?
2009.08-6261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.89,1288.727,What do you think the best authority from this Court for your basic proposition is?
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,1290.044,1294.448,I think the strongest case is Gompers v. Buck's Stove.
2009.08-6261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1314.362,1317.231,You think Gompers is the best case?
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,1317.231,1318.163,"Yes, I do."
2009.08-6261,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1318.163,1331.99,"And what is your position and can you advise us -- I know it's not in your case -- if there is a plea bargain in the Southern District of New York, does it -- does bind, do you think, the prosecutor in the Eastern District?"
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,1336.442,1336.858,Right.
2009.08-6261,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1408.721,1409.504,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-6261,0,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,1409.504,1410.121,Thank you.
2009.08-6261,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1410.121,1413.756,Mr. Long.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1413.756,1417.142,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-6261,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1447.996,1461.523,"Yes, but the argument is that because a private interested party can't bring it, the party is bringing it on behalf of the United States and his plea agreement therefore is with the United States."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1461.523,1472.545,"--Well, I mean if I could, Mr. Chief Justice, there are I think several questions in the case, and some are actually no longer in dispute so that will help to simplify a very complicated matter a little bit."
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1519.21,1521.495,I -- I'm not sure I understand your point.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1526.097,1526.731,--Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1526.731,1529.833,--But the prosecuting person--
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1529.833,1530.5,Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1530.5,1535.119,--the person whose name is listed is acting for someone.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1535.119,1535.821,Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1539.439,1539.873,Exactly.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1539.873,1547.295,"And I agree, that's mostly what we have to talk about this morning, but I'm trying to bracket it with issues that are really not properly in dispute here."
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1603.299,1604.566,Can you define what you see as that issue?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1605.716,1617.289,"--That's the issue of whether a private interested party, either on their own behalf or as the representative of the sovereign, can bring a criminal contempt action."
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.289,1618.308,What do you mean?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1626.428,1626.845,Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1626.845,1633.582,--whether a private interested party can be authorized to bring the suit on behalf of the sovereign.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1633.582,1634.065,Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.284,1637.653,"I understand, but you -- you covered two things."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1642.105,1642.638,--Right.
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1642.638,1646.841,Or whether a private individual can be appointed to bring it on behalf of the sovereign.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1646.841,1647.359,Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1647.359,1651.31,And I thought it was only -- only the second of these that you say is out of the case.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1652.912,1653.978,No.
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1653.978,1654.895,No.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1654.895,1675.159,"I think -- I think the -- all they have conceded is that for purposes of this case, we are going to assume that -- well, I may have given you the wrong answer to you -- we are -- they have said over and over again, we assume, that a private interested party can bring a criminal contempt proceeding."
2009.08-6261,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1677.044,1678.828,As representative of the sovereign?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1678.828,1682.515,"--Well, I -- I think that question is fairly before the Court."
2009.08-6261,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1682.515,1693.687,"And nobody doubts -- I didn't think it was at issue that the United States, rather than operating through the Assistant U.S. Attorney, can appoint you to handle the prosecution."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1693.687,1694.155,Exactly.
2009.08-6261,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1694.155,1695.255,"And that's what they don't dispute, right?"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1695.255,1697.191,Maybe a different way of making the--
2009.08-6261,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1697.191,1698.707,"I'm sorry, that's -- they don't dispute that?"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1700.143,1700.676,--Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1700.676,1701.293,Okay.
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1701.293,1704.428,"--I'm sorry, repeat it for me."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1705.245,1718.788,"The point is, they are not disputing, and they've said over and over again they're not disputing that a private, interested individual, like Ms. Watson, the individual in this case, can bring this proceeding."
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1719.271,1720.64,--On whose behalf?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1722.007,1729.995,"--And the issue that I think is before the Court is, would that be as a representative of the United States or would that be as a private person?"
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1729.995,1731.228,--Okay.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1745.004,1745.588,Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1747.404,1752.825,"That's so -- so if we say they can act on behalf of the United States, you--"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1752.825,1753.325,Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1777.023,1795.854,"So in other words, if, in fact -- you agree or don't agree, I don't know -- but the government says and they say, the government of the United States has here -- and it can, under the Constitution, delegate to a private person the authority to prosecute."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1795.854,1796.387,Right.
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1796.387,1798.639,There is a big argument against that.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1798.639,1799.189,Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1799.189,1806.126,The argument is: This would be the one person you can't delegate it to because they are very biased.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1806.126,1806.576,Right.
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1807.078,1810.363,"And that argument, you say, is not in this case."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1810.363,1811.18,--Exactly.
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1812.732,1813.232,Okay.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1819.052,1824.088,--So let me now address the point that: Is it a constitutional requirement?
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.584,1845.035,"I don't know what you mean by ""in the interest of""?"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1857.594,1862.229,"Well, the language that the court of appeals used is in the interest of the United States."
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.998,1867.95,I don't know what that means.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1874.621,1875.223,No.
2009.08-6261,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1894.684,1896.636,Why is that even relevant?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1902.64,1904.908,"Well, I agree with you completely Justice Alito."
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1916.9,1925.238,"--It's highly relevant, I think, because I think you would you like to make the argument, which I would like to hear, is that: Forget the United States."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1931.142,1931.642,Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1931.642,1935.344,"Now, if you are right about that, the plea agreement drops out."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1935.344,1935.944,Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1935.944,1938.229,Because nobody says made a plea agreement with her.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1944.597,1949.318,"I will make the argument, although if I am wrong, I still think the plea agreement doesn't bar this prosecution."
2009.08-6261,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1950.151,1963.344,"But, well -- well, with respect, even if the Constitution permits this, if the parties understood the plea agreement to mean that this was going to be barred, then why isn't that the end of the matter?"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1963.344,1983.324,"--Well, it's what a reasonable person would have understood Justice Alito, when the plea agreement says, crosses out District of Columbia, crosses out corporation counsel, and we are now all agreed that Ms. Watson, in her own name, can bring this proceeding under a statute that authorizes it and has for 20 years--"
2009.08-6261,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1983.324,1993.264,"And I suppose the argument could be that the -- that the government has no authority under D.C. law to enter into such an agreement, as well require these two--"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1993.264,1996.716,"--Well, that's -- now we are getting into statutory issues, Justice Alito."
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2018.945,2020.414,"Gee, I have really lost you."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2024.066,2026.985,"--The issue is, it's a matter of D.C. statute."
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2031.47,2032.055,"Well, okay."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2048.165,2049.517,"Yes, and let me make that argument."
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.517,2050.234,"And that's perfectly okay, right?"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2050.234,2052.469,If -- if that is a constitutional requirement.
2009.08-6261,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2077.684,2087.976,"Well, one way you can find it in the Constitution is that we have built a body of law about the obligation of people bringing prosecutions that wouldn't fit within your situation."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2091.094,2100.95,"--Well, if you will bear with me, I think the Constitution does answer questions like the Brady question, but it's not the penumbras and emanations of words like crimes."
2009.08-6261,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2101.984,2105.569,What are the Brady obligations of your client?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2105.569,2131.653,"--Well, I -- I think because the way -- the way this Court has defined criminal contempt does not look to the interest of the party versus the interest of the sovereign; in fact, the Court has said over and over again in Bagwell and Hicks and other cases that in all criminal contempt cases, civil and criminal, to some extent the interest of the sovereign is that--"
2009.08-6261,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2131.653,2134.521,What -- what are the Brady obligations of your client?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2134.521,2146.329,"--Due process says this is a criminal proceeding, Your Honor, if I can explain in a minute, and therefore, all the due process rights of a -- for a petty criminal offense apply."
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2147.515,2154.501,--So your client has to provide the -- her husband a lawyer?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2159.488,2163.857,--D.C. courts do provide lawyers if the -- to the defendant.
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2174.082,2176.098,I don't know if you have answered the Chief's question.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2183.688,2186.306,--They -- they come from the Due Process Clause.
2009.08-6261,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2203.517,2204.734,But can we get to the Brady?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2211.171,2211.671,--Right.
2009.08-6261,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2211.671,2218.444,Does that person have a -- a right to look at all the government files to see if there is any exonerating evidence?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2218.444,2218.994,Well--
2009.08-6261,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2218.994,2219.961,"I mean, how does it work?"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2220.979,2232.519,"--This is a determinate sentence, so under this Court's cases, without regard to whether the government's interests are -- take precedence over the private interests, it's criminal."
2009.08-6261,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2235.988,2237.005,But how does it work?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2245.778,2246.978,"--Well, right."
2009.08-6261,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2246.978,2247.796,--and that the prosecutor has?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2249.38,2253.8,In this case the court said that the Brady rights did apply.
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2264.823,2265.342,What do we do about that?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2270.127,2271.079,--Well--
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2271.079,2272.845,--without thinking about the one you don't.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2272.845,2273.947,--Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2273.947,2276.33,"And the reasons, as I have categorized this -- the--"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2276.33,2277.649,There are -- it may be that this is the wrong case.
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2277.649,2278.615,--So what do -- so what do we do?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2284.553,2285.203,Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2285.203,2285.838,"I mean, private--"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2285.838,2286.905,Well--
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2286.905,2295.611,"--vengeance is out and justice is in, and we have 3,000 years of that, and they are all going to be variations of that theme and we could think of 100 arguments."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2297.896,2298.513,--Well--
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2298.513,2304.3,"Well, before I can answer that question, I would like to know whether the government could appoint the private person."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2316.857,2317.507,--Well--
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2317.507,2326.38,How do I get my -- how do I begin to answer these questions bound together in my mind in some partial way?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2326.38,2330.95,"--Well, part -- part of the answer is, of course, that the court exercises control."
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2349.012,2350.296,But you want to do that.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2363.355,2372.027,"No, but -- but you know, D.C. tried for over a decade to do this with public prosecutors, and there just were not enough resources."
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.027,2374.996,Some problems have no answers.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2377.046,2378.681,--Well -- there may--
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2378.681,2388.554,Do you think that Congress could -- could set up a private organization to expend Federal funds -- we are going to abolish the Department of Education.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2397.726,2405.598,"--Well, but there is a long, long tradition of having private individuals undertake prosecutions of crimes."
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.784,2408.117,On -- on behalf of--
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2408.117,2409.234,--On behalf of.
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2409.234,2410.986,--on behalf of the executive.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2418.592,2419.308,"Well, but--"
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.308,2441.438,"And just as the executive power includes the power to expend funds appropriated by Congress, so also the executive power except in the -- in the instance of necessity acknowledged by Young, which I think was wrongly decided anyway -- except in that one narrow instance, the -- the power to prosecute belongs to the executive."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2441.438,2444.29,"--But -- but Justice Scalia, we are dealing with the District of Columbia."
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2449.861,2450.427,All right.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2468.172,2469.455,"Well -- and again, there is abundant historical precedent for that."
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2469.455,2471.624,"Yes, there was, before -- before Aeschylus."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2476.945,2477.561,"Well, if--"
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2477.561,2483.515,"--to have a statute that all criminal prosecutions would be brought by victims, period?"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2483.515,2491.352,"--Well, I think there would be today serious due process problems to work through with that sort of system."
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2491.352,2491.887,All right.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2494.004,2499.958,"Well, I would also say the Framers would have understood that to be a perfectly normal system."
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2508.314,2509.314,"Oh, I don't think that's right."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2515.134,2528.293,"Well, I mean there -- that issue is debated in the briefs and I think it was less common in the colonies in the United States than it was in Britain, but certainly wouldn't have been regarded as -- as unconstitutional."
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2545.005,2547.874,--I'm not sure why -- how we can avoid it.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2547.874,2552.743,"--Well, you could wait for a case that presents it -- that properly presents it, where it can be decided--"
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2552.743,2566.503,"Well, this case properly presents the argument that a private party can't bring a criminal prosecution on their -- in their own -- perhaps their own name, they can, but on their own, in their own interest."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2569.454,2570.504,--Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2575.874,2581.595,"You are saying the answer to that is, no, they can bring a claim in their own name?"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2581.595,2583.464,"--Yes, we -- we are arguing two things."
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2596.922,2597.438,"No, no."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2603.176,2604.961,"--Yes, absolutely."
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2604.961,2606.428,And you are saying it can.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2606.428,2607.162,Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2607.162,2609.446,Answer why.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2609.446,2613.666,Because the D.C. Council said they could do it.
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2666.034,2668.284,You might -- you might -- you might say this.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2708.878,2720.169,"--Well, you know, I think that would be an unfortunate result in the sense that, you know, the plea agreement in our view doesn't prevent this prosecution on any reasonable interpretation."
2009.08-6261,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2753.474,2761.43,"Well, unless you think it's a violation of due process for an interested party to be able to criminally prosecute someone at their -- at their discretion."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2761.43,2762.796,"Well, and that -- and, you know--"
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2762.796,2765.282,You want to plea bargain with a -- with an interested party?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2765.282,2772.553,"--Well, but Mr. Chief Justice and Justice Scalia, I mean, this is a system that is in all the States."
2009.08-6261,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2779.641,2782.926,Criminal -- criminal contempt prosecution or civil contempt prosecution?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2782.926,2784.028,"--Well -- well, but -- yes."
2009.08-6261,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2791.599,2793.051,Those are in every state?
2009.08-6261,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2793.051,2801.305,"Well, there can be order to show cause, but you are saying that every state allows a private person to have a criminal prosecution for criminal contempt?"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2801.305,2809.227,"Well, the -- the amicus briefs at -- 19 allow -- at this point, 19 allow you to file a motion."
2009.08-6261,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2813.547,2815.697,"Well, a -- a motion is different."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2815.697,2816.416,--Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2816.416,2825.855,"Then the courts decide -- then the court decides based on the position of the defendant, of the person who is charged with contempt--"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2825.855,2826.488,Yes.
2009.08-6261,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2826.488,2827.305,--whether or not to proceed.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2830.224,2831.676,"Absolutely, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2873.686,2875.019,"Oh, well, that's a different matter."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2875.019,2876.055,--No.
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2876.955,2878.088,That's -- that's -- why isn't it a different matter?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2878.088,2880.007,"I mean, that's what -- that's what happened in this case."
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2885.727,2889.513,"Okay, so now you are into the question of what counts as a prosecution."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2889.513,2891.731,"Yes, yes."
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2891.731,2892.565,"And there again, I am at sea."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2893.749,2895.566,"Well, if I could -- if I can just do it step by step."
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.827,2964.263,Is that the situation here in D.C.?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2971.417,2974.701,"--Well, you know, we have no record on any of this, Justice Scalia, because it was not--"
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.701,2976.57,How do you understand -- how does the statute read?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2988.628,2997.484,"--The way the statute and the court rules read is you file a motion, not an indictment or an information, a motion to hold the person in contempt."
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3008.375,3013.427,--A hearing on whether she can prosecute or a hearing on -- on whether he's going to be guilty or not.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3013.427,3020.849,"--You know, I am very uncomfortable to spend -- I have gone and observed one of these and I've talked to one of the judges, but none of this is in the record, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-6261,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3032.99,3038.744,"But can your private prosecutor, however you want to describe her, could she enter into a plea agreement with the defendant?"
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3038.744,3042.013,"--Well, they can -- they can agree to withdraw."
2009.08-6261,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3042.013,3048.667,"No, she said you could be subject to you 180 days; I will agree, and you'll plead guilty to 30 days."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3048.667,3051.635,"Again, none of this is in the record."
2009.08-6261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3058.724,3062.342,"Or pay $1,000 to your victim, which is me."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3062.342,3070.865,"--Well, you know, I have no information about whether that sort of thing happens or how the Court would treat it."
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3079.221,3079.854,I accept that--
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3079.854,3081.354,--And the details matter.
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3084.856,3091.962,"But a specific country -- this is the point Justice Scalia was making -- the rest of the country, it's a state system."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3091.962,3093.898,"--Well, but -- but D.C., Your Honor--"
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3093.898,3094.664,And -- and there--
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3094.664,3096.932,--is like a state in the sense that separation of powers--
2009.08-6261,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3096.932,3099.215,"--Well, but that's -- that's the question."
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3119.427,3121.779,--If you look at them -- if you look at this Court's decision in Palmore.
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3136.289,3138.74,--Is there somewhere I can look to see what happens?
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3165.325,3167.593,You mean the relief for contempt?
2009.08-6261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3167.593,3168.477,It doesn't say that.
2009.08-6261,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3190.723,3207.685,"Well, I think -- I think the honest answer is, Justice Breyer, you can find some of these things by looking around, but since we've been talking about issues that were not properly litigated and not decided and we do not have a well-developed record, some of these things are just not going to be available."
2009.08-6261,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3224.544,3226.229,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3242.406,3244.441,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-6261,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3280.031,3283.333,Whose state power was she acting on behalf of?
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3283.333,3302.312,"--The way we understand this, Justice Sotomayor, is that Respondent was exercising sovereign power on behalf of the Article I court, the D.C. court, which of course is partly a local court, but is exercising power whose initial source, original source, is Congress."
2009.08-6261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3311.918,3315.037,Courts don't have the power to incarcerate people.
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3323.326,3326.778,"I -- I don't believe that is the case, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-6261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3346.425,3353.495,But nobody asserted in Young that the prosecutor appointed by the court was only exercising the power of the court.
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3370.207,3375.945,"--Well, the court is surely part of the government, and in the end this is power of the United States."
2009.08-6261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3388.002,3394.656,Then why doesn't an agreement by the United States not to prosecute carry the day?
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3394.656,3398.608,"Yes, so this goes to the second question, in which I think Respondent is right."
2009.08-6261,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3422.657,3424.258,That's -- that's absolutely startling.
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3434.881,3439.185,The United States Government is a complicated place and the fact that--
2009.08-6261,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3439.185,3440.535,I take your word for it.
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3441.47,3451.326,"--and the fact that the Southern District of New York agrees to do one thing does not bind, for example, the INS, does not bind the--"
2009.08-6261,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3451.326,3455.647,"Maybe or maybe not, but surely it binds the New Jersey U.S. Attorney."
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3471.072,3485.166,"--Assuming that the U.S. Attorney in the second office has jurisdiction and assuming that the plea agreement does not say anything to suggest that it should be read more broadly, I think the answer is yes."
2009.08-6261,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3485.166,3487.199,"Well, how do you get -- I mean, you are a defendant."
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3493.67,3500.676,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, even if you are right I think that we prevail."
2009.08-6261,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3519.82,3520.437,It can't do that.
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3527.743,3544.37,"Well, the U.S. Attorney in New York could -- presumably that U.S. Attorney will know who else might have jurisdiction over the underlying conduct and would go and get an agreement from those other U.S. attorneys."
2009.08-6261,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3553.393,3562.332,But do I understand your position that in this particular case the U.S. Attorney could have entered into a settlement agreement that would have bound the Respondent?
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3562.332,3566.301,"--We actually don't think that that's right, Justice Stevens."
2009.08-6261,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3582.746,3586.964,You draw a distinction between the D.C. Circuit -- the D.C. and the United States?
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3586.964,3587.681,--Yes.
2009.08-6261,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3594.637,3599.755,"But you would agree, I take it, that the attorney for the District of Columbia could have bound Respondent?"
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3606.093,3613.515,--I think only the D.C. court could have prevented Respondent from going forward.
2009.08-6261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3614.832,3625.49,"And I have to agree with you that to accept this argument that the prosecutor here is an agent just of the court, just of the D.C. court, not an agent of the executive?"
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3625.49,3634.095,"--If -- who would you like the person be an agent of, Justice Scalia?"
2009.08-6261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3634.895,3637.047,"Well, I'm not making the argument."
2009.08-6261,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3637.047,3638.014,Usually we have questions the other way.
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3638.014,3640.332,I apologize.
2009.08-6261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3640.332,3647.522,I don't know that courts have ever asserted that they themselves have the power to prosecute.
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3647.522,3659.228,"Well, I do think that that's the situation that we find in Young, where a court appoints a person to prosecute a contempt on behalf of the court."
2009.08-6261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3659.228,3661.046,Not on behalf of the court.
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3680.243,3686.647,"Well, I do think Young is different, Justice Scalia, because Young was a separation of powers case."
2009.08-6261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3701.323,3706.726,Isn't it the case that only the U.S. Attorney can prosecute for this crime?
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3715.23,3718.368,"--Justice Scalia, I don't believe that is entirely clear."
2009.08-6261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3728.64,3731.859,"Because it's all up to the court; the court's the big prosecutor, right?"
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3731.859,3735.294,"Well, just as -- I know you dissented in Young, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-6261,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3747.286,3759.243,"Well, if there were a finding of innocent, or not guilty, by this prosecutor, could the official prosecutor then prosecute again, or would there be double jeopardy?"
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3766.015,3773.503,"--Well, this Court held in Dixon that the double jeopardy clause does apply, because they're all exercising power--"
2009.08-6261,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3773.503,3775.538,"Well, but that was the same authority."
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3775.538,3779.507,"--Yes, and they all are exercising power from the United States."
2009.08-6261,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3781.692,3785.727,"So you don't think this is a Bartkiss-like case, like Bartkiss v. Illinois?"
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3785.727,3790.98,"I -- I am not familiar with that case, Justice Kennedy, but I do think that the double jeopardy clause--"
2009.08-6261,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3790.98,3795.118,That a State prosecution doesn't bar a later Federal prosecution.
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3795.118,3802.688,"--Yes, that's exactly right, because ultimately all of these power are exercising power that comes from the same source, which is the United States Government."
2009.08-6261,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3802.688,3824.202,"Is your argument the broad argument that the Chief Justice was talking about, that we have a man who drives in a car from Baltimore to rob a bank in Washington and the U.S. Attorney in Washington gives him a piece of paper which says, I will not prosecute you for this now or in the future, and suddenly the U.S. Attorney in Baltimore prosecutes it."
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3828.422,3829.656,"Well, under several--"
2009.08-6261,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3829.656,3831.057,Or are you making a narrow argument?
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3831.057,3832.274,--Under several circuits' law--
2009.08-6261,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3832.274,3834.409,"Well, I'm just asking you your position on that."
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3844.665,3847.234,--I have a principal position and I have a back-up position.
2009.08-6261,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3854.323,3855.04,It does bar?
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3855.04,3855.773,--It does.
2009.08-6261,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3864.263,3870.517,"Counsel, could I ask you could a 1983 or I guess Bivens action be brought against Ms. Watson?"
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3878.688,3882.724,"Mr. Chief Justice, I have not thought about that question."
2009.08-6261,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3892.965,3893.515,She's a State actor.
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3901.721,3907.375,She -- it is absolutely right that she is a State actor for constitutional purposes.
2009.08-6261,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3914.611,3916.061,"Yes, briefly."
2009.08-6261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3916.061,3944.565,"Justice Breyer's question, the Chief Justice's question: Even circuits that apply a default rule whereby the government is the entire government and there needs to be limiting things in the agreement, I think if you look at this agreement you will find those limiting things, both in the cross-outs in the caption and in the particular promises that the United States Government has made, which applies really only to the United States Attorney's Office."
2009.08-6261,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3945.548,3946.183,"Thank you, General."
2009.08-6261,3,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,3948.567,3951.57,Thank you.
2009.08-6261,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4005.455,4020.381,Can I ask you this: The District of Columbia Court of Appeals said we are satisfied that no objectively reasonable person could understand that Mr. Robertson's plea agreement bound Ms. Watson and precluded her contempt proceeding against Mr. Robertson.
2009.08-6261,3,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,4024.917,4029.587,If you -- yes.
2009.08-6261,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4033.689,4034.974,And did you preserve that?
2009.08-6261,3,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,4051.75,4064.244,We absolutely raise that because our argument from -- from the very beginning was she can't constitutionally be representing herself in this proceeding.
2009.08-6261,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4081.352,4082.554,But that's a separate question.
2009.08-6261,3,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,4087.256,4099.647,"--Yes, and at the time that we signed the plea agreement, there was no precedent for the notion of a private person bringing a criminal action in her own name, interest and on her own behalf."
2009.08-6261,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4108.153,4131.202,"Just so I understand what is before us, you preserve -- you saying -- you are saying you preserve the issue that even if your client fully understood that this plea agreement had no application to a criminal contempt proceeding, he preserved the argument that he could contest the criminal contempt proceeding on the ground that it would be unconstitutional?"
2009.08-6261,3,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,4131.202,4132.887,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-6261,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4148.864,4149.53,"No, I understand that."
2009.08-6261,3,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,4162.489,4168.06,--Even if he gave up the right of a private person to prosecute on her own behalf?
2009.08-6261,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4168.76,4176.297,"Even if he didn't get that -- a bar to that under the plea agreement, the contempt proceeding would still be barred for some other reason?"
2009.08-6261,3,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,4177.583,4184.57,"--I am not sure that I can answer that we did, because I am not sure that I -- I understand the question."
2009.08-6261,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4203.233,4215.208,"You did raise, undoubtedly you say, the point that the only way in which she could be the prosecutor was as an agent of the United States?"
2009.08-6261,3,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,4215.208,4215.808,Absolutely.
2009.08-6261,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4215.808,4219.826,And that it was unconstitutional for her to -- to represent herself.
2009.08-6261,3,30279,jaclyn_s_frankfurt,,4219.826,4220.543,Absolutely.
2009.08-6261,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4245.81,4246.61,"Thank you, counsel."
