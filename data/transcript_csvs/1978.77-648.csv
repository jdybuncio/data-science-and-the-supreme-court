1978.77-648,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,61.012,We'll hear arguments next in Federal Emergency Regulatory Commission against Pennzoil and others.
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,81.506,87.299,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-648,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,400.303,405.148,"In the abstract, these figures really aren't very meaningful, are they?"
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,405.148,407.032,"Well, we think they are."
1978.77-648,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,407.032,409.13,As compared with what?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,412.492,423.547,"Well, if the standard is whether -- if the standard is that in order to obtain special relief from a commission rate, you have to show that you're cost would exceed your revenues."
1978.77-648,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,423.547,425.168,Which is your hardship case?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,425.168,426.539,"Well, if you like, yes."
1978.77-648,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,431.089,434.096,"Well, you didn't define what kind of a profit that was."
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,439.769,443.079,"Well, after all costs that Shell showed here."
1978.77-648,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,451.206,459.796,And does the record show what their profit would have been if the decision of the Commission was correct?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,459.796,477.536,"No, it does not, Your Honor, except that one can figure that out by adding the incremental royalties to the -- to what the Administrative Lawyer Judge found that their profit would be without it."
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,521.232,525.923,"Mr. Barnett, did they actually take the position that they had no jurisdiction to consider them?"
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,525.923,528.128,The Commission never said it had no jurisdiction.
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,533.116,534.625,Which is pretty much the same thing?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,534.625,538.69,I don't think it is because the Commission did consider the question.
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,593.002,597.268,It decided that it simply could not consider this fact?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,597.268,599.202,It considered this case and --
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,599.202,604.318,You see I considered the case but it could not consider this particular fact?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,604.318,605.872,With particular factor.
1978.77-648,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,644.642,651.976,So you're saying that the Commission decided that it would violate the Act for them to grant relief in this case?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,651.976,668.906,"Yes, the Commission decided that it would violate the Act as interpreted by this Court in the Texaco case for it to grant relief in this case or in any similar case where special relief is sought based on incremental royalties based on the unregulated market price."
1978.77-648,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.906,674.479,Is that the position the Commission took in the Court of Appeals?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,674.479,681.055,"I am not familiar with the Commission's brief in the Court of Appeals, Your Honor so I cannot answer that question."
1978.77-648,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.837,692.747,Do you think the Commission adequately states the reasons for its decision in its opinion?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,692.747,693.638,I think it does.
1978.77-648,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,694.071,701.259,Are there ordinary administrative practices of explaining clearly enough what the grounds for the decision were?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,701.259,707.247,I think it does as in the previous case if I were writing the Commission's opinion just as if I were writing the Act of Congress.
1978.77-648,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.886,746.745,"So that if someone comes in and just says, I'm now having to pay more for my gas than I used to and I want a rate adjustment."
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,751.406,751.543,Oh!
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,770.481,777.154,That is simply a factor which the Commission will not take into consideration in deciding whether a higher rate should be granted.
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,777.154,782.618,"No, no, the Commission took it into consideration here and decided that under the Act it may not grant a higher --"
1978.77-648,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.618,784.713,"Well, so they have no power to grant it?"
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,784.713,785.979,They have no power to grant it?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,785.979,788.64,"Well, the Commission decided here that it have no power."
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,790.518,791.779,That's all I asked you.
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,791.779,800.669,"Well, yes but the point is that as respondents present the case that's simply a procedural matter and the Commission here has refused even to consider anything."
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,814.547,824.826,We've had two or three cases here in the short time I've been on the Court coming from the predecessor of the FERC where the Commission started out taking the position.
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,837.767,842.595,"Well, that's true but in this case, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the Commission never said it lack jurisdiction."
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,847.073,848.766,It's just a legal decision?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,848.766,850.307,"Yes, that it simply a legal decision."
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,859.875,864.501,"Well, has the Commission always taken this position or not?"
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,864.501,865.706,Always in this case?
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,865.706,866.335,No.
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,867.69,871.865,"Well, this was the first case presented to it that presented this issue, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-648,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,871.865,873.852,You mean about an independent producer?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,873.852,883.55,About a -- about a royalty based on market value royalty which was interpreted to refer to the unregulated intrastate market.
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,883.55,887.229,What about the cases that depends -- refers to the pipeline cases?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,887.229,887.372,Oh!
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,891.195,892.624,"Well, I was."
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,893.669,894.798,Yes.
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.635,904.298,But the same section?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,904.298,922.775,"Well, it's the same section except that the section that provides Section 2.66 of the Commission's regulations does provide as Pennzoil states that pipelines as well as independent producers are subject to the applicable ceiling price."
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,980.194,981.728,"Yes, but that was an individual case."
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,986.661,989.034,"I think so, Your Honor."
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,989.034,990.512,"Now, what's the difference between that case and this?"
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,990.512,999.823,"Well, I think the difference between that case and this case is that that is a special case involving jurisdictional purchases of gas to how else are you going to treat that?"
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,999.823,1001.17,Non-jurisdictional purchase.
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,1001.17,1001.62,I'm sorry.
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1002.678,1004.615,"Well, this is non-jurisdiction here too."
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,1004.615,1006.849,"That's right, the royalties are non-jurisdictional too."
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1007.152,1008.186,And what's the difference?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,1008.186,1020.839,"Well, we think the Commission was justified and thinking that there is a difference because if you allow the past through of non-jurisdictional market value royalty rates, market value royalties being so common."
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1032.513,1034.897,But you're still construing the same section of the statute.
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,1034.897,1058.069,"You're still construing the same statute but the Commission could make the decision that if it granted a relief and the market value royalty cases, it would be undermining the entire regulatory scheme as this Court pointed out in Texaco which was another case where a whole regulatory scheme would be undermined and there is no such effect in an individual case of non-jurisdictional purchases such as Columbia."
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1058.069,1062.865,So I take it that the Commission didn't agree with the Administrative Law Judge?
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,1062.865,1069.368,The Commission did not address itself to the Administrative Law Judge's holding that this case turned --
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1069.368,1076.691,Because the Administrative Law Judge sought that the Commission had legal power under the statute that the Commission said it didn't have.
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,1076.691,1080.759,The Administrative Law Judge really address the question the Commission addressed either.
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1090.838,1092.966,"It said -- it said, we can't get there?"
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,1096.078,1100.237,"Well, it said that under the Act it would be illegal for us to grant relief in this case."
1978.77-648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1123.404,1131.281,"Then they would -- then suddenly, it would be legal to recognize the extra royalty cost there?"
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,1131.281,1132.35,"Well, yes it might be."
1978.77-648,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1520.97,1522.919,"Mr. Barnett, before you sit down."
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,1522.919,1524.117,Sure.
1978.77-648,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1524.117,1528.154,Your reply brief filed yesterday which is at my desk just this morning.
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,1528.154,1535.63,I'm sorry Mr. Justice Blackmun we filed that in typescript with the permission of the clerk last Wednesday.
1978.77-648,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1536.831,1557.041,"I'm not being critical, I knew they would like to have you make one or two sentence comment on the effect of the 78 Act because it seems to me that the new Act makes the underlying rational of Texaco almost inapplicable from here on end."
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,1557.041,1558.911,"Well, we don't' think --"
1978.77-648,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1558.911,1565.613,I was just trying to downplay it in your brief but maybe I should ask this question in closing counsel but at least I'd like some comment from you.
1978.77-648,0,17330,barnett,,1565.613,1567.2,"Well, we don't try to downplay it."
1978.77-648,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1627.656,1629.731,Mr. Stevens.
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,1629.731,1632.639,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-648,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.415,1716.481,"Well, I know but that's an ambiguous term too, I supposed."
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,1716.481,1718.061,"Jurisdiction, if you will Your Honor."
1978.77-648,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1718.061,1722.277,"Well, there's no word about jurisdiction in this opinion."
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,1722.277,1723.584,I agree and that's why we --
1978.77-648,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.584,1728.074,And there isn't in the Court of Appeals didn't refer to it as jurisdiction?
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,1728.074,1728.343,"No, sir."
1978.77-648,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.718,1736.572,"And you could sensibly call it a matter of authority if the question was, is it legal under the Act?"
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,1736.572,1737.775,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-648,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.775,1746.733,But suppose to do what the Commission was asked to do was illegal under the Act you could say that they had no authority to grant it.
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,1746.733,1748.862,That's the word I would use.
1978.77-648,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1848.728,1854.31,"I believe that we don't use it if we get the typewritten copy, once the --"
1978.77-648,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.31,1857.78,"Well, what's the argument made by the plaintiff?"
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,1857.78,1868.231,That is that the Commission based its holding on the record to the effect that this settlement royalty was based on intrastate rates.
1978.77-648,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1889.616,1901.289,"Well, but do you suggest that what the Government argues here in its reply brief or elsewhere does not agree with what the Commission itself found in its opinion?"
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,1901.289,1901.984,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-648,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.266,1908.142,"So, you're saying that they want affirmance on the ground different from what?"
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,1908.142,1910.964,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-648,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1914.564,1916.596,Why would you --
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,1916.596,1917.03,Your Honor?
1978.77-648,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1917.03,1925.609,Would you follow that by saying we can't reach the ground not considering the Commission?
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,1930.854,1946.039,"Well, Your Honor, I'm certainly aware that this Court has held that it would be improper to -- in the Burlington Trucking line -- Trucking case to affirm lower a Commission decision based on post talk rationalization."
1978.77-648,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.724,2057.205,"The Commission itself found that the, I think that this is an accurate quote that the Commission found that the impetus of the settlement is the market value of the royalties and no consideration has been given to regulative rates."
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,2066.451,2081.543,"Your Honor, certainly, we agree that the impetus of the litigation and the impetus of the settlement and the impetus of our application for relief was the litigation that was requesting market value be based on intrastate or other process."
1978.77-648,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2220.19,2223.308,Do you think that Columbia cases consistent with Texaco?
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,2226.524,2229.267,"Yes, sir, I do."
1978.77-648,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2229.267,2236.738,Although there the request was based on an unregulated rate or unregulated cost.
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,2236.738,2237.04,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-648,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.287,2240.064,In the market price?
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,2240.064,2240.832,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-648,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.96,2249.307,Right.
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,2249.307,2254.715,And they did over the small producers in Texaco.
1978.77-648,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2260.005,2270.361,They didn't have any -- they didn't have any jurisdiction over the prices that were being charged in unregulated market.
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,2276.503,2277.547,That's right.
1978.77-648,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2485.229,2490.098,"And you think the Commission has required to grant you, your client the relief you asked?"
1978.77-648,1,33119,jeron_stevens,,2490.098,2490.373,"No, sir."
1978.77-648,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2523.506,2526.512,Mr. Johnson.
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2526.512,2529.608,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2578.742,2582.605,The sentence starts out as such.
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2586.615,2588.843,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2623.491,2627.423,"Well, that's still the very language of the Commission used in the same paragraph."
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2627.423,2643.423,"Yes, Your Honor, it is and I believe what it says is that the Commission did not reach the issue of whether the increase royalty cost would result in a ceiling rate being imposed on Shell and Pennzoil which is consistent toward."
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.999,2914.494,"Let me ask you, sir."
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2970.844,2973.62,"Mr. Justice White, I'd like to answer that question in three ways."
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2978.946,2979.733,Yes.
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2979.733,2984.491,And we believe that is one of the issues in this case which the Commission refused to consider.
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2984.491,2984.833,Yes.
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,2984.833,2997.851,"Secondly, in the Permian case, part of the reason why this Court affirmed the area rate was the exception which the Commission said it would grant in special cases like this case."
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3072.505,3085.53,"My question was, would it be contrary to the Act for the Commission to have the rule that I posited and you said, up to now it hasn't, it doesn't seem to have that rule that's all you said so far."
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,3099.032,3107.086,"Your Honor, again, I would refer to the Permian case and as I read Permian, that was one of the basis that this Court utilize in affirming --"
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3107.086,3110.94,So your position is that it would be contrary to the Act?
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,3110.94,3116.506,I think it would be contrary the Act if the Commission in so doing imposed a confiscatory rate.
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3132.689,3142.316,"Well, would you be satisfied in this case if the Commission said that we'll grant you relief when and if you show that it is confiscatory?"
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,3142.316,3143.921,"Your Honor, what we're asking for in this case --"
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.921,3145.146,That isn't all you're asking.
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,3145.146,3145.842,-- is the precise --
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3145.842,3148.07,That isn't all you're asking.
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,3148.07,3149.501,"Well, --"
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3149.501,3163.93,You're asking them to -- in any event that they must or at least they got the authority to re-determine the just and reasonableness of a rate base on new royalty cost in any case whether it's confiscatory or not.
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,3164.843,3168.116,"Your Honor, I think if I could restate our position."
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3205.635,3220.318,You'd be satisfied then if the only thing that were left open on remand is whether or not the result would be confiscation if your request is not --
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,3220.318,3225.135,"Your Honor, I think the answer to that would not be satisfied."
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3225.135,3227.042,"You wanted more than that, I would think --"
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,3227.042,3231.362,"Yes, Your Honor, I think what we want is a fair trial on the merits and that's what we're asking."
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3231.362,3235.385,And the merits are more than just the question of confiscation?
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,3235.385,3241.542,"Yes, I think the merits also go to the question if whether royalty cost is reasonable and prudently incurred."
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3241.542,3241.707,Right.
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,3241.707,3242.017,This is the --
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3242.017,3242.02,So you don't --
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,3242.02,3246.602,-- the historic test which the Commission is utilized and determined why the costs are granted.
1978.77-648,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3246.602,3248.528,Confiscation item that you want.
1978.77-648,2,42876,thomas_g_johnson,,3248.528,3249.227,That is correct.
1978.77-648,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3440.418,3442.459,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Barnett?"
1978.77-648,3,17330,barnett,,3442.459,3445.683,"Just a couple of brief points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-648,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3531.153,3539.911,"In your view, the language of Mobil, I think it was being in bind does not occur until the rates are confiscatory."
1978.77-648,3,17330,barnett,,3539.911,3550.028,"Yes, we would interpret it that way and we would rely on the reference to Permian which did precisely interpret the relief provision that way."
1978.77-648,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3610.016,3614.912,"Mr. Barnett, what was the connection between 78 cents and the intrastate market price?"
1978.77-648,3,17330,barnett,,3614.912,3617.949,The record does not disclose what the connection was Mr. Justice.
1978.77-648,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3617.949,3620.696,But it was 150% of the regulated rate?
1978.77-648,3,17330,barnett,,3620.696,3623.397,The alternative to the 78 cents -- Oh!
1978.77-648,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3623.632,3624.866,78 cents was.
1978.77-648,3,17330,barnett,,3624.866,3625.306,The --
1978.77-648,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3625.306,3625.39,You mean 150%
1978.77-648,3,17330,barnett,,3625.39,3631.409,The 78 cents was in fact a 150% of the regulated rate for small producers.
1978.77-648,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3631.409,3635.226,This evidence are based on the regulated price?
1978.77-648,3,17330,barnett,,3635.226,3636.045,"Well, --"
1978.77-648,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3636.045,3638.938,And it had no relationship as I understand you to the unregulated price?
1978.77-648,3,17330,barnett,,3638.938,3646.708,"Well, it may well have if the unregulated price was about -- the claim was about 140 or 150 or 78 cents may well have been thought to be about half of it."
1978.77-648,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3647.325,3650.541,There is no evidence that they did that and the recent testimony not in the appendix is --
1978.77-648,3,17330,barnett,,3650.541,3651.218,"Yes, but --"
1978.77-648,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3651.218,3652.677,-- that it was based on the regulated rate.
1978.77-648,3,17330,barnett,,3652.677,3654.864,"Well, so my colleague says but we would submit --"
1978.77-648,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3654.864,3656.11,You disagree with that?
1978.77-648,3,17330,barnett,,3656.11,3657.94,"I haven't seen it, I certainly wouldn't challenge it."
1978.77-648,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3657.94,3661.476,But is there any evidence in the record that it was based on the intrastate?
1978.77-648,3,17330,barnett,,3661.476,3675.493,"Well, there's less – Yes, for example, 855 testimony of Mr. Smith for United Gas Pipeline Company, who says the 78 cents price is very -- which I feel is very reasonable in light of today's market prices."
1978.77-648,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3691.108,3693.348,But others wouldn't hurt?
1978.77-648,3,17330,barnett,,3693.348,3693.759,Yes.
1978.77-648,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3710.96,3711.593,Thank you gentlemen.
