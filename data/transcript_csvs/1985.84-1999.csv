1985.84-1999,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.25,"We will hear arguments next in Local Number 93 International Association of Firefighters, against City of Cleveland."
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,38.605,59.109,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, petitioner here questions whether or not the District Court below is empowered by the Congress of these United States to award quota relief and promotions to a class of persons none of whom had ever been shown to be specific victims of any past promotional discriminatory practices of the City of Cleveland."
1985.84-1999,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,271.84,273.089,And who consented?
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,273.089,280.365,"The consent, Mr. Chief Justice, was entered by the City of Cleveland and the minority firefighters, being the Vanguards."
1985.84-1999,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,285.929,294.855,Would an individual member of the union have had the veto power under your theory?
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,294.855,296.537,"Sir, not really veto power."
1985.84-1999,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,339.754,343.597,Would you answer my question.
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,350.189,362.468,"Yes, he would have been able to... had he not sought intervention, I am assuming your question has within it, Mr. Justice."
1985.84-1999,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,362.468,365.32,Even if he had intervened.
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,365.32,367.032,"If he had intervened, no, he would not."
1985.84-1999,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,372.656,381.962,Would you explain how the union is bound by the consent decree since it didn't consent?
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,381.962,392.697,"It is bound by the consent decree... first of all, any state or collateral attack... for example, there was a collective bargaining agreement in this that is recited, and I have lodged that just recently with this Court."
1985.84-1999,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,409.058,416.024,What if the union had consented to the decree?
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,420.435,445.222,"Then I believe that you still must look at the fact... well, that would be a more close situation to the Weber matter, Your Honor, and in that situation you have full, really full representation, and you have really full consent, ergo the minority firefighters negotiated and consented, the City of Cleveland negotiated and consented, and Local 93 would have negotiated and consented."
1985.84-1999,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,450.247,453.257,Would it have been valid had the union consented to it?
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,455.01,455.968,Yes.
1985.84-1999,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,455.968,464.714,Even as against those members who voted against confirming the consent decree?
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,464.714,475.542,"In all honesty, Mr. Justice White, I would certainly think that if a union president were to affix his signature there in the face of a 90 percent rejection--"
1985.84-1999,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,475.542,476.373,"No, no."
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,479.766,480.277,--Yes.
1985.84-1999,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,480.277,483.239,"But dissenters, would dissenters be bound?"
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,483.239,489.112,"They would be bound, but yet the remedy is still above the scope of--"
1985.84-1999,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,489.112,489.383,All right.
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,499.267,507.625,"--Well, they would certainly be more precluded, if you will, than in the situation that we have at hand."
1985.84-1999,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,507.625,508.443,Yes.
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,512.207,513.188,"I do the best I can, Judge."
1985.84-1999,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,513.188,515.079,May I ask a little question?
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,515.079,515.99,Yes.
1985.84-1999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,515.99,517.833,"I must confess, I don't understand it."
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,530.9,535.484,"In all due honesty, Justice Stevens, if the remedy is improper, the remedy is improper wherever it is handed."
1985.84-1999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,535.484,540.397,"And that would be true if you agreed to it, and if it is proper the fact you didn't agree to it doesn't make it improper."
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,541.578,542.947,That's correct.
1985.84-1999,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,542.947,547.942,So you want to change your answer to my earlier question?
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,548.383,550.063,I guess I am going to have to.
1985.84-1999,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,791.08,792.722,Are you still quoting Senator Humphrey?
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,792.722,793.832,"Yes, I am."
1985.84-1999,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,793.832,799.926,"I can't help but ask the question, if he were here today, on which side of this case do you think he would stand?"
1985.84-1999,0,46322,william_l_summers,,799.926,845.967,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, that is a very difficult question, but I think that the principles that Senator Humphrey stood for were strong enough that if he felt the necessity for quota relief in 1985, he would do everything within his power on the floor of Congress to see that those words were in fact added to this title, and in explaining on so many occasions before that very same Congress that Congress was not giving that power to the courts of this United States nor to the Equal Opportunity Commission, I think he made it very clear what the intent of that bill was at that time, and in knowing his job the way he knew it, if it were necessary to change it, he would see that the possibility would have every opportunity to come about, and would certainly not expect this Court to do so."
1985.84-1999,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,950.957,955.809,Mr. Reynolds.
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,955.809,976.203,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as Mr. Summers stated, the question that is raised by this case is purely one of statutory construction, whether a judicial order entered with the consent of the employer is subject to the remedial limitations imposed by Section 706(g) of Title 7."
1985.84-1999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1034.342,1042.086,"Of course, you still have to convince us as to what the last sentence of 706(g) means."
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1044.948,1050.261,"Mr. Justice White, I... I am sorry."
1985.84-1999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.261,1051.924,--Do you think it is subject to some other construction?
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1051.924,1063.231,There had been proposed in some of the briefs some different ways to parse the words that might suggest that it doesn't mean that there is a limitation on--
1985.84-1999,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1063.231,1069.525,"Well, Mr. Reynolds, apart from the briefs, Congressman Seller was the sponsor of that last sentence, wasn't he?"
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1069.525,1072.646,--The no order of the--
1985.84-1999,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1072.646,1075.359,The last sentence of 706(g).
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1075.359,1076.758,--706(g).
1985.84-1999,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1078.461,1088.757,"Yes, and he suggests that that bars any relief except for some victim of discrimination."
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1088.757,1090.209,That's correct.
1985.84-1999,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1090.209,1091.709,"But that wasn't his view of it, was it?"
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1091.709,1093.82,"I believe that was his view, and that was the view of--"
1985.84-1999,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1093.82,1113.332,"That is the last sentence, bars an order of hiring or otherwise for anyone suspended or discharged for any reason other than discrimination on account of race."
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1130.073,1134.417,--I think the legislative history of that sentence and the discussion in the Senate--
1985.84-1999,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1134.417,1138.288,"I am addressing my... I am asking, isn't that what Representative Seller said?"
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1138.288,1159.963,"--I think Representative Seller made a number of comments about this sentence and what it means in the legislative debates, and I think that the overwhelming import of what his understanding was is that this sentence barred the awarding of relief to those who were not victims of discrimination."
1985.84-1999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.227,1184.471,You mean discriminated in favor of those who were not--
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1184.471,1187.413,"It was, you would not discriminate in favor."
1985.84-1999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1187.413,1188.821,--Of those who were not--
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1188.821,1189.734,Who were not victims.
1985.84-1999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1221.192,1231.44,"--Do you suggest that giving relief, a court's giving relief to nonvictims itself violates Title 7?"
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1234.542,1245.028,I don't think that the Court can give relief to nonvictims of the discrimination.
1985.84-1999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1245.028,1245.999,What if it does?
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1249.682,1253.793,If a court orders it?
1985.84-1999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.788,1260.208,Yes.
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1260.208,1265.682,"I think if that is the specific requirement of the order, that it is invalid under 706(g) and the--"
1985.84-1999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1265.682,1267.064,It is just an invalid remedy.
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1267.064,1268.055,--That is right.
1985.84-1999,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1314.965,1325.631,"Mr. Reynolds, would you describe exactly the effect of the consent decree on the promotion of people who already were in the union?"
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1332.616,1349.267,"The effect of the decree and its operation would, I think, deny to some union members who were eligible for promotion the ability to be promoted solely by reason of their race."
1985.84-1999,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1351.979,1359.866,Did it apply to promotion of blacks who did not possess the requisite qualifications for promotion by whites?
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1359.866,1370.371,I think that this decree does require that you promote blacks without regard to their qualifications.
1985.84-1999,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1370.371,1374.703,"There were specified numbers of promotions that were to be made to each office, weren't there?"
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1374.703,1377.495,"Specified numbers, well, percentages."
1985.84-1999,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1377.495,1383.908,Those goals or quotas had to be met even if there were better qualified whites at the time?
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1383.908,1387.772,"That is the way that the decree was written and it was to operate, and indeed the way it did operate."
1985.84-1999,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1387.772,1388.973,Does the record show that?
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1388.973,1406.174,"The record of this case in terms of how it has operated, I think that this case comes to court before the time... the record was developed in this case before the time the promotions actually took place."
1985.84-1999,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1416.212,1422.604,"Mr. Reynolds, can I ask you another question about the text of the last sentence of 706(g)?"
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1450.514,1479.332,"I don't know, Mr. Justice Stevens, but it certainly would be within... it certainly would be very possible that there were black officers who had not been promoted by reason of qualifications, that is, for some reason other than race, who would by virtue of this decree, would indeed have the promotion award to them in order to fill the percentages."
1985.84-1999,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1479.332,1485.006,"--If that were true, if they had been denied promotion because of lack of qualification, you would say the language reads directly on them."
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1492.222,1500.607,"Well, I think this language... as I say, I think one can parse this language in several different ways which requires us to turn to the legislative history."
1985.84-1999,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1517.668,1523.103,"But you do not really contend that it is a plain language case, but rather it is an ambiguity case, and we must then look at the legislative history."
1985.84-1999,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1523.103,1527.064,I certainly think that we do need to look at the legislative history.
1985.84-1999,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1542.064,1543.256,Very well.
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1552.561,1556.415,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1985.84-1999,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1556.415,1559.645,You may raise the lecturn if you would like and find it more convenient.
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1559.645,1561.147,--Thank you for reminding me.
1985.84-1999,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.899,1694.896,"But ordinarily if the city created more promotions, as you refer to them, they would have gone to people next in line, would they not have?"
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1694.896,1695.895,That's correct.
1985.84-1999,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1720.661,1723.723,You mentioned examinations.
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1733.999,1739.563,They would to the extent to which the grades control your ranking on an eligible list.
1985.84-1999,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1740.494,1755.704,"Yes, but assuming that ten people passed, and some were much higher in grade scores than others, and only five positions were to be filled, would they be filled in accordance with the grade scores or not?"
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1755.704,1765.802,They would be filled in accordance with the grade scores except insofar as the court... the affirmative action plan embodied in the consent decree requires otherwise.
1985.84-1999,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1766.671,1768.203,How far is that?
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1768.203,1770.584,"--Well, it depends on the given list."
1985.84-1999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.559,1780.352,Would have to be.
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1781.451,1781.801,--That is correct.
1985.84-1999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.886,1795.018,So they all have... you can all say that they are minimally qualified but they are ranked.
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1795.018,1798.2,"More than minimally qualified, Justice White."
1985.84-1999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.718,1826.981,Did seniority have anything to do with who was entitled to a promotion?
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1826.981,1830.932,No seniority system is involved in this case.
1985.84-1999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.932,1831.372,All right.
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1831.372,1839.277,Much has been said about 706(g) previously this afternoon.
1985.84-1999,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1873.761,1891.082,"Counsel, if there had been no voluntary agreement, and if there had been no consent decree, but the case had gone to trial, do you think the court could have ordered precisely the same remedial scheme as was developed here for the consent decree?"
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1891.082,1892.704,"--Absolutely, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1999,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1895.344,1900.129,And you don't see anything in the Stotts opinion that would be contrary to that?
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1900.129,1910.104,"No, and there is no argument that there are equitable... the equitable limitations of the court have been exceeded, and there is nothing in the Stotts opinion that speaks to the contrary."
1985.84-1999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.909,1926.976,"Stotts does talk about the policy, the remedial policy of 706(g), doesn't it?"
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1926.976,1928.946,"That's correct, Justice White."
1985.84-1999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.946,1935.892,"And it says at least that its result is consistent with that policy, which is as follows."
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1935.892,1953.394,"That is correct, and there is nothing that we quarrel with in that discussion because what 706(g), what the last sentence here does is preserves management's prerogative in the individual case to say that Person X is not in fact qualified."
1985.84-1999,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.583,1962.971,Did the District Court make any finding as to past discrimination on the part of the City of Cleveland in making the decree?
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,1962.971,1963.492,"Yes, it did."
1985.84-1999,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2067.619,2072.512,"Well, it has effects different from a voluntary settlement, doesn't it?"
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2072.512,2073.433,--Certainly it does.
1985.84-1999,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2097.719,2102.123,"This wasn't an agreement of the parties at all, one party did not agree."
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2102.123,2106.905,"Well, that is totally irrelevant under these circumstances, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-1999,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2106.905,2119.283,"They found a particular motion in the court and said, one, we don't agree with this, and two, we don't agree with anything that is involved in affirmative action."
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2119.283,2120.685,Absolutely--
1985.84-1999,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2120.685,2124.817,On the next page the court issues a consent decree.
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2124.817,2126.639,--Your Honor--
1985.84-1999,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2126.639,2129.18,Who consented?
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2129.18,2130.242,"--Your Honor, they--"
1985.84-1999,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2130.242,2131.592,Who consented?
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2131.592,2134.013,--The consent was between the plaintiff and the defendants.
1985.84-1999,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2135.065,2137.035,I thought the defendant said he didn't.
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2137.035,2143.54,"--The original defendant... the original defendants, the city defendants consented and the plaintiffs consented."
1985.84-1999,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2150.135,2151.697,Was Local 93 a party?
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2151.697,2154.329,--They intervened as a party.
1985.84-1999,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.503,2177.213,That was the 45.
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2177.213,2183.096,"No, it was a more strenuous consent decree but it was not a 45 percent consent decree."
1985.84-1999,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2245.879,2256.775,"Is this case in any different posture than if the City of Cleveland had voluntarily decided, I think we will go ahead and do this because of our past employment practices?"
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2256.775,2259.967,"The Weber decision, we submit, is controlling."
1985.84-1999,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2259.967,2263.389,But the Weber decision did not apply to a public body.
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2265.041,2268.154,That is not a question that is argued by petitioner.
1985.84-1999,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2268.154,2271.787,You say the Weber decision is controlling.
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2282.523,2288.626,"My response is, there is no serious... this plan meets the Fourteenth Amendment requirements, Number One."
1985.84-1999,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2289.648,2300.164,"Do you think the City of Cleveland could just as a matter of course decide that we are going to hire 60 percent blacks and 40 percent whites because of, say, the political situation in the City of Cleveland?"
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2300.164,2305.758,"--No, this Court has spoken to that question, or very closely to that question in Fullilove and also in Bache."
1985.84-1999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2318.017,2325.523,So you are justifying this on the basis of a remedy for past discrimination.
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2326.314,2327.144,That's correct.
1985.84-1999,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2345.225,2347.378,"As a matter of fact, I think they stipulated to that effect."
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2347.378,2350.3,--They in fact stipulate that question away.
1985.84-1999,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2377.377,2385.683,"Yes, but Congress can't have the final say on what an employer can do as to voluntary compliance when you are talking about a public body."
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2385.683,2387.523,It can under Section 703.
1985.84-1999,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2515.738,2520.602,"But the validity of a consent decree depends upon the jurisdiction of the court to enter it, does it not?"
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2520.602,2526.817,"Mr. Chief Justice, that is absolutely correct, and there is no question about the court's jurisdiction here."
1985.84-1999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.898,2566.973,"Well, suppose 706(g) said that no court order may include A, B, C, which is precisely what this consent decree included."
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2571.307,2573.037,--My interpretation is--
1985.84-1999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.037,2574.008,Isn't that right?
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2584.133,2591.75,"--Well, I would say that, but it is clearly not necessary to reach that question, because 706(g) is not--"
1985.84-1999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2591.75,2596.672,"Well, it is if we agree with the government on what the construction of 706(g) is."
1985.84-1999,2,23086,edward_r_stege_jr,,2596.672,2627.583,"--Well, there are two issues on the construction of 706(g), Number One, whether it authorizes this as a matter of court-imposed remedies, Number One, and Number Two, whether there is anything in 706(g) that bars the parties from voluntarily agreeing, and on that latter question, I would urge the Court to take into consideration the fact that if Local 93 were to have even consented to this consent decree, that under their interpretation the last sentence of 706(g) would bar it."
1985.84-1999,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2632.205,2642.433,Mr. Maddox.
1985.84-1999,3,31772,john_d_maddox,,2642.433,2651.998,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, petitioner and the Department of Justice would resolve this case as a simple one of numbers."
1985.84-1999,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2707.743,2711.486,"How does that bear on the issues that we have here now, Mr. Maddox?"
1985.84-1999,3,31772,john_d_maddox,,2711.486,2725.107,"I think, Your Honor, that in looking at the governmental authority which Congress has delegated to enforce the statute and their construction of the statute, that helps the Court in formulating what Congress' intent was."
1985.84-1999,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3025.672,3031.075,"Do you think that is the submission of the other side, there may be no race-conscious--"
1985.84-1999,3,31772,john_d_maddox,,3031.075,3032.768,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1985.84-1999,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3045.394,3048.236,--I hadn't understood they went that far.
1985.84-1999,3,31772,john_d_maddox,,3054.561,3076.876,"--That is correct, Your Honor, but that is contrary and not consistent with race-conscious prospective relief, which does not focus on the victims, but focuses on the respondent, as is said in the first sentence of 706(g), focuses on the institution and what steps must be taken to alleviate discrimination in that institution."
1985.84-1999,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3078.235,3084.69,Do you agree that the black officers who get the benefit of this decree are non-victims?
1985.84-1999,3,31772,john_d_maddox,,3084.69,3086.352,--Some may be.
1985.84-1999,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3102.582,3111.058,"So we could assume and it may be true that all of them are non-victims, or that all of them are victims."
1985.84-1999,3,31772,john_d_maddox,,3111.058,3115.92,"You could assume either way, Your Honor, and that particular point is not relevant to race-conscious prospective relief."
1985.84-1999,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3115.92,3121.004,But for you to win you should win on either assumption.
1985.84-1999,3,31772,john_d_maddox,,3121.004,3122.765,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1999,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3135.694,3148.372,"But back to your previous point, who takes care of the 90 percent of the union and those in the union who have never themselves participated in any discrimination?"
1985.84-1999,3,31772,john_d_maddox,,3148.372,3155.869,"Your Honor, I believe that the negotiations resulted in a very fair allocation of any sort of burden."
1985.84-1999,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3298.021,3299.491,Thank you.
1985.84-1999,4,46322,william_l_summers,,3306.927,3342.71,"Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Maddox on behalf of the City of Cleveland seems to look towards the position of the Justice Department and allow singularly our claim to be one of... not that important, but it certainly seems to me that from the beginning and in the complaint which is in this joint appendix which prayed for dollar back pay relief, this City of Cleveland, he, the law director of the City of Cleveland, saw a way around it."
1985.84-1999,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3356.399,3356.829,"Well, he did in part."
1985.84-1999,4,46322,william_l_summers,,3356.829,3357.57,"--Pardon me, sir."
1985.84-1999,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3357.57,3358.56,"He did in part, and I would like to hear your answer."
1985.84-1999,4,46322,william_l_summers,,3367.155,3370.228,Who knows what is true?
1985.84-1999,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3570.14,3571.562,"Thank you, gentlemen."
