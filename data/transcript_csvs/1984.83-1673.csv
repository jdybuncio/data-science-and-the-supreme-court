1984.83-1673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.004,We will hear arguments next in Devine against Nutt.
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,67.115,77.741,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns the federal government's ability to fire or discipline employees who have engaged in serious misconduct."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,187.283,188.144,"Excuse me, Mr. Rothfeld."
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,195.228,198.059,"--Yes, they are required to provide for arbitration."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,198.059,205.456,"Do they have a standard form of arbitration clause, or may they differ depending on how the union and the agency negotiate?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,205.456,206.805,"They may differ, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,323.613,332.018,Could the government begin all over again and remedy the defects seen by the court?
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,332.018,334.561,"It is not clear whether they could, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,356.615,368.533,"On this holding of the Court of Appeals, would it be correct to say that it wouldn't make any difference what the offenses of these employees were?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,368.533,369.805,"--That is true, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,369.805,377.199,"It would be... they would be in the same boat if they had been caught selling drugs, or caught stealing typewriters?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,377.199,379.021,I think that is true.
1984.83-1673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,380.551,382.224,Purely a procedural problem.
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,382.224,394.298,"--The arbitrator focused solely on the procedural mistakes that were made by the agency, and in fact the actions of the employees in this case were serious violations which the arbitrator noted could be subjected to criminal penalties."
1984.83-1673,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,409.389,424.349,"Mr. Rothfeld, what remedies do you propose for the union under your view of the case to enforce the terms of the collective bargaining agreement in this regard?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,424.349,427.281,"Well, there are two points to make in response to that, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,473.533,475.403,"I am sorry, Mr. Rothfeld."
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,491.113,495.545,"Well, certainly the Federal Labor Relations Authority."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,495.545,505.413,"It may, of course, because it is proceeding, alleging an unfair labor practice, but what about... may the arbitrator issue a cease and desist order?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,505.413,512.607,"Well, the arbitrator certainly can remedy in any way they find appropriate a violation of--"
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,512.607,516.87,"Well, including a... I thought I heard you say earlier, including a cease and desist order."
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,519.04,526.266,"--I believe that would be an appropriate remedy, if the arbitrator found that a violation had occurred, and that that was a way to redress the violation."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,526.266,531.86,"Are cease and desist orders something that private arbitrators can do, do you think?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,531.86,549.722,"Private arbitrators generally direct the remedy to whatever violations have been found, and I think that... if this is an instance where the union is asserting its institutional interests, and as the statute clearly allows it to do for any violation of the collective bargaining agreement."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,549.722,560.678,"Well, now, what about the past misconduct, assuming the cease and desist order, whether it is the Labor Board or the arbitrator?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,566.753,579.401,"Well, past misconduct or past procedural violations that had no effect on the outcome of the agency's decision, one thing the arbitrator certainly cannot do is reinstate penalized employees."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,625.932,640.24,"Now, as I recall it, the Congressional history here of this statute weighs heavily in favor... indicated Congress weighed heavily in favor of arbitration, did it not?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,640.24,642.611,It made provision for arbitration.
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,643.463,649.907,But there is much in the legislative history that says that that is the preferred course?
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,649.907,655.089,"Well, Congress recognized that there are a variety of advantages to arbitration, and certainly we don't dispute that."
1984.83-1673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.508,762.961,The union represented the employee before the arbitrator?
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,762.961,764.441,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.441,774.379,So it had an opportunity at that time to ask... or did it have an opportunity to ask for a remedy tailored to its own interests?
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,774.379,775.558,"Well, the nature of the proceeding--"
1984.83-1673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,775.558,779.702,Or would it have had to file a separate grievance of its own?
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,779.702,789.607,"--I think, Your Honor, that if it had wanted to assert its institutional interests, it would have been required to file a separate union grievance, which the arbitrator might have consolidated."
1984.83-1673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,789.607,795.113,"Well, if that is clear enough, then it was clearly out of bounds to give a remedy to the union in this case."
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,795.113,797.444,"I think that is correct, Justice White."
1984.83-1673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.444,809.953,"Is there something clear about that in the Act, or is there any... it is just clear because the union is free to file a grievance of its own?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,810.865,817.569,"Well, the nature of the statutory adverse action proceeding, I think, does make that clear."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,821.232,825.727,May the union invoke independently the adverse action procedure?
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,825.727,831.74,--The union may independently invoke... file a grievance of its own and invoke arbitration on its own behalf.
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,831.74,834.692,"No, no, but that is under the collective bargaining agreement, isn't it?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,834.692,837.064,"Yes, that's correct."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,837.064,846.109,"But how about the route that the non-union member may take before the... what do you call it, the agency or something?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,846.109,848.37,Through the Merit Systems Protection Board.
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,848.37,849.151,Yes.
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,853.072,854.163,"No, it may not."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,855.576,865.461,"Its only remedy is either to go file its own grievance under the collective bargaining agreement, right, or go to the Labor Relations Board?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,865.461,866.492,--Correct.
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,866.492,870.526,Those are the only two routes you think that the union may take?
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,870.526,872.056,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,875.439,877.419,"But that isn't what the Federal Circuit held, was it?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,877.419,893.2,"--Well, the Federal Circuit we think incorrectly held that the union is a participant or is an independent party to the employee's adverse action charge through arbitration, and in fact, the answer to your question is no."
1984.83-1673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.2,894.389,You just say that is plain wrong.
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,894.389,903.987,"We do say that is plain wrong, not only because the union has its own independent remedies, but because the adverse action procedures place the focus on the employee."
1984.83-1673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.379,913.113,"And this remedy was imposed plainly to benefit the union, not the employee."
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,913.113,914.405,"Explicitly, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,925.61,929.343,"Wasn't Congress focused on the employee, not on the union?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,929.343,931.084,--That's correct.
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,932.095,940.13,"And it gave the employee the options of going the collective bargaining route or going the Merit Board route, didn't it?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,940.13,941.131,"--That's right, Justice Brennan."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,941.131,942.471,It didn't give the union that.
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,942.471,948.385,"No, if the employee opts not to go through the grievance procedure, the union has no recourse."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,970.771,980.196,"Incidentally, do non-union members, do they have... may they invoke the collective bargaining grievance procedure?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,980.196,986.31,"Members of bargaining units, whether or not they are dues-paying union members, may invoke the negotiating procedure."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1207.694,1221.184,"Perhaps you answered this already, Mr. Rothfeld, but did you say or not that the individual employee who elects to go the Merit Board route on appeal may or may not have the help of his union?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1221.184,1227.709,"He may be represented by his union, but the union is not his exclusive representative as it is in the arbitration."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1227.709,1232.822,"He is not going to collective bargaining unit, now, he is going to the Merit Board."
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1232.822,1234.793,The union has no statutory role in that--
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1234.793,1242.958,Does the union in fact play any role on behalf of the employee when the employee elects to go the Merit Board route?
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1242.958,1251.034,"--The union may elect to provide representation, but it has no statutory role, and it has no official role in the proceedings."
1984.83-1673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1251.034,1254.715,How about this case?
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1254.715,1260.709,"In this case... in every case in which arbitration is invoked, the union represents the employee."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1298.034,1314.545,"Well, may an agency and the union negotiate a provision limiting the scope of an arbitrator's authority, or does the requirement that they go to arbitration spell out what the scope of the arbitration is?"
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1314.545,1316.816,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1323.16,1324.022,By the collective bargaining agreement.
1984.83-1673,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1324.022,1325.043,That's correct.
1984.83-1673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1410.037,1412.128,Very well.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1416.562,1427.349,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented this afternoon may be more simply stated than the government has done."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1482.784,1484.737,Could the union have filed its own grievance?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1484.737,1487.989,"Yes, Your Honor, the union--"
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1487.989,1494.584,And gotten an appropriate remedy for its omission from the initial steps?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1494.584,1498.005,"--That is the critical question, Your Honor, what would be an appropriate remedy--"
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.005,1500.616,I just asked... how about the answer to my question?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1502.769,1505.22,"--Yes, Your Honor, the union could have filed--"
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.22,1507.06,"And the employer could have been told, don't do it any more?"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1507.06,1508.512,"--Yes, that's right, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1508.512,1510.202,By the arbitrator?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1510.202,1526.284,"By the arbitrator, but, Your Honor, I would point out in the context of this particular case early in the arbitral decision the arbitrator makes reference to a previous arbitration award by another arbitrator involving the same parties, GSA and this local."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.865,1579.349,"Well, suppose an employee is discharged for what... if he did what he did, anybody would say he shouldn't be working for this agency, and it goes to arbitration, and the arbitrator says, yes, you certainly shouldn't be working for this agency but you didn't have the benefit of your union at the initial sit-down, so we are going to put you back on the payroll."
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1580.759,1590.014,"Our argument is, Your Honor, that the arbitrator is in the best position to devise a remedy for the situation."
1984.83-1673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1636.754,1640.698,Are there lots of positions in the federal government that don't involve trust?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1640.698,1646.692,"Well, the particular officer, Your Honor, to answer your question, was returned to a custodial position."
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1687.238,1691.552,The union can't go before the board with its own?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1691.552,1692.702,It cannot.
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1692.702,1697.747,The only places it may go if there is a collective bargaining agreement is to the arbitrator.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1697.747,1698.866,That's correct.
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1698.866,1700.679,Or to the Labor Board.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1700.679,1701.868,That's correct.
1984.83-1673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1717.308,1732.278,"Do you agree with your friend that if these two men had been caught selling narcotics, heroin and what-not, this situation would be the same as it is now?"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1732.278,1735.781,"Your Honor, no, I do not."
1984.83-1673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1737.211,1738.813,What do you think the remedy would have been?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1738.813,1745.438,--I believe that the arbitrator in that case would have devised a remedy different from reinstatement.
1984.83-1673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1745.438,1748.777,Would you suggest some alternatives?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1751.091,1767.331,"I think that in that particular case, and I am assuming that there have been pervasive violations, that the violations have been repeated, and that the conduct, the misconduct approaches the level, for example, of theft, as I believe you suggested."
1984.83-1673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1767.331,1771.334,"Well, just they caught them selling heroin once."
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1776.647,1778.017,"No, Your Honor, I am not."
1984.83-1673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1782.221,1783.891,Or stealing typewriters.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1783.891,1785.604,"Yes, I would agree."
1984.83-1673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1789.975,1798.442,"Procedurally, might they not have come out just where they came out?"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1798.442,1800.743,--Procedurally they would have.
1984.83-1673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1826.379,1833.524,"So you are suggesting that if it had been a drug case or a theft of a typewriter, then they might have come to a different result?"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1833.524,1838.567,"We wouldn't be here today, Your Honor, if it had been a theft case, I am quite sure."
1984.83-1673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1921.912,1927.205,Even though nothing in this particular employee's record would deserve mitigation.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,1938.443,1953.432,"The procedural rights, Your Honor... that's correct, Your Honor, but the procedural rights nevertheless are very important in this scheme, particularly when one recalls that procedures are the only thing in the federal sector that unions may bargain over."
1984.83-1673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1975.926,1990.525,"Well, supposing that you have six people who have done what the most serious offender of these particular two did, and the arbitrator says, well, you know, this agency hasn't just violated the procedures once."
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2006.477,2012.21,I would say that it would be under those circumstances.
1984.83-1673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2023.358,2030.994,Even though the violation of the contractual provisions had no effect on the factfinding process in this particular arbitration?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2030.994,2039.248,"Your Honor, it is a subjective determination as to whether it did or did not, and the arbitrator must make that decision."
1984.83-1673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.248,2048.044,"Did the arbitrator here, in the case before us, make the determination that the violations of the procedure by the agency did have an effect on the factfinding process?"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2048.044,2050.816,"Not on the factfinding process, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.145,2069.228,But this remedy was imposed expressly just to vindicate the union's rights.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2069.228,2070.758,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.758,2078.644,"Nothing to do with whether these people did or didn't do what they were charged with doing, or what their desserts were."
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2078.644,2087.572,"The union didn't even, in this arbitration, contest the facts of the misconduct, Your Honor, because they felt they had been so grievously prejudiced."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2087.572,2095.417,"Would they have contested the remedy, I suppose, would they, except for their exclusion from the sit-down process?"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2095.417,2096.376,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.708,2100.038,"Well, what was their position before the arbitrator?"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2102.251,2104.642,"No, their position before the arbitrator was--"
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.642,2105.382,The union's.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2105.382,2117.61,"--that there was no case, because the agency's infractions had so grievously tainted the evidence that had been obtained against the grievants that the matter could not be supported at all."
1984.83-1673,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2201.586,2209.391,Except that it deprives the employer of a right to discharge an employee that legally is dischargable.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2210.623,2221.639,"Justice O'Connor, the Merit System Protection Board, however, would also have the right to mitigate a penalty based upon the consideration of all the relevant factors in the record."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2245.214,2266.548,"Do you think under the law the board could have imposed this very remedy if the employee in appearing before the board had said, I am entitled to relief here because I didn't have my representative earlier in this procedure, and the entire factfinding process was tainted?"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2279.806,2283.799,"The board could have done that under the... in my own opinion, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2516.941,2523.726,In grievances brought by employees in the collective bargaining--
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2523.726,2541.469,"That's correct, Your Honor, and that's a very important addition to what I said, because in fact we are talking about the integrity of the whole collective bargaining process here, and the only effective mechanism to really preserve the integrity of that process."
1984.83-1673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2591.19,2597.664,"--When you say the union's interests, do you mean the union's interests as distinguished from the grievant's interest?"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2597.664,2601.878,"Distinguished from the grievant's interest to a certain degree, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2602.97,2603.641,In the immediate case.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2603.641,2604.099,--Yes.
1984.83-1673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2629.346,2638.162,"And this individual grievant may have been denied a right, but it was found to be harmless, that it had no effect on the outcome."
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2638.162,2659.057,"That is correct, Your Honor, but that interpretation of the statutory harmful error rule is the MSPB's interpretation, and we are saying that that interpretation does not necessarily relate to the arbitral process, because the union cannot be a party before the Merit System Protection Board."
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2751.675,2758.851,"Well, of course, the same grievant can't be before both the board and the arbitrator at the same time, can they?"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2758.851,2759.852,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2759.852,2760.741,Cannot be.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2760.741,2761.642,Cannot be.
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2761.642,2768.247,"Once he elects the route he wants to take, he is stuck with it, and he can't go the other route ever."
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2768.247,2769.417,That's correct.
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2769.417,2777.203,How do you get these differences between the board and the arbitrator on the interpretation of harmful error?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2785.688,2787.458,"The board... yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2787.458,2790.46,--and that you disagree with the interpretation the board has put on it?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2790.46,2794.144,"Yes, because... I will clarify that."
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2819.369,2824.904,How did the board in your view improperly interpret the harmful error rule?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2824.904,2829.396,"The board, Your Honor, has not had occasion to interpret the--"
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2829.396,2831.607,"Well, then, I don't understand where the conflict--"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2831.607,2834.298,"--Well, there is no conflict, we would submit, between this award--"
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2834.298,2838.262,--What is it you disagree with that the board has done in the way of interpetation?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2838.262,2841.245,"--Your Honor, in this case, that is not an issue."
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2856.865,2858.155,That you disagree with.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2858.155,2859.967,"We would disagree with that, yes."
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2874.146,2879.92,And was not required to follow the board's interpretation because the union was not party to the board's proceeding.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2879.92,2887.274,"That's correct, Your Honor, and nothing else in the statute requires that the arbitrator follow board precedent."
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2892.049,2893.448,"Nor the other way around, I take it."
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2893.448,2894.499,Or the other way around.
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2895.839,2912.22,"But I take it both are supposed to follow the applicable statutes, not ignore the applicable statutes."
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2912.22,2913.502,"Of course, Your Honor, that is correct."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2923.608,2925.969,The government says the arbitrator did that in this case.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2925.969,2932.714,"The government is relying, however, on an interpretation by the Merit System Protection Board, which does not, in our opinion--"
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2932.714,2934.995,"Well, it is also relying on its own."
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2934.995,2937.407,"--Yes, Your Honor, clearly."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.68,2942.902,Yes.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2942.902,2965.385,"We are left in the private sector... we wish to emphasize this... with the arbitral mechanism to enforce the negotiated rights of the employees represented by unions, striking down the approach followed by the award at bar, which was to balance the competing interests of the agency--"
1984.83-1673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2965.385,2967.136,May I just ask this one question?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,2979.054,3000.217,"--The Federal Labor Relations Authority in the context of an unfair labor practice complaint, could also order the remedy of reinstatement based upon violations of the statute or pervasive and repeated violations of the contract."
1984.83-1673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3003.019,3005.591,"They could also issue a cease and desist order, couldn't they?"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3005.591,3015.138,"They could also issue a cease and desist order, although again the fact that the agency had previously apparently ignored an arbitrator's determination--"
1984.83-1673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3015.138,3021.533,"Ignored an arbitrator, but that is why I wonder if the arbitrator is really the most effective tribunal for granting relief to the union."
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3021.533,3026.143,"--Well, an arbitrator is supposed to be a parallel process in the context of adverse actions."
1984.83-1673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3026.143,3029.907,But adverse actions between the employee and the government.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3029.907,3041.204,"In which the union, though, in the arbitral context, is a co-party, if you will, if not the most important party, as the two Courts of Appeals have found."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3041.204,3048.681,"What steps can the union take to ensure that this won't happen again other than filing some procedure, proceeding?"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3054.504,3063.74,"In the context of the grievance procedures, most contracts provide that the union must be notified, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3063.74,3064.57,By whom?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3064.57,3067.331,"By the agency, which is the other party--"
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3067.331,3067.941,The employer.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3067.941,3068.562,--The employer.
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3071.955,3074.556,"And of course any employee can notify the union, can't it?"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3074.556,3075.628,Yes.
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3084.902,3086.494,Who can file a grievance?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3086.494,3089.907,"The employee may file a grievance, or the union may file a grievance."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.907,3092.879,And the employee files a grievance and doesn't even tell the union.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3094.88,3096.502,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3096.502,3097.301,What happened?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3097.301,3102.564,The grievance was filed by the employees with notice to the union.
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.746,3104.467,And then what happened?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3104.467,3112.11,"The grievance was processed through a number of steps, and at the conclusion of the two or three steps--"
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.11,3115.773,And during the processing was the employee there?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3115.773,3119.336,"--Yes, the employees were there and the union was represented."
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3122.608,3124.489,Those were meetings with supervisors up the line?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3124.489,3125.42,"--Yes, that's correct."
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3125.42,3126.329,And then what happened?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3126.329,3130.914,Then the union is faced with the option of electing arbitration or not.
1984.83-1673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3140.16,3140.741,Yes.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3140.741,3149.486,"If the union elects arbitration, they proceed to arbitration under the procedures negotiated by the union and the agency."
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3152.288,3157.421,What wrong was committed against the union here?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3157.421,3169.73,"--Well, in this particular case, Your Honor, the union hypothetically, had they been present at the time of the investigation, the investigatory interviews with these officers--"
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3169.73,3171.339,Did it file the grievance?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3171.339,3172.581,--It did not.
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3172.581,3174.862,Did the employee file the grievance?
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3174.862,3176.262,The employees filed the grievance.
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3176.262,3177.053,In this case.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3177.053,3177.784,In this case.
1984.83-1673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.784,3178.255,This particular case.
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3179.996,3183.768,"No, the employees did notify the union, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3199.419,3208.424,"Isn't there some indication in the record that the employees knew of their right to have the union present, and just didn't either feel it worthwhile or didn't bother to call the union people?"
1984.83-1673,1,19124,charles_a_hobbie,,3208.424,3212.276,The arbitrator did not indicate that they knew of the right to have the union present.
1984.83-1673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3227.647,3229.416,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Rothfeld?"
1984.83-1673,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3229.416,3231.088,"A few quick points, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3287.797,3304.687,"Mr. Rothfeld, I think your colleague just said that if the employee goes all through the grievance procedure with the union, up to the last supervisor, and that the union does not elect to go arbitration, the employee is finished."
1984.83-1673,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3308.911,3310.41,"I think that is true, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3316.954,3318.975,"You mean, at the very first, at the initial step."
1984.83-1673,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3319.506,3327.01,"At the initial step, but of course the union is obligated by its duty of fair representation to safeguard the employee's rights--"
1984.83-1673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3327.01,3332.965,It may be that the employee then may never want a union through those initial steps.
1984.83-1673,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3332.965,3342.111,"--That is true, Your Honor, and an employee who doesn't wish representation by a union may go through the Merit Systems Protection Board and obtain the... or should be able to--"
1984.83-1673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3342.111,3347.106,"But if he takes union help through the initial steps, then he is stuck with it."
1984.83-1673,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3351.156,3356.63,"--If he elects to follow the negotiated procedure, that is his choice, and once he has done that, that is it."
1984.83-1673,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3356.63,3357.341,I see.
1984.83-1673,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3382.937,3384.86,"I believe that is correct, Justice White."
1984.83-1673,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3389.402,3394.226,I would think there would be a lot of employees that wouldn't want the union.
1984.83-1673,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3394.226,3396.867,"I think that is true, Your Honor."
1984.83-1673,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3403.54,3406.532,"Well, they can't if they have had a union."
1984.83-1673,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3406.532,3412.037,They can go to the board if they have not yet elected to use the grievance procedure.
