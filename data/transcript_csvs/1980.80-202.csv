1980.80-202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.837,We will hear arguments first this morning in American Express Co. v. Koerner.
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,12.974,17.443,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,237.237,246.426,Did the company investigate the credit rating of any of Mr. Koerner... or of any of the other four employees?
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,246.426,249.378,"No, Mr. Justice, just the company."
1980.80-202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,286.401,290.119,"Well, you say that the company stood behind it."
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,298.542,309.016,"--Well technically, the individual employees were jointly liable with the company for any charges on their particular cards."
1980.80-202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,322.324,332.548,"Well, what I was trying to clarify, because I wasn't sure what you meant, is there any difference in the relationship between American Express and Mr. Koerner, and American Express and the other four men?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,332.548,334.015,"--No, Your Honor."
1980.80-202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,334.015,334.631,Individually.
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,334.631,335.214,No.
1980.80-202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,335.214,349.807,"How about the relationship between the individual and the company, and the individual and American Express; could American Express have gone after him for the personal charges?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,349.807,353.343,"It could have, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,380.81,386.997,"But it could have gone after the individual for all of the charges, couldn't it?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,386.997,387.766,--It could have.
1980.80-202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,471.77,476.406,What does the record show as to the payment of these accounts?
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,479.941,490.064,"No, there were apparently some instances where personal checks of the employees were also sent, as well as company checks."
1980.80-202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,490.064,505.157,"--Well, are we to infer from that that sometimes the employees used it for personal purposes, and then paid with a personal check, but when it was for a corporate purpose it was paid for by a corporate check?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,505.157,508.009,"Well, that's possible, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.811,641.981,"Well, Mr. Greene, there are... do you... does the company make the disclosures every time it issues a new card, every year?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,641.981,643.947,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.586,654.186,Must it?
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,654.186,657.205,Well it must make initial disclosures at the beginning--
1980.80-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.205,659.423,Well I'm asking you how about on reissue?
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,663.192,665.311,--A renewal card was sent.
1980.80-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,665.311,665.677,Yes.
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,667.327,668.513,There are disclosures.
1980.80-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.548,682.855,"Well, suppose a card like this is never used for business purposes, as it turns out, it's used completely for personal use."
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,688.224,700.5,"Well, American Express would have no way of knowing what the card was being used for, or whether those purchases are personal or business; all it gets are copies of the credit card slips from the merchant."
1980.80-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,725.182,737.173,"Even though every payment... the payment for every charge on the card is made by him personally, and not by the company?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,737.173,743.227,"--Well, that may not indicate that the charges were business charges."
1980.80-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,762.188,765.926,"So it really isn't the purpose, it's what somebody says the purpose is?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,765.926,769.211,"Well, it's... in this case, there is a contract, Your Honor."
1980.80-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.378,774.615,I'm just trying to find out what your theory is.
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,780.852,781.986,--Agreement.
1980.80-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.986,783.152,--contractual representation.
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,783.152,790.874,"And it's a matter that has to be determined at the outset, before the account is used."
1980.80-202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,790.874,800.33,"Well, your... that argument depends upon the hypothesis, does it not, that the extension of credit occurs when the card is issued?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,800.33,802.765,Well an extension of credit--
1980.80-202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,802.765,803.282,Yes.
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,803.282,804.467,--certainly occurs then.
1980.80-202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,804.983,813.406,"And I thought of a credit card, or at least it can be argued, that a credit card is no more than an agreement to extend credit in the future."
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,813.406,825.029,"--Well, the definition of credit contained in the Truth-in-Lending Act is broad enough so that the opening of an account has to be viewed as an extension of credit."
1980.80-202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,825.63,829.598,Even though the card is put by the cardholder into his desk drawer and never used?
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,829.598,830.198,--Well certainly--
1980.80-202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,830.198,831.534,That's an extension of credit?
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,831.534,835.486,--an extension of credit is the right to defer payment.
1980.80-202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,835.486,840.24,"It's not... well, it's an agreement to extend credit in the future, is it not?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,840.24,843.675,"Yes, and that constitutes an extension of credit."
1980.80-202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,873.194,877.312,"Well, it has to be to support your argument, does it not?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,877.312,880.947,It has to be an extension of credit; I'm not denying that it's used for--
1980.80-202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,880.947,882.097,To support your statutory argument?
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,882.097,882.697,--That's right.
1980.80-202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,883.466,900.825,"Well what do you make then, of the first clause of Section 104(1), credit transactions involving extensions of credit for business or commercial purposes... are not covered by the subsection."
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,900.825,904.229,"Well, I think that language is crucial to us, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.80-202,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,918.805,938.117,"Well Mr. Greene, isn't your position pretty much that the key really is the purpose of the extension of credit... and where the purpose is business and it is established here by the application form itself as being for business... that brings you within the exemption?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,938.117,938.983,Precisely.
1980.80-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,940.068,944.92,"Even if, as a matter of fact, that's false, the purpose is false?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,948.888,962.715,"Well, I could conceive of a case, Your Honor, where if someone were to come into American Express and say, two years later, I got a business card from you but I'd like to change it over into a personal card."
1980.80-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,962.715,971.57,"--Well, I can certainly conceive of a situation where someone couldn't get a card of his own but he could get one with the company's name on it and he never intended to use it for business purposes."
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,972.87,976.272,I would... that should hardly entitle him to--
1980.80-202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.272,977.391,That wouldn't change your case.
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,977.391,978.124,"--No, it wouldn't."
1980.80-202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1192.096,1198.869,"To what extent, Mr. Greene, is that an analogy with a letter of credit?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,1198.869,1219.347,"It's very similar, Your Honor; that would involve an agreement by a creditor to make extensions of credit in the future, and if that agreement were between a lender and a business debtor, it would not be covered by Truth-in-Lending."
1980.80-202,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1273.25,1278.821,"So Mr. Greene, what's the significance of the last sentence of letter 727,"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,1290.961,1293.413,"There might be, and I don't--"
1980.80-202,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1293.413,1307.805,"I mean, although ostensibly a business card, where in fact it is established that it was primarily for personal use, this suggests that while ordinarily that wouldn't happen with a corporate card, it might happen."
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,1307.805,1311.09,"--It might happen, and I don't disagree with that, Your Honor."
1980.80-202,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1342.292,1345.228,"You mean, at the time of the issuance?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,1345.228,1346.263,At the time of the issuance.
1980.80-202,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1364.392,1370.795,"Well I gather probably American Express would not have issued a card in the name of the company then, would it?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,1370.795,1380.067,"--If that, the procedures are if that were to happen, it would issue a personal card, which as I said, is the vast majority of the cards that American Express issues."
1980.80-202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1380.067,1385.055,"But you won the motion for summary judgment in the District Court, did you not?"
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,1385.055,1386.905,"We did, Mr. Justice--"
1980.80-202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1386.905,1391.959,So doesn't that mean that all inferences have to be resolved against your client?
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,1391.959,1410.02,"--Well of course it does, but in this case, we put in the evidence that I've cited, and under Rule 56 the Plaintiff was required to come in with any affidavits to counter that that were required, and he didn't put in any."
1980.80-202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1410.02,1421.978,"But unless... notwithstanding his failure to produce affidavits, there was a genuine issue as to material fact, in which case you were not entitled to prevail."
1980.80-202,0,39404,ronald_j_greene,,1421.978,1446.962,"If there were an issue of material fact, but we don't believe there is an issue of material fact because of the explicit agreement among the three involved parties: the John Koerner Company, Louis Koerner and American Express Company, a contract that this was to be a company account and a stipulation during discovery that all billing was done as a business account."
1980.80-202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1587.72,1593.623,Very well.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,1598.194,1600.194,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1635.717,1641.371,"Although the Truth-in-Lending Act doesn't deal with proper business etiquette, does it?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,1641.371,1647.175,"Well in a way, this... the Fair Credit Billing Act in a way does."
1980.80-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1661.35,1678.062,Well but you wouldn't suggest that an argument over a bill or an argument over a plane reservation or something like that paid for with a credit card would come within the Truth-in-Lending Act simply because it was a violation of good etiquette?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,1678.062,1678.696,"No, not at all."
1980.80-202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1679.812,1682.448,There's no question here that there was a violation of law?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,1682.448,1683.498,--That's correct.
1980.80-202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1685.216,1688.335,If this was covered by law.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,1688.335,1693.887,"--What would have happened here is... what my father was looking for was an apology, and this suit would never have been brought."
1980.80-202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1799.889,1804.21,But the credit information was submitted only with respect to the corporation?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,1804.21,1804.876,Correct.
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2031.925,2033.392,"Mr. Koerner, could I interrupt you for a second?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2033.392,2033.642,--Certainly.
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.642,2036.058,What is your basic theory here?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2043.414,2043.948,Both.
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2045.131,2047.616,"Do you require both, or... under the statute?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2047.616,2048.818,"--No, I don't think we require both."
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2059.623,2060.023,I understand.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2062.592,2064.827,"--Okay, the statute protects consumers."
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2083.456,2090.96,"So under that construction, you would win, if all of the transactions were business transactions?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2090.96,2093.395,That is one possibility.
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.395,2101.667,"The other possibility is that if there's any one personal transaction on the account, you would win even if he weren't jointly liable, I suppose?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2101.667,2102.867,Correct.
1980.80-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2115.843,2125.699,Can you summarize in about two sentences what you think American Express should have done under the statute here which it did not do?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2125.699,2128.068,Acknowledge the dispute.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2128.068,2129.635,Apologize?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2131.437,2132.187,Yes sir.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2145.911,2150.065,"The statute does a whole lot of things, but it doesn't require apologies, does it?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2150.065,2150.965,No.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2150.965,2154.683,"Well, then what does the statute require?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2154.683,2167.86,"The statute requires that while there is a dispute, and American Express, the issuer is notified of the dispute, that they do not revoke the card until they take certain steps, that's all."
1980.80-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2167.86,2173.014,"And that's what you claim was erroneously done here, when the credit card was cut in two?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2173.014,2173.764,Correct.
1980.80-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2211.722,2215.107,So what's going to happen if you win?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2215.107,2219.159,"In this particular, what's going to happen--"
1980.80-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2219.159,2221.527,"In this particular case, if you win?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2221.527,2222.277,--Okay.
1980.80-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2223.311,2227.915,"Well, I mean in... with respect to your client."
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2227.915,2233.485,--It will reverse the summary judgment.
1980.80-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2246.892,2251.213,"And, since there isn't any money involved, what happens?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2251.213,2251.863,It's just a matter of principles.
1980.80-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2251.863,2260.236,"So it's just kind of a... like they used to say in Michigan, litigation was the winter sport of farmers."
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2260.236,2275.246,"Well, of course what happens is that we have a public interest in this, is that, we are appearing in a way, as a private attorney general seeking to enforce a right of consumers under the Act."
1980.80-202,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2290.702,2293.904,"Well let's see, the Court of Appeals reversed the summary judgment?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2293.904,2294.523,--Correct.
1980.80-202,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2294.523,2296.923,So now you're supposed to go back to the trial court?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2296.923,2297.675,Precisely.
1980.80-202,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2297.675,2299.125,What happens in the trial court?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2299.125,2308.948,"We decide whether we wish to go forward with a certification of a class, or whether at that point the case should be over."
1980.80-202,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2322.523,2326.494,"I know, but won't the District Court have to agree with that proposition?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2326.494,2328.344,It is stipulated by the parties.
1980.80-202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2331.362,2340.468,What's the... what stake does your client have in this controversy now that would qualify as Article III standing?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2340.468,2347.573,"He's paid me, we've paid costs as we've gone along, in addition, he's incurred attorneys fees."
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2347.573,2350.359,"Mr. Koerner, you filed this as a class action, didn't you?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2350.359,2350.775,Correct.
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.013,2358.679,And has the class been certified?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2358.679,2359.215,"No, Your Honor."
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2359.215,2361.665,That was because the District Court ruled against you on the merits?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2361.665,2362.5,Precisely.
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2362.5,2369.587,"So now, I suppose, on remand it would be open to certify a class and recover the ten million dollars or whatever it is you sued for, isn't it?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2369.587,2375.305,"I think there's a statute of limitation of $100,000."
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.305,2375.624,Ten thousand dollars.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2381.126,2382.228,"Oh no, it's not moot."
1980.80-202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2505.542,2511.011,"This was not decided by the District Court or the Court of Appeals, was it?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2511.011,2512.011,What was?
1980.80-202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2512.544,2513.627,The inapplicability?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2513.627,2520.617,The Court of Appeals said it was... they would not apply it because the man was a consumer.
1980.80-202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2520.617,2521.217,Yes.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2534.792,2535.326,Correct.
1980.80-202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2535.326,2537.676,And that was not decided by the Court of Appeals?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2537.676,2537.859,No.
1980.80-202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2540.528,2541.094,Correct.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2541.094,2541.896,--and ducked it.
1980.80-202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2541.896,2542.43,Right.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2542.43,2547.8,That is an available alternative grounds for consideration by the Court.
1980.80-202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2547.8,2549.35,Did you urge it in the Court of Appeals?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2549.35,2550.086,Certainly.
1980.80-202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2595.365,2598.332,"When you say that American Express knows, how do they know?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2600.851,2601.434,Yes.
1980.80-202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2601.434,2612.992,"Does American Express have an obligation to find out whether the credit was extended for the purchase of perfume in Paris or an airline ticket, or what?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2612.992,2614.092,No.
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2648.415,2656.652,"Mr. Koerner, if you wait till the account is paid, isn't that too late for them to comply with the pre-extension of credit disclosure requirement?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2664.608,2665.558,--Yes.
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2678.184,2683.402,You're assuming the computer can differentiate between personal checks and other kinds of checks?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2683.402,2693.944,"Well they... they don't seem to be able to differentiate the correspondence from the company saying something is wrong, I mean if they have that burden, why shouldn't they be able to differentiate between personal checks and not?"
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2716.809,2721.261,"I think what they could do, they could have looked to the contract which said you can negotiate that point."
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2723.396,2725.079,"--No, there's nothing in the contract that says that."
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2725.079,2726.081,It did so.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2730.033,2731.069,"Oh well, that's true."
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2732.135,2732.719,"Yes,--"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2732.719,2734.319,--they would have gone for my father.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2734.319,2735.335,--So they could have done this.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2735.335,2735.921,Absolutely.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2735.921,2737.954,Who did they send the bill to?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2737.954,2739.456,They sent it to the company.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2739.456,2740.489,I thought so.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2740.489,2748.979,"On the other hand, 15 U.S.C. 1637 provides that you're supposed to give individual notice to the consumer."
1980.80-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2763.088,2773.944,"If you look at the application on page 27a of the Joint Appendix at the very bottom there, it's in small print"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2785.418,2786.187,That's my uncle's.
1980.80-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2788.27,2788.504,Your uncle's.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2804.731,2806.115,No.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2873.71,2873.71,"Listen, if--"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2873.71,2874.326,Yes sir?
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2874.326,2886.518,--If the Respondent in this case had taken out a personal American Express card and paid for it then he wouldn't have this problem?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2886.518,2887.384,Precisely.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2887.384,2891.136,And was the only reason for doing this to save money?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2891.136,2892.922,No.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2892.922,2894.623,Well what was the reason?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2894.623,2904.745,"The reason was to avoid the company advancing, or him advancing his own personal funds to the company, rather than use of the credit card."
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2904.745,2908.197,"Well, I don't understand that at all."
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2908.197,2908.747,Well okay.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2909.549,2914.584,"He'd have an American Express credit card, just like he had before?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2914.584,2914.751,--Correct.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2914.751,2917.036,But he would have paid for it?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2917.036,2917.653,Correct.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2917.653,2919.255,Now he's got one for free?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2919.255,2921.321,That the company pays for.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2921.321,2923.323,"As to him, it's free."
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2923.323,2926.309,"True, but he's a principal of the company."
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2926.309,2928.861,Well should he give up something for that?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2928.861,2932.045,"$20, for free?"
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2945.222,2948.174,About the only way for American Express to make money is for you to pay them.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2948.174,2949.557,--Correct.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2951.057,2956.711,"Well, and he didn't want to pay, so he goes under the company's, and now he wants to have it both ways."
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2956.711,2964.983,"--Well what happened is, in 1965 that was a distinction without a difference, because it didn't make any difference whether it was a personal card or business card or whatever."
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2964.983,2968.619,I cannot expect to be bound by 1965.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2968.619,2970.386,Agreed.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2977.207,2981.509,Well did you bill him in 1975?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2981.509,2983.444,The company--
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2983.444,2984.728,1980?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2984.728,2986.396,--The company was billed in 1975.
1980.80-202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2986.396,2986.98,Right.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2986.98,2987.932,"Well, can't we look at that?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2990.348,2992.217,"That's correct, but at that time--"
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2992.217,2995.002,"And at that time, he was getting a free ride?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,2995.002,2998.038,--Yes.
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.038,3000.24,Well why do you say yes?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,3002.106,3003.192,Precisely.
1980.80-202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3003.742,3007.027,"Wasn't he liable for all of the company debts, not only his own, under the agreement?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,3007.294,3009.527,"--That's true, that would be the quid pro quo."
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3010.193,3010.41,--not a free ride.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,3010.41,3014.745,"--he would not be getting a free ride therefore, because he swapped the $20--"
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3014.745,3021.668,"He wasn't paying... so far, as the annual $20 cost... did you hear me?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,3021.668,3022.168,--Yes sir.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3022.168,3023.518,Was that a free ride or not?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,3023.518,3023.934,That was.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3024.801,3026.451,"He didn't pay the $20, right?"
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,3026.451,3028.253,"--He did not play the $20, but--"
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3028.253,3029.353,Who paid the $20?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,3029.353,3029.886,--The company.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3037.692,3040.811,Wouldn't he have had that if he'd have had his own card?
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,3040.811,3042.544,Only for his own use.
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3045.965,3047.965,I can't get involved with your cousin and your uncle.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,3050.516,3062.324,"--Well American Express, by the terms of the application, invited him to become liable for any use by other people that they issued the card to."
1980.80-202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3078.936,3081.721,"Well that's a family affair, let the family work it out."
1980.80-202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3083.804,3088.124,Well that's only if they use an American Express credit card.
1980.80-202,1,34719,louis_r_koerner_jr,,3095.628,3096.313,--Precisely.
1980.80-202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3123.048,3123.665,Very well.
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3125.398,3129.368,Just a few minor points.
1980.80-202,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3143.175,3146.894,"What happens if you lose, we affirm?"
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3149.913,3156.5,--It will go back to the District Court and the District Court will have to decide whether to certify the case as a class action.
1980.80-202,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3173.628,3176.913,"And suppose the Court refuses to certify the class, then what?"
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3176.913,3184.586,"Then it would go forward as an individual action, as to Mr. Koerner, and there are statutory damages there of $100."
1980.80-202,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3184.586,3190.173,"How about the damages for humiliation, ripping your card up, and all that sort of thing?"
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3192.023,3197.41,"Well, there would be arguments as to whether the $100 statutory damages--"
1980.80-202,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3197.41,3197.91,--Was all?
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3197.91,3200.345,--would preclude such other damages.
1980.80-202,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3212.919,3214.871,But you didn't want to apologize?
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3214.871,3217.223,"--Well, I don't know."
1980.80-202,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3256.948,3265.471,"Didn't you... you answered, I suppose, before the summary judgment motion?"
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3265.471,3267.74,--I believe we did.
1980.80-202,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3268.956,3270.958,Did you deny the fact?
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3270.958,3273.06,I'll check that.
1980.80-202,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3273.06,3274.21,Well that's all right.
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3275.043,3275.326,It's in my records.
1980.80-202,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3275.326,3280.197,--I would think he alleged the facts and that you either denied them or admitted them?
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3280.197,3289.886,"We certainly filed a motion to dismiss, on summary judgment, you have to assume the facts."
1980.80-202,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3289.886,3294.022,"Mr. Greene, let me just ask you a question about... I think Judge Wisdom's theory."
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3311.149,3312.585,That's not--
1980.80-202,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3312.585,3314.568,"He's not a surety, as I understand your--"
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3314.568,3316.953,--That's not clear at all.
1980.80-202,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3330.38,3334.832,--Well what could the individual possibly be doing for which he would accept individual liability that--
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3334.832,3338.633,"Oh, Mr. Justice, that happens all the time."
1980.80-202,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3354.328,3356.278,--But that's in the nature of a surety relationship.
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3356.278,3358.364,"Well, it could be a joint liability."
1980.80-202,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3363.868,3372.874,"Don't you have this agreement, say somebody like U.S. Steel... a very large corporation, they have cards for literally dozens of people, I suppose, do they assume individual liability too?"
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3372.874,3373.624,--Yes.
1980.80-202,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3375.508,3377.325,Then your analogy wouldn't apply there.
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3380.36,3382.079,"--No, but it might well with the Koerner Company."
1980.80-202,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3401.041,3412.082,It seems to me that the most frequent situation where you have an individual on a company card is that everybody expects him to use it for personal purposes.
1980.80-202,2,39404,ronald_j_greene,,3412.082,3421.02,"--Well, you might assume that, but in this case, we have a contract that says that it's a business account, and the record doesn't reflect that."
1980.80-202,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3421.754,3422.337,"Thank you, gentlemen."
