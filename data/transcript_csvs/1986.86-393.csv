1986.86-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.106,"We will hear argument next in No. 86-393, the United States versus James B. Stanley."
1986.86-393,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,54.885,67.275,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in the 1950s the Army conducted tests regarding the effects of LSD, and respondent was one of the servicemen who participated in those tests."
1986.86-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,144.525,151.929,"Well, Mr. Weight, when you say granted final judgment, was there ever a judgment ordered in compliance with the separate document required?"
1986.86-393,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,152.962,157.764,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,200.257,204.478,"Well, but how about the separate instrument requirement of Rule 58?"
1986.86-393,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,204.478,208.68,We contend that this order is a separate document.
1986.86-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,208.68,209.763,You say it satisfies both those rules?
1986.86-393,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,209.763,210.232,Yes.
1986.86-393,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.792,264.498,"Before we leave that point, Mr. Wright, I guess the respondent argues that, on this same order you refer us to, in the next paragraph it says,"
1986.86-393,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,272.004,285.995,"--The clerk is required to enter a final judgment on the docket sheet, and we printed that in Page 2 of our joint appendix."
1986.86-393,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,297.119,300.337,That is in the appendix also?
1986.86-393,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,300.337,301.856,That is in the joint appendix.
1986.86-393,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,301.856,304.475,Yes.
1986.86-393,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,317.047,318.982,"No, that is correct."
1986.86-393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,318.982,322.1,What does that mean?
1986.86-393,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,324.084,328.671,"Well, we do not think that there is anything more to be done."
1986.86-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,562.817,577.961,Are there decisions in the Courts of Appeals as to whether or not the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals on a certified question extends only to the certified question or whether its jurisdiction extends to the whole case?
1986.86-393,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,577.961,579.878,There are such decisions.
1986.86-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.444,1043.981,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1047.266,1065.727,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, if the plaintiff in this case had volunteered for LSD drug testing on behalf of the Army, the government would have a much stronger argument that this was something that was incident to his military service, but that is not what happened in this case."
1986.86-393,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1093.295,1094.847,Did he volunteer?
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1094.847,1097.115,He did not volunteer for LSD drug testing.
1986.86-393,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1132.789,1140.375,Is it alleged in the complaint that he and he alone received the LSD or that others in the same program received it?
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1140.375,1142.744,We have not alleged that others in the same program received it.
1986.86-393,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1149.881,1153.618,"Did you say that, that he alone, or did you just say that he received it?"
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1153.618,1161.206,"We just alleged... we did not make allegations that other soldiers also received it, which was Justice Rehnquist's question."
1986.86-393,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1163.824,1169.045,"Well, I think there is a lot of difference between saying that he alone received it or that he received it."
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1170.812,1173.247,I am not saying that he was the only person who received it.
1986.86-393,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.695,1195.845,xxx was he?
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1195.845,1197.897,--There is no evidence what he was on.
1986.86-393,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.349,1204.301,You mean he went up there for rest and recreation?
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1204.301,1208.853,"--No, he went up there to volunteer for a program that was misrepresented to him."
1986.86-393,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1210.139,1214.824,"Whatever the program was, it was part of the Army, though, wasn't it?"
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1214.824,1221.429,"--Well, whether or not that was an Army program is also in dispute because the complaint alleges otherwise, okay."
1986.86-393,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1223.196,1226.631,How did anyone ever ask him to volunteer or give him the opportunity?
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1228.916,1232.052,--There was a notice that was posted at his Army barracks--
1986.86-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1232.052,1234.404,Why are you suing the Army if you are not sure it is an Army program?
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1237.439,1238.039,--We are not.
1986.86-393,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1267.558,1272.295,"He didn't get leave, did he, from Army duty for this program?"
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1272.295,1281.468,"--The complaint alleges that he was no longer... he was no longer on his active duty service for the time he was up there, that he returned back to his active duties after the month."
1986.86-393,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1286.705,1287.805,But he was still in the Army?
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1287.805,1289.574,"He was still in the Army, yes."
1986.86-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1451.597,1453.297,He made his claim with the Army?
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1453.297,1454.882,--He made his claim with the Army Claims Service.
1986.86-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1454.882,1457.417,So he thought the Army had had something to do with the program at that stage.
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1457.417,1457.867,Initially--
1986.86-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.867,1460.703,You are now telling us you are not sure that it was even the Army.
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1460.703,1465.57,"--Well, we are alleging that the program was... certainly the Army was involved in the program."
1986.86-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1483.549,1488.686,"I assume that all you are telling us is in the record, all this stuff you are telling us is not all extra-record material."
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1488.686,1503.88,"--Everything I am telling you is either in materials that were filed with the District Court when there was an earlier summary judgment motion years ago, there were some documentary materials filed with this Court, and what I am telling you also comes out of the allegations in the complaint, so it is in the record."
1986.86-393,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.363,1664.469,"Would it have made any difference if when they were interviewing him they said, by the way, will you drink this glass of liquid, it has LSD in it, we just want to see how it affects you?"
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1666.902,1674.925,"That would have made a substantial amount of difference because then you wouldn't have a violation of the Nuremberg Code, because you wouldn't have an unwitting test subject."
1986.86-393,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1688.148,1697.522,I figure you probably will would have been suing for giving him LSD without telling him what it might do to him.
1986.86-393,1,39710,richard_a_kupfer,,1697.522,1706.994,"--Well, the Army says that back in the early or late fifties that they themselves did not know what it would do to him."
1986.86-393,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2832.04,2834.723,"I have just a few comments, please."
1986.86-393,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2878.819,2883.073,xxx the regulations giving him LSD or not?
1986.86-393,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2883.073,2887.575,"--No, but--"
1986.86-393,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2887.575,2888.377,No what?
1986.86-393,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2888.377,2889.16,--I would like to mention that the respondent has mischaracterized that.
1986.86-393,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2919.896,2921.764,Was there any consent form involved in this?
1986.86-393,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2921.764,2924.716,We don't have the facts on this.
1986.86-393,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2942.844,2948.415,xxx never had a program of experimenting with LSD or did it?
1986.86-393,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2948.415,2949.498,"--I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1986.86-393,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2949.498,2953.569,Did our government have a program of experimenting with LSD?
1986.86-393,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2953.569,2954.785,"Yes, it did."
1986.86-393,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2954.785,2956.104,On soldiers?
1986.86-393,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2956.104,2958.054,"Yes, it did."
1986.86-393,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2958.054,2959.556,That is admitted?
1986.86-393,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2959.556,2960.173,Yes.
1986.86-393,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3009.404,3014.224,Are there cases that bar a Federal Tort Claims Act for intentional torts?
1986.86-393,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3014.224,3018.526,"Well, there is an intentional tort exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act."
1986.86-393,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3018.526,3018.926,Yes.
1986.86-393,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3018.926,3020.628,I think it is 2680(h).
1986.86-393,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.628,3021.961,Right.
1986.86-393,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3025.881,3031.352,The government has not waived sovereign immunity for intentional torts.
1986.86-393,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3031.352,3036.487,How about suits against the officers?
1986.86-393,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3036.487,3043.41,I am not sure that an intentional tort of the sort somebody hit somebody has actually come up.
1986.86-393,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3054.098,3062.537,"Well, is there any Federal jurisdiction over an ordinary tort claim of one military personnel over another?"
1986.86-393,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3073.429,3074.079,That is right.
1986.86-393,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3081.701,3084.653,What about on base?
1986.86-393,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3084.653,3100.079,"--I am sure we would get into disputes about these matters, but one could think that that would be a normal state law cause of action that one serviceman might have against another."
1986.86-393,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3101.496,3103.448,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
