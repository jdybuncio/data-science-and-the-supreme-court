1977.75-1069,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.772,"We will hear arguments next in 75-1069, Richmond Unified School District against Berg."
1977.75-1069,0,17274,arthur_w_walenta,,50.74,55.37,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please it court.
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,1666.688,1669.882,Mr. Chief Justice and may It please the court.
1977.75-1069,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1690.0,1692.29,Would it make any difference if that were not so?
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,1692.29,1697.968,Well it makes a difference here Mr. Chief Justice because of the nature of the injury.
1977.75-1069,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1697.968,1699.169,On the legal issues.
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,1699.169,1712.961,"It makes a difference with respect to the nature of the injury, that would have been incurred by Mrs. Berg had she been compelled to leave at the time when she was fully able to work for the Richmond School District and teach her kindergartners."
1977.75-1069,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1841.762,1849.627,"What are we supposed to do in this confused state of the record, if you want a summary judgment and disputed affidavits in the District Court?"
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,1849.627,1892.072,"I believe Mr. Justice Rehnquist that the record is not confused on the points as to which this Court has the ability to make determinations of law, I merely wish to point out to the court that the Richmond Unified School District changed its so called compulsory leave policy twice in the course of this litigation, but retained the compulsion in that policy and as the District court observed the compulsory nature of the policy with its assumption of the inability of the individual to work and its coercive element that, that individual's doctor's judgment was to be distrusted and with the effect on the individual of a deprivation of income was regardless of when the compulsion applied."
1977.75-1069,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1892.072,1895.722,"That is agreed on by everybody, by your opponent too?"
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,1895.722,1901.471,I am sure that my opponent disagrees with me with respect to the characterization of the policy as compulsory.
1977.75-1069,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1907.228,1913.061,Well then how does the District Court on your motion for summary judgment decide a question like that?
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,1913.061,1936.08,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in this case there is a local rule which requires a party making a motion for summary judgment to reside undisputed facts and I believe its page is 101 and 102 of our Appendix, those facts which we believed to be undisputed and to be necessary to the District Court's determination of the illegality of this policy are set forth."
1977.75-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2092.074,2095.895,What about this other statute the 1976 statute?
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2095.895,2124.141,"We believe that the 1976 statute would, would not for the adversariness between these parties by the definition of this court in the opinion in Kremens versus Bartley would move the case however, our understanding of the requirements with respect to sufficient adversariness is this, the parties here have a genuine dispute about the legality of the combined policy of mandatory leave and denial of accumulated sick leave pay."
1977.75-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2136.464,2138.961,Where is the injunction?
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2138.961,2151.583,"I believe that the District Court's, the final injunction, the final judgment is printed in the petition for Certiorari Appendix C and that judgment embodies the final provisions."
1977.75-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2151.583,2153.288,What page is it?
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2153.288,2164.035,"I am sorry, it is Appendix C page 46."
1977.75-1069,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.058,2178.097,"Ms Dunlap before you do, let me just get one thing clear, is there no dispute over back pay or any monetary dispute."
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2178.097,2195.225,"There is a monetary dispute between the Richmond School District and all the members of the class, it consists in the position of the class members and under the District Court's injunction this would be appealed that there entitled to accumulate a sick leave pay for everyday of actual disability due to pregnancy."
1977.75-1069,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.225,2196.598,Including the named plaintiff?
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2196.598,2202.056,"That is correct, she is included amongst those who are in need of that relief and who have afforded it below."
1977.75-1069,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2260.772,2263.252,"Ms. Dunlap, let me test that for a moment."
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2274.289,2280.247,"I am sure there is a difference of opinion with respect to that like any other health condition, doctors do tend to vary in their prescriptions."
1977.75-1069,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.247,2287.467,Well then why is it irrational for the school board to say it would like have its own doctor form a judgment on that question?
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2287.467,2303.265,It is discriminatory because no other class of persons who can contemplate disability or who are disabled then have recurring conditions are subjected to that untrusting interventions requirement on the part of the School District.
1977.75-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2356.487,2360.244,The 76th Statute says that you cannot do that anymore.
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2360.244,2369.382,"Well they cannot do it anymore, Mr. Justice Marshall, but in interim there are group of women asked to whom they have done it, as to whom they have denied that compensation."
1977.75-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.382,2371.802,Did you get damages in this case?
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2371.802,2377.042,"Well, the court enjoined them from denying these individuals of their accumulated sick leave pay, but that pay."
1977.75-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2377.042,2381.332,Am I correct that the only relief was an injunction?
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2381.332,2385.334,You are quite correct that the only relief in form is an injunction.
1977.75-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2385.334,2386.509,But that lead to a demand -- payment of money.
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2386.509,2388.208,"Yes, which has been unpaid, yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, thank you."
1977.75-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2388.208,2395.781,"But where in the; all of this does it say anything about money, it says an injunction and counsel fees, that is all."
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2395.781,2398.291,There is money Mr. Justice Marshall tied up --.
1977.75-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2398.291,2400.37,Well where is it the order?
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2400.37,2417.601,"All right, the enjoined them from depriving the plaintiff of her accumulated sick leave pay, she nonetheless has not received that pay, neither has any class member and there is group of people from 1973 to 1975 who by virtue of this District's denial of accumulated sick leave pay, have not received there money."
1977.75-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2426.792,2430.963,The whole injunction is what you pointed out to me in the appendix --
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2430.963,2433.887,It is the judgment at page 46 of Appendix C to the --
1977.75-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2433.887,2435.33,And that is the whole thing?
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2435.33,2438.414,"That is the whole thing, that is right it is."
1977.75-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2513.133,2519.229,What you mean to say is that the court means a word that you stop withholding payment?
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2519.229,2520.149,Yes that is correct.
1977.75-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2520.149,2522.24,Which means pay.
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2522.24,2523.946,Yes in the second section --
1977.75-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2523.946,2525.476,Why have not they been payed if they have --
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2525.476,2532.82,They have not been payed because it -- we viewed it as a money judgment in terms of the payment by the district of this money and therefore stayed in affect by the appeals.
1977.75-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2532.82,2533.697,It was stayed.
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2533.697,2535.949,"It was stayed, that is correct."
1977.75-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2658.444,2659.789,Well the California Statute.
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2659.789,2660.853,"The statutes, we believe --"
1977.75-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2660.853,2663.455,"The California Statute, you are not talking about Title VII now."
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2663.455,2664.906,Title VII required it.
1977.75-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2664.906,2666.102,"Well, what are you talking about?"
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2666.102,2667.389,Oh! I am sorry.
1977.75-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2677.071,2678.155,Just the opposite.
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2678.155,2681.058,But right that the district was in violation of that statute.
1977.75-1069,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2681.058,2685.721,Does that mean you would have had a suit as a matter of state law you could have brought this action in the state court.
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2685.721,2688.748,"It is a possibility I believe, it would certainly not have resolved --"
1977.75-1069,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.748,2694.521,"If it is not more than a possibility, should we get involved in the issue?"
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2694.521,2702.332,"It is our view that the questions before this court are the Title VII rights of the parties, it well may have been that an action could have brought under Sate Law."
1977.75-1069,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2702.332,2706.826,Did either of the lower courts construe the Californian Statue which you are now directing our attention to?
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2706.826,2722.769,"No, but a District Court in a similar case has construed this very statute namely the Oakland Federation of Teachers versus Oakland School District case which is sited in our brief in which the District Court for the Northern District of California found that where that district had argued that this statute afforded them this --"
1977.75-1069,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2722.769,2736.957,So this argument if I get it correctly is another distinction of the General Electric case is that here you are entitled as a matter of the State Law to be paid and in defiance of State Law you were not paid therefore that shows that it is -- what does it show -- what follows from that.
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2736.957,2740.788,"Basically, what it shows is that this employer had no bases."
1977.75-1069,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2763.356,2769.604,"Ms. Dunlap the question and I asked this earlier today and you are going to answer is, how have you made out a prima facie case?"
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2776.631,2798.724,"I hope not to be saying that, we have made our prima facie showing in two ways viewing first this court's language about purposeful discrimination, we submit that the tandem operation of the presumption of disability among this pregnant teachers with a presumption of non disability with respect to the accumulated sick pay, shows the purpose to discriminate against these pregnant women."
1977.75-1069,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2798.724,2807.882,"But they say it is the kind of disability that makes it inappropriate for you to teach, but it is not the kind of disability for which we are going to allow sick leave."
1977.75-1069,1,35708,mary_c_dunlap,,2812.415,2846.398,"It is a discrimination on account of sex because it is a whipsaw (ph) I submit to this court that with General Electrics mandatory leave policy before the court when it decided that case that it would have decided as the descending brethren pointed out to policies in tandem operation, which for one purpose drove women out of employment at a time that they were able and for another purpose deprive them of insurance benefits at a time that they were disabled, that in short this employer is saying for purposes of whatever discretion we may over your leave."
1977.75-1069,2,17274,arthur_w_walenta,,3520.237,3521.355,May it please the Court --
1977.75-1069,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3521.355,3521.981,Mr. Walenta.
1977.75-1069,2,17274,arthur_w_walenta,,3521.981,3525.318,-- I would like to reply very briefly only to a couple of points.
1977.75-1069,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3553.202,3561.213,Mr Wallenta do you concede that there is still is remaining an issue as to whether or not this lady should receive some money.
1977.75-1069,2,17274,arthur_w_walenta,,3561.213,3563.241,Oh there is no question on the sick leave.
1977.75-1069,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3563.241,3564.819,Then the case can not possibly be mooted.
1977.75-1069,2,17274,arthur_w_walenta,,3564.819,3566.469,"That is true,I think on that issue."
1977.75-1069,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3566.469,3570.454,You agree with your sister on the other side that this case is not moot don't you?
1977.75-1069,2,17274,arthur_w_walenta,,3570.454,3573.903,I basically do.
