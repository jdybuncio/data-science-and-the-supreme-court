1955.469,0,40593,richard_p_tinkham_jr,,43.685,47.629,May it please the Court.
1955.469,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,324.95,329.773,Is there any reservation in the stipulation of the jurisdiction?
1955.469,0,40593,richard_p_tinkham_jr,,329.773,331.309,"No, sir, there was not."
1955.469,1,43608,victor_m_harding,,1431.511,1440.231,"If the Court please, I would like to fill in a few more of the facts of this case, which have not been brought out by counsel for the petitioner."
1955.469,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1720.006,1725.231,"Well, I understand that Meehan put in another application for a change."
1955.469,1,43608,victor_m_harding,,1725.231,1726.44,"No, he just put in one --"
1955.469,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1726.44,1730.852,But you said there's going to be (Inaudible) impression of the two.
1955.469,1,43608,victor_m_harding,,1730.852,1747.414,"No, after the initial issuance of the policy, about two months later, Meehan decided to trade in his old for a new one and that was the time when he wrote asking the company if they would change the policy brought in the coverage so it would cover a co-serviceman."
1955.469,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1747.414,1751.106,"Well, was it then the request -- was it a request to change --"
1955.469,1,43608,victor_m_harding,,1751.106,1751.337,Yes.
1955.469,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1751.337,1753.47,-- or inquiry as to whether they would change.
1955.469,1,43608,victor_m_harding,,1753.47,1757.41,"Your Honor, it was both you might say and it would depend on how you construe the letter but --"
1955.469,2,40593,richard_p_tinkham_jr,,2954.06,2954.948,May it please the Court.
1955.469,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3037.74,3041.68,Is that -- is that followed that -- what you referred to?
1955.469,2,40593,richard_p_tinkham_jr,,3041.68,3054.397,I -- the stipulation amending the complaint and amending the answers so are to deny the new allegations as to the new party's plaintiff was the one that Mr. Harding has just referred to.
1955.469,3,43608,victor_m_harding,,3104.995,3114.686,"Yes, it -- it doesn't say that we stipulate that we reserved only certain defenses, Your Honor."
1955.469,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3162.851,3167.401,"How about that language where you do submit to the Court, where is that?"
1955.469,4,40593,richard_p_tinkham_jr,,3167.401,3170.347,"That's paragraph 1, Your Honor, on the page 8."
1955.469,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3170.347,3177.821,"Paragraph 1 which says, “That each of the parties to this stipulation voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the above entitled Court.”"
1955.469,4,40593,richard_p_tinkham_jr,,3177.821,3179.221,"Yes, sir."
1955.469,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3179.221,3184.868,Why wasn't that a voluntary provision (Inaudible)
1955.469,4,40593,richard_p_tinkham_jr,,3184.868,3192.873,"Well, I think it would have been if we haven't maintained in our answer this defense which was set forth there, the defense of the jurisdiction."
1955.469,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3192.873,3200.546,I think that should by implication be read as preserving the right to the jurisdiction which you said you voluntarily permitted to.
1955.469,4,40593,richard_p_tinkham_jr,,3200.546,3210.782,"Well, I agree that two are -- appear to be inconsistent, but I think reading behind the lines, I don't think there was any intent there to waive that defense."
1955.469,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3214.24,3225.712,"Well, when I -- when I asked you the question, I ask where in the stipulation did that occur and you -- you told me it's on page 9 of your brief but that's another stipulation."
1955.469,4,40593,richard_p_tinkham_jr,,3225.712,3225.977,Well --
1955.469,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3225.977,3229.341,This -- this stipulation has got to be for what its worth.
1955.469,4,40593,richard_p_tinkham_jr,,3229.341,3231.343,"The -- the two stipulations are dated the same date, Your Honor."
1955.469,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3231.343,3235.118,"That may be but they refer to other matters, didn't they?"
1955.469,4,40593,richard_p_tinkham_jr,,3235.118,3240.501,"Well, one is a stipulation for judgment and the other is a stipulation adding party's plaintiff."
1955.469,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3249.081,3254.583,"It appears to it, but it's -- how could you make it any more apparent than it is here?"
1955.469,4,40593,richard_p_tinkham_jr,,3254.583,3254.945,Well --
1955.469,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3254.945,3277.365,"What -- what words could you say here that would -- would -- more clearly bring you under the jurisdiction of the Court and to say that “Each of the parties to this stipulation voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the above entitled Court without service of process herein, the same as if personal service had been obtained by each against the other.”"
1955.469,4,40593,richard_p_tinkham_jr,,3280.056,3284.608,By saying that we waive the defense in our answer to the jurisdiction.
1955.469,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3291.824,3296.452,Thank you.
