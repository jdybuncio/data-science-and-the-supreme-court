2002.02-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.993,"We'll hear argument next in number 02-42, Franchise Tax Board of California versus Gilbert Hyatt."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,66.752,72.446,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2002.02-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,151.707,154.346,"Mr. Leatherwood, may I ask you a threshold question?"
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,181.633,186.547,"Justice Ginsberg, we do not join in the chorus to overrule Nevada v. Hall."
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,205.699,216.639,"But the comparison would be between the university, education, which was the... which was the defendant, and the tax authorities."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,247.27,250.697,"I mean, compared... I thank you, Your Honor... in comparing the sovereign functions--"
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,250.697,253.215,Education versus tax.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,253.215,258.416,"--Yeah, and driving an automobile in another state's... on another state's highway--"
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,258.416,259.902,That's not the sovereign function.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,259.902,260.357,--That's not--
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,260.357,260.81,I'm saying that--
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,260.81,261.637,--the sovereign function.
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,261.637,263.95,--it seems like that's apples and oranges to me.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,301.641,310.64,"Well, to answer the Court's question directly, the most significant difference is that the tax function is... is much more significant than the education function."
2002.02-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,310.64,316.213,"Well, that's... that... that... that would be a very difficult premise for us to say, that education is somehow secondary."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,316.213,316.889,Well--
2002.02-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,316.889,324.941,You're... you're saying Nevada can't have a great university... can have a great university by keeping its people within its own borders.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,335.077,338.504,"--No, Your Honor, I would agree with you that that would be a difficult--"
2002.02-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,338.504,344.448,"For the State of California to argue that education is not a core state function is, to me, rather astounding."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,344.448,349.445,"--No, Your Honor, I'm not arguing that education is not a core sovereign function."
2002.02-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,357.618,358.444,"Well, Mr.--"
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,358.444,358.594,--to provide taxation.
2002.02-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,358.594,367.378,"--Leatherwood, we... this court tried to follow a core state function test under the Tenth Amendment."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,403.915,405.605,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.438,438.216,There you have a specific act of Congress that tells the Federal Government to back off.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,440.528,449.983,"But we do have the Full Faith and Credit Clause, which directs that a state is to recognize the public acts of another state."
2002.02-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.215,484.618,"But Nevada did recognize California law to the extent it was similar to Nevada's... that is, saying you had immunity from the negligent acts."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,505.461,507.569,"Absolutely, I agree with the Court on that point."
2002.02-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,508.312,508.312,Why not?
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,508.312,509.221,--the extension of that--
2002.02-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,509.221,510.996,Why do you agree on that point?
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,511.739,517.765,--Because the extension of our immunity law does not cover physical torts or torts--
2002.02-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,517.765,517.971,Oh.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,517.971,518.715,--outside the scope--
2002.02-42,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,518.715,519.457,I see.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,519.457,523.389,"--of course, the scope of... of the... the acts that are incidental to--"
2002.02-42,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.389,523.76,I see.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,537.569,548.376,"--Well, in fact, Your Honor, if they would use the Nevada standard, use the same standard that Nevada applies to its own taxing agencies, then this case would be on a hold."
2002.02-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,557.292,581.236,"But that's not what they're... the Nevada court said, we're going to treat the tax collectors from anywhere who come in to our state and act here, and we're going to... the Nevada Supreme Court said, we're going to apply our rule, and our rule is negligence is immunity; intentional, there isn't."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,594.899,601.853,"--Your Honor, I am not asking this Court to not believe the Nevada Supreme Court."
2002.02-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,616.902,625.752,"Oh, but this... but Nevada Supreme Court, I thought, made very clear that what they were dealing with is tortious conduct, harassing conduct."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,653.516,662.515,"Your Honor, what has happened in this particular case, 97 percent of the conduct that occurred during the course of this audit occurred in California."
2002.02-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,673.661,677.831,"Well, that may be, but the that isn't the issue that we've got in front of us here."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,703.483,711.617,I would absolutely agree with the Court that the issue whether or not Nevada was obligated to apply our immunity laws with respect--
2002.02-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,711.617,711.7,All right.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,711.7,716.53,--with respect to conduct undertaken incidental to this audit.
2002.02-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,716.53,720.988,"May I go back to Justice Stevens' question, because I'm not sure of your answer to it."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,747.82,750.049,"Your Honor, no."
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,777.438,778.098,It doesn't matter.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,821.937,824.332,"--Well... well, I understand that, Your Honor."
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,828.79,829.006,Yes.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,829.006,831.102,--but applying--
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,831.102,831.762,If it did.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,831.762,833.87,--applying it... my... our particular theory--
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,833.87,833.991,Yes.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,833.991,840.39,"--that, yes, we... then Nevada would be obligated under the Full Faith and Credit Clause to apply that particular law."
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,840.39,846.334,"And, therefore, you could not bring the lawsuit in Nevada about somebody beating somebody up."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,846.334,846.706,--If--
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,846.706,847.821,If that were the law in California.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,847.821,850.133,--if that were... if that was the case.
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,850.133,850.449,"Yeah, okay."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,850.449,854.553,"--in this particular case, that's illegal in California and that's illegal in Nevada."
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,854.553,874.903,"So how, then, do we reconcile that position, where we're back to our starting place, with the fact that he could bring an action if on his way down from Lake Tahoe in the state car, he happened to drive a little negligently and ran somebody over?"
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,880.021,882.621,"No, and we're agreeing with Nevada v. Hall."
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,882.621,882.993,I know.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,896.905,897.648,"Yes, I--"
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,897.648,908.711,"You say, if, in fact, that same tax collector beats up somebody, and the California law is that you cannot sue, Nevada cannot apply its own law."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,908.711,910.092,"--That's not what I'm saying, Your Honor."
2002.02-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,936.492,936.708,Okay.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,936.708,937.617,--of that statute.
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,937.617,937.617,I.
2002.02-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,937.617,958.656,"And is the reason that the answer is different in the two cases, the reason that there is something special about tax collection or is the reason that there is a closer connection in the hypo of the beating up for tax collection than the driving the automobile for tax collection?"
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,958.656,959.133,Well--
2002.02-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,959.133,959.755,Which is it?
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,965.243,966.525,"--Well, I think it's both, Your Honor."
2002.02-42,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,988.362,994.527,"Mr. Leatherwood, if I understand your position, it would be exactly the same if a hundred percent of the conduct had occurred in Nevada."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,994.527,996.99,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2002.02-42,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,998.438,1001.243,But the problem I have... may I just ask this question.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1032.284,1046.94,"--Well, Your Honor, in this particular case, as I've indicated, according to our reading of Nevada precedent, published precedent, that they would not permit this lawsuit to proceed until the tax process has been concluded."
2002.02-42,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1065.433,1069.315,"Well, we understood the reasoning of the Nevada Supreme Court to say they would."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1071.377,1073.03,"--No, absolutely not, Your Honor."
2002.02-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1103.371,1109.315,"--But certainly this sort of thing isn't the kind of thing you could have exhausted your remedies on, is it?"
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1109.315,1111.173,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2002.02-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1131.69,1133.798,"Now, what is... was your answer to the question?"
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1137.513,1138.506,--Part--
2002.02-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1138.506,1143.086,--Suppose the tax collector were driving negligently in Las Vegas.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1147.71,1152.623,"--I think, under Nevada v. Hall, he would be... he would be subject to negligent liability."
2002.02-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1165.831,1181.23,--So suppose that we... we conclude that footnote 24 does not provide sufficient guidance for us to have a stable jurisprudence and that you will lose unless Nevada versus Hall is overruled.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1184.286,1186.059,Your Honor--
2002.02-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1186.059,1190.889,"I know you don't want to entertain that possibility, but suppose that's what we conclude."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1190.889,1207.32,"--Well, we... we've thought about this, Your Honor, of course, and we would accept a win, if that's the Court's direction, through overruling Nevada v. Hall, but it's our contention that the Court doesn't have to go that far to get... to get to this point."
2002.02-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1216.858,1225.114,"But then that, as I suggested earlier, is a difficult thing to do, because there are congressional statutes that mandate that here."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1246.951,1248.316,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1269.408,1271.555,What... what about a congressional statute?
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1325.963,1334.219,"--Well, that still creates... that still creates the situation where Nevada is supervising and managing California's tax practices."
2002.02-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1334.219,1336.532,Back to activities happening in Nevada.
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1336.532,1336.82,Yeah.
2002.02-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1376.49,1384.292,"Well, they would have to show as an intentional... whatever that means under Nevada law... not just negligent when they--"
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1384.292,1396.818,"Well, the intentional act here is that California created a tax system in bad faith to... bad faith to extort an exit... an exit tax from... from a taxpayer."
2002.02-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1396.818,1405.43,"--I thought that, again, the Nevada Supreme Court said, we are not going to touch the question of where this man was domiciled."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1435.318,1453.728,"Yeah, and I would... I would direct the Court to Joint Appendix 133, where... where the Court would... the Nevada courts have indicated that almost all the action in this... in this lawsuit occurred in California."
2002.02-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1455.009,1458.945,"Well, you... you recognized that there were two trips into California."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1458.945,1459.938,"--Actually, Your Honor--"
2002.02-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1459.938,1460.886,"I mean, to Nevada."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1460.886,1467.74,"--Actually, Your Honor, I believe there were three trips, and they were short trips... they were trips of extremely short duration."
2002.02-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1467.74,1477.232,"And what was there about... on one of those trips, there was a trespass on his property and rummaging through his trash."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1477.232,1481.236,"Well, that's not part of... that's not part of the allegations of the... of the complaint itself."
2002.02-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1483.631,1497.006,"It was a more... a more general interference with his privacy, but those were examples that were alleged, if not in the complaint, somewhere."
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1497.006,1518.1,"--No, there has been deposition testimony that there... on one of the trips, that the investigator looked at the timing of Mr.... of Respondent's trash delivery and also looked at... determined whether or not Respondent was receiving any mail at that particular location."
2002.02-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1563.796,1564.622,"Do you want to reserve your time, Mr. Leatherwood?"
2002.02-42,0,24226,felix_leatherwood,,1564.622,1565.92,"--reserve the balance of my time, thank you."
2002.02-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1565.92,1566.563,Very well.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1568.132,1576.139,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-42,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1641.486,1647.885,"Mr. Farr, can I ask you, do you think they were compelled by the Full Faith and Credit Clause to grant immunity on the negligence claim?"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1647.885,1654.739,"--That's an interesting question, Justice Stevens, because Nevada officials themselves have immunity."
2002.02-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1684.954,1687.926,"Well, are principles of comity dictated by the Constitution?"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1688.381,1688.581,--They are--
2002.02-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1688.581,1691.148,--suppose Nevada said they were not going to grant comity?
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1691.148,1692.157,"--That's correct, yes."
2002.02-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1706.752,1713.522,"Well, is it your position then the private plaintiff can always bring suit against a state in the courts of another state?"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1713.522,1725.578,"--Well, the first question, of course, is whether the court has legislative... the first Full Faith and Credit question is whether the court in which the suit is brought has legislative jurisdiction."
2002.02-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1732.265,1733.008,"Well, then under due precedent."
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1734.456,1738.747,"--So assuming that they've satisfied that, they are entitled to bring a suit."
2002.02-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1760.129,1760.584,It's very--

2002.02-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1760.872,1782.049,"--it's very odd to me that California can't be sued in its own courts and it can't be sued in a federal court, but it can be sued in a Nevada court, which, if we follow that, the question really is has the... has the least interest in maintaining the dignity of the State of California."
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1782.049,1785.392,"--Well, there are two... two factors there, Justice Kennedy."
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1918.895,1922.444,Is... how does Alden fit into this?
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1954.107,1954.395,Uh-huh.
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1954.395,1956.419,Do we get a different result?
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1956.419,1962.902,"Okay, I think that is not a question that is within the notion of what is the question in this case."
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1962.902,1963.068,"No, no, well--"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1963.068,1963.234,I'm sorry.
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1963.44,1963.812,"--you see, what I--"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1963.812,1965.11,--Excuse me.
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1965.11,1965.11,"--nonetheless, although--"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1965.11,1966.225,"No, I--"
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1966.225,1971.88,"--what I'm trying to do is... is sort out what, in my mind, are a set of impossible anomalies, and that's why I ask you that question."
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1971.88,1972.706,--I'm sorry.
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1974.026,1974.026,Go ahead.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1974.026,1979.31,"What I... I reserve the point, of course, always, that I don't believe this is within the question presented."
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1979.31,1979.493,"Yeah, yeah, of course."
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1979.493,1993.489,"But I actually was going... what I meant to say is that I don't think it's the same kind of question in the sense that I think still when you're talking about enforcement of a federal cause of action in another state, that is still really a federal-state question."
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1993.489,1993.611,"See, but--"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1993.611,1993.794,That's still--
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1993.794,1994.232,"--your answer, then--"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1994.232,1995.18,--an evolving question.
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1995.18,2005.211,--your answer to my question is Alden cannot be avoided simply by the Maine citizen walking into a New Hampshire court and bringing the same case.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2005.211,2005.749,That's correct.
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2005.749,2005.915,All right.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2005.915,2006.824,I think that is--
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2006.824,2007.75,And I would guess that's right.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2007.75,2008.476,--still a federal-state--
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2008.476,2008.476,"All right, assuming that's right--"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2008.476,2008.676,--I think that is still a federal-state issue.
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2008.676,2016.072,"--assuming that's right, now, look at the tremendous anomaly, which you were just about to address, and I want to be sure you do."
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2038.652,2039.767,That's right.
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2039.767,2059.995,"And the only difference between the two cases is that his cause of action is federal law in the first case, and he can't sue the state; but state law in the second case, and he can, which, of course, means that the law of New Hampshire binds Maine in a way that federal law cannot."
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2067.138,2067.138,--Well--
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2067.138,2068.047,--if you can give it.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2073.786,2074.629,--That's correct.
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.647,2079.936,Uh-huh.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2079.936,2098.14,"--in distinguishing the opinion in Nevada versus Hall, when it noted that when you get into the situation of a state being sued in the courts of another state and, as in Nevada versus Hall, under a state cause of action, you have now implicated the sovereignty of a second sovereign."
2002.02-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2108.914,2111.105,But that seems to make their case even harder.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2131.91,2131.993,"Well, I think that--"
2002.02-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2131.993,2133.275,--in the Eleventh Amendment.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2133.275,2135.959,"--I mean, I think that there are two things going on."
2002.02-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2189.54,2195.197,"Well, doesn't our original jurisdiction as the states between states bear something on this question?"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2195.197,2196.599,It bears a little bit.
2002.02-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2209.315,2222.44,The idea that the framers would provide for its original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court in... for suits by one state against another suggests they thought it might be pretty hard to bring such a suit anywhere else.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2222.44,2226.405,"Well, and they... certainly as a practical matter, they would have been right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.02-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2266.733,2278.046,"Mr. Farr, have you found other examples around the country of suits by citizens of one state against another state in the other state's courts?"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2278.046,2278.501,I--
2002.02-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2278.501,2281.927,"Is this relatively rare, or is it happening?"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2284.24,2288.615,"--It's relatively rare, and... but there have been some suits."
2002.02-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2310.906,2310.906,Uh-huh.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2310.906,2311.749,--of that state.
2002.02-42,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2354.707,2355.655,"Mr. Farr, are you saying--"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2355.655,2356.109,--accept.
2002.02-42,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2356.109,2358.255,"--that that, too, is just a matter of comity?"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2358.255,2359.248,I do think that that's--
2002.02-42,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2359.248,2359.498,Doesn't--
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2359.498,2359.703,--just a matter--
2002.02-42,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2359.703,2366.64,--doesn't the Privileges and Immunity Clause of Article IV have something to say?
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2381.622,2385.216,--If one granted lesser immunity?
2002.02-42,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2385.588,2385.959,Yes.

2002.02-42,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2420.145,2421.26,"I mean, I thought--"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2421.26,2421.426,--I would have thought not.
2002.02-42,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2421.426,2427.825,"--that would go to individual liability, but it would... it would not affect this question, but I may be wrong."
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2427.825,2431.085,"Well, no, I... that would be my assumption, also, Justice Souter."
2002.02-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2470.799,2479.465,"Well, there is some reluctance to say that California officials can run amok in Nevada without Nevada being able to do anything about it."
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2491.809,2495.979,"Well, I mean, let me suggest a couple of other possibilities, Justice Kennedy, as well."

2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2580.32,2591.959,"Right, but what... what... what is the... I don't want to... I don't want you to get distracted, because I thought Justice Ginsberg and maybe Justice Kennedy and I were driving at the same problem, which is that imagine Nevada v. Hall is good law."
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2602.173,2602.527,--Correct.
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2602.527,2606.614,--(b) interstate compacts... that was what you were suggesting.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2606.614,2606.985,And... and--
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2606.985,2606.985,All right.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2606.985,2607.707,--if I may--
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2607.707,2607.707,"Yeah, the--"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2607.707,2611.422,"--if I may intercede, it doesn't necessarily have to be a compact."
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2611.588,2612.414,"--Right, some--"

2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2612.614,2614.932,--kind of a voluntary action by the states.

2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2671.214,2671.957,--It's--
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2671.957,2672.412,Or--
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2672.412,2673.526,--it seems exhaustive--

2002.02-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2730.988,2733.673,But can you say that categorically and absolutely?
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2736.933,2745.728,"Well, what... the permutations and facts, I think, go particularly to what constitutes legislative jurisdiction."

2002.02-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2792.373,2792.744,THE COURT Yes.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2792.744,2793.299,That's correct.
2002.02-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2828.221,2830.722,Comity is something like a hearty handshake.

2002.02-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2941.358,2943.094,Are there no extremes?

2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3089.555,3089.927,--Right.
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3089.927,3091.291,--but what is the answer?
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3091.291,3098.554,"Well, I mean, I still think that, in the end, the answer is that this is a matter that one trusts to the judgment of states--"
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3098.554,3100.801,"So the answer is if they want to do that, they can do it."
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3100.801,3105.325,"--that if, in fact, there is a question about discovery, that--"
2002.02-42,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3105.325,3105.613,Uh-huh.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3105.613,3118.04,"--I mean, that I... accepting the characterization, although I dispute it to some extent, but to the extent there's a question about discovery, that is simply part and parcel of the states being able to exercise their jurisdiction."
2002.02-42,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3118.04,3118.412,I thought discovery was--
2002.02-42,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3118.412,3118.866,--Okay.
2002.02-42,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3118.866,3120.435,--interlocutory.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3130.179,3134.516,"--Well, there's certainly nothing specifically in the question presented about discovery."
2002.02-42,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3166.959,3167.414,Mr. Farr--
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3167.414,3168.695,Our view is... yeah?
2002.02-42,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3168.695,3180.334,"--do I understand... your comity argument basically is... it's kind a self-executing thing, because each time a state has to answer the comity question, it asks the question, what would I do if the tables were reversed?"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3186.489,3187.027,Well--
2002.02-42,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3187.027,3193.176,"--well, that's the rule that seems to have been developed without any overriding constitutional command order here."
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3193.176,3194.102,"--That's correct, Justice Stevens."
2002.02-42,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3209.689,3212.289,"What if the... what if the case came, and they didn't do it?"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3230.865,3232.536,I certainly think that's possible.
2002.02-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3250.018,3251.011,What would be the underlying--
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3256.888,3269.792,"The... I suppose, I mean, based on what California has said before... said up to now, it would bring it under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, that it would say that there is some requirement--"
2002.02-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3269.792,3273.961,"Well, but we wouldn't need an original action for the Full Faith and Credit Clause."
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3275.159,3276.069,--That's correct.
2002.02-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3276.441,3283.478,So what's the... what would an original action... there was... there's no underlying substantive standard to apply?
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3283.478,3288.124,"--I mean, the question would be, is there... obviously, the question that's being raised."
2002.02-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3292.666,3292.682,We haven't--
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3292.682,3293.675,--that says--
2002.02-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3293.675,3300.567,"--in boundary cases, though, adopted, as a federal rule, something maybe different from the law of either state."
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3300.567,3301.021,--That's correct.
2002.02-42,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3329.462,3330.455,It's not simply that.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3330.455,3330.693,--is that entitles you to stop it.
2002.02-42,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3330.693,3332.617,It's not simply that it's a prior action pending.
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3348.288,3356.916,"it... in fact, the Nevada court dismissed the declaratory judgment action precisely because it didn't want to get into the question that was at issue in the California proceeding."
2002.02-42,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3356.916,3359.888,"Yes, but what about the intrusive discovery?"
2002.02-42,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3359.888,3369.465,"Well, most of the... most of the other material... with one exception, most of the other issues involved things that have nothing to do with the merits of the California inquiry."
2002.02-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3395.35,3396.586,"Thank you, Mr. Farr."
2002.02-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3396.586,3399.437,"Mr. Leatherwood, you have five minutes remaining."
2002.02-42,2,24226,felix_leatherwood,,3399.437,3402.037,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2002.02-42,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3502.469,3504.576,"Thank you, Mr. Leatherwood."
