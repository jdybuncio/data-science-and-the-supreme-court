2009.08-1470,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.229,"We'll hear argument first this morning in case 08-1470, Berghuis v. Thompkins."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,7.09,23.74,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In rejecting Mr. Thompkins's Miranda claim and ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the Michigan courts did not unreasonably apply clearly established Supreme Court precedent."
2009.08-1470,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,77.963,80.837,But he didn't -- he didn't waive them.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,90.582,92.629,But--
2009.08-1470,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,92.629,95.285,--that he was waiving the right to remain silent.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,104.453,114.966,"--Although in Butler this Court noted that -- that Butler himself had remained silent and did not answer the -- answer at all, or remained silent when asked whether he wished to waive his right to counsel."
2009.08-1470,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,133.691,145.094,"Could you tell me without more detail, which is what the circuit court said, about what the limited responses -- I'm using your word -- were."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,148.529,148.981,--Well--
2009.08-1470,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,148.981,160.508,"Meaning if all he said was, yes, I want them in, that's much different than saying, if someone had asked him, do you want to leave, and he shakes his head no."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,167.991,171.598,--I have to carefully delineate between waiver and invocation.
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,181.188,186.03,"That happened about 2 hours and 15 minutes into the exercise, didn't it?"
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,186.03,186.357,--That's right.
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,187.137,187.496,Okay.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,192.698,193.415,"--Well, we--"
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,193.415,197.054,Would you say that that's -- that's gone past the point where--
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,197.054,205.614,"--Well, this -- if you're looking at what has been clearly established for this Court, this Court has never -- I mean, one of the arguments raised against the position I'm advocating is that there is an immediacy requirement."
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,209.392,214.142,"--In Butler he said: I will talk to you, but I am not signing any forms."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,214.142,214.61,That's right.
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,222.386,225.338,"What they say is, ""a course of conduct"" -- we will not hold --"
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,232.727,233.413,--Right.
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,233.413,235.632,--But the prosecution's burden is great.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,235.632,236.786,Right.
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,252.217,259.618,"But going back to Justice Sotomayor's question, is there anything during the 2 hours and 15 minutes that could suggest a waiver?"
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,259.618,264.274,The -- the -- the waiver occurs at the time that he answered the question.
2009.08-1470,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,271.161,277.767,So what do we do with our case law that says that you can't infer waiver simply from the confession?
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,277.767,279.159,"--Well, the--"
2009.08-1470,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,279.159,280.032,"I mean, we have said that."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,283.156,283.702,"--Well, the--"
2009.08-1470,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,283.702,284.049,--by the Court.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,284.049,291.684,"--The courts on direct review have allowed -- where there's a knowing reception of one's rights, have allowed the answers themselves to provide the evidence that the person did waive his rights."
2009.08-1470,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,291.887,302.489,"Well, I think certainly in -- in Butler, if someone in their confession says, I know I don't have to talk to you, but I want to, that that would be using those words."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,302.489,302.801,--But that would be--
2009.08-1470,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,302.801,303.254,So how can you say--
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,303.254,303.893,"--That would be an express waiver, though."
2009.08-1470,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,303.893,313.732,--How can you say that an appeal to someone's religious position after 2 and a quarter hours is a voluntary waiver?
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,313.732,324.166,"Well, if you look at what this Court has provided in terms of guidance regarding what constitutes a lengthy interrogation, Miranda notes that a lengthy interrogation would be strong evidence against there being a valid waiver."
2009.08-1470,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,330.694,338.736,We didn't say -- we don't have any decision that says the police are home free for 2 and a quarter hours.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,343.485,343.765,--Right.
2009.08-1470,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,343.765,363.524,"But we -- we have no decision that says that the police, faced with a silent suspect, goes after that suspect, questioning him incessantly for 2 and -- 2 hours and 15 minutes, that that is not lengthy."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,363.524,373.394,"Well, I think it's important to remember that the factual record here was established by the State court, and the factual record isn't that he remained absolutely silent, but that he participated--"
2009.08-1470,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,373.394,375.597,"He said ""yeah"", ""no"", and ""I don't know""."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,375.597,375.909,--Right.
2009.08-1470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.421,380.686,Wait.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,386.076,387.249,"--No, and in fact--"
2009.08-1470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.249,389.904,And that there can't be a waiver after 2 and a quarter hours?
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,389.904,391.137,"--No, there's no case law to that effect."
2009.08-1470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.137,395.072,"And, therefore, there's no clearly established Supreme Court law that 2 and a quarter hours is too long."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,395.072,396.448,That's the position that--
2009.08-1470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.448,397.306,Isn't that the name of the game here?
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,397.306,397.852,--That's the position--
2009.08-1470,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,397.852,409.457,"Is there a clearly established rule that in all of the circumstances of the case, we can find that there is coercion, time being one aspect of those circumstances?"
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,409.457,410.443,--I think that's right.
2009.08-1470,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,411.582,418.718,"And so that is a clearly established rule, and then it's a question whether 2 and a half, 3 and a half, 4 and a half suffices."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,418.718,419.03,--Right.
2009.08-1470,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,439.21,439.553,The question--
2009.08-1470,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,439.553,447.862,"But your -- your position is that if -- same facts, but it's 10 hours instead of 2 and a half, is that a closer case, at least?"
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,448.283,457.908,"--That's a very different case, because there is case law -- like I cited Blackburn was an interview that ran 8 or 9 hours, and this Court found that that person was probably incompetent or insane."
2009.08-1470,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,464.046,469.76,"--And does that show that -- that the circumstances are coercive, so that even if there were a waiver it would be--"
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,469.76,470.275,--Right.
2009.08-1470,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,476.038,484.598,"--The question, of course, is not whether we think 2 and a quarter hours under all the circumstances is -- is too long under our precedent."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,489.266,489.937,That's right.
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,511.895,517.612,I thought Miranda held that you can't question a person unless he waives his right.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,517.612,519.456,"--No, Miranda in fact talks about--"
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,519.456,524.202,You can question him even after he -- it's clear that he hadn't waived his right.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,527.154,531.451,"--Warnings -- warnings is a prerequisite to questioning, but the waiver is not."
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,531.794,533.292,"--No, I'm not talking about the waiver."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,552.208,552.988,--If there is a--
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,552.988,554.626,"Is that clear law, yes or no?"
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,554.626,556.424,"--Yes, that if there is--"
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,556.424,556.783,"Okay, yes."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,574.821,575.663,--No.
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,576.959,579.083,For the question is not this.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,613.197,614.539,--Yes.
2009.08-1470,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,646.775,650.258,--You're saying there's a difference between a waiver and a failure to assert?
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,650.258,653.49,"--Yes, exactly."
2009.08-1470,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,661.831,669.283,"You want to change the Miranda rule to say: Tell someone their rights, and unless they explicitly say"
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,683.103,696.912,"--Butler states that where there was silence after the provision of the Miranda warnings, silence, that where the subsequent conduct, where knowing reception of rights and the course of conduct indicates waiver--"
2009.08-1470,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,696.912,699.816,There wasn't -- there wasn't silence in Butler.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,702.035,703.065,--I understand that's the facts of Butler.
2009.08-1470,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,714.405,717.496,My -- but we go back to the point you made earlier.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,722.211,725.476,"--No, because there could have been actions taken by the police during the course of this interview."
2009.08-1470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.618,737.88,"I don't understand how this person could just sit there for 2 hours and didn't want to be interrogated and doesn't say: You know, I don't want to answer your questions."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,743.143,744.22,That's right.
2009.08-1470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.22,749.828,"Why shouldn't we have a rule which simply says if you don't want to be interrogated, all you have to say is"
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,751.232,752.327,Mr. Thompkins--
2009.08-1470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.327,754.889,"That's nice and clear, wouldn't be any problem at all."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,762.369,764.556,--I think that that kind of cuts to the nub of what Miranda says.
2009.08-1470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,785.11,791.529,"Why should the police have to play this game of, you know, an hour and a half, 2 hours, 2 hours and 15 minutes, 5 hours, 7 hours?"
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,801.18,805.088,"--I think that's right, that here Mr. Thompkins at any point could have said: ""I want to stop""--"
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,805.088,806.46,What would you do with Miranda's statement
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,848.053,848.724,--It's a--
2009.08-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,848.724,852.316,"I grant you, you might argue for a change in the law."
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,852.316,862.489,"--But -- but this language from Miranda that says the silence of the accused after warnings are given would not be sufficient, that's right, but Butler then fully explained."
2009.08-1470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.649,919.162,Is there any difference between -- between waiving your right and a failure to assert your right?
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,919.162,926.862,"Yes, there is a difference, that here Mr. Thompkins did not assert his right."
2009.08-1470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.673,929.877,Is every failure to assert a waiver?
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,929.877,941.447,"--No, because at the point -- the point at which Mr. Thompkins waived is when he acts inconsistent with the exercise of his rights."
2009.08-1470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,944.789,945.694,What about before that?
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,947.694,948.521,Before -- in that--
2009.08-1470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,948.521,949.676,He hasn't asserted his right.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,950.471,950.877,--Right.
2009.08-1470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.25,953.705,--He has done neither.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,953.705,954.656,He has does neither.
2009.08-1470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,954.656,955.876,He has neither waived nor asserted.
2009.08-1470,0,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,955.876,963.356,"And there's nothing -- the way the Miranda rule works is that the waiver is a -- is a prerequisite for the -- for admission of the evidence, but not for the interrogation itself."
2009.08-1470,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,970.446,970.992,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,987.077,994.529,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent's confession was properly admitted at his trial."
2009.08-1470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1055.599,1056.878,So do you read -- yes.
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1066.123,1066.467,No.
2009.08-1470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1066.467,1068.277,"--Okay, you do not."
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1068.277,1068.87,No.
2009.08-1470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1068.87,1070.789,So are you going to go on -- because this is right where you are.
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1080.066,1089.734,"As long as the warnings are given, the accused has been told of his rights, and that the police will respect his rights, and questioning can proceed."
2009.08-1470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1129.702,1136.92,But why isn't that language that you quote a negative inference that there must be a waiver?
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1136.92,1145.195,"Well, if you look back at the language -- the other language in Miranda, it says that a waiver is a prerequisite to the admission of the evidence at trial."
2009.08-1470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1166.284,1173.372,So there's a difference between waiving at the time of the interrogation and then waiving it at the time of trial?
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1174.277,1174.792,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.523,1231.304,"But in this case, it was the fact of the concession -- the confession that constituted the waiver."
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1231.304,1235.176,"--That shows that he decided to talk, but the confession itself isn't enough."
2009.08-1470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1265.647,1267.663,But I just want to make sure where we are.
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1267.663,1268.225,Yes.
2009.08-1470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1268.225,1273.068,"You're not -- you're conceding, it seems to me, that there must be a waiver?"
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1273.068,1275.848,Before the evidence can be admitted at trial.
2009.08-1470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1275.848,1279.549,I just don't understand -- why -- why can't--
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1279.549,1279.83,Okay.
2009.08-1470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1280.423,1281.939,--We have to guide the police.
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1281.939,1283.296,--Yes.
2009.08-1470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1283.296,1287.781,"Why don't we tell the police, there must be a waiver before you can continue to interrogate?"
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1287.781,1296.496,"That would -- that would exact a substantial price on law enforcement, and that's the exact argument that Justice Brennan made in the Butler case that was rejected."
2009.08-1470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1301.523,1306.553,"I don't know why you didn't answer Justice Stevens's questions by saying, Justice Stevens, I don't care about waiver."
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1312.582,1313.268,Yes.
2009.08-1470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1315.799,1318.548,Why do you say it would change the police's behavior?
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1363.104,1364.122,Not every police--
2009.08-1470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1364.122,1364.918,I mean the Respondent.
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1364.918,1365.308,--manual says that.
2009.08-1470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1379.458,1381.24,Which -- which are the police manuals that go your way?
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1382.504,1387.063,"I'm sorry, I don't -- I don't have the specific citations from the brief."
2009.08-1470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.315,1434.029,"Well, you're saying there -- there's a difference, I -- I assume, between not waiving and positively asserting your right not to be interrogated?"
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1434.029,1435.215,That's exactly right.
2009.08-1470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.901,1443.006,"So, if -- if he had -- here he simply refused to sign the -- the Miranda form, right?"
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1443.006,1443.77,--That's right.
2009.08-1470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.77,1445.849,Which would have -- which would been the -- the waiver.
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1457.5,1458.857,Then the interrogation stops.
2009.08-1470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1458.857,1460.125,Okay.
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1460.125,1460.92,And that--
2009.08-1470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1460.92,1464.839,So -- so he has the right to terminate the whole thing by asserting his right.
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1472.369,1472.822,--Right.
2009.08-1470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1483.971,1486.393,But there also assumes there has to be a waiver.
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1486.393,1498.168,"--Yes, at the time that the person makes the inculpatory statements that are going at be introduced at trial, it must be the case that he decided he was going to talk to the police knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily."
2009.08-1470,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1498.168,1498.496,Excuse me.
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1581.432,1582.633,Right.
2009.08-1470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1595.927,1611.435,"Unless, I assume, that you -- you -- you acknowledge that if the interrogation had go on -- had gone on for so long that it had become coercive, then that -- that -- that last statement would not -- would not be a voluntary waiver."
2009.08-1470,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1611.435,1612.356,That's right.
2009.08-1470,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1617.291,1618.835,"Thank you, Ms. Saharsky."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1622.633,1637.425,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When I review Miranda, I find language from Miranda that says that you have to have a -- an advice of rights and a waiver before you question."
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1653.667,1654.84,What happens when you read Butler?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1654.84,1661.741,"Butler, I think, is an interesting case, because Butler is mostly aimed at the right to counsel."
2009.08-1470,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1684.765,1691.808,"Your argument is that you can infer waiver of the right to counsel from conduct, but you can't infer waiver of the right to remain silent from conduct?"
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1691.808,1693.512,"Essentially, yes."
2009.08-1470,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1693.512,1697.899,What's your best authority for that proposition?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1697.899,1703.194,Let me make sure that I -- that I said yes to the right thing.
2009.08-1470,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1753.252,1765.45,"So, basically what you're saying is that if the defendant here had said at the beginning, I don't know whether I -- I want to talk to you or not, but I'm going to listen to your questions and I might answer some and I might answer others -- that would be a different case?"
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1765.45,1766.733,"--Yes, absolutely."
2009.08-1470,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1767.95,1775.105,And where is there -- what Supreme Court case establishes the distinction between those two situations clearly?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1775.105,1784.397,"Well, Davis is a case that talks about the assertion of the right to counsel, but does not apply to the right to remain silent."
2009.08-1470,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1805.045,1805.872,I'm not sure I really understand.
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1805.872,1812.451,"It depends on what you -- what you need to make ""it"", it depends on what ""it"" is."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1841.686,1853.84,"Well, Justice Scalia, I just read you page 475 from Miranda that says the requirement is warnings and waiver, and that's not, as they said, a preliminary ritual."
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1858.399,1865.006,But does that make it clear that -- that there has to be a waiver before the interrogation can continue?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1867.817,1872.8,"--Again, Butler is really a right to counsel case."
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.8,1874.612,They're both under -- they're both under Miranda.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1876.484,1886.312,"In Butler the -- the waiver, the voluntary act of the person being interrogated really occurred very, very early."
2009.08-1470,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1909.066,1914.703,I thought your answer was that there does not have to be a waiver before questioning can occur.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1914.703,1915.983,"No, there must be a waiver."
2009.08-1470,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1916.829,1917.25,There must be--
2009.08-1470,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1917.25,1918.735,"Well, Miranda does not say that."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1942.254,1942.633,--Okay.
2009.08-1470,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1942.633,1944.583,--in the absence of some special circumstance.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1944.583,1950.112,"In this case, because it went -- because the interrogation lasted so long--"
2009.08-1470,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1950.112,1951.032,Am I right?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1957.625,1960.749,--Um--
2009.08-1470,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1960.749,1962.371,I'm asking because I don't know.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1963.139,1965.245,--And I -- and I want to answer you with what -- what I read.
2009.08-1470,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1975.977,1980.333,"--So, what if the person says: I'm not waiving, but I'm not saying that I will never waive."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1982.365,1983.722,--I think you've got a waiver.
2009.08-1470,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1983.722,1985.157,When he says--
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1985.157,1985.266,You've got a waiver.
2009.08-1470,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1985.266,1985.906,--I'm not waiving?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1985.906,1989.607,But he's willing to talk to the police.
2009.08-1470,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2011.209,2011.787,Can I interrupt?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2021.969,2025.33,--I think he is engaging in a conversation.
2009.08-1470,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2025.33,2025.642,That's a waiver.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2025.642,2031.842,I think he's engaging in a conversation with the police and that the police at that point can continue to talk.
2009.08-1470,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2042.227,2043.151,"Well, he -- he didn't say anything."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2055.614,2069.671,"--What is key, I think, in your -- in your hypothetical and in Justice Alito's hypothetical, is that you have a defendant that feels comfortable, that is not being oppressed by this coercive atmosphere."
2009.08-1470,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2079.51,2083.772,May I -- just refresh my recollection.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2088.365,2092.737,"Justice Stevens, that's kind of iffy."
2009.08-1470,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2094.362,2095.376,Because that was present in Butler.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2095.376,2098.875,"--Yes, the police officer in this case said either"
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.448,2107.84,It was read to him.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2107.84,2109.493,"Yes, it was read to him."
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.493,2112.679,And they had him read a portion of the Miranda warning.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2112.679,2113.884,I don't think they had him read a portion--
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.884,2114.524,Huh?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2114.524,2115.008,--Justice Scalia.
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.008,2115.476,What?
2009.08-1470,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2115.476,2119.676,"I thought, in order to test his knowledge of English, they asked him to read one or two paragraphs."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2119.676,2119.817,Okay.
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.817,2119.926,"Yes, they had him read--"
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2119.926,2123.923,"I guess it was just that they didn't ask him to write anything, so that they didn't know whether he could write in English."
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.938,2129.515,"--So I -- boy, I -- what more do you need?"
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2129.515,2130.407,You need--
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2130.407,2132.81,"I mean, he -- he's listening when -- when they read it to him."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2136.467,2146.524,"--You are presuming that a defendant thinks that they've got the kind of power to look at a police officer and say,"
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2148.305,2153.442,"Maybe -- maybe he doesn't want to talk for the moment, but he does want to listen."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2194.769,2196.021,What--
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2196.021,2197.3,--he -- he sat there and listened.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2201.753,2213.092,"--There is nothing in -- on this record that indicates that he wanted to listen to them as opposed to what Justice Alito's hypothetical is, where the gentleman says: Well, I'm not going to say anything, but I want to hear what you have to say."
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2214.091,2220.072,"Well, we have it to the extent that he was told he had right to remain silent and he didn't say, I'm not going to talk to you."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2220.072,2224.896,There's no clearly established law that says that he has to assert his right to remain silent.
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2224.896,2229.116,"Is it there any clearly established law the other way, which is the pertinent question?"
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2229.116,2238.861,"I think that because there is the presumption of the -- the privilege is a presumptive right, that he does not have to assert it."
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2254.373,2256.463,We're not talking -- we're not talking about the Fifth Amendment right.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2265.209,2266.633,"--Well, when--"
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2266.633,2270.38,There's no suggestion that there's -- that the statements are not voluntary.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2272.486,2272.938,--Right.
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2304.177,2305.939,"What if he said, do you want to remain silent?"
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2305.939,2307.769,--He could -- that's fine.
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2307.769,2309.394,And he doesn't answer either one.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2309.394,2312.581,Then -- then he's not cooperating.
2009.08-1470,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2319.451,2327.513,Then you're saying then that the defendant has to -- never has to invoke his right?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2328.48,2333.525,--The state of the -- the state of the law is a defendant does not have to invoke his right to remain silent.
2009.08-1470,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2342.474,2345.832,--Was the Miranda warning adequate in this case?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2363.716,2365.342,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2381.069,2388.578,"You say you don't have to invoke your rights, but Butler also says that you can impliedly waive them."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2390.407,2399.029,"I'm saying you don't have to invoke the right to remain silent, that that's not the state of the law, that only the right to remain -- I'm sorry -- the right to counsel must be invoked."
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2399.029,2399.419,Right.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2415.131,2423.956,The State actually found two -- I think you're saying that there was an objectively unreasonable determination of the facts in this case?
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2423.956,2424.379,Yes.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2424.379,2425.347,And I think that--
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2425.347,2426.033,Maybe.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2426.033,2428.86,--It's one way or the other.
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2428.86,2429.406,Right.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2429.406,2439.529,And I think clearly that there -- that there were facts that the Michigan Court of Appeals found that were not supported by the record and were objectively unreasonable.
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2439.529,2441.229,What are those?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2441.229,2455.053,"The Sixth Circuit found that when the Michigan Court of Appeals said the defendant continued to talk with officers, the Sixth Circuit said that that was an objectively unreasonable finding because there was no continuation, there was no talking."
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2498.303,2516.154,"Of course, those facts are relevant only if we accept your -- your principal assertion, which is that you -- you don't have to invoke the right and interrogation must cease immediately."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2539.864,2544.002,--I don't want to say it's true--
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.002,2544.891,It wasn't meant to be a trick question.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2544.891,2546.937,--just because you are asking it.
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2551.328,2561.432,"On your theory, those -- those factual things are irrelevant, whether--"
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2561.432,2565.32,"Well, my theory is that you don't get past the failure to get the waiver."
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2565.32,2566.228,"--Exactly, exactly."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2566.228,2566.867,Yes.
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2619.129,2631.529,"I must say I've never understood that to be the law, and I don't think it's generally understood to be the law, that unless you get a waiver right at the outset, you have to -- you have to terminate interrogation."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2636.934,2642.479,"--Justice Scalia, the opposite of that then becomes the ability to keep the defendant in a room, and the longer--"
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2642.479,2643.774,I'm not saying it isn't a good rule.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2653.784,2664.781,"--And we would just suggest that the State court applied Moseley incorrectly and applied Miranda, that those are the clearly established law in that case."
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2664.781,2665.358,I like clear rules.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2677.322,2686.068,"But if interrogation continues, the longer it continues the less likely that the statement that is taken is going to be the product of my client's free will."
2009.08-1470,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2707.2,2712.557,Could you tell me when the police have to stop?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2721.07,2730.066,--I think that they can say to the person: Do you now want to waive your right and talk to us or do you want to remain silent?
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2734.441,2735.143,But he doesn't answer.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2736.641,2737.269,--Then that's it.
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2737.269,2737.799,--impassively.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2737.799,2738.704,Then that's it.
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2738.704,2739.546,Then they have to stop?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2739.546,2746.047,"There's no burden -- I mean, then the burden isn't met, this heavy burden that he has knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived those rights."
2009.08-1470,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2746.047,2750.011,I don't see how you square that with Moseley.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2750.011,2760.022,"Well, Moseley says that the longer that you question someone, that -- Moseley is the persistent questioning case, where you keep questioning the guy and questioning the guy."
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2778.595,2780.655,And all he has to do is say: I don't want to talk to you.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2782.187,2795.585,"And all they had to say -- I've got to take the flip side -- is -- and because it's their house, because if they don't want to create the ambiguity, they are the ones that have to say: Will you talk to us now?"
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2813.079,2816.25,I don't understand how they create the ambiguity.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2816.25,2819.595,Because they are leaving -- they're not moving off of square one.
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2841.506,2843.663,"Well, I guess this gets back to a question I had earlier."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2857.545,2865.902,"If you are going to base this on an implied waiver, don't you have to look to see what the circumstances were that were going on?"
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2868.355,2871.915,But that's correct -- and that's where -- how I read Butler; you have to look at the circumstances.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2877.21,2878.083,--Yes.
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2878.083,2878.961,The other circumstances are irrelevant.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2885.785,2903.013,"If you find that the officer does not have to ask the question, does not have to clarify whether in fact the defendant is remaining silent, then I do have to talk to the rest to try and persuade you that in those 2 hours and 45 minutes he was not being cooperative, he was not willingly entering into--"
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2903.013,2904.776,"That issue is not in this case, though."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2904.776,2905.634,--Well--
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2905.634,2909.37,"As I understand it, you've lost at every stage on the voluntariness and have not renewed that, correct?"
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2912.462,2916.288,--I did -- I did talk about voluntariness in my brief to this Court.
2009.08-1470,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2916.288,2921.551,Your argument would be the same if this was compressed to 45 minutes?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2921.551,2922.191,Yes.
2009.08-1470,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2922.191,2922.659,Same result?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2922.659,2923.614,Yes.
2009.08-1470,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2923.614,2924.644,30 minutes?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2924.644,2925.689,Yes.
2009.08-1470,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2925.689,2926.582,15?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2926.582,2927.143,Yes.
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2927.549,2930.283,One?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2949.93,2964.502,"If -- if you were going to go and use implied waiver, if -- and I think that you can use an implied waiver, you -- you are interested in looking at what happened in this case to decide whether, in fact, the ""yes"" answers were an implied waiver."
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2976.278,2980.014,Could -- could you describe a situation where you think there would be an implied waiver?
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2980.014,2985.964,"I'm willing to talk to you, but I won't put anything in writing."
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2997.176,2999.222,"Well, I thought that -- that doesn't sound implied."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,3000.224,3000.567,--Okay.
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3000.567,3001.332,"So, is--"
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3001.332,3002.471,Wait.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,3008.203,3008.578,Yes.
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3008.578,3010.532,That wasn't a waiver--
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,3010.532,3011.171,Okay.
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3011.171,3012.185,--of his right to remain silent.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,3012.185,3017.418,Then let me give another example of a waiver of the right to remain silent.
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3017.418,3018.186,"I'm willing to talk to you, I'm willing to listen to you."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,3038.724,3039.707,"Well, it's not a new right."
2009.08-1470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3039.707,3040.628,A right not to be interrogated.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,3040.628,3042.004,It's -- it's not a new right.
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3072.132,3072.444,--Okay.
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,3075.037,3079.252,"Well, it's -- the implied waiver case is North Carolina v. Butler."
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3079.252,3079.783,"Well, that's right."
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,3086.171,3092.34,"But Butler -- I don't think you have to overrule Butler, because Butler really was a right to counsel case."
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3103.114,3107.8,"So, there's -- so, there's no implied waiver with respect to the right to remain silent?"
2009.08-1470,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,3107.8,3116.252,"That's a hard question, and I don't have -- I don't have an easy answer or a hard answer for you."
2009.08-1470,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3158.951,3159.813,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1470,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3163.982,3174.245,"I -- I have to say that -- page 475 and 476, particularly, of Miranda do talk in terms of a -- of a waiver."
2009.08-1470,3,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,3182.16,3186.099,"Well, I think Miranda itself contemplates pre-waiver interrogation."
2009.08-1470,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3205.558,3206.198,What page is--
2009.08-1470,3,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,3206.198,3209.337,--Page 14 on the left side in the middle.
2009.08-1470,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3227.971,3228.58,"Well, why doesn't it--"
2009.08-1470,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3228.58,3229.469,But I don't think that was the question.
2009.08-1470,3,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,3239.187,3239.858,--That's right.
2009.08-1470,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3239.858,3257.648,"Then it says, clearly, that even if the police and the prosecution testify he did waive it, even if they say he did, explicitly, still, if there's a long questioning, even then, the court should be very careful about admitting it."
2009.08-1470,3,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,3257.648,3258.412,Right.
2009.08-1470,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3258.724,3268.266,"And doesn't it flow from that a fortiori that if he doesn't admit it and all there is, is the long questioning that, there has been no waiver?"
2009.08-1470,3,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,3268.266,3271.717,--But here Mr. Thompkins answered a series of questions knowing--
2009.08-1470,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3271.717,3272.641,He answered three questions.
2009.08-1470,3,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,3272.641,3272.968,--Right.
2009.08-1470,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3272.968,3273.639,All right.
2009.08-1470,3,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,3283.466,3292.115,"He -- that's what the Federal courts have done on direct review -- this is what Cardwell did, and there are five or six circuits have found the answers to the questions themselves can be the best--"
2009.08-1470,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3292.115,3300.035,"So, in this case, after 2 hours and 15 minutes when he gave the answers I just said, when did he waive his Miranda rights?"
2009.08-1470,3,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,3300.035,3302.815,"--When he answered those questions, because the--"
2009.08-1470,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3302.815,3304.363,"No, I think any then -- then Miranda is--"
2009.08-1470,3,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,3304.363,3305.034,"--No, because--"
2009.08-1470,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3305.034,3308.5,--It says you can't admit the stuff after a long questioning unless he waives.
2009.08-1470,3,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,3311.639,3320.652,"--The -- that's what the Federal courts have done in applying Butler, because the words and actions of the person interrogated can give rise to the inference that the person has waived."
2009.08-1470,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3327.43,3330.9,"--May I ask, can you go back to page 14 in your reply brief?"
2009.08-1470,3,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,3343.799,3344.47,--Right.
2009.08-1470,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3344.47,3352.358,"So the question is whether during those two hours by not answering a -- a number of questions, did he indicate in any way that he wished to remain silent?"
2009.08-1470,3,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,3352.358,3353.138,Right.
2009.08-1470,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3360.731,3364.26,Then it says that any -- in any manner that he wished to remain silent.
2009.08-1470,3,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,3374.192,3382.44,"--Well, what happens, though, in Davis, this Court made clear for the purpose of invocation, that the invocation has to be unambiguous because the police have to know when they have to cut off their questioning."
2009.08-1470,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3408.773,3410.442,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1470,3,17986,b_eric_restuccia,,3410.442,3410.863,Thank you.
2009.08-1470,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3410.863,3411.943,The case is submitted.
