1980.78-1789,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.982,We'll hear arguments next in Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company v. Hall.
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,59.07,64.287,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,585.468,601.259,"Well, but the respondents' position as I understand it, Mr. Goldberg, is that Arkla had a duty under the contract to report that they were getting a higher price from the United States than they were getting from the respondents."
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,603.758,608.491,I'm not sure that they expressly stated that claim but our position is--
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,608.491,630.42,"I don't find the complaint here... I understood from the briefs that, in effect, what they're saying is, you breached the contract by not formally advising them you were getting a higher price from the United States than you were getting from them, and that this is a breach of contract."
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,630.42,662.22,"--No, their claim of a breach of contract is that the royalty payments made under the government lease constituted a purchase from a party seller, the Government, of gas, and that therefore, since that's the language of the favored nation provision, and they claim that it was a higher price than the fixed prices in the contract, and therefore, they said, the favored nation provision was triggered."
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,662.22,675.745,"Well, as I recall it, you argue in the briefs that purchase, you didn't realize that the contract provision came within purchase until that was decided in '78, wasn't it, or something like that?"
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,675.745,691.567,"No, it's our position that settled Louisiana law as well as federal law says that a royalty payment is not a purchase of gas."
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,693.441,702.938,"But in 1978 did not the Louisiana courts construe the word ""purchase"" as including what happened here?"
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,702.938,704.156,"--Oh, yes, yes."
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,704.156,707.106,"And you didn't know about it, you say, until 1978?"
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,709.872,716.853,Our defense to the contract action--
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,716.853,722.257,"Well, I know, you're arguing that primary jurisdiction, they have no jurisdiction to do this at all."
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,726.819,728.396,"--Well, we also--"
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,728.396,729.536,And you had that defense.
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,729.536,745.311,"--We also say that under the terms of the contract, the favored nation provision was not triggered because the royalty payments did not constitute a purchase and the decision of the court below was in error."
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,784.406,786.547,"Well, I know, but is that anything we can review?"
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,786.547,791.498,--What we've asked you to do here--
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,791.498,794.012,What's the federal question involved in that?
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,794.012,806.319,"--Whether the award of the court below violated the Filed Rate Doctrine, violated the primary jurisdiction and exclusive rate jurisdiction of the Commission, and regulations of the Commission."
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,806.319,826.264,"But if the respondents had known that the favored nation clause was triggered, if you had told them so, or at least had given them the information on which they could conclude that, I take it between '62 and '72 they might have gone to the federal commission and got approval of the rates."
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,826.264,828.577,I don't know what they would have done but that's what they should have done.
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,829.95,831.622,"Well, maybe they... well, they didn't know, they didn't know; you didn't tell them."
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,831.622,846.773,And even if they didn't know it and found out for the first time in '74... let's assume that for the sake of argument... their proper course of action was to go to the Commission.
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,901.782,912.153,"Do you contend, Mr. Goldberg, that the reasoning of this recent order would have applied if they had asked, or if they'd filed back in 1962 or '63?"
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,912.153,919.868,In 1962 they were asking for an increase back to 1961--
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,919.868,923.195,But you think the reasoning of this order would have applied?
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,923.195,923.789,"--Yes, I--"
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.789,926.32,I thought it was based on the fact that they were so late.
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,926.32,933.16,--We would have had the same considerations that the Commission refers to.
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,933.16,939.345,"If they came in '62 and said, we want to get the higher rate for the period '62 to '72, the next ten years."
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,939.345,941.938,I don't think they could come in and--
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.938,944.812,We don't know whether the Commission would have let them do it or not.
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,944.812,945.218,--We do not.
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,945.968,950.497,You don't deny that it was at least possible the Commission would have let them do that?
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,950.497,964.243,"Well, the present Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as presently constituted has said in their order that they hesitate to speculate on what the Commission would have done."
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.008,970.49,"Well, doesn't that mean that it was at least a possibility that it would have been done had they been able to act promptly?"
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,970.49,973.693,I suppose that possibility could exist.
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,982.439,986.421,But who's responsible for the fact that they were unable to go in in '62?
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,986.421,988.076,Not the petitioner.
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,995.245,997.011,But if you read the contract the other way.
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,1017.704,1028.919,"--If you assume that we had a duty, then I suppose it would be we would be responsible for the delay if that is the federal jurisprudence, because this contract is not controlled by state jurisdiction, state jurisprudence."
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.703,1107.482,"The state court said, on the preponderance of the evidence we think it's more likely they would than they would have not."
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,1111.965,1114.371,--I think that we could have demonstrated to the Commission--
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.371,1115.729,But you didn't.
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,1115.729,1122.102,"--We didn't because they made no filing, but if you're asking me to speculate--"
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1122.102,1132.52,"No, all I asked you was whether or not it were possible as a matter of law that they could have ruled in favor of allowing the higher rate, back if they'd made a timely filing?"
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,1132.52,1145.28,--If they also met the qualifications of the favored... the Commission would have had to find that the favored nation was triggered because the royalty payments constituted a purchase from any party seller.
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1155.839,1165.492,"I thought the way the case comes to us we assume for purposes of whether the Filed Rate Doctrine applies or not that there was a violation of the favored nations agreement, the duty and all the rest."
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,1171.958,1180.705,"That's right, because the allowance by the court below violates the determinations under the Filed Rate Doctrine."
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1276.621,1296.099,"I suppose, Mr. Goldberg, your position would be that it applied even, even had Arkla here deliberately and intentionally not informed the respondents that they were getting a higher rate in a situation where they should have given it?"
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,1302.768,1307.782,"Yes, but I'd like to say first, we don't have to go that far, back to the states."
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1307.782,1307.954,I know.
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,1308.859,1309.609,Yes.
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1309.609,1310.812,That's how far you would go?
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,1310.812,1311.703,Yes.
1980.78-1789,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1311.703,1312.311,All right.
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,1312.311,1338.676,"And we say, also, that if you read Montana-Dakota, in that situation, where the Filed Rate Doctrine was held to apply, the complainant in that case, the plaintiff in that case was under the thumb of a parent corporation, was clearly prevented from going before the Commission and protesting the rates involved."
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1353.186,1359.325,Isn't it correct that that case really just held that that precluded them from having a claim under the federal statute.
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,1363.619,1369.461,"No, we think that if you read the case as a whole--"
1980.78-1789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1369.461,1372.942,That case did arise in the federal judicial system and the first question is whether federal jurisdiction--
1980.78-1789,0,39378,reuben_goldberg,,1372.942,1379.893,--They sought to draw a right to their cause of action from the terms of the Federal Power Act itself.
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,1617.453,1620.326,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1980.78-1789,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1979.634,1988.178,"Well, the points you're making surely bear on the equities, perhaps, but is that controlling?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,1988.178,2005.625,"Your Honor, I think... yes, sir, I think to the extent that we sued for breach of contract because they destroyed these people's contractual rights and their rights to enforce and implement their contractual rights consistent with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations."
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2006.562,2011.699,"Mr. Howell, what would be the... if you're right and we were to affirm--"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2011.699,2012.668,"--Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2012.668,2016.307,"--What damages would you recover, say, for the period from '62 through '72?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2016.307,2021.024,"The damages should be measured by what the United States Government received, Your Honor."
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2021.024,2025.553,"In other words, the difference between what you're getting and what the United States got?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2025.553,2026.069,"Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2026.069,2031.941,"Well, now, then that's really in effect the rate increase, isn't it, for that period?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2031.941,2033.972,"Your Honor, it's award of damages measured by--"
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2033.972,2035.363,"I know, that's the name of it."
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2035.363,2035.8,"--Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2035.8,2038.626,In effect it's the same thing as a rate increase.
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2038.626,2045.592,"Well, I think it can be styled that way semantically but I would say from the legal proposition it would be the payment of damages by Arkla--"
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2045.592,2047.451,"Well, in any event, it would an amount of money--"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2047.451,2048.045,"--Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2048.045,2061.163,"--Without prior Commission approval which would be exactly what you would have sought in the way of approval of a rate increase had you known about this deal with the Government, isn't it?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2061.163,2062.647,"Yes, sir, and in that regard--"
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2062.647,2066.646,Doesn't that have some significance on the real issue we've got to decide?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2066.646,2077.767,"--Your Honor, I think, perhaps in this context, we filed a petition with the Federal Power Commission on June 30, 1976."
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2143.443,2150.268,"Well, are you telling me then, actually, you in effect had Commission approval on the difference?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2150.268,2155.875,"The Commission deferred to the courts, Your Honor, the question as to whether or not we were contractually authorized."
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2160.64,2170.884,"Well, what I'm trying to get, Mr. Howell, did the Commission in effect tell you, if you can get approval of the... if there was a violation of the contract here and you were entitled to it, consider that we've approved it?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2170.884,2179.99,"--Your Honor, I interpret it that way and I think the Louisiana courts did too, because the order clearly says, if you would have filed and if you were contractually authorized, these are the rates--"
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2179.99,2180.803,Is that order in our Appendix?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2180.803,2181.428,"--Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2185.988,2188.066,180?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2188.066,2204.386,"Yes, sir, and it was cited by the Louisiana court in its opinion in the appendix at the top of page 62, in the Joint Appendix, the Louisiana Supreme Court specifically relied upon the Federal Power Commission's November 8, 1976, order."
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2204.386,2239.341,"Could I ask you if you had, say, in 1972 on 3, you had gone to the Commission and asked for a rate increase, saying that you were contractually permitted to increase the rates and please give us permission to charge a higher rate, and the Commission had said fine, that's fine, now, that certainly would have been permission for you prospectively to file, to charge higher rates?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2239.341,2240.341,"Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.341,2245.963,Is the Commission authorized to give retroactive effect to any rate increase?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2245.963,2246.494,"No, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.305,2271.219,"So, the question that my brother Brennan asked you, was, do you interpret the Commission's response to what you did file as saying, we consent to your charging higher rates from 1961 up to... I don't think they have the authority to make rate increases retroactive."
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2271.219,2278.623,"--Your Honor, they defer to the courts, recognizing that the courts had concurrent jurisdiction over breach of contract--"
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2278.623,2279.216,I understand that.
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2279.216,2279.685,"--Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.685,2293.804,"Even if it were conceded that the contract permitted you to... if there was no question whatsoever about that, the Commission would... the most the Commission could do is say, prospectively, you may charge higher rates?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2293.804,2299.707,"Well, at the time we found out about it, Your Honors, in 1974--"
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.707,2300.441,"Well, that's the problem."
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2300.441,2301.738,"--Yes, sir, that is the problem."
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.411,2427.985,"As I understand the Commission, the Commission opposes the result you want to reach here?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2427.985,2428.938,"--Yes, sir, they--"
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.938,2443.728,"And on the ground that this would undercut their authority despite the claim of... your claim based on the equities, and despite your in effect claiming estoppel--"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2443.728,2444.571,"--Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2444.571,2446.727,--Or misrepresentation or whatever?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2446.727,2451.741,Just a breach of an affirmative duty to disclose true and material facts relative to contractual rights.
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2451.741,2455.942,"And the Commission... that's the Commission's position, isn't it?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2455.942,2476.045,"Your Honor, after the Louisiana Supreme Court rendered its judgment on March 5, 1979, they issued an order on April 25, 1979, and they said that we're not interested in the damages awarded for the liquids and the condensate, based on what the Government received."
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2526.32,2528.148,From '72 on?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2528.148,2528.678,"Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2528.678,2533.943,"At least, any producer who was a small producer entitled to be exempt from filing?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2533.943,2534.099,"Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.035,2537.8,There is some argument about whether all of them are or not?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2537.8,2542.08,"But the Commission has held that we were, Arkla has treated us as such, and I really think that's--"
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.08,2546.437,"So, from '72 on, it didn't make any difference whether--"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2546.437,2547.015,--That's correct.
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.308,2567.756,"--Well, the Commission position is, though, from '61 to '72, as to the dry gas residue, you're not entitled to any--"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2567.756,2573.801,"--We've been caught in a Catch-22, Your Honor, that Arkla, by withholding the facts."
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2635.23,2639.649,"--Well, was the position, Mr. Howell, that there was no jurisdiction to grant a waiver?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2639.649,2648.771,"No, sir, they have the authority to grant a waiver and they granted it in 20-some-odd cases that we cited to the Commission... Plaquemines, Piqua, and other decisions... they've granted waivers; yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2648.771,2650.645,"Well, is that judgment that--"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2650.645,2655.378,"No, sir, we've taken an appeal from their denial of the waiver to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals."
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2655.378,2656.003,--Is it pending there?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2656.003,2656.425,It's pending there.
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2668.763,2675.605,"I was going to say, if you lose here, is the issue of a waiver still open in the 5th Circuit or isn't it?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2675.605,2689.708,"--Your Honor, I think that the waiver issue is essential to us getting damages for the dry residue gas from '61 to '72 and this Court doesn't feel that it can address the waiver head-on in this breach of contract case, then I think certainly we're entitled to go through the process to--"
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2689.708,2691.176,"Well, you're already there, I gather, and--"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2691.176,2693.049,"--Yes, sir, and entitled to finish it."
1980.78-1789,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2693.049,2695.486,--What does the Commission have to say about the waiver?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2695.486,2707.466,"Your Honor, the Commission said that it just goes back too far, it... they say the equities are on our side in the original order that they issued."
1980.78-1789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2723.193,2724.568,"Well, it's kind of like the doctrine of laches, isn't it?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2724.568,2725.489,Sir?
1980.78-1789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2725.489,2730.346,"It's kind of like a doctrine of laches, isn't it, that you can't go back forever?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2730.346,2737.125,"Yes, sir, but it's being applied to us when we were prevented from taking the action necessary to implement our rights at that time."
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2758.07,2761.865,When was the waiver appeal taken?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2761.865,2763.443,"Your Honor, it was taken--"
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.443,2766.817,When was it filed in the Court of Appeals?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2766.817,2776.188,"--The rehearing was denied, I believe, January 2... the waiver was denied on November 5, 1980."
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2777.906,2784.935,That was after... that was after we granted certiorari?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2784.935,2790.057,"--No, sir, I believe you granted certiorari January 19 of this year, if I'm not mistaken."
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.057,2790.557,"This year, did we?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2790.557,2791.057,"Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.634,2800.366,So we knew that the waiver had been denied?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2800.366,2803.099,"Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2803.099,2808.503,And we also knew that you were appealing to the 5th Circuit?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2808.503,2809.05,"Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2809.05,2812.922,When did you file your notice of appeal in the 5th Circuit?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2812.922,2815.313,I believe it was January 7 or 8 of this year.
1980.78-1789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2815.313,2821.139,"So, within five or ten days of the time we granted certiorari?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2821.139,2821.857,"Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2821.857,2823.466,"How do we know that, Mr. Howell?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,2826.762,2834.431,"Your Honor, the other side, the petitioner herein, made a filing showing that our application for rehearing with the FERC had been denied."
1980.78-1789,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3107.79,3124.626,"Would you think that if this were a completely private contract, no filed rates, just a contract between two private parties, that the doctrine of laches might move in and cut you off at some point in that period or not?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,3124.626,3129.438,"Your Honor, not as long as they were withholding the facts, and I was getting to that a while ago."
1980.78-1789,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3202.876,3204.205,"We will resume there at 1 o'clock, counsel."
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,3220.697,3223.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3400.484,3403.639,"Are there many precedents, Mr. Howell, waivers by the Commission?"
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,3403.639,3404.155,"Yes, sir."
1980.78-1789,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3464.38,3466.254,So you were surprised when you got the denial?
1980.78-1789,1,30819,james_fleet_howell,,3466.254,3469.66,"--I've never been more shocked in my life, Your Honor, to be quite frank."
1980.78-1789,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3482.686,3483.233,Thank you.
1980.78-1789,2,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3484.56,3486.56,Just a few things here.
1980.78-1789,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3623.708,3633.016,"But counsel, a moment ago you referred to the fact that the Commission was misled and cited us to a footnote ten in your brief on page 11, I believe."
1980.78-1789,2,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3635.094,3636.453,--Page 11 of the reply brief.
1980.78-1789,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3636.453,3639.67,"--Oh, of your reply brief?"
1980.78-1789,2,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3645.621,3650.322,Yes; yes.
1980.78-1789,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3656.055,3676.404,Is there any argument in this case about... or I'll put it the other way... must we decide whether these companies are small companies that are freed from the filing requirements as of '72?
1980.78-1789,2,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3679.06,3679.357,Yes.
1980.78-1789,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3685.229,3693.383,"But you mean, if someone is a small producer, then from '72 on there is no dispute?"
1980.78-1789,2,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3693.383,3698.054,"Not unless they can demonstrate... there still is the question, even if you're a small producer."
1980.78-1789,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3709.676,3711.221,"Well, then, it'd all go back to the state court?"
1980.78-1789,2,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3711.221,3714.095,"--Well, that's a question for the Commission."
1980.78-1789,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3714.095,3715.798,Why is that?
1980.78-1789,2,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3715.798,3719.999,Because it's within the Commission's primary jurisdiction and in its exclusive--
1980.78-1789,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3719.999,3730.246,"I thought the Commission in this very case said that to the extent these companies are small producers, then it's up to the state court after '72?"
1980.78-1789,2,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3730.246,3734.135,"--No, I don't think the Commission said that."
1980.78-1789,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3751.783,3758.546,"But... the Commission washed its hands of the whole matter then, with respect to post-'72 rate increase?"
1980.78-1789,2,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3758.546,3763.436,"--No, I don't think that you could say that, because... may I just--"
1980.78-1789,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3763.436,3766.278,"Well, you were about to say that that's on appeal anyway, weren't you?"
1980.78-1789,2,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3766.278,3768.121,--It's on appeal in the United States district court.
1980.78-1789,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3768.121,3768.527,All right.
1980.78-1789,2,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3771.168,3774.245,It's held in abeyance pending the outcome of this case.
1980.78-1789,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3786.068,3789.815,"I don't want to extend your time, Mr. Goldberg."
1980.78-1789,2,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3789.815,3791.003,--Thank you.
1980.78-1789,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3791.003,3791.847,"Thank you, gentlemen."
