1988.87-6571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.222,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-6571, Dethorne Graham v. M. S. Connor."
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,12.241,12.941,Mr. Chief Justice.
1988.87-6571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,134.52,136.972,What was he doing when the officers arrived?
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,138.055,138.991,He was sitting on the curb.
1988.87-6571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,138.991,140.457,Was he conscious?
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,140.457,141.942,"Yes, he was at that time."
1988.87-6571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,141.942,143.276,Had he been?
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,143.276,146.144,"Yes, he had been conscious, but he has not memory of those events."
1988.87-6571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,146.144,149.696,To whom was he talking?
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,149.696,162.856,"He was talking to Mr. Berry and to Officer Connor at that time, when the back-up officers arrived, and we can tell by the comment of the first arriving officer that they were explained about the sugar reaction because the first comment was,"
1988.87-6571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,298.874,302.16,Now what court decision are you talking about?
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,302.16,306.797,--I'm talking about the District Court decision and the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.
1988.87-6571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,306.797,308.464,We're reviewing the Court of Appeals decision.
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,308.464,309.564,"We are, sir."
1988.87-6571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,309.564,313.218,What did it hold?
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,313.218,329.81,"The 4th Circuit United States Court of Appeals, we contend, created a generic hybrid type of constitutional right with no specific provision as to what the constitutional anchor for the analysis is."
1988.87-6571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,342.137,344.57,So you're saying they applied the wrong rule of law.
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,344.57,347.272,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-6571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,582.093,590.849,"Mr. Beaver, don't you understand that your opponents here concede that the 4th Amendment is the correct mode of analysis for these facts?"
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,590.849,593.384,"I understand that they do so in their brief, sir."
1988.87-6571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,663.711,671.051,But does the subjective factor have any bearing on any immunity that the officers might have?
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,671.051,680.34,--It does not under this Court's decision in Harlow v. Fitzgerald where a subjective... this Court has driven subjective considerations from every aspect of 4th Amendment analysis.
1988.87-6571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,680.34,691.23,"So under your view, I take it, the immunity analysis collapses into the objective analysis under the 4th Amendment and the issue is simply the same?"
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,691.23,691.564,"Oh, no."
1988.87-6571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,704.355,706.74,"There there was reliance, because of reliance on a statute?"
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,706.74,709.026,--Because of reliance upon the Bright Line test--
1988.87-6571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,709.026,715.83,"In this case... in this case, are the two inquiries precisely the same?"
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,715.83,721.734,"--I would think not, but with all due respect there was no raising of the qualified good faith immunity defense in this case."
1988.87-6571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,754.205,774.516,"Counsel, under the objective approach, or test, that you propose, I assume that statements made by the officers during the course of the arrest that might indicate personal animus would be irrelevant."
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,774.516,775.201,Yes.
1988.87-6571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,822.932,823.682,then.
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,827.067,831.538,Other than perhaps in a decision by the jury whether to award punitive damages.
1988.87-6571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,831.538,839.209,Some of the circuits have applied a pretextual seizure doctrine.
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,858.272,859.155,I see.
1988.87-6571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,859.155,865.609,Do you think your objective standard would preclude that kind of an analysis?
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,865.609,874.881,"I believe that a pretextual stop is not objectively reasonable, if that makes sense."
1988.87-6571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,884.404,891.057,But you wouldn't look at the officer's true intent under your theory.
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,891.057,900.33,"--Let me back up and say, strictly speaking with the objective test I would agree with you, with the justice."
1988.87-6571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,900.33,907.852,You can't hypothesize any case in which a seizure is objectively unreasonable and there is good faith?
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,907.852,911.904,"--Oh, I'm certain that there are many cases where there is an objectively unreasonable seizure--"
1988.87-6571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,911.904,912.754,Only with the statute.
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,912.754,915.437,--Tennessee v. Garner is a prime example.
1988.87-6571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,918.156,926.326,There was a statute there.
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,926.326,932.314,Put on the spot it is very difficult for me to think of hypotheticals.
1988.87-6571,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.108,951.127,"Are you two whispering over there, or what's going on?"
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,953.143,954.579,Pardon me.
1988.87-6571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.336,979.424,"Mr. Beaver, you have to run that one by me again, where you said that you cannot conceive of how, you say, a pretextual stop is always objectively unreasonable."
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,980.96,982.66,"Well, I believe that I stated that--"
1988.87-6571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.66,987.714,You don't know it's objectively unreasonable unless you know what the subjective intent of the officers is.
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,988.414,994.751,"--That's correct, and I have since rescinded that in speaking with the justice as stated, but I do not believe that that would be a situation."
1988.87-6571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,999.953,1004.107,It would not at all be.
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,1004.107,1006.126,It would not be objectively unreasonable.
1988.87-6571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1006.126,1012.03,"So you'd be willing to apply your rule consistently, so you can make as many pretextual stops as you want."
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,1012.03,1013.43,Right.
1988.87-6571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1013.43,1015.231,Without violating the 4th Amendment.
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,1015.231,1017.231,"May I state, sir, that this is not my rule."
1988.87-6571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1023.837,1024.303,Whatever.
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,1030.841,1033.026,"For the purposes of this argument I believe that I would, yes sir."
1988.87-6571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.026,1035.026,"But the next argument, you wouldn't."
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,1035.026,1036.061,"Well, I might not."
1988.87-6571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1099.818,1103.936,Wouldn't the officer at least have to intend to seize the person.
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,1103.936,1107.222,Yes.
1988.87-6571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1190.139,1195.293,What if we agree with you that the Court of Appeals used the wrong standard?
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,1199.764,1202.297,We would argue the case should be reversed and sent back for a new trial.
1988.87-6571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.297,1202.966,--For a new trial?
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,1202.966,1203.799,Yes.
1988.87-6571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1208.184,1218.723,"You mean in the Court of Appeals, they ought to review the, what the District Court did under the right standard?"
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,1218.723,1224.027,"May it please the Court, the decision on directed verdict is a question of law."
1988.87-6571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.027,1224.677,Right.
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,1224.677,1233.315,"The District Court, the Court of Appeals, for that matter this Court, has no discretion in how to determine the facts here."
1988.87-6571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1245.79,1255.063,"But if they reviewed the directed verdict judgment under the wrong standard why shouldn't we just send it back to the Court of Appeals and say, you should fly the right standard?"
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,1255.063,1257.665,That is one option for this Court.
1988.87-6571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1268.489,1272.607,Then we have to study the record and know all the facts... that's a lot of work.
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,1272.607,1278.011,I presume the justice has studied the record and is familiar with the facts.
1988.87-6571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1278.011,1286.201,Should the jury be instructed that if the facts are as you state them to be they must bring in a verdict for the Plaintiff?
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,1289.568,1290.602,"No, not in every case."
1988.87-6571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1315.034,1327.694,"In this case, if the evidence is as you have explained it, and I recognize only one side has testified, then as a matter of law is it an unreasonable seizure?"
1988.87-6571,0,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,1327.694,1334.597,"In my opinion, in this case, were there no other side to be heard, yes, under an objective reasonableness test."
1988.87-6571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1370.503,1372.638,"Thank you, Mr. Beaver."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1376.274,1378.892,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1424.755,1425.423,Yes.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1427.907,1428.775,"That's correct, it did."
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1429.675,1431.511,"They weren't exactly a mystery, those cases at that time."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1431.511,1432.261,--Excuse me?
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1432.261,1433.111,Those are new cases.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1438.081,1439.231,It certainly could have.
1988.87-6571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1466.848,1467.665,Let me interrupt you for just a moment.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1473.252,1475.438,We agree that it can be analyzed under the 4th Amendment.
1988.87-6571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1475.438,1476.188,And should be?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1476.188,1478.156,"Yes, we would agree with that."
1988.87-6571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1544.082,1548.717,Is this on the theory that words mean precisely what we intend them to mean and nothing else?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1550.669,1550.986,No.
1988.87-6571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.245,1568.047,For example?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1568.047,1571.582,"--I think in common law immunity defenses, for example."
1988.87-6571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1571.582,1573.815,A malice standard is objective?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1573.815,1576.101,I believe that's right.
1988.87-6571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1583.807,1585.758,The inference is of intent.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1603.201,1605.303,"--They could be used in that way, but the Court of Appeals--"
1988.87-6571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1605.303,1618.313,"They would normally be used that way, and I don't know that I can read the Court of Appeals language as imposing some objective standard out there by the use of those words."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1629.935,1648.432,--We read the Court of Appeals decision in this case and in Justice subsequent en banc decision to explain that it was an objective test: that it's a legal description of that level of force that is more than simply a battery under state law and reaches the level of a constitutional violation.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1683.422,1690.092,What reason was there for handcuffing a diabetic in a coma?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1690.092,1695.663,At the time the officers didn't know that he was a diabetic in a coma.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1695.663,1700.884,What was he doing that was so violent that he had to be handcuffed?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1700.884,1702.95,You have to go back one step even before that.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1709.287,1709.839,Violent?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1709.839,1710.605,It wasn't clear.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1713.524,1720.428,"Well, what did he do that was violent?"
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1720.428,1721.128,Testimony.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1729.867,1735.437,"But what was he doing, I'm talking about before they put the handcuffs on him."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1738.989,1740.674,He was acting in a very bizarre manner.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1757.969,1759.153,Was that threatening anybody?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1760.755,1762.405,"--Well, the officers didn't have to wait until he was--"
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1762.405,1764.873,Did he strike anybody?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1764.873,1766.659,--I don't believe the record indicates that he struck anybody.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1766.659,1769.309,Did he threaten to strike anybody?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1769.309,1773.079,He was acting in an unpredictable and potentially dangerous manner.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1773.079,1776.864,"Can you answer, did he threaten to strike anybody?"
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1776.864,1779.799,He did not overtly threaten to strike anyone.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.799,1782.351,Did he have a weapon of any kind?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1782.351,1784.218,"The record doesn't indicate, I don't believe."
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1784.218,1786.22,The record didn't show he had a weapon of any kind?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1786.22,1786.87,That's correct.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1786.87,1789.172,"Well, why was he handcuffed?"
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1789.172,1803.582,The record shows that he was properly stopped as a suspect for a criminal investigation; that he was acting suspiciously; that he was acting in a bizarre manner; that Mr. Berry asked for Officer Connor's help.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1803.582,1811.688,"Is bizarre an explainable word, or does it cover anything?"
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1811.688,1813.371,"No, it doesn't cover anything."
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1813.371,1814.556,What does it cover?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1814.556,1816.841,"It covers, certainly, Petitioner's conduct in this case."
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1816.841,1817.507,Which was what?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1817.507,1818.324,And Mr. Berry so said.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1857.817,1863.886,Shouldn't a diabetic object to being arrested rather than given treatment?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1863.886,1865.138,He wasn't arrested.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1865.888,1867.607,"Well, why was he handcuffed?"
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1867.607,1871.409,He was handcuffed because the officers were concerned that he was a criminal suspect.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1881.784,1884.25,In order to protect himself?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1884.25,1887.688,The District Court summarized the record as indicating that.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1890.99,1896.877,May I differ from that conclusion?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1896.877,1902.864,"The record either supports it or it doesn't but the District Court did say that, and I think it is supported by the record."
1988.87-6571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1929.015,1930.381,Was there a seizure here?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1930.381,1932.05,"Yes, I agree there was a seizure."
1988.87-6571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1939.737,1951.611,"Well, Mr. Levy, I guess at the time the officers finally put the Petitioner in the wagon they were aware that no crime had occurred in the convenience market."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1951.611,1952.63,I think that's not correct.
1988.87-6571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1962.919,1967.556,Were they aware he was a diabetic at the time he was lifted into the wagon.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1967.556,1970.156,There were statements to them that he was a diabetic.
1988.87-6571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1981.798,1982.4,"Well, let's see."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1984.583,1986.785,That didn't result from the diabetes.
1988.87-6571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1986.785,1988.386,From being lifted into the wagon.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1988.386,1990.37,The record doesn't show how his foot was broken.
1988.87-6571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2001.161,2003.063,Isn't that really a jury question?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2003.063,2008.548,"But the Plaintiff in this case, the Petitioner, has the burden of putting in evidence that shows its more probable than not."
1988.87-6571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.548,2017.989,"Well, if you're sure that your foot was okay before this sort of a fracas and it's broken afterwards, isn't the jury entitled to infer that it was a result of this confrontation?"
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2017.989,2020.439,"Oh, it's entitled to infer that it occurred during the confrontation."
1988.87-6571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2035.784,2037.784,And you don't think those are jury questions?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2037.784,2044.39,"I don't think they are in this case, but even if they are, there still is no jury question about whether the officers acted unreasonably."
1988.87-6571,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2052.544,2053.662,How many officers were there?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2054.096,2054.896,I believe there were five in total.
1988.87-6571,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2054.896,2055.612,Five.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2055.612,2057.181,That's correct.
1988.87-6571,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2057.181,2060.549,"Diabetic coma is not particularly uncommon, is it?"
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2060.549,2063.501,"It is not uncommon, although it is very similar in its symptoms to drunkenness."
1988.87-6571,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2067.887,2073.441,"Well, that's always asserted, but there are diabetic comas and there is drunkenness."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2073.441,2074.257,There is.
1988.87-6571,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2074.257,2076.326,And police officers know the difference.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2076.326,2083.062,"Well, these officers here had training on diabetics and one officer stated that based on her experience Petitioner was not acting like a diabetic."
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2094.604,2103.976,"Before you do that, Mr. Levy, what about the reasonableness of not following up on his request that they look at the card in his pocket that would indicate he was a diabetic."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2103.976,2109.297,"--Even if he was a diabetic, that would not have changed the officer's actions here."
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.297,2115.451,If they were on reasonable notice of the fact that he was a diabetic and desperately in need of orange juice that wouldn't affect the reasonableness?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2115.451,2117.07,Well at first they wouldn't have known that he was desperately in need of orange juice.
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.07,2117.636,"Well, he said he was."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2117.636,2126.841,"That's not clear from the record, and even if they knew he was having a diabetic problem they wouldn't have known whether it was caused by too much or too little blood sugar."
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2138.399,2139.233,They didn't have to guess.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2142.101,2146.405,"his companion said, Mr. Berry said, that he didn't know what was wrong with Petitioner."
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2160.498,2164.366,What do you think the reasonable police officer should do in that circumstance?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2167.502,2169.354,"Well, that's not what happened here even at the end."
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.472,2173.772,Not by the police officers.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2173.772,2174.572,Excuse me?
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2174.572,2175.674,By the police officers?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2175.674,2178.81,I believe it was by his friend who had brought the orange juice.
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2218.935,2222.053,Can I ask one other question that was prompted by something Justice O'Connor asked.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2229.474,2231.159,I think it is not relevant.
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2231.159,2238.08,"It would not itself be an unreasonable aspect of a way in which one seizes a citizen, to use that kind of language?"
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2238.08,2238.947,I believe that's correct.
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2238.947,2241.682,You don't think it would ever be harmful at all?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2241.682,2244.05,If the seizure itself was lawful--
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.05,2249.787,"Well, they have sufficient factual basis for a Terry stop."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2253.839,2258.743,"--It may not be appropriate, and I certainly don't defend what the Court of Appeals characterized--"
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2258.743,2260.262,"Is it not relevant, even?"
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2260.262,2263.547,"--I think it is not relevant under an objective standard, the 4th Amendment."
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2263.547,2269.801,Even though it might incite further confrontation and the like and help bring the crowd around and all that sort of thing.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2272.32,2272.836,I think it is.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2294.297,2305.336,"This is five officers with loaded guns and a handcuffed prisoner, and they need to do something else?"
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2305.336,2307.188,What they did at that point--
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.188,2311.573,Did they need to do anything else to maintain peace and order?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2311.573,2315.108,"--They put him in the car and they removed him from the scene, that's what they did."
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2315.908,2318.643,Why did they need five?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2321.679,2324.547,"--They didn't have to use that kind of language, and we don't defend that but it's not--"
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2324.547,2325.714,Well that's a part of it in my book.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2325.714,2330.701,"--But even if it's a part of it... and I don't agree with that... but even if it is, it is not a constitutional violation."
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2330.701,2332.652,How big was this man?
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2332.652,2333.686,The record doesn't indicate.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2338.004,2347.746,"Five policemen, fully armed, can take care of one prisoner without maltreating him."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2347.746,2350.614,--I don't think the officers here maltreated him.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2350.614,2351.714,"Yes, or no?"
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2351.714,2354.4,"Yes, I think five officers can, but part of what they had to do--"
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2354.4,2355.935,"Well, why didn't they?"
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2355.935,2357.185,--I think they did.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2357.185,2358.552,They maltreated him.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2358.552,2358.82,No.
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2359.987,2362.772,They picked him up and shoved him in the back of a car.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2362.772,2363.556,He was resisting.
1988.87-6571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2404.499,2415.889,"Mr. Levy, suppose we think the Court of Appeals applied the wrong standard; that they did not apply an objective standard and that the objective standard is the proper one."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2421.543,2422.643,We think the Court can get to the facts.
1988.87-6571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.643,2424.276,"Well, of course we can."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2425.561,2426.661,I think the Court should decide it.
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.892,2507.565,"Mr. Levy, I hate to keep interrupting you, but I think there is a lot in the opinion that supports your argument that the Court was basically applying an objective standard."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2526.443,2527.776,Let me give two answers.
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2540.803,2549.475,"Oh, I agree one can read that as also an objective standard, but it's a much more severe, it's a different standard than the 4th Amendment standard, or is it?"
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2550.392,2553.677,"It's different in its words, and maybe at the margin it's different."
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.866,2566.084,But the Court of Appeals seems to have applied a standard that would be the same standard in an 8th Amendment context.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2571.488,2579.844,"No, I think the Court of Appeals decision is defensible, although as we discussed before its language may be a little bit ill-chosen to convey the sense of an objective test."
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.38,2590.802,"Well, I'm not making the objective subject dichotomy, but just saying that theirs is a more severe objective test than the proper objective test would be."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2590.802,2611.799,"I think the problem in this case, or in Whitley against Albers, or in Garner, is to formulate a constitutional standard that allows... that accommodates the legitimate need of law enforcement officers to use force on the one hand, but doesn't allow them to use force that is simply gratuitous or unrelated to any legitimate law enforcement need."
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2959.091,2965.678,"Before you go too far on these ""everys"" we're dealing with one diabetic."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2969.297,2974.351,"--Well, he was a diabetic as we now know, but he was also a criminal suspect who was acting very suspiciously and erratically."
1988.87-6571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2974.351,2977.553,"Well, criminal suspects are not guilty."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2977.553,2979.219,And he was never arrested here.
1988.87-6571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3047.48,3052.2,"Mr. Levy, your test is kind of a rational basis test to boil it down, isn't it?"
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3052.2,3053.986,It could be characterized that way.
1988.87-6571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3093.194,3098.264,"Well, but you're conflating the 4th Amendment test with a test for official immunity."
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3123.479,3128.449,"It is quite different, and there is no immunity issue in this case because by oversight it was failed to be raised below."
1988.87-6571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3128.449,3133.085,But don't make us distort the law to cover that oversight.
1988.87-6571,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3133.085,3137.203,"Well, the application of immunity doctrine here is not at all clear."
1988.87-6571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3157.217,3159.467,"Thank you, Mr. Levy."
1988.87-6571,2,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,3161.402,3163.287,"Very briefly, if I might, Your Honor."
1988.87-6571,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3190.438,3208.133,"Well, the Court of Appeals said that it was undisputed that really the evidence showed that your client was being very active sitting on the curb, and that he was having to be restrained by his friend and an officer."
1988.87-6571,2,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,3208.133,3222.143,"If I may, sir, get fact-specific, Justice: under the case in the direct examination of Mr. Berry, he was directly asked whether at any time he saw the Petitioner kicking or waving his arms around or resisting in any way."
1988.87-6571,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.051,3238.419,There was testimony that he tried to kick an officer.
1988.87-6571,2,26643,h_gerald_beaver,,3238.419,3249.043,"There was testimony from another police officer that he did that, but we are not bound by the credibility of a police officer that we call for adverse examination under the Federal Rules of Evidence, Your Honor."
1988.87-6571,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3467.653,3468.536,"Thank you, Mr. Beaver."
