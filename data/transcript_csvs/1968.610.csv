1968.610,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,18.792,"Number 610, John L. Sullivan, Tax Commissioner of the State of Connecticut et al., Appellants versus the United States."
1968.610,0,23524,f_michael_ahern,,21.09,25.185,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1968.610,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.461,1370.938,But none of them pay if they are purchasing at military exchanges?
1968.610,0,23524,f_michael_ahern,,1370.938,1372.939,That's correct Justice White.
1968.610,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1372.939,1374.921,Wherever the exchange is?
1968.610,0,23524,f_michael_ahern,,1374.921,1389.243,"As long as the exchange is on a military base, military enclave with PXs and the military stores. If they choose to buy an item at a corner grocery store or corner drugstore, they pay the tax."
1968.610,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1389.243,1393.536,Why -- what's the source of the exemption for the Post Exchange?
1968.610,0,23524,f_michael_ahern,,1395.315,1401.718,"No, I believe it's a decision of this Court that the Post Exchanges are agencies of the federal government for the purposes of waging war and its supporting armies."
1968.610,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1401.718,1405.294,There's nobody practice it in the statute too?
1968.610,0,23524,f_michael_ahern,,1405.294,1407.222,I don't believe it is Justice White.
1968.610,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1555.6,1557.346,Mr. Weinstein.
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1557.346,1562.499,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1968.610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1610.112,1612.924,"-- and you're asking on both sides of the case, aren't you?"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1612.924,1623.808,"I was about to say Mr. Justice Stewart, my purpose here is to advance the arguments and support the argument set forth in part 1 of our brief, the argument in behalf of the servicemen."
1968.610,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1636.332,1644.482,"Well, let's see, you mean know as a personal view to the Solicitor General and the Assistant Attorney General of this case?"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1644.482,1662.257,I think Mr. Justice Brennan that the -- well I should -- the way to put it is that we are here for all practical purposes as the representative as in effect as the guardian out of light of the servicemen.
1968.610,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1669.214,1674.581,"Yes, but what I'm trying to get at is, does the Government support the servicemen or not?"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1674.581,1692.081,"I think this is a situation where the Government has whereas perhaps more than one hat to the extent that the Government's function is to formulate a litigating position on behalf of the Department of Justice, which represents the United States as such."
1968.610,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1710.618,1723.312,"Well -- but you've just said Mr. Weinstein, the inference I draw from that is that the Solicitor General and the Assistant Attorney General's position is the official position of the United States Government?"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1737.547,1745.273,"Yes, I think that it's the -- clearly the function of the Solicitor General to formulate what you're describing as the official position in this Court."
1968.610,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1745.273,1747.328,So that's where you want to stand then?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1747.328,1747.935,"Yes, I would."
1968.610,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1747.935,1748.206,That is.
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1748.206,1749.064,I think that's right.
1968.610,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1749.064,1753.519,"Mr. Weinstein, are there only tow points of view in the Department of Justice?"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1761.12,1765.906,"I think the two views are the judgment below should be affirmed, which I should like to advance here."
1968.610,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1768.725,1775.423,"In oral argument, is anybody going for the Government going to present the view that it should be reversed?"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1775.423,1776.577,No.
1968.610,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.58,1803.486,"Well, is there a case or controversy now in the United States in the State of Connecticut?"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1803.486,1805.127,"I think there is Justice White, because --"
1968.610,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.127,1805.523,Hold on.
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1810.782,1816.866,"If you check the purest case Justice White, and if I were not here to advance the argument on behalf of the servicemen."
1968.610,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1849.81,1859.6,"It may be that if United States have had this position in the first place that it's now its official position, the suit would never been brought?"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1859.6,1862.248,I think that would go far as a speculation.
1968.610,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1865.618,1876.286,"If you were -- we're not to assume are we that the, on the one side are the Solicitor General and the Assistant Attorney General."
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1887.213,1888.471,No.
1968.610,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1890.021,1894.492,But who is on the other side?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1894.492,1899.754,I am here hoping that I'll be able to argue the other side on behalf of the servicemen.
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1899.754,1900.953,By what authority?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1900.953,1902.658,Of the Solicitor General.
1968.610,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.658,1905.673,Is this the first time you view it then?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1905.673,1906.956,You mean what is my personal opinion on the matter?
1968.610,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1906.956,1913.511,You have personal view now that that can support the servicemen or in support of the Solicitor General's position?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1913.511,1922.164,"Well, I think to the extent that my personal view is a pertinent and I'm not sure that they are, I --"
1968.610,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1922.164,1922.675,Mr. Weinstein.
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1922.675,1925.927,"I -- I support your arguments, I'd like to advance."
1968.610,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1925.927,1933.118,"Mr. Weinstein I want a case that you say that I'm eager, and I'm sure we all are very eager to hear your arguments."
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1962.708,1966.312,"It's unconventional Justice Fortas, but I don't think unprecedented."
1968.610,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1987.426,1988.819,276?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1988.819,1990.449,Volume 276.
1968.610,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2004.294,2013.02,"Was that a conflict within the Department of Justice, because this apparently is a conflict within the Department of Justice."
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2026.22,2041.499,"I don't think that there is a conflict among -- in the Department of Justice in the sense that the officials charged with the responsibility of formulating a position of the presidential appointees over an agreement, and their views are stated in part 2 of the brief."
1968.610,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2091.795,2100.974,"And here we have no statement of the position of the Department of Defense, do we?"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2100.974,2101.252,No.
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2107.847,2110.669,Who is their representative here?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2145.343,2152.735,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that the Solicitor General assigned me to appear here with that purpose in mind."
1968.610,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2187.479,2200.418,"If the United States had decided not to come here at all, I suppose the Court might have been interested in having this argument anyway."
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2201.735,2202.341,I should think so.
1968.610,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.054,2237.763,"Well but, the fact is --"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2237.763,2238.742,And --
1968.610,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.742,2243.996,-- the fact is that either the United States officially agreed with Connecticut.
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2247.77,2249.024,"That is correct, Justice White."
1968.610,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2249.024,2274.133,"Mr. Weinstein, it is if your submission that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to push the statute beyond so as to make it applicable to the ordinary retail sales tax and the concomitant use tax now imposed by most of the states end of quote on the last page of your brief?"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2274.133,2278.36,That is the view of that is expressed in that part of the brief.
1968.610,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2278.36,2278.778,And is that --
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2278.778,2280.707,And it's our view that I wish to support here.
1968.610,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.707,2284.902,Is that in complete agreement with the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with --
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2284.902,2285.481,No --
1968.610,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2285.481,2287.01,-- the end of the petitioner?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2287.01,2294.758,-- that is in complete disagreement with the Court of Appeals and in agreement with the appellants with the position taken by the State of Connecticut.
1968.610,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2294.758,2296.437,Its' entirely opposite to the Court of Appeals?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2296.437,2299.95,The Court of Appeals in this case ruled in favor or the servicemen.
1968.610,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2302.289,2302.92,That's right.
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2302.92,2307.125,The position taken in the part 2 of our brief --
1968.610,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.125,2307.523,Right.
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2307.523,2312.986,-- is that the Court of Appeals and District Court were wrong and should be reversed.
1968.610,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2312.986,2313.561,Right.
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2313.561,2317.8,That is not the position that I have been assigned to argue here.
1968.610,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2322.707,2331.166,"What I noticed at the end of the brief, you don't suggest whether they should be affirmed or reversed or anything."
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2332.559,2333.271,That's correct.
1968.610,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2334.523,2337.64,What do you want us to do?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2337.64,2348.618,I would like to be free to argue if I may that the decision below should be affirmed and present what we conceive of as the arguments on that side of the case.
1968.610,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2348.618,2349.639,And you wanted over --
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2349.639,2350.576,You say we.
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2352.893,2361.145,"My -- myself and the other gentlemen who were assigned to work on this part of the case, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2361.145,2361.412,They may --
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2361.412,2362.665,The Solicitor General's --
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2362.665,2366.797,-- all of them in the office who worked on it or against the Solicitor General?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2366.797,2382.976,"I -- I don't -- I would like to think Mr. Chief Justice that that is not pertinent that the -- pertinent thing is that in view of the Solicitor General, this issue should be developed before the call of court in argument in an adversarial way."
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2382.976,2388.144,"Well, are we entitled to approach the case in this way?"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2410.922,2412.109,If I may?
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2412.109,2412.74,"No, no is that --"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2412.74,2414.029,"That is not, no that is not --"
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2414.029,2415.383,Why is that not fair?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2415.383,2420.673,"Because the constitutionality question is the other way around, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2434.147,2444.269,"Well, if the supremacy clause would be involve would it if the Act, if the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act applies to it?"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2444.269,2452.754,"Yes of course, but my difference with you wasn't to the extent the Connecticut and the Solicitor General agree that the decision should be reversed."
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2467.958,2470.264,You say the position of the State of Connecticut is the statue is --
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2470.264,2471.854,Is that Section 514 --
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2471.854,2473.071,-- unconstitutional?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2473.071,2477.294,-- is an unconstitutional abridgement of the reserved powers of the State to tax.
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2477.294,2479.885,"Well speaking of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, isn't it?"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2479.885,2480.57,That's correct.
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2480.57,2482.605,"Oh, I thought you're talking about the Tax Act."
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2482.605,2483.58,"No, no."
1968.610,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2524.594,2533.105,"Well, as I recall it's not so long ago, we had a case here of a tax against an army officer, as I remember it."
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2569.588,2570.431,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1968.610,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2570.431,2572.997,"Although, we didn't appoint you, but --"
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2572.997,2579.114,"Yes, well I also call the Court's attention to the Telye case which was I think decided at the same term."
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2603.245,2610.407,Well aren't we entitled to know what the Government represents as the public interest in this case?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2627.781,2636.493,I think Mr. Chief Justice that the position of the United States before this Court must be taken to be that formulated by the Solicitor General.
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2636.493,2638.107,That's part 2 of your brief?
1968.610,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2638.107,2640.762,"I would think so, yes sir."
1968.610,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2640.762,2644.155,But you argue against?
1968.610,2,23524,f_michael_ahern,,5083.637,5087.869,I have nothing further to add Mr. Chief Justice.
1968.610,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5087.869,5088.452,Very well.
