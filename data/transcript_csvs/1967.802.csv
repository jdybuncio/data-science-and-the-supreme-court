1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,27.765,30.582,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1967.802,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,185.423,186.967,Both Houses passed the Bill?
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,186.967,187.517,Sir?
1967.802,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,187.517,188.401,Did both Houses passed the Bill?
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,188.401,191.815,"Yes sir, the General Assembly of Virginia has adjourned sir."
1967.802,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,213.442,216.859,May I ask which one of the provisions that is --
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,216.859,218.613,Yes sir.
1967.802,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,228.3,228.799,Yes thank you.
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,228.799,238.729,"Now we agree with the spirit of it because we think quite candidly, that it protects the rights of the general public as well as that of the prisoners."
1967.802,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,376.5,380.904,"I suppose the Virginia Penal System does have different types of institutions, doesn't it?"
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,380.904,383.28,"Yes sir, we maintain several different types."
1967.802,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,394.303,403.413,And that where a person is incarcerated will depend at least partly upon how many offenses he has been convicted of.
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,403.413,409.141,"It would -- this would definitely, I would have state quite candidly have a very important effect."
1967.802,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,423.827,425.959,Don't think he'll never make it.
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,425.959,429.0,"Well, he's got some severe problems."
1967.802,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,429.0,432.8,Other than that does he might yet get this break?
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,434.678,435.324,Yes sir.
1967.802,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,435.324,440.005,So we can't attack you now he wants to attack that's a 30-year sentence.
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,441.352,445.436,"That is correct sir, in the Federal Court sir."
1967.802,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,449.592,457.401,"Example this, do you suppose he'll be in a position when the governor signs your new law to go into your state court to attack that second --"
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,457.401,458.068,Yes sir.
1967.802,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,460.452,461.554,And maybe this one.
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,462.341,463.852,Yes sir.
1967.802,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,488.141,497.356,"Well I -- what's the year if the governor signs this, the next couple of weeks, this could be the question over the years automatic state remedy --"
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,497.356,498.555,No sir.
1967.802,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,508.009,509.987,What if we don't sit back in the 28th?
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,509.987,518.354,"Well, I don't go on vacation until the 27th of July so -- but be that as it may."
1967.802,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,519.7,530.061,But if you agree with the principle of it and you believe that that's based upon your sense of justice.
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,549.7,550.483,Yes sir.
1967.802,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,583.357,587.825,"Well Mr. Harp, didn't we do exactly this in case of Nebraska?"
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,593.376,593.806,Yes sir thats correct.
1967.802,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,593.806,606.215,"And report that circumstance since the state now provided a remedy and the Attorney General of the State, your opposite number, came here and told us that that state procedure is now available."
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,613.164,616.11,Well this would be fine for about two years.
1967.802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,642.867,654.388,"So you said in that situation on the end of the line that you think is and should be, is a chance to petition for cert here from the state collateral relief."
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,654.388,655.287,You could do that.
1967.802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,655.287,656.966,From denial of state collateral relief?
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,656.966,659.542,That's correct sir.
1967.802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,659.542,665.468,But if we denied certiorari here there would be no resort to federal habeas after that.
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,665.468,667.586,That is correct sir.
1967.802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.503,684.126,"And in terms of questions of law, you might say that's nothing wrong with that, but that's some defect in hearing then there's a problem."
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,684.126,685.198,That is correct.
1967.802,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,819.444,825.416,But that would leave the man on the penitentiary until 1999 before he could get any relief.
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,825.416,825.674,No sir.
1967.802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,833.42,836.966,Do you mean is there will be a procedure to a relief?
1967.802,0,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,836.966,838.087,"Yes, there'd be a procedure."
1967.802,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,852.609,857.622,Was there to be a motion in this matter?
1967.802,1,42576,thomas_s_currier,,857.622,860.703,Mr. Chief Justice Warren may it please the Court.
1967.802,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,869.23,873.465,The motion is granted.
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,887.287,890.801,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,938.217,945.46,"And may I Mr. Kirby, as suppose we allege the illegality in a double jeopardy argument here?"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,945.46,954.248,The essential illegality I think Mr. Justice Brennan alleged in both cases is ineffective as representation of counsel.
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1132.394,1133.402,The suspension?
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1133.402,1136.011,The suspension was revoked and so he is now scheduled for --
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1136.011,1144.493,"-- now on the timetable, what would he be able to attack if under the state provision?"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1144.493,1146.151,Under the state provision?
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1146.151,1149.442,"The state's submission, when does this -- his present term when --"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1149.442,1156.118,"His present term that's un-attacked here would run out in 1994 I think, Your Honor."
1967.802,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1179.398,1184.112,By entitled to a hearing you he maybe stated a prima facie constitutional claim.
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1184.112,1185.324,They've started a prim--
1967.802,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1185.324,1186.305,"That's what you mean, isn't it?"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1186.305,1193.968,"Yes Your Honor; that if absent timeliness problems, that if this allegations were made in District Court."
1967.802,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1200.533,1204.963,We'll recess now Mr. Kirby.
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1208.4,1210.425,Thank you Your Honor.
1967.802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1424.094,1429.053,This is also being handled in the Virginia courts after June 28.
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1429.053,1437.093,Well Your Honor I think that raise the point raised by the Virginia legislation is its effect on this proceeding here.
1967.802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1480.878,1487.874,"The point is, suppose just by shear chance."
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1495.97,1496.927,Yes Your Honor.
1967.802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1496.927,1498.443,Just assume by chance.
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1503.724,1512.597,Well I am working on that assumption Mr. Justice Marshall that it would not be—that it will be signed before this Court hands a down a decision.
1967.802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1522.709,1549.229,"As of April 28, these prisoners would have under Virginia's argument, a post conviction proceeding in the Virginia courts and under your argument after April 28 there would have a post conviction proceeding in the federal court."
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1566.128,1570.535,You honor I think the no -- answer is no to both questions.
1967.802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1658.55,1660.645,And how about Rowe?
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1660.645,1668.875,Rowe Your Honor does make the base of the allegation that his counsel was ineffective also.
1967.802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1739.851,1751.246,"Your position is in regardless of this particular case and these particular men what we should do is look pass at everything, and overrule McNally on general principle?"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1751.246,1756.447,Well Your Honor I think there is substantial reason for ruling McNally in this case and in any case.
1967.802,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1917.919,1921.273,Are you asking if we overrule McNally?
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1921.273,1921.924,Yes Your Honor.
1967.802,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1936.112,1940.876,Do you understand McNally to be a constitutional rule?
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1940.876,1948.314,Your Honor I'm not sure whether McNally purported to base itself on the constitution.
1967.802,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1969.695,1982.794,"Well this that the bottom of your contention that McNally should be overruled; the constitutional provision with reference to the right to a speedy, public trial?"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1982.794,1987.296,No Your Honor I don't think that that is behind this.
1967.802,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1989.87,1995.986,"Otherwise, what is the constitutional provision for me to rely?"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,1995.986,1999.814,Your Honor we don't rely on a constitutional provision here.
1967.802,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2001.778,2007.538,But I understood you've said that McNally -- you didn't know whether it might be a constitutional --
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2007.538,2008.524,You honor I think I've corrected my --
1967.802,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2008.524,2015.136,"And you're asking if we overrule McNally if on the basis, I suppose on constitution --"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2015.136,2017.016,Your Honor I -- the constitutional --
1967.802,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2017.016,2028.804,-- that we could find something in the constitution which makes it what's been done illegal.And what would make that illegal other than provision to a speedy public trial?
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2028.804,2038.093,Your Honor I think that we might look to the suspension clause and the interaction into the suspension clause and the Fifth Amendment in the Fourteenth Amendment.
1967.802,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2038.093,2039.098,Suspension what?
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2039.098,2043.674,The suspension that the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended.
1967.802,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2045.042,2045.732,Well I think that's proper to argue.
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2045.732,2059.029,"Yes, I think it's not necessary though to reach any constitutional question here because I think the statute can be interpreted another way which obviates the necessity for reaching any constitutional issue."
1967.802,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2120.313,2123.625,I understand that what your basic argument now is that is.
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2131.185,2150.656,"Your Honor I think that McNally -- that upholding the McNally interpretation and that is that saying the congress said that the writ of habeas corpus is only available on these circumstances, raises to serious constitutional problems to which you have averted."
1967.802,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2154.983,2173.778,"What we're talking only is statutory construction why, since the court decided that McNally and Congress has invested itself to the same sections of through this statute here, why not leave it to the Congress?"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2178.323,2183.042,Well Your Honor I think that there are several things that could be said to that.
1967.802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.728,2309.271,Now that's a little different point as to whether or not you could do something in habeas corpus besides discharge.
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2320.116,2322.362,"I'm sorry Your Honor, I don't understand the question."
1967.802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.958,2330.173,Under the sentence that they are facing?
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2330.173,2335.946,"Your Honor I think that under at least one interpretation, they are in custody under the sentence which they're attacking."
1967.802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.946,2341.126,"Hold on, but McNally said they weren't, didn't it?"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2341.126,2341.796,Yes.
1967.802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2343.83,2345.298,They were in custody.
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2345.298,2352.93,-- that they were not in custody unless they we're actually serving and it identified service is the only restraint or liberty.
1967.802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.93,2362.058,That's a little different question whether or not when you grant the writ of habeas corpus you have to order a discharge.
1967.802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.058,2362.517,I agree.
1967.802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2377.612,2383.54,And the second one isn't here is it?
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2383.54,2384.985,"The relief, the scope of the relief."
1967.802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.985,2387.257,Remedy question isn't here isn't it?
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2387.257,2392.644,Yes Your Honor I think that the remedy question is here.
1967.802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.269,2398.986,"It's here if you get by the first point, it's here then?"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2398.986,2400.081,Yes Your Honor
1967.802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2400.081,2401.062,Not unless?
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2401.062,2402.811,"Not unless, I agree."
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2442.171,2452.993,"Tell me Mr. Kirby, when the judge imposes these sentences in this instance, was he already serving the first?"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2452.993,2458.297,"In the case of, Your Honor I think it's accurately stated that in both cases they were already serving."
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2458.482,2465.09,"Yes, in the second conviction following the imposition of the sentence that is against the first conviction."
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2465.09,2468.888,"Yes Your Honor but not in that order, not in that order Your Honor."
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2490.6,2495.709,So would it be possible to change the order of the sequence?
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2495.709,2496.544,No Your Honor its --
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2496.544,2498.533,At the time of the --
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2498.533,2522.16,"No Your Honor, the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has seen two cases one cited in my brief, Peyton versus Williams, 206 Virginia and the subsequent case in either, I think late 206 or early 207 Peyton versus Grace says that Mr. Milton, the Superintendent of Records at Virginia State Penitentiary can schedule sentences practically anyway he wants."
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2522.16,2522.737,So he may?
1967.802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2523.951,2529.053,These sentences took the guys in the --
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2529.053,2530.801,He could've scheduled them differently Your Honor.
1967.802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2532.151,2538.87,And on the happenstance of how he schedules them depends whether or not he has the right to attack it?
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2538.87,2542.606,Depends through his -- the access to the federal court.
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2542.606,2563.869,"-- so when you have, well I gather the more usual situation that is the prosecution under the fact of several counts, and there are convictions when the -- and that the second sentence is imposed, who picks out what sentence shall be served first and what count, how effect otherwise?"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2563.869,2568.775,Your Honor I think that unless the court and Mr. Harp may be able to correct me on this.
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2576.031,2577.064,Or the judge says --
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2577.064,2578.286,Yes.
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2578.286,2579.395,-- “Guilty on all counts.”
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2579.395,2580.168,To run consecutively.
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2580.168,2582.806,The year on each count to run consecutively.
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2593.92,2594.632,Yes Your Honor.
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2607.056,2619.982,"What's the difference if the court says “We sentence you to all counts that under the first to be followed by that under the second and then the third, the fourth” that binds them to --"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2619.982,2621.334,Your Honor I think it does.
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2710.76,2737.368,"Tell me, are you making any argument at all Mr. Kirby that whatever may have been the proper deposition of the custody in which you cite, in which you cite application on the facts of McNally, in any event on the facts of this case, custody can be possible to appraise this Section?"
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2739.343,2741.246,No Your Honor I'm not making that argument.
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2741.246,2744.819,You don't give these cases accountable to be suspicious?
1967.802,2,31282,john_j_kirby_jr,,2744.819,2747.903,No Your Honor I did not.
1967.802,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2748.424,2749.701,Thank you Mr. Kirby.
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,2751.157,2753.238,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1967.802,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2840.061,2850.658,"The problem is there is a clear conflict now in the Federal Circuits as to the availability of federal habeas corpus to somebody situated as these petitioners, as these respondents are."
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,2850.658,2851.752,That is correct sir.
1967.802,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2851.752,2862.28,"And well, Virginia as of what you've told us about Virginia is very interesting in facts there 49 other states and there is a clear certain conflict."
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,2862.28,2865.143,That is correct sir.
1967.802,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2865.143,2868.728,And would indicate that perhaps we better decide this case on the merits wouldn't it?
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,2868.728,2874.729,"That is correct sir, Mr. Kirby and I have full agreement that the case should be decided on the merits."
1967.802,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2882.996,2891.089,"May I ask, in light of this warden if he made a booking entry which had a different order of service would be --"
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,2891.089,2894.078,No sir I'll jump to that right now.
1967.802,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3015.152,3015.796,Mr. Harp.
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,3015.796,3016.541,Yes sir?
1967.802,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3016.541,3027.607,"With Thacker, suppose he had committed a violation of his parole other than to have been convicted of a crime?"
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,3027.607,3030.981,Then he would come back into the penal system under his old number sir.
1967.802,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3030.981,3034.048,And he could raise this point?
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,3034.048,3035.784,"He would then be serving the sentence of which he complained as I see it, yes sir."
1967.802,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3035.784,3037.474,He would be our from under it for now?
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,3037.474,3038.419,Yes sir.
1967.802,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3038.419,3045.634,But since he violated the wrong provision of his parole agreement McNally applied it.
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,3045.634,3045.97,No sir.
1967.802,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3079.327,3089.43,"Excuse Mr. Harp, you did say Virginia had this statutory provision of that shall serve in the order of which after the first?"
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,3093.259,3093.674,No sir.
1967.802,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3110.75,3112.109,Imposed by the trial judge?
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,3112.109,3113.074,Yes sir.
1967.802,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3129.039,3130.197,It's just a follow up.
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,3130.197,3130.745,Yes sir.
1967.802,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3130.745,3134.122,-- if the federal court if an officer gives the sentence -- gives the prisoner sentence.
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,3134.122,3135.465,That is correct sir.
1967.802,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3136.095,3139.33,Whenever they're appointed?
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,3139.33,3141.345,Yes sir.
1967.802,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.076,3148.08,Or defeating a little --
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,3148.08,3149.113,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1967.802,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3280.141,3283.658,"Well it's not those, these people are in custody."
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,3283.658,3293.187,But the question is and the statute says if Your Honor please repeatedly “in custody under a judgment” and they are not in custody under the judgment.
1967.802,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3302.35,3318.78,Mr. Kirby before we conclude this case in behalf of the Court I would like to thank you and your associate Mr. Currier for your representation of this indigent dependent.
1967.802,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,3381.854,3385.511,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
