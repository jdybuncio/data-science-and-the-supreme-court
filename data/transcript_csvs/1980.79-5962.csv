1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.654,We'll hear arguments next in Vincent v. Texas.
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,77.766,80.968,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,120.343,126.231,"Now, you're going to tell us why that wasn't swallowed up by the subsequent developments, aren't you?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,126.231,127.099,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,127.099,137.805,"Why that lack, assuming that there was a lack, was not swallowed up and made irrelevant by the subsequent events?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,137.805,139.074,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,201.747,215.657,And did he admit on the stand also that he had on the spot conceded he was intoxicated?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,215.657,216.474,I believe that's true.
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,216.474,219.276,"At the full hearing did it come out, what he had said before?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,219.276,220.826,Yes.
1980.79-5962,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,220.826,225.012,"Well, what then can we do for your client?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,231.35,256.566,"In terms of whether or not there was probable cause to hold him and whether this Court should either send it back for that hearing, I would probably concede, although that's what this Court did in Gagnon v. Scarpelli, that that would be an irrelevant and useless situation."
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,259.334,260.551,What else do you want?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,260.551,267.939,I have also asked the Court to in essence dismiss the probation proceedings.
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,267.939,268.589,Right.
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,268.589,279.247,By reason of the fact that the State of Texas for the past eight years has consistently refused to apply the mandates of this Court in due process hearing.
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,285.335,292.655,"Well, do you have any complaint about the revocation hearing on the proceeding?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,292.655,299.578,"Not the second stage hearing which this Court talked about, the full blown hearing; there was no complaint at that hearing."
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,300.161,301.928,You have no complaint about it now?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,301.928,303.38,"--No, none whatsoever."
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,303.38,304.83,"Well, then, what good--"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,304.83,305.913,But we haven't complained about it.
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,305.913,313.166,--would the preliminary hearing do you under the Morrissey case?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,313.166,325.576,"In terms of what it would actually do, what would happen is, if you remanded it for that probable cause hearing, they would put on the same evidence that was at the full blown hearing, they would conclude there was probable cause, and you'd have the hearing."
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,331.911,336.649,"Well, would not the practical effect... tell me what the practical effect would be?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,336.649,353.658,"--Well, the practical effect is, at the time that he was arrested and at the time from that point until he had a counsel appointed and was out on bail, he was held without a determination of probable cause under this Court's mandates."
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,369.12,374.94,"You're not saying, rectify the probable cause?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,374.94,375.474,No.
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,375.474,378.309,To rectify the lack of a probable cause hearing?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,378.309,378.759,Exactly.
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,378.759,381.261,There certainly was probable cause.
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,381.261,384.63,The fact of probable cause was never attacked.
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,387.082,389.7,What does Gerstein v. Pugh tell us about that problem?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,389.7,403.091,"Gerstein v. Pugh, the only way that comes in is, what do you do with a conviction which is based upon an improper detention or an arrest without probable cause?"
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,415.582,422.671,"Well, if we wouldn't void a conviction on that ground, do you think we ought to void a parole revocation on that ground?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,422.671,425.123,"--In this case, yes."
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,425.123,427.023,And then what would happen?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,428.992,430.86,"Not on this particular violation, no."
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,430.86,432.426,Why not?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,432.426,434.662,If that conviction--
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,434.662,439.297,You mean that's dead and gone?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,439.297,441.482,--I think it would be; yes.
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,441.482,448.486,A revocation couldn't properly be based upon that conduct?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,449.505,454.224,"I think in this situation that would be the logical conclusion of what this Court would say, yes."
1980.79-5962,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,454.224,456.575,Is this a class action?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,456.575,457.558,No.
1980.79-5962,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.125,466.864,"And Gerstein v. Pugh was an appeal by the tate from an opinion of the three judge district court, was it not?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,466.864,467.383,Yes.
1980.79-5962,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,469.049,474.684,"In other words, would you be satisfied with prospective relief here?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,474.684,495.866,"I would be satisfied with my client, first of all, having his probation revocation voided, and secondly, if this Court decides from that point on that it applies only to probation revocations which are on appeal currently in Texas plus in the future, my client would have no reason not to accept that ruling."
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,495.866,519.482,"But as far as the law is concerned if it were simply announced that dispensing with the first hearing was not testified in this case but that no relief flows from that, you would be sort of like Gagnon."
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,533.772,535.374,He'd won the battle but maybe lost the war.
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,535.374,540.811,"Well, I don't know; you might... this is not a 1983 suit, is it?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,540.811,541.661,No.
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,541.661,555.905,"But if you had waited and filed a 1983 suit and said I want some damages even if it's a peppercorn, I want a declaratory judgment that I was wronged, and I want damages, and I should get a penny at least."
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,555.905,559.857,That peppercorn might give Mr. Vincent some moral satisfaction.
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,559.857,560.892,"Well, at least it would be a--"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,560.892,569.58,"But I think the State argues, and depending on how this Court handles the question of prospectivity, for example--"
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,569.58,574.782,--Do you think it's the function of this Court to be handing out peppercorns or granting significant relief?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,574.782,593.53,"--I think it's the function of this Court to enforce the Gagnon v. Scarpelli and grant significant relief insofar as Mr. Vincent is concerned, and I think in terms of whether it's prospective or not, we're not talking about a situation like Gagnon v. Scarpelli or Morrissey v. Brewer."
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,618.828,619.011,Did they say that in here?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,621.18,630.886,"They simply said that in this case, that Mr. Vincent's position has been adversely decided against him in a prior case and cited the Whisenant v. State case."
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.289,638.391,And what did they say in the prior case?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,638.391,680.301,"--In the Whisenant case they said that Gagnon v. Scarpelli does not apply to Texas probation revocation proceedings for several reasons: number one, we made the distinction earlier between the suspension of imposition of sentence and the suspension of execution; number two, Texas procedure provides more due process than Gagnon v. Scarpelli; and third, that the probationer is entitled to a mandatory 20-day hearing, and that obviates the necessity, they believed, for a preliminary determination from appellants."
1980.79-5962,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,680.301,704.6,"Mr. McCutcheon, according to my recollection there was recently filed in this case a motion to dismiss the appeal, based upon the proposition that your client had escaped before his case was decided by the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, and that therefore that court didn't have any jurisdiction and that we don't."
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,711.671,711.904,That's correct.
1980.79-5962,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,712.237,713.456,--to the hearing on the matter?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,713.456,716.658,--I understood that that motion had been already overruled by this Court.
1980.79-5962,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,716.658,717.074,"Oh, I see."
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,718.291,719.224,That was my understanding from co counsel.
1980.79-5962,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,739.887,742.003,"Excuse me, Mr. McCutcheon?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,742.003,743.089,--minimum requirements... yes?
1980.79-5962,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,743.089,747.124,Did you say you had information that we had actually overruled that motion?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,748.993,752.695,"As I understood it, you're talking about the motion to dismiss on escape?"
1980.79-5962,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,752.695,753.445,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,753.445,757.063,As opposed to the original motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
1980.79-5962,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,757.063,759.682,"No, no, this is a motion based on his escape, on his alleged escape."
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,759.682,762.448,I was informed by counsel for the State this morning.
1980.79-5962,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,771.138,773.323,You mean by a formal order?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,774.04,777.042,"All I was told, that it had been overruled."
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,777.042,779.477,We postponed it to the merits.
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,781.779,788.099,"Well, I understood that the motion that was postponed to the merits was the original motion to dismiss that was filed right after I--"
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,788.099,789.867,"--The motion was denied, we're informed."
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,790.467,792.236,--All right.
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,792.236,799.057,Where is your client?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,799.057,804.044,My client is in the correctional facility in the State of Colorado.
1980.79-5962,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,814.067,818.602,When was your last communication with him?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,818.602,822.922,Right after I received the State's Motion to Dismiss on the grounds of escape.
1980.79-5962,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,822.922,823.873,This recent one?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,823.873,828.076,Yes.
1980.79-5962,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,853.708,859.679,"Well, wasn't one of the conditions of his probation to obey all the laws?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,859.679,861.631,Yes.
1980.79-5962,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,861.631,864.832,And he was picked up for drunken driving?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,864.832,865.732,Yes.
1980.79-5962,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,865.732,881.711,And didn't either the arresting officer or... I forget if he was taken before a magistrate or not... find there was probable cause to arrest him for drunken driving?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,881.711,888.531,The officer made that determination as he must do in all situations for arrest.
1980.79-5962,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,899.339,904.492,What admissions if any did your client make at that time?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,904.492,908.544,"Well, he admitted that he was intoxicated and that he was on probation."
1980.79-5962,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,908.544,910.23,And even that he was driving?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,910.23,910.63,Yes.
1980.79-5962,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,910.63,911.33,"Well, that's clear."
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,911.33,912.746,"Well, he was clearly driving the car."
1980.79-5962,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,912.746,914.765,"So it was a clear violation of his probation, wasn't it?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,914.765,915.132,Yes.
1980.79-5962,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,915.132,915.965,By his own admission?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,915.965,917.4,Yes.
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,917.4,926.84,"What do you need the hearing for at that stage, in view of his subsequent admission at the revocation hearing that he had violated the conditions of his parole?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,934.112,943.535,"Because, Your Honor, as this Court has said, one of the purposes of that preliminary hearing is not only to determine probable cause but to--"
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,943.535,944.201,But he's determined it.
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,947.32,950.07,"--But, number one, he was intoxicated when he made that admission."
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,950.07,955.807,"What did he admit when he had the revocation hearing, which was a number of days or weeks later?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,955.807,962.044,When I put him on the stand he admitted that he had been drinking beer seven or eight hours earlier.
1980.79-5962,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,962.044,964.061,And that he had admitted it before?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,964.061,964.746,Yes.
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,964.746,968.698,And he was conscious of having admitted it before?
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,968.698,982.374,"It seems to me, though, that what this Court... the problem with that approach is that you're looking at a later determination of the merits to decide whether you filed... should or should not have followed due process grounds earlier in the case."
1980.79-5962,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,996.032,1016.096,"But we decide specific concrete controversies here, and in this case certainly there is some sense that there wasn't a concrete controversy as to whether your client at the initial stage had violated parole."
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,1016.096,1018.63,I would agree with that statement.
1980.79-5962,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1024.367,1030.271,"Then, why haven't all of his rights been fulfilled by the State of Texas?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,1036.092,1064.509,"It seems to me that there is a reason to have a hearing for a fact which may not be in dispute and that is that in order to set a procedure, a constitutional procedure under that statute, which for seven years the Court had said it did not have to follow, that even though he may have admitted it at the time he is still entitled to that hearing, to have the evidence presented against him, the witnesses told to him, and a chance to speak."
1980.79-5962,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1064.509,1088.81,"Well, supposing that in a civil case the plaintiff alleges that the defendant was at the intersection of High and Broad in Columbus, Ohio, at 12 noon on such and such a day, and the defendant admits it, do you think that either party is entitled to a hearing on that?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,1088.81,1091.596,Not in a civil case.
1980.79-5962,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1099.0,1108.371,"But isn't yours very much the same, that there is no dispute as to the fact on which you want a hearing?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,1108.371,1129.971,"There is no dispute now as to the fact, there probably was not a dispute at the time, but the fact is that he was not afforded those minimum due process rights which I do not understand to be dependent on whether he was guilty or innocent."
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1138.391,1141.242,"Well, that isn't what Morrissey v. Brewer held at all."
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,1191.858,1194.877,"Your Honor, number one, it's not purely academic."
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1194.877,1197.412,"It isn't a class action, as Justice Rehnquist suggested--"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,1197.412,1197.762,No.
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1197.762,1201.031,--where you make the establishing procedure.
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,1201.031,1205.415,"But I think you are in essence, you are establishing a procedure in Morrissey--"
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1205.415,1207.35,We've established that in Morrissey v. Brewer.
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,1207.35,1210.052,--And you've established it in Gagnon v. Scarpelli.
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1214.521,1223.61,"Well, you're here to see, to have us monitor the State courts on their actual application?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,1223.61,1226.312,"Insofar as it related to my client, yes."
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1226.312,1231.65,"And, will you tell us again what you can accomplish?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,1231.65,1239.072,"Insofar as my client is concerned, I cannot probably accomplish any more than was accomplished in Gagnon v. Scarpelli."
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1259.402,1274.745,"Yes, but, again, Morrissey v. Brewer said he's entitled to be sure you've got the right man so they don't send him back to jail because of an act committed by someone else of the same name."
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,1285.367,1286.803,It could be a disinterested--
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1286.803,1288.719,And the probation officer dealt with it here.
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,1288.719,1291.005,--But that was not a disinterested probation officer.
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1295.658,1305.947,"And he rather sensibly concluded that nothing else was necessary, in view of the admissions of this man that he was driving under those conditions, would you not agree to that?"
1980.79-5962,0,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,1305.947,1315.47,"I would think he concluded that under the state of the law at the time that was all he had to do, was to get the county attorney to file a motion and have the probation started."
1980.79-5962,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1331.98,1340.418,"Mr. Becker, among other things, perhaps you will enlighten me on why we're here at all."
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1340.418,1341.201,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-5962,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1502.541,1507.059,And presumably was issued only upon probable cause?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1507.059,1507.595,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-5962,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1507.595,1509.678,"Although it doesn't so recite, does it?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1509.678,1510.094,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-5962,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1516.582,1517.515,Should be issued for the arrest of the said appellant.
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1517.515,1518.015,That's right.
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1525.119,1526.204,"Does the language,"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1529.556,1530.19,Yes?
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1530.19,1534.008,--does that equate to probable cause?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1536.91,1546.101,"Yes, Your Honor, because under Texas law probable cause is required for an arrest warrant to arrest for a motion to revoke probation, same as in any other circumstances."
1980.79-5962,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1553.505,1558.425,What's the reference in the arrest warrant to burglary?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1558.425,1559.409,To the burglary?
1980.79-5962,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1559.409,1559.909,Yes.
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1559.909,1561.194,"None whatever, Your Honor."
1980.79-5962,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1568.681,1571.817,--for the revocation was the drunken driving offense.
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1571.817,1573.835,"--Yes, that's right."
1980.79-5962,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1588.011,1590.38,"It was a burglary, which was--"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1590.38,1592.28,"--his original offense, for which--"
1980.79-5962,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1592.28,1592.98,--Original conviction?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1592.98,1593.498,--Yes.
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1627.902,1639.96,"This hearing that you referred to, the order on page 18, that occurred two days, no one day after the drunken driving episode, did it not?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1639.96,1640.41,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1647.797,1660.54,"Do you suggest that that process is the equivalent, the functional equivalent of the hearing that might have been held before a neutral probation officer under Morrissey v. Brewer?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1660.54,1661.89,"Not alone, Your Honor."
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1769.303,1770.072,At revocation?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1770.072,1771.472,"Yes, sir, at revocation."
1980.79-5962,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1864.729,1868.348,"Mr. Becker, may I see if I can restate your argument as I understand the thrust of it?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1886.209,1889.678,--That is the large part of what I'm saying.
1980.79-5962,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1895.165,1895.532,Right.
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1907.223,1908.008,Exactly; that's exactly right.
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1923.381,1928.785,"In other words, you're saying Texas is giving a great deal more than Morrissey v. Brewer required."
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1928.785,1955.27,"Your Honor, if the flexibility in according due process protections that this Court has so frequently spoken of means anything, it means to me that what Texas has done in this case overall greatly exceeds the constitutional minimum, and that the mere happenstance that as far as the preliminary hearing is concerned, that that is not something that's routinely afforded in light of all the other procedures, states no violation of the Constitution."
1980.79-5962,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1955.27,1969.529,"Mr. Becker, you mention on page 11 of your brief the case of Escoe v. Zerbst, which was decided by this Court in 1935, which characterized probation as an act of grace."
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1991.093,1992.628,"Consistently yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-5962,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2047.112,2049.078,"Mr. Becker, can I just ask one more question?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2064.422,2074.513,"Well, Your Honor, there are all sorts of rights given to all sorts of people, that those people aren't told about."
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2180.096,2183.381,Is it also true that he wouldn't get it if he didn't do it?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2183.381,2189.635,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think that that is true any more than anybody else who was thrown in jail."
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2189.635,2195.939,"Well, we realize that a man in Huntsville doesn't move around freely, don't we?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2195.939,2202.193,"Well, now, the record in this case reflects, Your Honor, that he made two phone calls to his former attorney."
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2210.647,2218.153,"Do you know that our Constitution has two sets of rules, one for those who know, and one for those who do not know?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2218.153,2219.236,"--Well, he already had a lawyer."
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2235.114,2236.064,How'd you know that?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2236.064,2238.747,Because he testified to that in the transcript.
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.432,2243.051,I think I remember that one.
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2243.051,2245.586,"--Yes, sir, he had a conversation with her on the telephone."
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2245.586,2258.827,"But my whole point is that you put a guy in jail and then the statute says, if you can get word out, you'll get a hearing."
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2261.529,2263.731,"Well, as I said, Your Honor--"
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2263.731,2267.083,Is that the Texas system?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2267.083,2270.551,"--In other words, if he didn't get word out, he could sit there indefinitely?"
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2270.551,2271.151,Yes.
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2271.151,2277.872,"He could sit there indefinitely except that he has a right to bail, in the discretion of the court, and he has a general--"
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2277.872,2280.891,Does he get the bail without applying for it?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2280.891,2281.843,"--Well, he may."
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2281.843,2282.376,How?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2282.376,2284.226,It's in the discretion of the trial court.
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2284.226,2287.145,"Well, how can the Court give him bail if he doesn't ask for it?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2287.145,2292.031,"Well, they did it... directive reflects... they did it the first time he'd been thrown in jail for possessing marijuana."
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2292.031,2294.566,"Well, how did he get before the court?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2294.566,2296.283,On that occasion?
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2296.283,2299.987,I thought this case was talking about the man who is in jail?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2299.987,2301.387,"Yes, that's correct, sir."
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2301.387,2304.172,"Well, how can he get bail in jail if he doesn't apply for it?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2307.224,2310.993,"Apparently, the judge might, the judge and the district attorney."
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2321.384,2322.418,I'm just asking for facts.
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2322.418,2322.951,Yes.
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2322.951,2329.573,Is the only way that he gets this due process is to ask for it in some fashion?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2329.573,2333.858,"Well, the only way that he's guaranteed to get it, that's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-5962,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2343.547,2344.68,Does that make it right?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2344.68,2356.354,"Well, if I were a legislator I might have written that statute a little differently, but I am adamant upon the point that if we didn't have the statute our procedures would still be constitutional."
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2409.586,2412.371,"And that would comply with Morrissey v. Brewer, you say?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2412.371,2415.49,"--I say that it would, as I read the case."
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2598.51,2603.996,Is it always a judge of the State of Texas who hears the revocation proceeding?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2603.996,2605.279,Invariably.
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2606.763,2611.417,"And that's considerably beyond our cases, isn't it?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2611.417,2614.519,"Always a judge, always an attorney."
1980.79-5962,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2614.519,2616.654,You make Texas sound almost perfect.
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2617.937,2660.25,"Well, no, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Marshall may well have pointed out something that we might have done better, but in truth, if you look at the Appendix that's in our brief, which was prepared painstakingly, where there is a comparison of Texas procedures with those of every other state, as to what we selected as broad based matters of comparison, Fourth Amendment protection, Fifth Amendment rights, right to counsel, and whether or not each of those states affords those protections, Texas is the only state with ""yes's"" all the way across except of course that a preliminary hearing is not invariably required."
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2660.25,2675.51,"But at that point, Mr. Becker, in order to take him into custody and start the revocation proceeding, doesn't the officer have to make a motion?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2675.51,2676.46,Yes.
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2679.062,2680.045,Where does he file it?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2680.045,2680.83,At court.
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.83,2683.047,And who acts on it?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2683.047,2685.631,"Well, an arrest warrant has to be issued."
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.631,2686.9,"I know, but who acts on it?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2686.9,2688.033,The judge.
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2688.033,2690.852,And the warrant doesn't issue until a judge acts?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2690.852,2691.452,Right.
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2691.452,2693.637,And what's attached to the motion?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2693.637,2696.439,What's attached to the motion to revoke?
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.458,2700.275,Is there an affidavit?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2700.275,2703.56,"There is always commonly an affidavit, yes, sir."
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2706.179,2707.595,It's signed by him but not by a lawyer?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2707.595,2708.429,--Right.
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2712.683,2731.894,"Are you suggesting, or should you suggest, that whatever reliability factor the initial hearing in Morrissey was supposed to require is in a sense made up for by this necessity of filing a motion in court?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2731.894,2747.756,"--It's... yes, it's made up for, that it's almost made up for, and that it's close enough to be an all right made up for, but because of the lack of a wrongful determination down the line, because of that hearing that's coming soon, that dealing both ends of the spectrum--"
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2747.756,2757.795,Is this similar to the probable cause hearing that's necessary or equivalent to what's necessary in Gagnon to assure compliance?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2757.795,2761.664,"--Well, yes, Your Honor, except that the accused has no right to be there."
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2764.366,2773.704,Do you think the... do you think that Morrissey inevitably requires the presence of the accused at the first hearing?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2773.704,2777.025,"--Well, that's how I read it; yes, sir."
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.693,2782.543,"Oh, I know you'd be glad--"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2782.543,2784.679,"--Yes, but as I read it, yes, he's required to be there."
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2788.916,2796.82,"--But it's really just that it's in order to have a fairly reliable probable cause determination, isn't it?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2796.82,2797.939,"Yes, that's right."
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2809.211,2817.916,"But you could arrest, you could have people arrested and incarcerated on an ex parte proceeding under an arrest warrant."
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2817.916,2819.452,It happens all the time.
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.452,2824.256,"And so, you're saying that this is as reliable as that, anyway."
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2824.256,2824.572,Yes.
1980.79-5962,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.572,2827.208,You file a motion and the judge acts on it and issues a warrant.
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2827.208,2827.741,Yes.
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2828.958,2853.489,"Well, under Morrissey v. Brewer, a man in this situation, apparently driving while intoxicated, might come into that preliminary hearing and bring in the affidavit of his dentist that he'd just had two teeth pulled and that he had given him a sedative and that that would explain a condition that would resemble intoxication."
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2874.235,2875.318,"--This is true, Your Honor."
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2880.806,2885.274,So there were no problems of the kind that we were concerned about in Morrissey v. Brewer?
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2885.274,2886.043,--Right.
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2903.37,2916.312,"Now, your friend has not suggested... at least if he did, I didn't hear him suggest anything that might have been done, any showing that he might have made at that Morrissey v. Brewer hearing."
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2922.366,2923.366,None whatsoever.
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2987.057,2989.259,"Is he still a fugitive, if you know?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2989.259,2993.611,"Well, of course, we have a factual dispute as to whether he's a fugitive."
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2993.611,2995.663,"Well, is he incarcerated or not?"
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2995.663,2997.015,He is incarcerated in Colorado.
1980.79-5962,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2997.015,2997.932,In another state.
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2997.932,2998.715,In another state there is--
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2998.715,2999.765,--for another offense.
1980.79-5962,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2999.765,3004.419,"--For a different... as a matter of fact, for revocation of probation up there, if you can believe it."
1980.79-5962,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3019.178,3022.813,"Do you have anything further, Mr. McCutcheon?"
1980.79-5962,2,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,3022.813,3024.596,"One brief point, Your Honor."
1980.79-5962,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3064.457,3066.34,"Well, it's upon the order of."
1980.79-5962,2,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,3066.34,3067.675,Order of the Court.
1980.79-5962,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3070.111,3084.121,That's a considerably different kettle of fish than having the decision to arrest made by an officer of the law independently of the court.
1980.79-5962,2,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,3084.121,3091.874,"--If it's done in the ordinary sense that we think of an arrest warrant being done, that is, upon an affidavit with the information--"
1980.79-5962,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3091.874,3096.594,Arrests are made on warrants that are issued ex parte all the time.
1980.79-5962,2,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,3096.594,3100.88,"--I understand, but they also may on arrest warrants under Texas procedure."
1980.79-5962,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3118.056,3125.162,Is that interchange between the probation officer and the judge in the record?
1980.79-5962,2,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,3125.162,3125.795,It is not.
1980.79-5962,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3126.562,3129.53,How do we know what happened between them?
1980.79-5962,2,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,3129.53,3131.482,--The only thing we know is what the order says.
1980.79-5962,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.482,3137.402,"At least it's perfectly clear, though, that the probation officer did not act on his own."
1980.79-5962,2,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,3137.402,3138.369,That's right.
1980.79-5962,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3138.369,3151.395,"In Morrissey the question was whether if you're going to administratively detain a man and make the administrative determination, and bind him over, you're going to have to have whatever Morrissey said."
1980.79-5962,2,39857,robert_d_mccutcheon,,3155.181,3156.381,That's correct.
1980.79-5962,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3163.803,3164.887,"Thank you, gentlemen."
