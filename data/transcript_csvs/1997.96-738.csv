1997.96-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.254,"We'll hear argument now in No. 96-738, Mario Salinas v. United States."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,9.606,12.391,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-738,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,125.331,126.797,"Of course, it's clear the statute would apply in those cases."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,134.617,135.653,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1997.96-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,171.373,180.313,"But our... our inquiry, really... we think probably that Congress is the one to decide whether the government's interest is satisfied."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,193.053,197.94,"Well, yes, it would be, Justice Rehnquist, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-738,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,212.784,227.544,"Then why... why... why is this statute... I gather the government gave 860... or $850,000, and about 915,000 a year, to house 100... 100 Federal prisoners... up to 100."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,227.544,228.194,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-738,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,228.194,230.912,"That's about $9,000 or $10,000 a prisoner."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,230.912,231.947,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
1997.96-738,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,231.947,234.413,"To create a certain kind of a room, a cell."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,234.413,235.232,Right.
1997.96-738,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,235.232,237.632,And now that room or cell was misused.
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,261.466,273.374,"Well, because in... in... in the trial court level, the judge faced the issue of whether this conduct in this case, the... the conjugal visits or the contact visits, were... were illegal."
1997.96-738,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,295.188,298.39,"I'm... I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't quite grasp the... the answer to your question."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,309.698,311.331,"Yes... yes, ma'am."
1997.96-738,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,311.331,313.665,So why would that have to be put to the jury?
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,314.934,315.867,"No... no, ma'am."
1997.96-738,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,335.265,344.287,"Well, why would there have been a need for the briber to bribe if the conjugal visits were lawful?"
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,344.287,352.976,I... I think it's because it was a policy of the sheriff's department not to allow conjugal visits.
1997.96-738,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,366.284,381.394,"Well, wouldn't there also be a Federal interest in... in not wanting its... its contract jails to be used for bribery, even if in fact the briber gets a very bad deal?"
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,381.394,383.262,"Yes, I... I think there is--"
1997.96-738,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,383.262,390.0,"So, if that's the case, then what difference does it make whether, in fact, these visits were, in fact, lawful or not lawful?"
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,390.0,394.653,"--Well, because this statute is directed to the protection of property."
1997.96-738,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,423.321,432.679,"Well, suppose... suppose the jail official charged with purchasing the food for the prisoners is taking a... a bribe and a kickback, and siphons off $10,000 a month."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,434.979,435.796,--Yes.
1997.96-738,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,435.796,437.013,Is that covered by this statute?
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,437.013,445.986,"Yes, it is covered by that statute, because then there is... is something that was taken from the Federal funds or from the State funds, but not the local funds."
1997.96-738,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,445.986,446.452,No... no; these are State funds.
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,448.604,465.9,"Yes, sir, it... it is... Justice Kennedy, it is covered by this statute, because the statute, in my reading of it, says, not only are we protecting Federal funds, but state, we're going to protect your funds, we're going to protect your property, we're going to protect you from bribery."
1997.96-738,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,469.935,481.092,"Suppose the Federal Government gives money for a museum or for a dam, and a State official improperly says to the public, I'll charge you to use the dam, and keeps the money."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,485.027,485.677,Mmm-hmm.
1997.96-738,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,485.677,487.629,Is that covered by the statute?
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,487.629,498.287,"I... I think it would be probably not covered by the statute, because nothing was taken from the Federal Government or the State government or the local government."
1997.96-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,521.736,526.538,"Well, that... that... that's a bit tautological to say that not all prohibited transactions are covered."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,526.538,526.921,--Yes.
1997.96-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,526.921,537.46,"Where... where in the statute do you find the language that would make it not applicable, say, to Justice Breyer's question?"
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,537.46,554.071,"I find it in... in the bribery portion of the statute that says that in order for it to be a violation, there has to be... it has to involve a transaction... business transaction or series of transaction of government, involving more than $5,000."
1997.96-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,563.36,566.562,"So you say the amount of the bribe would have to be $5,000?"
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,566.562,567.679,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1997.96-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,571.7,574.668,"Then what does the $5,000 refer to?"
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,574.668,580.056,It refers to the value to the Federal Government or the State government or the local government of what was taken away from them.
1997.96-738,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,590.677,596.831,"But you don't tie it into the text of this provision, Mr. Enriquez; that... that... that's what troubles me."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,611.725,612.527,I... I don't... I don't--
1997.96-738,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,612.527,613.427,--there's no business?
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,613.427,616.812,"--I think that's... that's our point, Your Honor, that... that these--"
1997.96-738,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,616.812,618.329,"Well, you didn't put it that way in your brief."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,639.51,641.16,"--I... I wouldn't either, and even--"
1997.96-738,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,641.16,642.046,--or a business.
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,642.046,643.162,--That's right.
1997.96-738,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.31,666.995,He gives the contract or he gives--
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,666.995,667.895,A bid.
1997.96-738,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.895,669.114,--or gives the business--
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,669.114,670.346,Or the grant.
1997.96-738,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.346,671.898,"--Or the grant or whatever, yeah."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,671.898,672.865,Or things of that nature.
1997.96-738,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,672.865,673.515,Are you saying that--
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,685.473,687.841,I... I think that's... there's a possibility of that reading.
1997.96-738,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,699.133,734.139,"Well, but we're looking at (B), somebody who corruptly solicits or demands for the demand of any person... that could be for the benefit of Beltran... or agrees to accept anything of value from any person... and he agreed to accept money from Beltran... intending to be influenced or rewarded... which he was... in connection with a transaction of the government or agency... the transaction being the housing of Federal prisoners, pursuant to the contract."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,738.224,751.683,"I... I guess our position, Justice O'Connor, is that the... the only transaction there was a transaction between the marshal's office and the County of Hidalgo to establish this agreement."
1997.96-738,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,762.139,763.158,It isn't that complicated.
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,774.447,775.049,--That's right.
1997.96-738,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,793.677,813.472,"Well, the reason the government wants a statute like this is to avoid the unseemliness of giving large sums of Federal money for services to the Federal Government that are being carried out in a corrupt fashion by the entity and the employees charged with conducting it."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,813.472,814.172,"Yes, ma'am."
1997.96-738,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,826.564,829.183,"Well, but the language of (B) is broader than that."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,833.302,834.335,"--Yes, Your Honor--"
1997.96-738,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,834.335,837.337,"I mean, we... we look at the language of the statute."
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,837.337,837.956,--Yes.
1997.96-738,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,844.11,847.312,"Convince my colleague, Justice Scalia, of that, would you?"
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,847.928,849.428,I will try.
1997.96-738,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.014,852.314,May I just ask this?
1997.96-738,0,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,863.487,864.004,--That's what... that's what--
1997.96-738,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1544.193,1549.58,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-738,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1582.135,1583.737,What was the transaction?
1997.96-738,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1583.737,1587.539,The transaction in this case was allowing con... was allowing conjugal visits.
1997.96-738,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.436,1616.291,"If I took a bribe for... for allowing the prisoner to open his window, would... would opening the window be a transaction?"
1997.96-738,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1616.291,1620.843,I think that if the... it could be.
1997.96-738,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.766,1632.234,"Yeah, I think you're using ""transaction"" in... in a... in a broad sense that I really don't recognize."
1997.96-738,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1632.684,1633.586,I do think that what--
1997.96-738,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1633.586,1639.49,"--the word really has, to me, a... a, you know, a flavor of a deal between two people--"
1997.96-738,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1639.49,1640.857,"--Well, let me first--"
1997.96-738,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.857,1641.74,"--as ""business"" does."
1997.96-738,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1641.74,1644.042,"--let me first say, this is not a point that's discussed in the briefs."
1997.96-738,2,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,3017.978,3021.782,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-738,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3160.523,3170.961,"Well, Mr.... Mr. Enriquez, the statute here says, whoever being an agent of a State, local or Indian tribe, so there's no doubt that Congress meant to include those... those persons, is there?"
1997.96-738,2,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,3170.961,3172.846,"--Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct."
1997.96-738,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3176.632,3183.286,"So you say we must read each clause in the Act with... with that in mind, even though it was clear that Congress intended to include State officials?"
1997.96-738,2,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,3183.286,3193.16,"--Yes, because, all... all of a sudden, we have a situation here where Congress is indicating that it wants to work upon or... or affect State officials."
1997.96-738,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3201.664,3203.533,Are you suggesting there's a Tenth Amendment--
1997.96-738,2,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,3203.533,3204.967,"Yes, ma'am, I do."
1997.96-738,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3204.967,3236.754,"--and that this is... that... that it would be unconstitutional for the Federal Government to say, now, when we give our money to State operators, we want that agency, in all of its parts, to be clean, because if there's bribery going on with the State program, the... there's the risk that the same officers that are dishonest with regard to the State program are going to be dishonest with regard to the Federal program?"
1997.96-738,2,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,3236.754,3250.513,"I... I think the Federal Government can do that, ma'am, if... if it is couched in terms of protecting its property or if it's couched in another jurisdictional element, such as it affects interstate commerce, or one of the jurisdictional elements--"
1997.96-738,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3250.513,3254.984,"Well, what's wrong with Federal money... that seems to be a big Federal peg... we're giving you Federal money--"
1997.96-738,2,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,3254.984,3255.734,"--Yes, ma'am."
1997.96-738,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3255.734,3256.65,--to make conditions on it?
1997.96-738,2,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,3256.65,3264.773,"And I understand that... that the... the government's position on this is that it's under the Spending Clause and that, by virtue of spending, they can go ahead and regulate."
1997.96-738,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3303.548,3308.016,"Did you make that argument somewhere else along the line, or did you just today?"
1997.96-738,2,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,3308.016,3308.833,"No, ma'am."
1997.96-738,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3315.004,3317.289,You made that argument in the lower courts?
1997.96-738,2,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,3317.289,3331.615,"--I... I don't know that we argued it in terms of Commerce Clause, but we argued it in terms of property of the government; that this was a protection of property statute, and... and that it could be just... it could be justified only on that basis."
1997.96-738,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3331.615,3333.4,But the Tenth Amendment argument that you're presenting to us now--
1997.96-738,2,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,3333.4,3333.817,"Yes, ma'am."
1997.96-738,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3333.817,3335.083,--did you make that in the lower courts?
1997.96-738,2,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,3335.083,3337.685,"We didn't specifically come out and say Tenth Amendment, Your Honor."
1997.96-738,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3337.685,3339.052,"Thank you, Mr. Enriquez."
1997.96-738,2,23872,francisco_j_enriquez,,3340.302,3340.852,Thank you.
