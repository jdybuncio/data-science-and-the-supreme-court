1972.72-269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.229,"We'll hear arguments next in 72-269, Levitt against Committee for Public Education and 72-270 and 271."
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,50.029,53.296,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-269,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,532.52,552.147,"Ms. Coon, in this connection, is the record clear as to the fact of the state aid embracing or not embracing teachers' examinations as such other than the generalized test that come out of the state offices?"
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,552.147,586.308,"Yes, Your Honor, because the -- the state Commissioner's regulations require the non-public schools to have a continual – in-school program of testing of pupils to measure educational achievement and that the testing involved here includes not only the general test imposed by the State which are statewide in application but also the state's examination of the test administered in the schools to determine whether or not the pupils in all grades are meeting levels of educational achievement."
1972.72-269,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,586.308,592.696,"So but if a teacher gives a weekly quiz, her time in the preparation of the quiz is -- just is part of the cost that's taken into consideration."
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,592.696,596.571,That was included in the cost analysis studies.
1972.72-269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,596.571,599.944,How does the State audit that?
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,603.829,607.114,They require reports to be made to the Commission of Education.
1972.72-269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,607.114,611.077,"Well, reports on each individual pupil?"
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,611.077,613.51,"On -- on the results of testing, yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,633.291,644.355,"Is it possible for the New York statute to have been constituted more narrowly so as to, as not to include what you have just told me is included?"
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,644.355,651.986,It would be possible to so construe it and that might raise a question as to the relationship of the amount paid.
1972.72-269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,678.74,682.225,Has -- has this statute ever been constituted by the state courts?
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,682.225,685.129,"No, Your Honor it has not."
1972.72-269,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,685.129,690.715,"So that, it's conceivable that they might have constituted the statute more narrowly had it gone to them?"
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,690.715,695.838,"It is conceivable, Your Honor."
1972.72-269,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,695.838,709.799,-- question in this case might very well be whether the process of testing can in fact be separated from the basic overall process of teaching?
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,723.562,724.792,"No, Your Honor they are not."
1972.72-269,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,724.954,727.301,Are –- are any prepared by the local schools?
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,727.301,728.843,"Yes, Your Honor, they are."
1972.72-269,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,731.819,732.647,Right.
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,743.652,755.696,I would assume any type of test the teacher would use as -- to measuring the -- whether or not her pupils have understood and – and learned the material provided.
1972.72-269,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.768,794.23,"Ms. Coon, is there a -- do I understand there's a difference between the kinds of tests that are given on the public schools from the kinds of test that are given in the non-public school?"
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,794.23,805.568,"No, except in this regard that there is no specific regulation of the Commissioner which directs the public schools to conduct a continuing testing program -- an in-school testing program."
1972.72-269,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,812.866,817.284,That is by -- by members of -- of the staff of the Commission of Education (Voice Overlap)
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,817.284,818.59,"Well, right."
1972.72-269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,823.647,826.876,But they do have -- the statewide tests are given to the public schools.
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,826.876,828.538,"Yes, both in public and non-public schools."
1972.72-269,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.538,838.935,But the -- but the regulation does not require in the -- these -- the public schools to prepare their own tests like it does of the private school?
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,838.935,841.574,It does not require them to conduct this continuing program --
1972.72-269,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,841.574,841.777,Yes.
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,841.777,844.068,-- of testings under this regulation.
1972.72-269,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,856.795,860.063,"What do you think the issue here is, Ms. Coon?"
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,870.544,877.454,"I think that the issue is probably is raised probably by the -- the plaintiffs, and this action was more that the schools were paid."
1972.72-269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,883.557,888.894,How much audit is done of the amount?
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,888.894,897.6,The only audit that was -- has been done of this has been the -- the cost analysis studies which were done on a selective school basis comparing the cost in public --
1972.72-269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,897.6,897.828,But there's no continuing audit?
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,897.828,899.782,-- and non-public schools.
1972.72-269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,900.338,903.323,The entanglement is in actually in the requiring the test --
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,903.323,903.5,Yes.
1972.72-269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,903.695,908.58,-- supervision of -- of the performance?
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,908.58,908.872,Right.
1972.72-269,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,926.957,929.069,I -- I didn't understand Ms. Coon.
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,931.71,934.572,"Well, we -- we submit, Your Honor, that if the State were not able to pay --"
1972.72-269,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,934.572,936.921,"I know, but what -- what -- I -- I'm sorry."
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,942.337,948.954,"Well, the State has -- has an interest on -- on I think that this Court in Allen certainly said that the States do have the interest in (Voice Overlap)"
1972.72-269,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,948.954,951.25,I -- I guess I haven't made my question clear yet.
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,956.158,964.351,"By auditing the test, by getting reports from the schools, the schools are required to submit extensive reports, record-keeping analysis and so forth --"
1972.72-269,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,964.351,964.946,I see.
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,964.946,965.509,-- added to this example.
1972.72-269,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,965.509,968.392,But these tests are for are to audit.
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,968.392,969.83,That's what the test -- the tests are for.
1972.72-269,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,969.83,971.399,For the purpose of education (Inaudible)
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,971.399,972.089,Yes.
1972.72-269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,972.089,975.585,"Whatever entanglement there is, is really without regard to payment then?"
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,975.585,977.12,"That is quite true, Your Honor."
1972.72-269,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.427,989.125,"Well, teaching is mandated by the State, too isn't that --"
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,989.125,990.592,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1972.72-269,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,990.592,992.575,"So under your 30-day, they could pay the whole (Voice Overlap)"
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,992.575,993.78,"Oh no, no, Your Honor."
1972.72-269,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.081,1020.778,"Well, don't they impose teaching upon them to?"
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,1020.778,1025.189,Only since they have voluntarily undertaken to establish themselves as a school.
1972.72-269,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.266,1041.791,"But is this really -- is this really a part of – is sort of a condition, isn't it of satisfying the compulsory attendance laws I mean the school -- does -- does the school have to do this?"
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,1043.608,1045.512,"Oh yes, they would -- they would have to do this (Voice overlap)"
1972.72-269,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1045.512,1049.778,They would have to do it or -- or the students wouldn't be satisfying the compulsory school attendance laws?
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,1049.778,1051.854,"That is quite true, Your Honor."
1972.72-269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1070.118,1084.92,"Do -- do the teachers just -- following up my brother Douglas' question, do the teachers in private parochial schools have to -- have to be -- have to meet certain standards of imposed by the States or do they have to be at the State of New York or do they have to be certificated in any way?"
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,1084.92,1086.204,"Not in this program, Your Honor."
1972.72-269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1099.985,1107.225,But there's no requirement as to the educational and professional qualifications of the teachers in these schools?
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,1107.225,1107.869,Not in the --
1972.72-269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1107.869,1108.201,They could be --
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,1108.201,1109.534,Not as -- not as far as --
1972.72-269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1109.534,1114.816,-- the teachers insofar as the State knows to be wholly illiterate for instance?
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,1114.816,1115.144,No.
1972.72-269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1121.564,1123.846,There'd -- they'd be quite extraordinary teachers.
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,1124.321,1128.645,"I would -- I would think so, I think (Voice Overlap) that the -- the thing that the State is interested here is in the result."
1972.72-269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1128.645,1131.286,But there are no standards for the teachers are they?
1972.72-269,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1134.091,1136.47,Are there standards for the courses insofar as --
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,1136.47,1137.572,"There are standards of courses, yes."
1972.72-269,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1142.244,1145.259,(Voice Overlap) Then the State could finance the teaching of those courses.
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,1145.259,1146.055,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-269,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1172.208,1179.699,But the District Court couldn't even figure out whether the amount paid would equal the cost of the school or exceeded it?
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,1179.699,1183.433,"For this particular instance, we have a stipulated cost analysis of studies."
1972.72-269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1191.756,1193.171,Was that stipulated?
1972.72-269,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,1193.171,1194.402,"Yes, Your Honor, it was."
1972.72-269,1,37810,porter_r_chandler,,1261.085,1261.817,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1261.817,1262.718,Very well.
1972.72-269,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1266.793,1271.109,"And Mr. Pfeffer, first on this last question, did you understand that's the situation in New York?"
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1271.109,1272.327,"I understand it, yes."
1972.72-269,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1274.047,1275.919,"That's – that -- that is unusual, isn't it?"
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1275.919,1289.819,It is rather unusual and it's a reality of -- of the -- the influence and political power which groups have in New York which has been able to resist this.
1972.72-269,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1289.819,1304.112,"I -- I don't think that's so unusual, I through people on our family, I know a good many of them are college graduates who had jobs in private schools, but who couldn't get jobs in public schools because they hadn't had the necessary courses in education."
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1305.517,1307.044,Well --
1972.72-269,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1307.044,1311.946,So the best private schools in the country have teachers who could not get jobs in public schools.
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1311.946,1312.465,Well that's entirely true.
1972.72-269,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1312.465,1315.836,Because they haven't had the necessary courses in -- in --
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1315.836,1315.938,That their question was --
1972.72-269,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1315.938,1316.641,-- education.
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1316.641,1333.878,"-- whether they're on the general level, of our exceptional persons who -- who have and I think is about a general level, it is assumed -- a general assumption that out of the training if necessary affects the teaching."
1972.72-269,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1333.878,1339.45,"With whole credit to private schools as I understand it, is that correct?"
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1339.45,1341.357,On the elementary school level.
1972.72-269,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1356.468,1365.24,-- Education publishes a list of accredited private schools and that list is available to colleges and universities.
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1387.802,1390.953,I don't think the record does to take my own understanding is that.
1972.72-269,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1528.773,1532.656,"Well, do you mean it could avoid giving the tests entirely?"
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1532.656,1534.835,"Well, it certainly could, now let me --"
1972.72-269,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1534.835,1538.875,Would it still get the $28 and the $45 if they didn't.
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1538.875,1548.008,"According to the -- the -- according to the application of construction of the statute by the State, yes."
1972.72-269,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1627.692,1628.4,Where are you now?
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1628.591,1628.985,On page 16 --
1972.72-269,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1628.985,1629.579,-- of the main brief?

1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1854.115,1856.617,Your Honor is entirely correct.
1972.72-269,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.617,1856.705,Let's say it's here.
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1856.705,1858.037,That's exactly what the point is.
1972.72-269,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1917.92,1921.213,"I notice that, but don't you think that New York would be in bad faith?"
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1929.182,1930.619,"The question here is not that case, Your Honor."
1972.72-269,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1930.772,1933.61,"Well, I did not -- I just asked you a question."
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1935.212,1935.988,Bad case?
1972.72-269,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1935.988,1936.705,Bad faith.
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1936.705,1938.296,Oh bad faith.
1972.72-269,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1942.865,1945.838,"You mean that New York can say, “Here is $28 do with it what you want to do and --"
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1945.838,1948.947,This is what -- this is what the State is doing.
1972.72-269,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1965.717,1978.993,"Well independent of the First Amendment Religion Clauses Mr. Pfeffer, couldn't the States, if they failed to carry out the contract of -- in relation to the grant or the -- the statutory purpose can the State recover it?"

1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2452.396,2453.092,-- they're both happening.
1972.72-269,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2453.092,2456.447,Let me clear that step further Mr. Pfeffer.

1972.72-269,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2586.608,2600.799,"Well that would be true in the inoculation case because the school might take the money and use it for religious teaching, (Voice Overlap) and -- and therefore the State would to be assured that the school had not done that and that would entangle the State with the school, would it not?"
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2600.799,2609.418,"The -- the entanglement would be limited to -- not to examining what's taught, to limit it just to a doctor's certificate."
1972.72-269,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2618.707,2622.373,Did I understand you to say that you give the money to the school?
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2622.373,2623.229,In this case?
1972.72-269,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2623.229,2625.251,For the inoculations.
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2625.251,2634.361,"Well, I would say that even if they did, I don't believe that would be unconstitutional provided, provided there was auditing to show that the money was used for tha purpose."
1972.72-269,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2640.687,2641.225,Why not?
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2646.689,2654.365,"Well, (Voice Overlap) I think will be such a -- a limited entanglement."

1972.72-269,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2680.849,2683.798,Would that be true if it were given to a Christian Science school?
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2683.798,2687.813,"Oh, that would be difficult thing if it is because a Christian Science couldn't accept it, because if it couldn't, it wouldn't be a (Voice Overlap)"
1972.72-269,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2687.813,2689.532,Let's say the school did accept it.
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2689.532,2691.349,Then I think it would be unconstitutional.
1972.72-269,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2691.349,2691.935,Why?
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2691.935,2697.657,"Because there, giving the money would be there for use for an – an -- either unlawfully of an unconstitutional purpose."

1972.72-269,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2835.9,2837.04,But it's --
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2837.04,2839.136,But I don't know of any such thing.
1972.72-269,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2839.294,2847.904,That -- that still gives us some -- it has entanglement and gives us some aid to church-operated institution does it not?
1972.72-269,2,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2847.904,2865.784,"Well the -- the -- my answer to that would be, that the ROTC is generally as far as I know up until now, is at college level, and in Tilton versus Richardson, this Court held that there are more liberal rules with respect to -- at the college level than expect the elementary and high school level."
