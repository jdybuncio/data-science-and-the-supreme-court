1993.92-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,16.793,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-757, Barbara Landgraf v. USI Film Products, and 92-938, Maurice Rivers and Robert Davison v. Roadway Express."
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,18.143,20.713,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-757,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,55.589,59.87,I don't think that the Civil Rights overturned our decision.
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,65.593,66.214,--I--
1993.92-757,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,66.214,68.565,It's a very fundamental distinction.
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,68.565,72.288,"--Well, I'll accept your characterization of it."
1993.92-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,101.287,105.31,"In one of the two cases, Mr. Schnapper, the right to jury trial is involved, isn't it?"
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,105.31,111.975,"--If section 102 applies, then either party could request a jury trial, that's right."
1993.92-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,113.805,114.917,"In Landgraf, right."
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,123.683,125.173,"That's right, that's right."
1993.92-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,132.048,141.015,"And on that point, if the plaintiff prevailed there would have to be an entire new trial, because the defendant also would have a right to jury trial."
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,141.813,143.444,"--We don't believe so, Your Honor."
1993.92-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,156.983,161.127,How could there be estoppel when the defendant succeeded... won the judgment.
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,178.559,181.78,"--Your Honor, in the Landgraf case the judgment was in the plaintiff's favor."
1993.92-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,189.704,192.325,That was not the... what was the ultimate judgment in the district court?
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,195.618,199.091,There wasn't... there wasn't judgment entered for the plaintiff.
1993.92-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,201.543,205.345,"Yeah, and one appeals from a judgment, not from an opinion and not from a finding."
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,225.969,242.539,"--I believe, Your Honor, that... that when we were in the court of appeals arguing that even prior to the Civil Rights Act we were entitled to greater relief, the defendants could have argued that we were not entitled to any relief because the decision as to liability was incorrect."
1993.92-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,247.484,249.605,There is the further point--
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,273.22,277.232,"We view the matter differently, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,287.839,291.572,"Well, what if Congress had done just the opposite of what it did here?"
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,311.445,311.805,No.
1993.92-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.161,341.545,But you are claiming you should go back and be able to have a jury trial?
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,341.545,347.239,"Oh, we're claiming we have a right to go back and seek additional relief in the form of damages."
1993.92-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,352.33,354.692,Which they wouldn't have done before the act was amended.
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,354.692,355.613,--Right.
1993.92-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,362.979,368.943,"And you don't recognize the defend... that a defendant would have an argument, well, I'm entitled to a jury trial too."
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,376.427,379.74,"Well, it has, however, happened."
1993.92-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,389.165,391.016,Yeah.
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,402.423,407.058,"Well, we view the matter differently."
1993.92-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,407.058,418.908,"Do you have any authority for a... an appeal from a favorable decision, where a party is allowed to appeal from a favorable decision?"
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,418.908,423.44,"Now, I'm not sure whether this precise circumstance has arisen."
1993.92-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,423.811,426.472,But I don't want to sidetrack you on that anymore.
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,428.872,438.87,"--Well, let me also say that it's not necessary at... in this case and in this present posture, for this Court to address that collateral judgment by estoppel issue."
1993.92-757,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,504.923,511.246,"Do you agree that that applies to... so far as you know, to only one possible party?"
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,511.246,513.658,That was the understanding of Congress and that's our understanding.
1993.92-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,545.521,555.515,"Well, section 402(a) doesn't... is not clear, is it, in telling us whether it can be retroactively applied?"
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,558.066,558.317,Well--
1993.92-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,558.317,565.563,--could become effective on the date of its passage but not be retroactive under that language.
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,565.563,571.337,"--Well, our... if all we had here was the language take effect upon enactment, we would not have a strong argument."
1993.92-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,571.337,571.527,Yeah.
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,571.527,574.749,"But we have other provisions in the statute, and here, as in--"
1993.92-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,574.749,580.804,"Well you rely on these two, 109(c) and 402(b), exceptions--"
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,580.804,581.254,"--Well, we also--"
1993.92-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,581.254,583.207,--for the meaning of the 402(a).
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,583.207,584.427,--Yes.
1993.92-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,654.755,659.788,There is some redundancy in this... in this act.
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,672.704,677.64,"We agree, Your Honor, that... the maxim is where it's possible to avoid redundancy, the court should interpret the act to do so."
1993.92-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,688.926,701.294,"Mr. Schnapper, there... now, there are a lot of maxims of construction and it's not unusual for the maxims to cut against one another, and in those cases I guess you have to decide which one is stronger."
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,741.74,742.12,Well--
1993.92-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,742.12,743.34,"You wouldn't say this is clear, would you?"
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,743.34,747.133,"--Well, I wouldn't... well, I would, Your Honor."
1993.92-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.504,827.447,"Before you get into it, you say that have traditionally been applied."
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,831.828,832.409,Well--
1993.92-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,832.409,835.001,Express... was it ever expressed before Bradley?
1993.92-757,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,837.982,839.184,"--Well, we listed a number of cases."
1993.92-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,863.32,864.79,"Very well, Mr. Schnapper."
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,866.292,884.695,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,917.146,926.012,My discussion with Mr. Schnapper was over whether there was a finding... there was no judgment for the plaintiff.
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,926.012,926.329,That is correct.
1993.92-757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,926.329,928.492,And the court of appeals affirmed a judgment for the defendant.
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,928.492,929.131,That is correct.
1993.92-757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,929.131,934.366,And my understanding is that winners can't appeal from a favorable judgment.
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,934.366,934.887,That's correct.
1993.92-757,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1042.457,1052.363,"How would you apply that rule, Mr. Days, in the hypothetical case, not this statute, where the jury trial provisions are not linked to the damages?"
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1073.688,1088.437,"We would regard the right to a jury trial as a procedural right, and under normal circumstances that would require a jury trial."
1993.92-757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1102.325,1104.428,"Well, why do you have to make that exception?"
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1156.612,1173.242,"Justice Scalia, that's certainly one way of approaching it, but I don't believe that that provides any greater certainty than the rule that we're suggesting, namely that the Court approach the issue by looking at substantive changes on the one hand, and procedural or remedial on the other."
1993.92-757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1173.242,1179.907,"Well, I wouldn't have to make an arbitrary exception to that principle, as you have had to make it for your substantive procedural distinction."
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1187.791,1188.081,Yes.
1993.92-757,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1188.081,1201.122,"Maybe we should be looking to the kinds of principles that govern the Erie Doctrine or the rules enabling it, to see what types of things could be immediately applied and what couldn't."
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1202.631,1203.032,"Yes, it does."
1993.92-757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1215.5,1216.191,"But, Mr. Days--"
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1216.191,1216.581,--of Law.
1993.92-757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1216.581,1232.33,"--In that connection, on the substance/procedure divide, whether it's in the Erie context or the choice of law context, whether it's vertical or horizontal, damages, as far as I know, are always put on the substantive side of the line, mode of trial on the procedural side."
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1253.765,1259.518,"Our position is that that is remedial, that what the statute--"
1993.92-757,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1259.518,1260.69,Including punitives?
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1260.69,1264.732,--I think the situation is more problematic with respect to punitives.
1993.92-757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1264.732,1271.316,Do you have any authority even for compensatory damages being something that one would class as not substantive?
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1271.316,1286.467,"Yes, there are decisions in the lower court that have allowed double damages in situations where there was a change in the law, even though that was not the rule prior to the change in law."
1993.92-757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1292.511,1297.192,Why is that any different from increasing the criminal penalty for an action that's already criminal?
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1299.315,1302.378,The ex post facto law would come into effect when we're talking about criminal penalties.
1993.92-757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1302.378,1303.157,"Well, why, because it's retroactive?"
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1309.921,1313.044,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think we disagree as to what the rule is."
1993.92-757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1316.407,1320.41,"Well, that's what ex post facto... that's what the ex post facto law is directed to."
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1320.41,1333.747,"But I'm talking about in the civil context, and I think that we've shown in our briefs and the briefs of petitioner that the rule has really been one that makes that distinction between substance, on the one hand, and procedure and remedy on the other."
1993.92-757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1333.747,1351.219,"Mr. Days, I haven't seen any case, at least in this Court, where an augmentation of the penalty... of the damages, I withdraw the word penalty, but where an increase in available damages has been applied retroactively."
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1368.06,1370.082,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1370.89,1371.341,"So, it is--"
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1371.341,1372.593,--I'm not aware of a case in this Court.
1993.92-757,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1398.079,1401.722,--And why is it... why are punitive damages not a new remedy for an old wrong?
1993.92-757,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1401.722,1422.476,"We think that punitive damages are more difficult because this Court has pointed out in TXO, for example, in Justice Stevens' opinion, that there are requirements of notice that ought to be provided to a person before that person is subjected to punitive damages."
1993.92-757,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1437.205,1439.256,"Thank you, General Days."
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1441.589,1445.861,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1462.671,1464.093,I think it slipped their mind.
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1464.313,1481.454,"It was a heavily debated issue, no doubt, and... but they didn't specifically address it, and the question for this Court is what rule of construction applies in a case where Congress has not specifically addressed--"
1993.92-757,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1481.454,1482.296,"Well, Mr. Nager--"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1489.569,1490.02,--Yes.
1993.92-757,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1490.02,1507.21,"The panel there took the position that Congress had not only addressed it but the language is clear, and when you look at the provisions relied upon by Mr. Schnapper that it becomes a plain language case."
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1507.21,1511.134,"That is what the court in Reynolds held, and, of course, it was wrong."
1993.92-757,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1525.794,1531.827,"Well, do we... do we get to presumptions before we get beyond the question of plain language?"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1532.598,1533.757,"--Yes, Justice Souter, I think we do."
1993.92-757,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1555.132,1560.224,"--Well, in our struggle how do we read out the negative implication of 109(c)?"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1560.224,1565.999,"--I don't think it's a question of reading it out, Justice Souter."
1993.92-757,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1599.541,1605.035,"Well, let me... in your response would you make a... maybe you don't want to make this distinction; if you don't, you tell me."
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1635.334,1638.127,I think the Justice is correct in that the two provisions are different.
1993.92-757,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1665.275,1665.893,Uh-hum.
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1665.893,1669.195,And the... so essentially 402(b) is a grandfathering provision.
1993.92-757,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1687.999,1707.771,"Well, I would grant you that in the absence of (c) it certainly would be ambiguous, but it is also very clear, as your brother pointed out, that it begins by referring to an exception so that it seems to have been drafted with just such an exception as 109(c) in mind, which seems to me, if anything, to underline the implication of (c)."
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1709.062,1734.439,"--Well, in... the Justice has agreed with me that section 402(b) prohibits both retroactive and prospective effects, so to the extent that 402(a) starts with except... with a qualification on its language, it easily picks up 402(b) without making any reference one way or the other as to whether or not 402(a) is only a prospectivity provision or a retroactivity provision as well as a prospectivity provision."
1993.92-757,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1747.938,1766.369,"Well, language that includes ""except as otherwise provided"" and then an exception, in what cases here do you... do you think support your view that even the natural inference of the statute will be ignored in favor of nonretroactivity?"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1766.369,1776.637,"Congress, in the 1978 amendments to title VII and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act which changed the rule of law that this Court had announced in Gilbert v. General Electric."
1993.92-757,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1815.864,1821.135,And are there cases from this Court that express such a view?
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1821.135,1826.449,"Well, there are cases from this Court dealing, quite frankly, with much more complicated and difficult cases."
1993.92-757,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1881.045,1881.424,Why don't we--
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1881.424,1883.026,--Against retroactive applications of the law.
1993.92-757,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1883.026,1885.968,"--Mr. Nager, stick closer to home."
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1898.017,1898.938,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-757,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1898.938,1901.699,--How about the Civil Rights Restoration Act of '87?
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1917.788,1924.965,I have to concede to the Justice that I haven't read the language of the Civil Rights Act... Civil Rights Restoration Act of '87.
1993.92-757,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1939.162,1943.066,"That would be the closest, I think, wouldn't it, to the Patterson situation?"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,1943.066,1943.424,No.
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2015.513,2015.873,"But, Mr. Nager--"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2047.082,2051.016,"I'm... apologies if I have been unclear, Justice Stevens."
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.87,2068.938,"So your position is there is no retroactivity, even, for example, on the consent decree provision, that applies only to future consent decrees, not to future attacks on previously entered consent decrees."
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2068.938,2075.592,"--It applies... that provision, just like the expert witness fees provision, would apply to any event occurring after the date of enactment."
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2090.094,2099.898,"Well, what is your view on whether it would attack... whether it would apply to a future lawsuit challenging the validity of a prior dissent decree on the ground that the litigant didn't have adequate notice?"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2099.898,2103.511,--The question is with respect to the applicability of section 108?
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2103.511,2103.791,Yeah.
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2103.791,2125.516,"With respect to that future lawsuit, the law... if the lawsuit was challenging the validity of the consent decree, it would have to meet the requirements of section 108 in order to be properly filed, because section 108 sets forth the terms upon which such a lawsuit can be filed."
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2125.516,2131.411,And the ground of the lawsuit is that he... at the time the consent decree was entered the plaintiff had not had adequate notice.
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2137.842,2147.52,"And you've picked a tough example and I'm hesitating not because I don't know the right methodology to apply, but because I can't... I don't have... I'm not looking at each provision of the statute."
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.52,2156.937,--All I'm suggesting is that the retroactivity problem is complicated because there are a variety of provisions in here with respect to which one could at least argue that there is some kind of retroactivity.
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2156.937,2164.272,The point is easily conceded by me that this is not an easy question even if one knows what the right starting point is.
1993.92-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.272,2168.223,"Of course, the distinction between substance and procedure is not a very clear one either, is it?"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2168.223,2171.285,"That is true, Justice Scalia, and I appreciate that help."
1993.92-757,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2171.506,2182.062,"Before we get into that, can... would you tell me, what is the analogue in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act that you're... you're arguing from to section 109(c)?"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2182.062,2185.203,"To my knowledge, there is no analogue and--"
1993.92-757,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2185.203,2187.006,"Well, doesn't... isn't that the end of the argument, then?"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2187.006,2187.765,"--No, I don't think so."
1993.92-757,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2204.117,2202.836,Why not?
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2207.47,2217.805,"--Because this Court's decisions have stated over and over and over again, it has to be a clear and unequivocal command for retroactivity that Congress has set forth."
1993.92-757,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2220.028,2226.381,"But, well, is the rule that you think we should follow or, indeed, that perhaps we have followed, is that a negative inference will never suffice?"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2226.381,2232.087,"--Yes, that is what we would suggest to the Court, that Congress has to either expressly--"
1993.92-757,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2232.087,2233.305,It would certainly get you where you want to go.
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2233.506,2236.649,"--That's part of my objective, if not my entire objective."
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2298.92,2300.759,"But, Mr. Nager, apparently Congress thought we'd misapplied the presumptions."
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2300.759,2304.723,"And Congress has the right to change the rules, as it clearly has."
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2330.82,2341.038,"Mr. Nager, may I ask you if you think there's any... you were asked about the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, the Grove City... sequel to Grove City."
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2351.934,2353.564,I think not.
1993.92-757,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2431.355,2435.877,"In the case of the 1987 act, the returns in the lower court are divided."
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2437.58,2438.909,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-757,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2438.909,2447.457,"On the retro... and so would you agree that the answer should be the same in this case as it is in that, at least with respect to Patterson and Grove City?"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2463.956,2466.498,"Well, this statute doesn't say that, though."
1993.92-757,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2480.277,2486.24,Are you saying there's a stronger argument for the retroactivity of the '87 act than of the 1991 act?
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2486.24,2503.434,"--Yes, although I'd reiterate the point that I made to Justice Stevens, that Congress' purpose in restoring the law, while it may provide a suggestion of an intention for retroactivity, is not sufficient to create a retroactive effective date."
1993.92-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2548.751,2555.527,"That presumption that you're referring to, Mr. Nager, I gather is not just an interpretative presumption."
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2566.814,2576.0,"I think so, although I'm hesitant to... in this particular case, to make distinctions between substantive presumptions and interpretative presumptions."
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2576.22,2580.422,What is... what is the underlying... what is the underlying value that makes this presumption so important?
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2582.435,2585.696,It in... part of it is the concept of fair notice.
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2585.696,2586.335,And what else is it?
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2586.335,2607.65,"It is the notion that in this country, with our separation of powers between the legislative branch and the judicial branch and the executive branch, that the power to look backwards to interpret preexisting law and apply preexisting law lies with the courts, and that the presumption with respect to the legislative branch is that it looks forward, not backwards."
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.65,2613.975,"Yes, but there's no question here that if Congress had made it's intent clear, it would have had the power to make the statute retroactive."
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2613.975,2615.046,That is true.
1993.92-757,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2639.45,2650.699,"Mr. Nager, you're not arguing, are you, that there would be a separation of powers problem in any application short of attacking a final judgment of the Court?"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2650.699,2651.1,--No.
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2717.161,2719.683,I also made the same point in my dissent in Daubert against Florida.
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2719.683,2721.075,--That is--
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2721.075,2722.495,Which kind of cuts against you a little bit.
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2722.775,2730.99,"--That is true, but the... of course, that was a dissenting opinion and it was not about what informs this presumption."
1993.92-757,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2731.27,2740.087,"Mr. Nager, as far as knowing what the law is, I mean the law has been, throughout this period, thou shalt not discriminate."
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2784.696,2788.659,I'm not making that argument because I don't think that we need to.
1993.92-757,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2813.466,2817.327,But there was a finding that the employer's conduct was in violation of the act.
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,2817.327,2827.835,"The finding was that there was sexual harassment occurring in the workplace, but there was also another finding that the employer, USI Film Products, had redressed that situation."
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3003.348,3008.401,"Mr. Nager, it is perfectly clear, isn't it, that if they had made their intent perfectly clear we would have followed it?"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,3010.444,3012.114,--That's true.
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3012.755,3016.619,"If we'd said it in different language, do you think they still might have just compromised this way?"
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,3016.619,3029.064,"--Justice Stevens, there are clearly floor statements from people on both sides citing different decisions coming out of this Court to try to... to create, essentially, a manipulated record for the lower courts to apply."
1993.92-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3029.064,3034.089,"But each side well knew that if they put in language as they had in the 1990 statute, there wouldn't have been much of a problem."
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,3034.089,3035.041,That's true.
1993.92-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3035.041,3041.844,"Well, I guess it's clear that if they make it clear we will follow it."
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,3042.044,3042.745,That's true too.
1993.92-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3042.745,3048.568,And that's what the... what the one-upsmanship was about.
1993.92-757,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,3048.568,3050.989,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3053.742,3055.464,"Thank you, Mr. Nager."
1993.92-757,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3058.086,3061.748,May it please the Court:
1993.92-757,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3118.373,3120.874,Does that... does that go for all the decisions?
1993.92-757,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3126.949,3133.854,"In general, those cases... those remarks don't distinguish among... some are specifically about Patterson or other cases, but generally they're about... they're referring to the whole statute."
1993.92-757,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3133.854,3137.507,--So you would be making the same argument if the... this particular problem before us today was the Shaw--
1993.92-757,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3137.507,3137.758,Yes.
1993.92-757,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3137.758,3146.533,"--Problem, even though that involves the... another... yet another maxim, that sovereign immunity and waivers strictly construed."
1993.92-757,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3146.533,3147.084,"Yes, yes."
1993.92-757,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3147.932,3153.566,"So you... the Solicitor General, I believe, had a caveat about... about that."
1993.92-757,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3153.566,3154.197,--He did.
1993.92-757,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3154.197,3155.008,You don't share that.
1993.92-757,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3155.008,3155.699,We do not.
1993.92-757,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3224.593,3234.569,"Well, but especially when you're dealing with a statute that imposes vicarious liability... that is to say, we're not talking about employers who personally discriminate."
1993.92-757,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3256.643,3262.277,"With all deference, Your Honor, we don't believe that that is what ordinarily goes on in the business community."
1993.92-757,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3274.775,3280.168,Do you go... do you go the whole hog with your argument and say that also applies to the new punitive damage provisions?
1993.92-757,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3280.168,3280.539,--We do.
1993.92-757,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3286.082,3286.844,"What was it, $300,000?"
1993.92-757,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3286.844,3289.125,--It depends on the size of the employer.
1993.92-757,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3289.125,3289.565,Oh.
1993.92-757,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3289.565,3292.697,"On punitive damages I would, you know, raise somewhat different questions."
1993.92-757,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3294.089,3295.108,But you'd come to the same conclusion.
1993.92-757,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3295.108,3295.449,--Yes.
1993.92-757,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3301.233,3305.797,"Well, then it would follow... then it would follow that punitive damages are... serve no purpose."
1993.92-757,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3305.797,3307.126,"--No, Your Honor."
1993.92-757,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3322.767,3323.879,Do you think... never mind.
1993.92-757,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3323.879,3324.94,Thank you.
1993.92-757,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3324.94,3325.841,"Thank you, Mr. Schnapper."
