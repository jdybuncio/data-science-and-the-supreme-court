1971.70-13,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.715,We will hear arguments next in Dunn against Blumstein.
1971.70-13,0,40333,robert_h_roberts,,52.147,55.144,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-13,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,156.562,178.018,"Mr. Roberts, have there been any studies made on a widespread or even a national basis to determine how long it takes to pack up registration and that sort of thing to check out to be sure that the voters are voting in two states."
1971.70-13,0,40333,robert_h_roberts,,178.018,216.577,"No sir, not to my knowledge, if Your Honor please, that is where we think that the District Court erred in trying to make such a determination based on the registration cutoff deadline of 30 days, which implies in Tennessee and in most of the states that have registration laws, but, it is our insistence that the Court was in error there because that cutoff period is designed specifically and it is very clearly shown in the law to be for the purpose of permitting the county election officials, the necessary time to make the administrative acts that they are required to do."
1971.70-13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,285.821,296.683,"What is been the experience with those administrative problems in connection with the federal statute, the election, presidential and other federal elections."
1971.70-13,0,40333,robert_h_roberts,,296.683,300.666,Of course -- we of course we have not had a presidential election since then.
1971.70-13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,303.415,305.879,"I think that is 30 days, is it not?"
1971.70-13,0,40333,robert_h_roberts,,305.879,306.71,Sir?
1971.70-13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,306.71,308.039,30 days residence?
1971.70-13,0,40333,robert_h_roberts,,308.039,308.884,Yes sir.
1971.70-13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,310.125,315.463,But I gather to kind of cease that you have to accommodate itself for the forthcoming presidential election.
1971.70-13,0,40333,robert_h_roberts,,315.463,315.734,Yes sir.
1971.70-13,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,419.239,428.444,Does Tennessee have criminal penalties for voting in Tennessee and voting somewhere else if it could be accomplished?
1971.70-13,0,40333,robert_h_roberts,,428.444,429.531,"Yes sir, we do."
1971.70-13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,496.743,503.375,Is Tennessee preparing some sort of procedure to deal with this problem in the next year’s presidential election?
1971.70-13,0,40333,robert_h_roberts,,503.375,504.866,Yes sir.
1971.70-13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,504.866,512.311,I mean as I gather it you are going to have to permit everybody to vote who is been a 30-day resident of Tennessee?
1971.70-13,0,40333,robert_h_roberts,,512.311,513.289,"Yes sir, that is true if this --"
1971.70-13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,513.289,515.179,(Inaudible) the two offenses.
1971.70-13,0,40333,robert_h_roberts,,515.179,519.275,Yes and this Court upholds the lower court’s decision that that would be --
1971.70-13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,519.275,524.728,"No, I mean I am speaking only of the presidential election."
1971.70-13,0,40333,robert_h_roberts,,539.736,540.597,Yes sir.
1971.70-13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,540.597,545.883,"So, I gather you are going to have to accommodate, Tennessee is going to have to accommodate its whole system in that requirement?"
1971.70-13,0,40333,robert_h_roberts,,545.883,547.773,Yes sir.
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1514.156,1518.121,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1589.792,1616.734,"But by the same token I gather Mr. Blumstein, you are not asserting that a state is constitutionally required to let every single resident, who is qualified by age, vote, are you, because a person can become a resident under the law in less than 24 hours, be in the state with no intention to live elsewhere and that can happen in a matter of hours."
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1631.096,1633.927,"Mr. Justice Stewart, there are several points that I can make a response to that."
1971.70-13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1637.557,1641.455,"There is, but, I am asking you if you -- there is, as a matter of state statute."
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1644.866,1661.772,"If a person comes in to the State of Tennessee and establishes its domicile, according to the relevant tennessee standards, you would look at whether he has become a domicile for tax purpose, you would look at whether he becomes a domicile for purposes of his driver’s license, his automobile registration and so forth."
1971.70-13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1701.984,1714.246,"I did not ask the kind of review it triggered, I asked you whether your claim is that the State is compelled to commit every bona fide resident of Tennessee who is over 18 years old to vote."
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1732.877,1744.112,"Yes sir, under those circumstances unless the state can show a compelling reason to discriminate against this bona fide resident, it is the constitutional obligation of the State to allow him to vote."
1971.70-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1777.681,1794.024,"But on your theory, a man can move into Tennessee in the morning, get off the plane, go and buy a house that afternoon which he might readily do, present himself in the afternoon at 5 o’clock in the polling booth and insist on voting."
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1796.089,1798.251,"Yes, Your Honor; that is correct."
1971.70-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1826.543,1837.63,"Do you think Tennessee could, by its Constitution, fix voting age at the age 25 for everyone under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution?"
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1837.63,1839.36,"Well, that specifically the --"
1971.70-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1839.36,1841.335,Except for national elections?
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1847.03,1856.486,I believe Your Honor that would be covered by the most recent Twenty Sixth Amendment which stipulates 18 years old for all elections.
1971.70-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1856.486,1858.884,I was just asking your response on it.
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1858.884,1863.384,"Well, I think it would be specifically barred by the Twenty Sixth Amendment from doing that."
1971.70-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1863.384,1865.351,In the state and local elections?
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1865.351,1868.514,"My understanding is that the Twenty Sixth Amendment covers both, Your Honor."
1971.70-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1878.924,1885.527,"So, inspired of the Twenty Sixth Amendment, could it be that Tennessee have made that choice?"
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1885.527,1889.289,"Under this Court’s opinion in Oregon against Mitchell, I think it certainly could."
1971.70-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1901.934,1903.958,That is the penalty that is surprising.
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1903.958,1905.923,"Yes, Your Honor; that is right."
1971.70-13,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1905.923,1912.68,"Now, do I understand from your answer to Justice Stewart’s question that you are attacking the 30-day provision?"
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1912.68,1915.749,"No, Your Honor, Justice Blackmun."
1971.70-13,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1962.667,1973.723,"I understood your answer to one of the questions was that if you moved in Tennessee today and bought a house, you could present yourself to the polling place to vote at 5 p.m."
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1973.723,1981.713,Provided that you are within the 30-day -- provided the registration books were open which only occurs more than 30 days before the election.
1971.70-13,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2007.866,2010.941,"Then, your answer is that he cannot present himself at 5 p.m."
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2012.578,2016.126,"Not if it is -- within that 30-day period, no sir."
1971.70-13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2016.126,2020.143,You are not complaining that 30-day period is constitutionally invalid?
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2020.143,2020.574,No sir.
1971.70-13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2058.687,2069.328,Does Tennessee has a permanent registration or does a person have to register for each election or does he have to register only if he misses a couple of elections?
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2069.328,2074.676,There is permanent registration but they are all provisions for purging if you do not vote for a certain number of years.
1971.70-13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2074.676,2075.783,Certain number consecutively.
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2075.783,2078.619,Yes sir.
1971.70-13,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2151.943,2158.445,Does that figure include an assumption against fact that everybody votes?
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2158.445,2160.508,"Your Honor, the 7.7 figure?"
1971.70-13,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2160.508,2161.176,Yes.
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2161.176,2164.879,That was a percent of the actual vote cast.
1971.70-13,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2164.879,2168.679,"Well, I am talking about the people that move from state to state."
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2168.679,2170.318,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-13,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2198.673,2205.371,(Inaudible) that some people would not admit that they would not vote?
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2208.266,2218.4,"Well, it is possible, Your Honor, the amicus points out that it might overstate the actual disfranchisement of those who would vote."
1971.70-13,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2265.093,2269.651,"Mr. Blumstein, you are all registered now and ready to go, are you in Tennessee?"
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2269.651,2270.729,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2453.485,2461.403,You would let to state in terms that the interest that it asserts to put on a 30-day requirement?
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2461.403,2466.945,"Your Honor, I think there has been some confusion generated about that and I would like to set the record clear."
1971.70-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.626,2475.001,You agree that a man must be a resident of a state for at least 30 days before you can vote?
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2475.001,2476.899,Before you can vote but not before you can register.
1971.70-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.899,2488.097,"I understand that but I just asked you, if you have to be -- now the only reason that the state can do that, I suppose, is in terms of the interest of what you have just been talking about."
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2488.097,2488.911,Yes sir.
1971.70-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.911,2497.652,And you say those interests are good for 30 days but no longer?
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2497.652,2499.761,"Your Honor, there is no discrimination in that."
1971.70-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.761,2507.116,"I mean, it is a compelling -- for 30 days those interests are compelling, for any longer they are not compelling?"
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2507.116,2510.778,"They are also, if please Your Honor, They are also not discriminatory."
1971.70-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2513.626,2531.439,"I understand that; I understand that, but you are just saying that if the state just have to do on any longer period, would you have to be resident, you would say as a violation of equal protection."
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2531.439,2534.646,"No, I think that would be a different case, Your Honor."
1971.70-13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2543.485,2549.623,I do not see how you can say that 30-day provision applies equally to long time residents and new residents.
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2559.902,2564.953,"Or, it discriminates against all those who have not attempted to register at that point."
1971.70-13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2564.953,2575.132,Then all person who has been in the state 29-and-a-half days or less may attempt because he wants to register but he cannot.
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2576.816,2579.943,"Yes sir, to that extent, it does discriminate against him."
1971.70-13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2579.943,2588.132,"So, it is a matter of degree as the question of My Brother White implies."
1971.70-13,1,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2588.132,2591.278,"To that extent, yes sir, it is."
1971.70-13,2,40333,robert_h_roberts,,3042.609,3046.526,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-13,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3323.294,3326.259,Thank you Mr. Roberts and Mr. Blumstein.
