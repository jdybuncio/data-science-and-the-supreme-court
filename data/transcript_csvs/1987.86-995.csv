1987.86-995,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.224,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 86-995, Murray against the United States, consolidated with 86-1016, Carter against the United States."
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,15.51,17.712,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.954,447.389,"Mr. Randolph, I don't understand what you're saying."
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,468.469,478.075,"Under Segura, what they have done at most is engaged in a reasonable seizure of the property, and also under Mincey,--"
1987.86-995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.075,479.61,Have we ever said that that's a seizure?
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,484.264,491.002,"--I think Segura so held, Justice Scalia, and I think it was that basis on which the Court said"
1987.86-995,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,560.343,571.25,"--The Court didn't addressed the problem we have here, did it, as to whether the stuff that was seen prior to the securing of the premises should be suppressed?"
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,571.25,576.404,"The Court said in the opinion that is not before it, I want to be precise about this,"
1987.86-995,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,607.173,624.652,"Well, Mr. Randolph, the Courts below didn't really address the question of whether the... what the officers saw after their illegal entry, influenced the decision to get the warrant, did they?"
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,624.652,625.318,That's correct.
1987.86-995,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,626.17,648.083,"And, so, really, the question we have to decide is if, in fact, what the officers saw on their illegal entry did not influence, if it did not influence their subsequent decision to get the warrant, must the evidence be excluded."
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,648.083,656.273,"Well, we are getting into the realm of intent, and I would like to address the question this way:"
1987.86-995,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,680.889,685.625,"Well, that wasn't addressed below, and I think we need to deal with it first in the abstract."
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,689.26,690.544,--Right.
1987.86-995,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,765.224,768.612,I don't think that's the extent of the rule that is suggested.
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,787.74,794.243,"But, then, we're getting into, I think, Justice O'Connor, a land of make-believe."
1987.86-995,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,833.47,836.256,"Well, I don't follow that scenario at all."
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,845.445,864.924,"And the consequence of that, of allowing that evidence in is that there's no deterrent anymore because what incentive is there for an officer who knows that in an hour or two hours, you can go get a warrant or maybe his colleagues are up at the magistrate, why wait."
1987.86-995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,907.436,916.291,"Mr. Randolph, just for the record, we didn't hold in Segura that surrounding the warehouse or even going into the warehouse and being there would constitute a seizure."
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,916.291,917.841,--Assumed arguendo.
1987.86-995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,917.841,918.424,Assumed arguendo.
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,918.424,919.16,I'm sorry.
1987.86-995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,919.16,922.712,"Big difference, and we found that even if it had been, it would have been reasonable."
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,923.428,927.849,I've gotten ahead of myself.
1987.86-995,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1114.986,1117.004,"What does confirmatory mean, Mr. Randolph?"
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,1119.104,1125.944,"You have never used it, Your Honor, and what it means in this situation is simply that the agents confirmed their suspicions."
1987.86-995,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1141.703,1148.809,"Well, is the fact that the search was confirmatory, is that a vice other than the vices you've already averted to in your argument?"
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,1148.809,1163.45,"It's part and parcel of my argument, Chief Justice, and... but the Government, I'm saying the Government has gone off and said if the agents had a confirmatory intent or a purpose, then we would agree that the evidence should be suppressed."
1987.86-995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1166.687,1168.854,I think they say that only for their first argument.
1987.86-995,0,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,1173.674,1182.296,"I'm not sure where all the pieces of the puzzle fit, and I thought that was in the... maybe it was in the independent source argument."
1987.86-995,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1185.748,1187.867,"Very well, Mr. Randolph."
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1189.167,1195.521,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1337.815,1352.373,But is it not correct that the Chief Justice in his opinion said that one reason that there will be a deterrent against this kind of activity is that the... whatever evidence they discover as a direct result of the entry will be suppressed?
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1352.373,1353.442,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1355.308,1355.944,Yes.
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1356.494,1357.477,I think that's an important distinction.
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1357.477,1360.16,You don't think he meant that it would automatically be suppressed?
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1360.16,1361.445,We do not.
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.445,1362.129,I see.
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1362.129,1365.797,"I believe the sentence continues,"
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1378.306,1381.175,What is the deterrent then if it won't be suppressed?
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1390.364,1397.352,"Your Honor, he was, of course, assuming that, but that was one of several deterrents that the Chief Justice discussed."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1397.352,1399.137,And the other is that he might sue the police officers.
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1399.137,1402.506,Civil liability was one of the deterrents.
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1408.493,1409.81,"You can rely on those here, too, I suppose."
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1409.81,1410.862,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1412.062,1420.717,What kind of sanction would you say would be appropriate for the officer who fills out the application for a warrant and doesn't tell the magistrate that they've already searched the place?
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1420.717,1429.989,"No sanction whatsoever, Your Honor, because that doesn't bear on the determination that the magistrate makes, which is whether probable cause exists."
1987.86-995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1445.582,1454.188,"Is it clear that the Chief Justice's ""may"" is gone if we agree with you in this case?"
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1468.948,1470.314,"Absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1470.314,1471.483,"So,--"
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1473.416,1474.602,That is--
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1474.602,1477.97,He's assuming there are cases in which you draw a distinction between the two.
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1484.207,1485.14,"--No, Your Honor."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.325,1495.098,So that your view is quite different from the Chief Justice's view because he said there may be cases where you must draw a distinction.
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1495.098,1498.4,Our view is quite different from that suggestion.
1987.86-995,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.416,1524.034,Was there that in this case?
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1524.034,1533.223,"There was no finding in so many words because, as Mr. Randolph said a moment ago, this issue was not raised in the lower court."
1987.86-995,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1549.316,1565.861,"Well, let's assume that the agents wouldn't have gotten a warrant if they hadn't performed an illegal search before--"
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1565.861,1566.394,Suppress everything.
1987.86-995,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1566.394,1567.294,--Suppress everything.
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1567.294,1574.217,Suppress everything that bears that causal relationship to the unlawful search.
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1578.269,1583.823,Who has the burden of proof on the issue of determining whether there was a causal connection?
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1583.823,1585.323,"It's the Government's burden of proof, Your Honor."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.323,1588.375,"And, so, if there's no finding, there is a failure of proof on your part?"
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1588.375,1589.977,No.
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.827,1596.381,"Don't you have the burden of introducing the issue, too?"
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1603.151,1607.003,We certainly have the burden of showing a lack of causal relation.
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1607.003,1608.272,And there's no such finding--
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1608.272,1624.964,"Lack of causal relation was at issue in the lower courts, but the only contested aspect of that issue in the lower courts was whether the acquisition of the warrant... well, in fact, I'm not sure there was any contested aspect of that in the lower courts."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1800.23,1814.756,"--And you say we don't have findings by either the lower courts as to whether there was or was not a causal connection between the things that were seen, so to speak, and the things that were unseen?"
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1814.756,1825.195,"Your Honor, the... we think that the findings of the lower court are absolutely sufficient to negate any possibility of a causal connection in this case."
1987.86-995,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1825.195,1831.266,Can you refer specifically to findings that the Court of Appeals made findings?
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1831.266,1837.753,"Well, obviously, the Court of Appeals does not make findings, but the Court of Appeals did observe--"
1987.86-995,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1837.753,1838.939,I've observed them to make findings.
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1838.939,1846.526,"--Well, Your Honor, on page 28A of the Appendix to the Petition, the Court said:"
1987.86-995,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1874.878,1876.045,How about the findings of the District Court?
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1877.147,1878.364,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-995,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.364,1879.432,--specific in those findings?
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1879.432,1887.253,"Page 42A in the middle of Paragraph U, the Court finds that"
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2032.113,2035.683,"Mr. Englert, would you make a comment on the hypothetical that Mr. Randolph raises?"
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2052.958,2054.643,"Your Honor, I have two answers to that."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2069.571,2075.373,"Well, what if they were looking for, say, a stolen vehicle rather than marijuana, so that they knew it was either there or it isn't there?"
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2078.592,2086.081,"Your Honor, it's certainly possible to imagine hypotheticals different from this case in which they would not have come back, but, of course, in Segura,--"
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.081,2096.654,"Presumably, since probable cause is a great deal less than certainty, there must be a very large number of cases in which there is probable cause, but, yet, the search is unsuccessful."
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2102.042,2107.094,"--Of course, this case didn't involve a search for evidence."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2108.446,2118.485,"They're searching for a large weapon or explosives or something like that, and you don't find it, is it not true that they probably would not go get a warrant in that case?"
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2118.485,2121.754,"--There certainly may be some such cases, Your Honor, yes, but, again in Segura,--"
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2121.754,2132.644,"And if there is such a case, then is it not true that it cannot be said that the application for the warrant was inevitable because they wouldn't have gotten the warrant unless they found what they were looking for?"
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2132.644,2134.744,--That argument could have been made in Segura.
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2138.346,2140.148,"Well, Segura should have been decided the other way."
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2181.291,2182.341,"I agree, Your Honor."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2205.673,2207.275,You are right that it doesn't bear on the causation issue.
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2222.535,2225.487,"Your Honor, we are here under both independent source and--"
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2225.487,2227.004,"Now, you're arguing independent source then."
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2227.004,2228.839,"--Well, we think it's essentially the same argument."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.956,2234.176,But you don't think inevitable discovery requirement means that it has to be inevitable?
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2234.176,2242.865,"We do think that inevitable discovery argument means it has to be inevitable, yes."
1987.86-995,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.387,2277.288,"Why isn't... I suppose if there had never been an illegal entry in the first place, but then a valid warrant issues and they go into the... or even if they say a warrant was issued to discover some other kind of evidence and they go in the warehouse and in plain view is some marijuana."
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2282.34,2285.792,"Well, that, of course, depends on the legality of the initial entry."
1987.86-995,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.792,2286.31,Why?
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2286.31,2294.464,"Which... as I understand the plain view doctrine, the plain view doctrine applies when agents are aware they have a right lawfully to be."
1987.86-995,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.464,2295.25,Yes.
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2295.25,2300.903,"And if they had a right lawfully to be in the warehouse, then, of course, the plain view seizure would be valid."
1987.86-995,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2300.903,2301.603,All right.
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2323.567,2333.458,"If they are not unlawfully there, as assumed in Segura and as is being assumed arguendo in this case, that's when the question of independent source and inevitable discovery arise."
1987.86-995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2438.442,2441.144,"Mr. Englert, would you just say a word?"
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2475.983,2477.317,"The answer is no, Your Honor."
1987.86-995,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2500.865,2512.823,"Well, Mr. Englert, you wouldn't fail very often because you have the officers there to testify and certainly the defense can't contest what they say."
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2512.823,2517.875,"--Well, the defense can contest what they say and, indeed, such factors as whether they physically--"
1987.86-995,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2517.875,2518.575,"Well, they don't have their own evidence."
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2523.029,2534.319,--But such factors as to whether they actually seized the evidence during their entry or left it alone and immediately went and got the warrant bear on the credibility of the assertion that it was inevitable from the start that a warrant would be obtained.
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2539.473,2547.71,"But if you accept your facts and assume you can make them even more clear, you had an Assistant U.S. Attorney involved in these decisions."
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2567.541,2575.146,"There is a reason to await the discovery of the evidence, but we will admit it's not an exclusionary rule."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2575.146,2577.146,"I see, but the exclusionary rule has no deterrent effect."
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2578.931,2587.37,"In the precise circumstances you pose, that's correct, but there's nothing novel about the proposition that there may be situations in which the exclusionary rule has no deterrent effect."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2587.37,2588.537,Let me ask you another question.
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2603.213,2605.748,You shouldn't necessarily.
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2606.448,2610.902,"So, then, that additional sanction you mentioned, you really are not maintaining."
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2610.902,2618.306,"--No, I think not, Your Honor, because the finder of fact has to find inevitably, has to find a lack of causation, and that bears on--"
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.306,2626.845,"Why does the fact it might have been... say they had seized the marijuana here before they got the warrant, why should that make a difference?"
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2629.114,2630.864,--It would make a difference in the analysis.
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2632.232,2638.22,"You think it should be admitted anyway, don't you, because it is inevitable that they would have seized it if they had gone ahead and gotten the warrant?"
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2638.22,2640.27,"On a sufficient showing of the inevitability, yes."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.27,2643.772,And it's exactly the same showing that you need to justify the entry.
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2643.772,2650.027,"Except that the showing of inevitability is somewhat undermined, this factual question."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2655.495,2656.014,Why?
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2656.014,2668.322,"Because, in a case like this, in which a brief tour was made and nothing was seized, that tends to confirm the Government's assertion that the plan from the start was to go get a warrant."
1987.86-995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2697.222,2711.082,"Yes, I understand it, but basically what you're saying is we should not rely on the exclusionary rule for the deterrent for warrantless entries when there's (a) probable cause and (b) intent to get a warrant as soon as it's convenient to do so."
1987.86-995,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2716.553,2725.159,"--In cases in which the Government makes a sufficient showing, that's right, because the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to exclude evidence come about by illegality."
1987.86-995,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2757.046,2758.413,"Thank you, Mr. Englert."
1987.86-995,2,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,2760.832,2762.784,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-995,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2967.348,2970.918,Do you think property found means looked at in the statute?
1987.86-995,2,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,2970.918,2972.368,I would think so.
1987.86-995,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3004.99,3018.232,"Mr. Randolph, what if they open a window and see it and then they realize they have no probable cause to enter, no warrant, do you think they'd still have an obligation to go in there because of the statute?"
1987.86-995,2,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,3018.232,3021.851,"Well, if they look in the window and see it, there's certainly a probable cause."
1987.86-995,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3025.319,3027.453,You think they should go in and seize it?
1987.86-995,2,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,3027.453,3028.921,--Not without a warrant.
1987.86-995,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3028.921,3031.723,Why is that different in this case?
1987.86-995,2,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,3031.723,3035.909,Because they didn't find it till they got inside.
1987.86-995,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3051.536,3069.332,"Mr. Randolph, I don't understand your seizure argument because it seems to me that if we agree with the Government in this case, that inevitably they would have seized it as well as seen it, and I think they had... it would cure the illegal seizure much as it cures illegal search."
1987.86-995,2,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,3069.332,3071.198,"I fully agree, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-995,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3151.736,3154.469,How is your theory consistent with Segura?
1987.86-995,2,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,3157.973,3172.047,"--Segura can rest on the following proposition, that what was not seen was not seized within... unreasonably seized within the apartment, and the following example--"
1987.86-995,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3172.047,3175.767,"So, unless we agree with you that there's a seizure here, then Segura covers this case?"
1987.86-995,2,16836,a_raymond_randolph,,3175.767,3177.834,--Segura does not cover this case.
1987.86-995,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3347.496,3350.346,"Thank you, Mr. Randolph."
