1965.10,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,13.467,18.535,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.10,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,68.194,70.611,Thank you.
1965.10,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,70.611,73.224,On the other case.
1965.10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,73.224,74.595,Excuse Mr. Solicitor General?
1965.10,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,74.595,74.757,Yes sir?
1965.10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,74.757,76.45,This is only the preemption point?
1965.10,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,76.45,77.874,Only the preemption point.
1965.10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,77.874,82.441,"On the conflict point getting over the preemption point, are we to assume the -- that would express the fact (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.10,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,82.441,87.262,I'd explain the statement on that.
1965.10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,87.967,88.885,Thank you.
1965.10,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,88.885,91.597,The reason is most of this happened before I took over.
1965.10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,91.597,95.255,The Secretary did agree with you on the conflict?
1965.10,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,95.255,95.987,Right.
1965.10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,95.987,97.182,Yes.
1965.10,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,97.182,102.967,Its -- the one point is the preemption and he flatly disagreed.
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,779.818,786.633,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please Your Honors."
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1094.538,1112.526,"May I ask you in reference to this particular law, would it be any different or is it -- would it be about an equivalent, the state had adopted law which made it illegal for a wife to borrow money from the Federal Government?"
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1112.526,1117.894,I think that such a law would be an unconstitutional law Your Honor.
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1165.877,1167.019,"Well, is there any?"
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1172.244,1174.95,It does not specifically.
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1176.131,1177.699,Do you think they are?
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1177.699,1178.764,I think they are.
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1187.599,1192.003,"But the effect of this is to make it impossible isn't it, as it (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1192.003,1193.674,"No sir, not at all sir."
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1193.674,1196.108,For the wife to borrow?
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1196.108,1196.635,Not at all.
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1199.977,1204.271,But why would they lend it if they couldn't collect it?
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1204.271,1205.945,I didn't mean to say that.
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1212.826,1215.266,But can it be collect -- is it collectible?
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1215.266,1216.601,Yes sir.
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1223.17,1233.801,"Well, your position is then that the Texas Law does not relieve a woman from -- married woman from liability to the Government on this particular contract?"
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1233.801,1240.783,My -- I don't believe that I am conveying what I am trying to say to you sir.
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1282.391,1304.085,"May I just want to understand perfectly what your law is and as I understand it, under your Texas law a woman who's engaged in business with her husband who borrows money from the Government, small business administration is free from being liable for that debt so that can be collected, so that its collected?"
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1304.085,1304.967,No sir.
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1308.16,1308.823,That just (Voice Overlap) --
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1308.823,1341.618,-- against that wife unless she has had her disabilities or coverture removed under the statute then she's fully liable but if it's as just a regular community debt where she has not qualified to do business then if she merely signs the note with her husband there is no personal liability on her part for the simple reasons sir that she has not one thing on earth to say about the community property or its management in Texas.
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1346.361,1346.625,But what is (Voice Overlap) --
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1346.625,1347.677,Now the reason she didn't --
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1347.677,1349.462,What is a community property?
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1352.829,1354.221,"No sir, it would not be."
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1410.85,1422.441,"Well, you have to reach the proposition and we have to face that under the law there the Government makes a loan the man and his wife."
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1427.633,1428.835,Not at all sir.
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1428.835,1428.918,Is it --
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1428.918,1429.399,Not at all.
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1429.399,1430.645,That's what I'd like to --
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1430.645,1433.356,That is not correct.
1965.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1524.317,1526.637,"Mr. Hammett, may I ask just one question."
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1537.149,1537.919,Right sir.
1965.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1537.919,1540.928,But it maybe executed against the community property?
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1540.928,1543.737,"Right sir, absolutely correct."
1965.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1543.737,1548.86,And -- as on the facts of this case does this wife have separate property?
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1548.86,1549.825,Not yet sir.
1965.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1555.964,1559.084,But that can't be reached to satisfy this judgment.
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1559.084,1560.463,That's correct sir.
1965.10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.463,1576.308,"Mr. Hammett, I thought the Government's position was that unless the Congress has said this that the state law is to apply the federal contracts that when you've got a federal contract you apply the federal law to it."
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1597.501,1609.419,Sir I believe that if the Congress expresses itself or if that's the interpretation of this Court then and there was a conflict then by all means the federal statute would prevail.
1965.10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1609.419,1630.335,"Well, yes, but the -- what about just the narrow -- much narrower point that at any time you have a federal contract -- that the Federal Government enters into a contract that's authorized by the statute that this federal law governs the -- all aspects of that contract and that state law has nothing to do with it unless Congress expressly says that it does."
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1630.335,1631.613,I think that it does not.
1965.10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.825,1660.373,(Inaudible) but you don't even get to the conflict question.
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1676.984,1681.522,Yet from the standpoint of source our sovereignty yes sir I agree with that position.
1965.10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1681.522,1691.11,"And you never -- and that the state law has nothing to do with it until and unless that Congress says that, well this is a federal contract but nevertheless we'll adopt state law."
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1691.11,1695.639,I think that's right and then if Congress fails to say that this Court can.
1965.10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1695.639,1695.938,"Well, (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1695.938,1698.864,But using it as an -- the appropriate federal rule.
1965.10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1698.864,1700.922,"Is this a federal contract, this note?"
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1700.922,1702.061,"Yes, I think it is."
1965.10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.435,1703.58,Why shouldn't federal law --
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1703.58,1707.695,Because the United States Government is a party to the contract --
1965.10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1707.695,1707.993,"Yes, why --"
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1707.993,1708.997,-- and this Court --
1965.10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.997,1711.687,Why does state law got anything to do with it then?
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1711.687,1718.064,"Well, I don't think that the small business administration can operate in a void or a vacuum."
1965.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1734.474,1740.379,"But your argument doesn't conclude in reaching into the law of Arkansas instead of Texas, as I understand it?"
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1740.379,1741.251,I beg your pardon sir.
1965.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1741.251,1746.715,"If they may reach out and pick up state law they don't necessarily have to adopt your state law, do they?"
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1746.715,1751.143,"Oh, I think that would -- I -- the Congress can pick any standard it wants."
1965.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1751.143,1753.512,Yes.
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1753.512,1754.249,I --
1965.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1754.249,1767.037,"You agree that the state law that the fact that it's a Federal Government -- that it's a federal contract, does it preempt state law or that federal law governs (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1767.037,1769.743,Let me answer it this way as I see it.
1965.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1793.323,1795.227,And you say you ought to --
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1795.227,1795.526,I say that --
1965.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1795.526,1802.448,-- as a matter of just good common sense and that where better can you go doesn't rule all the state where the lady lives?
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1802.448,1806.957,I'd hate the job of having to provide that body through a set of regulations.
1965.10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.957,1814.168,"The United States -- if the United States now says, ""We don't want to go to this law of Texas, its federal law and we're going to find the federal law somewhere else."
1965.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1814.168,1832.629,"In any other case and this very suit the Government, the petitioner would be a estopped because of an inconsistent position when that -- I don't understand why the petitioners not estopped as a matter of law in this case."
1965.10,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1882.35,1882.407,Mr. Hammett.
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1882.407,1884.98,-- which authorize that mortgage and --
1965.10,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1884.98,1885.588,Mr. Hammet.
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1885.588,1885.956,Yes sir.
1965.10,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1885.956,1887.641,I beg your pardon sir.
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1927.769,1931.27,"Mr. Justice Fortas, I haven't said this."
1965.10,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1968.004,1968.037,I --
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,1968.037,1969.642,-- if you don't have that --
1965.10,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1969.642,2013.506,"I don't quite understand from the Government's brief whether they have thoroughly considered the possibility that some limitations on the capacity of married woman to contract maybe an integral part of the states community property system and if it is a community -- an integral part of the state's community property system, would that have a bearing upon the result to be reached in this case, I merely suggest the question far from knowing the answer."
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,2013.506,2014.68,I think it does sir.
1965.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2019.644,2021.263,The regulation?
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,2021.263,2027.083,"Yes sir, it's -- you mean the small business regulations?"
1965.10,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2027.083,2028.123,On page 5 of your brief?
1965.10,1,30719,j_v_hammett,,2028.123,2038.2,"On page 5 of the brief, Regulation 122.17 F. and Regulation 123.7 AA"
1965.10,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2126.464,2143.81,May it please the Court on the one point strikes me as to requiring this procedure under the Texas law which requires you filing a piece of paper and is lying in the judges' chambers until some time he gets around to doing it.
1965.10,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2149.869,2171.39,"There are other creditors neither would -- neither party here has talked of -- about the -- maybe it's not important or relevant but about the effect of one rule or the other here on other creditors of residents of Texas who all of them are governed by the state law and who are competing as a creditor with the United States which has not given any particular priority, is it under these --"
1965.10,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2171.39,2172.3,Yes sir.
1965.10,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2177.723,2182.244,"We'll, you're representing the United States but there are other creditors who might of these debtors?"
1965.10,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2182.244,2186.295,There I think have to -- they have to borrow with a notice of the Texas law --
1965.10,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2186.295,2186.775,"Well, and why shouldn't you?"
1965.10,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2186.775,2188.051,-- because they're bound by it.
1965.10,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2188.051,2188.844,Why shouldn't you?
1965.10,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2188.844,2193.078,It's because this Court has said over and over again we're not starting with Clearfield.
1965.10,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2210.47,2210.545,Is the federal law --
1965.10,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2210.545,2211.328,Is this --
1965.10,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2211.328,2212.773,-- of coverture --
1965.10,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2212.773,2212.928,There is none.
1965.10,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2212.928,2214.98,-- where was it to be found?
1965.10,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2214.98,2218.115,It said coverture is not a defense.
