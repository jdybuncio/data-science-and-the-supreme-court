1982.81-1983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.185,We will hear argument first this morning in Schweiker against Campbell.
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,16.476,34.936,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the issue in this case is the validity of regulations governing claims under the Social Security Act for disability in cases that can't be decided on the basis of medical evidence alone."
1982.81-1983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,47.699,49.025,Total impairment?
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,49.025,52.523,I believe so.
1982.81-1983,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.276,214.427,"Mr. Garvey, do you interpret the Court of Appeals' decision as perhaps being based on some kind of due process, lack of notice requirement?"
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,214.427,221.941,"I find it difficult to understand the Court of Appeals as having said that, because it made no mention of the due process clause."
1982.81-1983,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.87,243.103,"Short of a due process requirement of notice, what other requirement would there be?"
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,243.103,245.615,What other requirement might the Court--
1982.81-1983,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,245.615,247.131,For notice.
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,247.131,249.257,--There is also a statutory--
1982.81-1983,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.257,250.567,--as far as this Court is concerned?
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,250.567,270.107,"--There is a statutory requirement of notice in Section 205(b) of the Social Security Act that provides that the Secretary must give notice and reasonable opportunity for a hearing, and the Secretary has in fact implemented that notice requirement by regulations, and there are a couple in particular."
1982.81-1983,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.248,309.34,"Mr. Garvey, the Court of Appeals didn't mention that section that you have just quoted at all."
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,309.34,310.713,"No, it did not."
1982.81-1983,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,310.713,336.345,"As I understand it, we have a statute here and we have regulations issued pursuant to the Secretary's authority under 405(a), and the Court of Appeals could decide against the Secretary in this case only if it either decided that the regulation wasn't authorized by the statute or that the statute had some sort of constitutional infirmity in it."
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,336.345,339.842,"That is the Secretary's contention in this case, that is correct."
1982.81-1983,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,339.842,343.812,"What do you understand to have been the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, if it had any?"
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,343.812,360.568,"As I understand the Court of Appeals, what it was concerned about was that, the Secretary had not complied with the procedures which the Courts had used to interpret the statutory term before these regulations had been passed."
1982.81-1983,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,470.979,475.319,"Is this a substantial evidence case for us, then?"
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,494.466,496.026,"No, it is not."
1982.81-1983,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,541.853,545.256,Maybe you are arguing that the grid system is evidence.
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,545.256,551.645,But it is evidence only in the sense in which any kind of regulation is evidence.
1982.81-1983,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,559.705,564.36,It really dispenses with the need for this sort of a proof that the Court of Appeals thought was required.
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,564.36,565.312,That is correct.
1982.81-1983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,608.468,629.536,"At the top of page 9-A of the opinion, is it possible that that material where the Court refers to the fact that before and after these guidelines that the Court of Appeals had had some pretty specific notions as to what the standard should be."
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,639.422,640.721,I think that is exactly correct.
1982.81-1983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,701.537,712.062,Is there anything in the regulations that deals with the burden of proof and this possible shifting of the burden of proof here?
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,712.062,737.537,"What the regulations say is that in cases which are specifically described by the guidelines, by the tables in Appendix 2, that under those circumstances, if the findings of fact are the same as the rule, we use that rule to decide whether a person is disabled."
1982.81-1983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,987.475,1004.439,"Well, suppose one of the things that the tables say is that light work includes the ability to lift up to 20 pounds or 15, whatever it is, may the claimant dispute whether or not he or she in fact may lift up to 15 pounds?"
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1004.439,1004.922,--Indeed.
1982.81-1983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1021.884,1023.195,"Then what happens, Mr. Garvey?"
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1042.077,1043.687,"No, not necessarily."
1982.81-1983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1051.81,1052.699,And makes a finding.
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1052.699,1055.901,--and makes a finding with respect to how many pounds she is able to lift.
1982.81-1983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1071.33,1084.062,"Of course, in advance of the hearing, does she get any kind of notice to indicate that one of the issues will be whether she can or cannot lift 15 pounds?"
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1084.062,1094.822,"The notice which she gets in advance of the hearing appears in the administrative record, and it says that"
1982.81-1983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1119.766,1123.249,Does she get a copy of the guidelines at all?
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1123.249,1125.218,She does not get a copy of the guidelines.
1982.81-1983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1127.951,1129.324,"Excuse me, Mr. Garvey."
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1140.71,1143.537,--She is told that the guidelines will apply.
1982.81-1983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1143.537,1146.723,How does she get access to the guidelines?
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1146.723,1151.126,The guidelines are available at Social Security Administration Branch offices.
1982.81-1983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1184.176,1188.645,"Now I gather she is entitled to assistance with a counsel, is she not, if she wants to bring someone?"
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1188.645,1189.549,"--Yes, she is."
1982.81-1983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1189.549,1193.222,"But if she does not bring someone, none is provided for her?"
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1193.222,1199.89,"That's correct, although it is important to emphasize that the Administrative Law Judge at these hearings does not represent the Secretary."
1982.81-1983,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1219.333,1222.554,"Mr. Garvey, I still am not certain."
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1226.41,1234.358,She is not specifically told in any of the notices which are mailed to her that the question will be whether she can lift 15 pounds.
1982.81-1983,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1234.358,1239.341,"My question is, when is she told, ever?"
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1239.341,1242.246,"She can be told at the hearing, in fact, it is quite proper--"
1982.81-1983,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1242.246,1253.274,When was this particular party told that she is going to be measured by whether or not she can lift 15 pounds?
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1253.274,1256.429,--She was not told that she would be measured at any time.
1982.81-1983,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1256.429,1258.024,She was never told?
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1258.024,1258.96,No.
1982.81-1983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1367.947,1372.396,May I ask you a question?
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1401.463,1409.211,"What she would then have succeeded in proving was that that was the wrong table to apply to her, or that for some reason the tables didn't apply."
1982.81-1983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1483.837,1493.69,"I am still not clear what happens if she proves that even though he has correctly described her physical condition, she can't perform any of the 1600 jobs."
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1497.267,1499.469,I would suppose so.
1982.81-1983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1520.041,1533.692,"I wouldn't necessarily think that they would be arbitrary and capricious in all cases, it is just that she has some particular incapacity for... Of course, I admit, it is a hard case to assume, with 1600 jobs, presumably she ought to be able to perform some of them."
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1548.343,1551.888,--I should emphasize again--
1982.81-1983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1551.888,1557.557,"If I understand you view, there are cases in which the regulations, at least theoretically, might not be dispositive if she--"
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1557.557,1559.261,"--Absolutely, there are many such cases."
1982.81-1983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.899,1571.49,"--So is it correct that one could interpret the Second Circuit as holding, as just imposing a requirement on the hearing officer to be sure that this isn't one of those cases."
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1586.078,1604.539,"I don't believe so, because the Second Circuit continually said that what the Secretary had failed to do was to introduce evidence about these kinds of jobs to show (a) that they were available and (b) that they were suitable for somebody who, the Second Circuit had already said, was capable of doing light work."
1982.81-1983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1604.539,1614.813,"If one were to construe the Second Circuit opinion in the way I suggested it might be read, how big a problem would it be for the Secretary?"
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1617.734,1628.497,There are many cases in which the tables cannot be applied because the claimant has some other disability which doesn't fit within the description of light work.
1982.81-1983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1628.497,1631.964,That is true regardless of whether you follow the Second Circuit or not.
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1631.964,1632.978,That is correct.
1982.81-1983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1667.574,1671.544,"But it does tell her more than handing her a card with 1600 jobs on it, doesn't it?"
1982.81-1983,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1671.544,1678.056,"Certainly, although it tells them--"
1982.81-1983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1714.586,1725.63,"Mr. Nazario, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,1725.63,1745.404,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue presented by this case is not whether the Secretary has the authority to promulgate regulations to determine disability."
1982.81-1983,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1765.378,1769.643,"What is the source of those procedural rights, Mr. Nazario?"
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,1769.643,1781.139,"First of all, Your Honor, the claimant has the right under the regulations to present all the evidence relevant to her case."
1982.81-1983,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1809.828,1815.778,Did the Court of Appeals cite each of those regulations or statutory provisions that you have just mentioned?
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,1815.778,1816.562,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1983,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1873.741,1883.517,"Are the regulations which you're relying on contained here in the petition or the appendix or something, and if so where?"
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,1883.517,1897.075,"--I believe the specific regulation is cited in our brief, and it is cited also in the Secretary's brief."
1982.81-1983,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1919.833,1926.127,"Which regulation is it, and is it set forth any place in the papers that we have before us?"
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,1926.127,1927.546,"--Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1982.81-1983,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1932.342,1940.73,Don't let me interrupt your argument.
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,1940.73,1946.01,The regulation appears at 30 CFR 44.944.
1982.81-1983,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1946.01,1950.881,"Where are they in your briefs, what page?"
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,1950.881,1958.567,"We discuss that regulation on page 11 of our brief, the second paragraph there."
1982.81-1983,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1996.91,2005.189,"May I ask, Mr. Nazario, are you making any constitutional argument, B of your brief suggests you may."
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2007.923,2011.607,I say--
1982.81-1983,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2011.607,2016.825,You say the regulations entitle her to the kind of hearing you say she did not get.
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2023.962,2025.132,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1983,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2028.789,2030.489,What constitutional violation?
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2030.489,2044.688,"The constitutional... The right of a claimant to testify at the hearing is premised not only in the Secretary's regulation, but also in the Social Security statute which requires notice and the right--"
1982.81-1983,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2044.688,2048.763,So this is a statutory and under the regulations.
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2048.763,2064.555,"--The regulation, and also a constitutional claim because the claimant has a right under the Fifth Amendment, under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to introduce all the... to have a full and fair hearing in determining her entitlement to disability benefits."
1982.81-1983,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2064.555,2072.019,"Do we have to reach the constitutional claim, if you are right that the statute and regulations entitled her to something which she didn't get?"
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2072.019,2076.301,"That is not the issue in the case, Your Honor."
1982.81-1983,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2088.764,2094.745,You mean due process requirements as expressed in the regulations and the statute?
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2094.745,2096.29,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1983,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2096.29,2108.316,"Mr. Nazario, the Court of Appeals in its opinion, as I read it, made no mention of any constitutional claim that you asserted under the Federal Constitution."
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2111.365,2115.799,"Well, Your Honor, the Court of Appeals assumed that Mrs. Campbell had had due process."
1982.81-1983,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2116.392,2117.612,I asked you a question.
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2123.091,2138.088,--We argued before the Court of Appeals that Mrs. Campbell had not been given adequate notice and an adequate hearing and an adequate opportunity to present her evidence because the ALJ failed to inform her of the--
1982.81-1983,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2138.088,2143.396,Did you phrase that in terms of a constitutional violation in the Court of Appeals?
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2143.396,2148.52,"--No, Your Honor, we did not, and the Court of Appeals did not take it in terms of a constitutional violation."
1982.81-1983,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.015,2267.392,May I ask you a question here.
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2295.394,2299.894,In this particular case.
1982.81-1983,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.894,2300.706,This particular case.
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2300.706,2302.328,"In Mrs. Campbell's case, we believe so."
1982.81-1983,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.171,2308.813,These ten or 15.
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2308.813,2312.607,"--Under this process, Mrs. Campbell would have probably been able to address the issue at the hearing."
1982.81-1983,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2312.607,2321.885,"Supposing that instead of doing that, the ALJ had said: The Secretary has a regulation that lists 1600 jobs that people who can do light work can do."
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2333.754,2338.394,"In the case of some claimants it probably would have, but not in the case of this claimant."
1982.81-1983,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2338.394,2338.846,In this case.
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2338.846,2343.545,I don't think that this claimant would have been able to understand the Secretary's regulations.
1982.81-1983,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2355.604,2358.415,What I am really trying to find out.
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2367.162,2372.987,"--Your Honor, but the problem is that the regulations do not contain a list of the jobs, and that's the problem."
1982.81-1983,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2510.854,2514.555,--What is the amount of benefit she receives?
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2514.555,2521.383,She is currently receiving about only $250 a month.
1982.81-1983,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2521.383,2534.453,"Of course, the amount is not relevant to any of the legal issues here, but I was interested in terms of why she appeared at this hearing without any legal assistance."
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2534.453,2555.055,"I understand she tried to get legal assistance but she was unable to because the private attorneys which she contacted charged a sum which was too high for her means at that time, and she could not get the service of a free legal representative."
1982.81-1983,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2556.896,2562.051,"She later did get services of the Legal Aid, did she not?"
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2562.051,2566.91,"--No, Your Honor, not until she filed the case in the District Court."
1982.81-1983,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2566.91,2576.046,Was it the Legal Aid who wanted to charge her $35?
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2576.046,2576.826,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1983,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2576.826,2578.171,That was a private attorney?
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2578.171,2579.154,That was a private attorney.
1982.81-1983,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2579.154,2579.637,I see.
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2579.637,2581.341,"That is correct, it was a private attorney."
1982.81-1983,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2604.177,2613.064,Is there any procedure under Social Security to which the claimant could go to get instruction on how to present a case like this?
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2613.064,2614.873,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1982.81-1983,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2639.959,2648.565,Is information available on the procedures and requirements and the regulation at the branch offices of the Social Security?
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2648.565,2658.98,I believe that a copy of the CFR... a copy of the regulations would be made available to the claimant if the claimant goes to the office and inquires about it.
1982.81-1983,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2658.98,2662.884,"Yes, and presumably there would be staff present to explain."
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2662.884,2665.664,"That I do not know, Your Honor."
1982.81-1983,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2680.206,2689.046,"Isn't she obligated to do a little something for herself, if she is depending on benefits, if she is trying to get benefits?"
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2689.046,2703.946,"Well, Your Honor, in this case I think she did as much as she could, considering that she had a sixth grade education, that she was unrepresented at her hearing, and that she was misled by the Secretary's initial denial of benefits."
1982.81-1983,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2703.946,2707.241,You don't think she could have been expected to go to the district office?
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2707.241,2718.752,"She did went to the District Office, that's where she filed the initial claim for benefits, that is where she filed the claim for reconsideration of the original denial, and that is where she filed the request for the hearing."
1982.81-1983,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2724.641,2726.594,But they were available there?
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2726.594,2731.75,"Presumably they were available, but she was not informed of their availability."
1982.81-1983,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2731.75,2747.913,"Mr. Nazario, there is some indication, is there not, that Congress has pressed the Secretary to promulgate a grid system or regulations such as those that are employed here, is there not?"
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2747.913,2749.57,"Yes, Your Honor, there is."
1982.81-1983,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2749.57,2756.738,"Basically, the Secretary in promulgating this system is carrying out the wishes of Congress; is that right?"
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2756.738,2761.144,"Yes, Your Honor, that is right."
1982.81-1983,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2793.256,2802.814,"The Court of Appeals certainly did not state that the Secretary had failed to apply his own regulation, did it?"
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2802.814,2809.732,"Well, the Court of Appeals did not state that in so many words, but the holding of the Court of Appeals is clear."
1982.81-1983,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2859.571,2862.413,"Mr. Nazario, may I ask another question."
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2900.368,2912.831,"Well, Your Honor, if the ALJ had followed up on this statement, if the ALJ had made the statement while Mrs. Campbell was testifying, then probably Mrs. Campbell would have been able to present her relevant evidence."
1982.81-1983,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2952.75,2960.483,"Are you saying that if he had repeated this statement while she was testifying, then you really wouldn't have a case?"
1982.81-1983,1,40074,ruben_nazario,,2960.483,2983.891,"--If he had repeated this statement in terms of questions, and if Mrs. Campbell had been therefore able to put in evidence on each of these factors, then Mrs. Campbell would have established that she was disabled under the grid and, of course, she would have had no need to appeal on the Secretary's decision."
1982.81-1983,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3227.619,3230.664,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Garvey?"
1982.81-1983,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3234.134,3235.741,I have a couple of brief points.
1982.81-1983,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3322.876,3328.047,"What does that mean, Mr. Garvey, as a practical matter?"
1982.81-1983,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3328.047,3334.372,"As a practical matter, what it means is that they may go to the Social Security Office and ask what kinds of evidence will help them to bolster their claim."
1982.81-1983,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3334.372,3336.81,Are they told about the guidelines?
1982.81-1983,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3336.81,3343.853,"They are told... If they went to the Social Security Office and inquired about the guidelines, they would be told about the guidelines."
1982.81-1983,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3357.613,3360.362,You may finish your response.
1982.81-1983,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3360.362,3361.926,If I may just finish that sentence.
1982.81-1983,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3394.334,3396.066,"Thank you, gentlemen."
