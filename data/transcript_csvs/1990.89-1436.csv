1990.89-1436,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.904,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1436, United States v. R. Enterprises."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,42.91,45.529,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,212.586,214.788,"May I just say, there are several opinions in the case."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,215.721,218.24,--This is... I am reading from the most recent opinion of the court of appeals.
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,218.24,219.423,Which is where in the materials?
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,219.423,223.811,The one which is at issue on which cert was granted in this case.
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,223.811,225.294,And where is it in the materials?
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,225.294,227.794,It's the beginning of the Petition Appendix.
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,230.562,231.281,Okay.
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,232.398,233.098,Yes.
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,306.079,306.746,What case was that from?
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,306.746,309.448,"--That is Blair against the United States, 1919 decision, Your Honor."
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,316.685,320.922,"Well, if you read that literally you can subpoena anything without any limit, right?"
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,320.922,322.256,"--I think there is a limit, Your Honor--"
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,322.256,325.224,But under Blair there wouldn't be any limit at all.
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,325.224,329.694,"--Well, Blair is talking about a case in which there is no question that the--"
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,329.694,331.563,"So you don't rely on Blair literally, then?"
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,331.563,342.752,"--We don't say that there are no limits, because we believe that a court has a responsibility to ensure that the grand jury is proceeding in good faith and is not engaged in something that is not--"
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,342.752,351.275,"I just suggest that Blair, like this case, perhaps involves some overriding... you know, written a little beyond the facts."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,351.275,359.445,"--The Court could have said assuming that the grand jury is proceeding in good faith, and I think that was the assumption underlying the Court's discussion on that point."
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,359.445,368.468,"Well actually, Mr. Bryson, you really don't go that far as to say that the court has a responsibility to assure that the grand jury is proceeding in good faith."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,369.486,370.002,Exactly.
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,370.002,373.788,--So it isn't really that the court has a responsibility to assure it.
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,373.788,374.538,"Well, the court has--"
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,374.538,380.175,"You would say that if the claimant can show that the grand jury is not proceeding in bad, in good faith--"
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,380.175,385.746,"--If the claimant can make a prima facie showing, then it puts the court in a position that the court is--"
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.746,392.602,"--But that showing cannot consist of the, just utter irrelevance to the investigation of what is sought."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,392.602,415.098,"--Unless the showing establishes that there is just no conceivable relevance, that the materials are so clearly on their face irrelevant, anything that the grand jury could legitimately be interested in, that it establishes virtually a prima facie case in and of itself that the grand jury is engaged in some kind of improper action beyond the scope of its responsibilities and authorities."
1990.89-1436,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,415.098,421.669,"Well, if that has been done, do you say that the burden of proof shifts, or that simply the burden of going forward then devolves on the Government?"
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,421.669,424.787,I don't think... I don't think the burden of proof shifts.
1990.89-1436,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,454.306,454.556,Right.
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,456.772,457.924,Now I have to emphasize that.
1990.89-1436,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,494.864,497.299,"Truthfully, we're not talking about the grand jury."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,499.351,501.703,"As a practical matter, Your Honor, in most cases that is right."
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,521.748,530.52,"Mr. Bryson, do you think the judge should look at each subpoena all by itself in a vacuum, or is it proper for the judge to consider the pattern of subpoenas of which this is just one?"
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,530.52,539.376,"I think it is perfectly appropriate to consider the pattern of subpoenas, any evidence that may bear on the question of whether the grand jury is acting in good faith in pursuing an investigation."
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,539.376,546.566,Is it at all relevant that the other subpoenas raised First Amendment issues that may well have influenced the court of appeals in its earlier decisions?
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,546.566,557.188,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think... first of all, excuse me... first of all, the court of appeals did not decide this issue on First Amendment grounds."
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,590.678,592.795,What exactly were the records that were requested here?
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,592.795,597.414,"--They were sales journals... well, corporate journals, tax returns--"
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,597.414,599.048,That would identify the customers and the suppliers of the company.
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,599.048,608.556,"--Well, the customers' identification provisions were limited to those sales that were made in Virginia, which these two respondents claim were none."
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,609.222,611.258,"And there is no dispute about that, is there?"
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,611.258,612.574,"--Well, we don't know."
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,615.692,617.259,"They filed uncontradicted affidavits to that effect, didn't they?"
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,617.259,617.659,That is right.
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.193,807.865,"So in terms of the rule, you say that the word unreasonable has one meaning with reference to trial and another with reference to grand jury?"
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,807.865,808.565,Precisely.
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.051,844.538,"Well, doesn't the prior history of the quashing of a whole series of subpoenas demonstrate on its face that the grand jury was abusing its powers in this particular investigation?"
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,844.538,847.34,"--Your Honor, first of all we're talking about there was one--"
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,847.34,852.478,"All of which, as I understand, the Government agrees now they were properly quashed, the prior subpoenas."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,852.478,863.1,"--There was one prior subpoena, Your Honor, which was involved in the previous court of appeals decision in this case several years ago, in which we acknowledged that that subpoena was unduly vague."
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,881.58,882.363,I see.
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,882.363,894.138,"However, the fact that the grand jury made one mistake, as we see it, with respect to one subpoena several years ago, does not mean that these subpoenas are in any way brought under a cloud."
1990.89-1436,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,936.714,950.355,"In some cases I assume the person to whom the process is served upon will have no knowledge of, really, the subject of the grand jury's investigation."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,950.355,950.807,--Exactly.
1990.89-1436,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,950.807,957.961,"If that is so, why shouldn't the Government have the burden to show conceivable relevance, at least in that instance?"
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,957.961,958.677,Well--
1990.89-1436,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,958.677,964.381,How can the person upon whom the process is served possibly meet that standard?
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,964.381,967.583,"--Well, there are cases in which it may be possible to make such a showing."
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1125.933,1133.622,"Mr. Bryson, I thought the Fourth Amendment protected us from unreasonable searches and seizures, not bad faith searches and seizures."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1153.0,1157.968,"Your Honor, I think that the question of reasonableness depends on the setting."
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1167.757,1169.324,"No, but good faith is different from reasonable."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1174.961,1179.398,"--Well, I think in this context reasonable is essentially the same as good faith."
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.667,1185.036,"--Well, you don't mean good faith then."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1205.865,1206.465,"--No, I am saying that."
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.232,1209.167,But that has nothing to do with reasonableness.
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1214.988,1216.838,"--Well, Your Honor, I disagree."
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1246.257,1257.296,"Why can't... I am impressed with the fact that we shouldn't have to, that it will hamstring investigations if you allow these things to be litigated up front all the time, I understand that."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1283.18,1290.536,"Well, that is how these cases are all litigated, at the point at which the individual adamantly refuses."
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1290.536,1292.202,"Well no, it's usually a motion to quash, isn't it?"
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1292.202,1294.238,"Well, but that's right."
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.238,1296.69,I'm talking about we will not allow any motions to quash.
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1315.401,1330.494,"Well, it would be completely inconsistent with the way things have always been done, which is... the fact that it would be a different way of doing things doesn't necessarily make it wrong, but the way we do it now is to have a motion to quash, which is where the question of the validity of the subpoena is decided, then--"
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1330.494,1332.113,"And use bad faith for that, that is fine."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1339.933,1353.61,"--Again, our submission is that the definition in this context of unreasonable is not something that a judge thinks is not a fruitful line, or not likely to be a fruitful line of inquiry, but rather something in which the grand jury is clearly out of its bailiwick."
1990.89-1436,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1360.013,1377.475,"Well, certainly our case of Walling v. Oklahoma Press Publishing Company, which is the leading case for administrative subpoenas, pretty much adopts the test you say, I think, that if you, the person objecting has to show that it isn't going to lead to any relevant evidence."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1377.475,1383.979,"I think that is essentially the rule both in that case, in Endicott Johnson, which is another administrative subpoena case, and in Morton Salt."
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1386.831,1391.235,"Are all of these cases, did they come up on motions to quash, or did they come up--"
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1391.235,1392.018,--They came up because they were--
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1392.018,1392.918,--Motions to enforce.
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1392.918,1393.718,--administrative subpoena cases.
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1394.468,1395.518,"Oh, seeking to enforce them in the courts."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1395.518,1395.934,That is right.
1990.89-1436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.186,1397.586,But it's still... I see.
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1397.586,1399.872,--Grand juries... subpoenas are self-enforcing.
1990.89-1436,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1409.328,1412.363,"Of course, quite a few of the judges were formal prosecutors."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1412.363,1414.696,--That's true.
1990.89-1436,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1414.696,1418.148,So they know what is being done and they know what's--
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1418.148,1422.802,"They have, I think the district courts often are quite sensitive and aware of what is going on--"
1990.89-1436,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1422.802,1431.408,"--If I understand, your position is the judge is perfectly well to say I don't think this leads anyplace, but if you want to go, go."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1431.408,1432.091,--That is exactly right.
1990.89-1436,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1444.548,1448.452,Are the search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment applicable here?
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1448.452,1459.241,"Well, Your Honor, this Court has, since the Boyd case and in subsequent cases including the Walling case, has regarded them as applicable."
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1496.766,1498.718,"Could I ask you just one question, Mr. Bryson, because I kind of got lost."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1506.955,1507.491,--Yes.
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.491,1508.307,--I can understand the reasoning.
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1509.307,1519.096,"Your Honor, you have not to my knowledge had a case in which that question in that form was presented, so I think the answer to that is no, not to my knowledge."
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1519.096,1521.481,"The Bowman case came up in kind of a funny way, I know."
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1521.481,1522.75,That was a trial subpoena.
1990.89-1436,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.75,1524.75,The defendant subpoenaed the Government's materials.
1990.89-1436,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1524.75,1524.966,That's right.
1990.89-1436,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.628,1542.812,"Thank you, Mr. Bryson."
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1543.746,1547.698,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.664,1622.43,Do you say that is what the court of appeals held?
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1622.43,1624.965,"--Yes, Judge, I do, and let me tell you--"
1990.89-1436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.965,1630.935,"Well, it doesn't sound to me like you really were, in your brief that you were really defending what the court of appeals said."
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1632.821,1649.064,"--Well, Your Honor, let me just... the court of appeals said our only concern with respect to the business records requested from Model, R. Enterprises, and MFR is the relevancy of those documents to the grand jury's investigation."
1990.89-1436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1654.135,1659.805,"Were you, at least you say if you come in and object to the subpoena you have got to do something more than just object."
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1659.805,1661.022,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-1436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1661.022,1662.324,You have to prove what?
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1665.542,1677.666,"I have to, Your Honor, set forth facts as to why I believe there is at least a basis for making the Government... in our case, Your Honor, we came in and it has never been disputed; this little bookstore in Brooklyn does no business in Virginia."
1990.89-1436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.368,1681.135,You don't need to argue the facts now.
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1685.272,1691.76,"--The burden we have, Your Honor, is a reasonable showing that there is absolutely no relevance for the records requested."
1990.89-1436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1693.46,1695.212,Reasonable showing absolutely--
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1695.212,1702.716,"--Well, a reasonable showing, Your Honor, that we feel there is no basis for requiring us to turn all of our records over to the grand jury."
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1702.716,1706.519,--And would an affidavit by the defendant be that sort of a reasonable showing?
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1706.519,1711.756,"I think, Your Honor, it can be done in an affidavit either by the lawyer or by the defendant, at least--"
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1711.756,1714.791,The lawyer on hearsay presumably?
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1714.791,1722.779,"--Well, Your Honor, in this instance we indicated in our papers we had conducted an investigation, but Judge... they never really challenged the sufficiency of our papers."
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.591,1800.981,"Mr. Fahringer, wasn't it shown in this case that these companies that were being subpoenaed were in fact alter egos of one principal?"
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1800.981,1803.699,"--Your Honor, they were shown that he owned all of the companies, but--"
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1803.699,1804.616,"Yeah, well, okay--"
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1804.616,1807.135,"--But I don't think that's enough, Your Honor."
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1807.135,1810.337,--Why shouldn't the grand jury be entitled to inquire on that basis alone?
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1810.337,1813.872,"Well, Your Honor, if I may say, as the Third Circuit said, that--"
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1813.872,1818.276,Are you talking about the decision of the Fourth Circuit in this case or the Third Circuit in some other case?
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1818.276,1818.909,--I'm sorry.
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1832.516,1840.689,"Well, there may not be any logical inference of the sort that would convince a jury by a preponderance of the evidence, but surely the Government need not show that much when they are just investigating."
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1840.689,1844.141,"But Judge, they showed nothing, except that one man owned them all."
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1844.843,1845.843,"Well, why isn't that enough?"
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1845.843,1856.651,"--Well, Your Honor, I think what would be a sounder rule for the litigation of these matters is for a prosecutor to come in and say Your Honor, we think those records will show that this company, MFR, is engaged in a conspiracy--"
1990.89-1436,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1856.651,1859.034,What you want is a bill of particulars.
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1859.034,1859.686,--I beg your pardon?
1990.89-1436,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1859.686,1861.836,What you want is a bill of particulars.
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1862.722,1863.738,"No, Your Honor, it isn't."
1990.89-1436,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1866.174,1867.29,"Well, what, what do you want?"
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1868.257,1876.196,"I think, Your Honor, instead of... we are entitled, instead of a prosecutor coming in and saying we don't have to show relevance, that they show some relevance."
1990.89-1436,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1879.865,1881.284,"Well, that's what I'm asking."
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1882.55,1884.801,"--Your Honor, in this instance I'll give you an example."
1990.89-1436,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1894.757,1896.709,I thought the grand jury proceedings were secret--
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1896.709,1898.478,They are.
1990.89-1436,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1898.478,1902.097,--and that you didn't have to give all the records of the grand jury out in the open courtroom.
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1902.097,1903.38,"I am not suggesting, Your Honor--"
1990.89-1436,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1903.38,1904.549,Isn't that what you're asking?
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1904.549,1906.682,"--Your Honor, what I'm saying is--"
1990.89-1436,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1906.682,1909.834,"Aren't you asking for the Government's case, or a little peep at it?"
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1909.834,1911.136,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1948.975,1952.994,"But this was looking towards a prosecution for obscenity, wasn't it?"
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1952.994,1953.946,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1953.946,1957.314,"And you agree that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment, don't you?"
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1957.314,1957.881,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-1436,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1973.407,1979.644,"Well, doesn't that get to the issue of whether the, whether there has got to be a demonstration that the evidence would be admissible?"
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1979.644,1980.596,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1436,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1980.596,1984.881,Do you concede that the Fourth Circuit was wrong in imposing that condition?
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,1984.881,1989.166,"I concede, Your Honor, that they do not have to establish admissibility for a grand jury."
1990.89-1436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.15,2020.637,And therefore failed to meet the requirement that any documents subpoenaed must be admissible?
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2020.637,2023.855,"No, Your Honor, not at all, because Judge--"
1990.89-1436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.855,2024.555,Well that's what it says.
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2024.555,2035.73,"--If I can answer that question, what they did in this case was we have to deliver... Your Honor, it has been affirmed, 50,000 records of Model, Model Distributors is going to have to deliver 50,000 of their business records."
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2056.06,2058.409,"Mr. Fahringer, why don't you slow down and calm down."
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2058.409,2059.012,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1990.89-1436,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2106.659,2108.759,"May I ask, where are the affidavits in the record?"
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2109.945,2113.23,"--They are, Judge, in the court of appeals Appendix--"
1990.89-1436,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2113.23,2113.647,In the Appendix.
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2113.647,2115.765,--which I believe has been transmitted to this Court.
1990.89-1436,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2115.765,2116.365,Thank you.
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2116.365,2117.615,Eight copies of that.
1990.89-1436,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2267.028,2268.146,Let me just ask you one question.
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2292.928,2295.813,"--Your Honor, you are partially correct."
1990.89-1436,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2300.867,2301.317,Right.
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2301.317,2303.486,I don't believe it was ever said they are similar.
1990.89-1436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2357.871,2370.445,"Well, was the grand jury bound to believe the submission that this, that there was no business done in Virginia by these two other companies?"
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2370.445,2375.665,"No, but Your Honor, it has never been disputed by the Government, and the Government never stood up and said--"
1990.89-1436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.665,2378.217,Maybe that's what they wanted to find out.
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2378.217,2399.881,"--But Your Honor, what we're saying is... all we believe the prosecutor would have to say to a district judge is... Your Honor, we believe, instead of agreeing with us and saying it doesn't make any difference whether they do business down here or not, we believe they should have been required to say either one, we think the records will show they do do business down here, and that is why we want them, and that may have been the end of it right then and there."
1990.89-1436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.881,2404.102,"Do you think it would be enough to say well, we want to find out whether they do or not?"
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2404.102,2405.519,"Judge, I think--"
1990.89-1436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2405.519,2406.221,Do they or not?
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2406.954,2407.387,--No.
1990.89-1436,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2407.387,2408.404,Why not?
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2408.404,2410.255,"Because, Your Honor, I think it requires more."
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2419.944,2428.467,You're saying then that the Government has to take the word of a potential defendant as to something unless they have some sort of independent evidence.
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2428.467,2430.169,"Judge, what, I think--"
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2430.169,2432.436,"I'm the Chief Justice, not Judge."
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2432.436,2433.121,--I'm sorry.
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2462.854,2467.208,"So let's follow Justice Stevens' hypothesis, or the hypothesis which he mentioned."
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2491.824,2492.474,They win.
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2493.108,2494.442,How is that different from what happened here?
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2494.442,2495.726,"--Because they didn't say that, Your Honor."
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2505.833,2510.619,So that on these same facts if the Government had just said different words the outcome would have been different?
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2510.619,2511.904,"Your Honor, what I'm suggesting--"
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2511.904,2513.221,"No, you can answer that yes or no."
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2513.221,2514.789,"--Yes, Judge."
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2525.812,2530.097,Okay. What more do they have... is it enough to just say we have a hunch... supposing they say we have a hunch?
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2532.732,2533.549,--I don't think that's enough.
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2533.549,2535.168,So they have to have outside evidence.
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2535.168,2538.62,A good faith basis for arguing that it's relevant.
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2538.62,2543.94,"Okay, which would... the good faith basis would have to have outside evidence, I take it, from your answers to the questions."
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2543.94,2547.641,"Well, Your Honor, it would either be through their investigation, through informants, through--"
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2547.641,2549.208,"Okay, but you're talking about outside evidence."
1990.89-1436,1,26978,herald_p_fahringer,,2549.208,2551.343,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2558.147,2559.497,"Thank you, Mr. Fahringer."
1990.89-1436,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,2562.265,2563.799,"Just very briefly, Your Honor."
1990.89-1436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2653.275,2653.525,May I just be sure I catch this.
1990.89-1436,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,2668.718,2675.538,"--Well, you wouldn't know what happened to the New York assets that... MFR is based, excuse me, Model is based in New York."
1990.89-1436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.877,2686.162,Those proceeds would only be relevant if they were sales of obscene materials.
1990.89-1436,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,2686.162,2686.962,--Yes.
1990.89-1436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2693.032,2695.984,I thought all the subpoenas for the particular tapes had been quashed.
1990.89-1436,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,2695.984,2695.984,"--Well, in another prosecution that was brought previously, Model's tapes were adjudicated to be obscene."
1990.89-1436,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,2695.984,2704.84,I see.
1990.89-1436,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,2704.84,2709.458,So we know that they have in the past distributed materials in Virginia.
1990.89-1436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2716.647,2722.199,Under that theory you could of course get all the records of all the companies that this man had any investment in.
1990.89-1436,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,2722.199,2724.467,"--Yes, that is right, we could."
1990.89-1436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2732.707,2736.459,"Which would be established by the sale of one obscene book, I guess?"
1990.89-1436,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,2736.459,2738.061,"--It would have to be multiple sales, Your Honor."
1990.89-1436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2738.061,2739.477,"Two books, that's right."
1990.89-1436,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,2739.477,2741.013,"Well, that's right."
1990.89-1436,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2781.021,2782.856,"Thank you, Mr. Bryson."
