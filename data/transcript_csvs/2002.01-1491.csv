2002.01-1491,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.789,"We'll hear argument now in Number 01-1491, Charles DeMore versus Hyung Joon Kim."
2002.01-1491,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,10.48,13.429,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1491,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,68.249,72.776,"General Olson, do... do we have authority to entertain this challenge?"
2002.01-1491,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,119.254,139.73,"--Justice Scalia, it's the Government's position, as held by three courts of appeals, that that provision does not apply to a habeas corpus challenge to the constitutionality of the statute itself, that the language of that provision relates to challenges to an action by the Attorney General or administrative action and does not preclude a challenge."
2002.01-1491,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.73,140.074,No.
2002.01-1491,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,154.247,162.888,"It's... it's our submission, after careful examination... the Government originally took that position that you've suggested in court proceedings."
2002.01-1491,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.492,175.699,And... and you're relying on what language to--
2002.01-1491,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,175.699,200.513,"--Well, we're relying on the language that it refers to, and a reasonable construction of the statute refers to actions, administrative actions, by the Attorney General or immigration... administrative action by administrative officials, and this Court's construction of statutes against precluding constitutional challenges to other statutes."
2002.01-1491,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.513,206.702,"--Oh, but all of those other statutes had some wiggle room I think, even St. Cyr, and there just is no wiggle room here."
2002.01-1491,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,214.623,230.264,"Even in the Quirin case where the... the presidential order said that the people shall have no access to the courts at all, this Court sat to hear whether that sort of a provision was constitutional or not."
2002.01-1491,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,230.264,250.068,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and while it would be in the Government's interest to preclude this challenge at all, we think a fair reading of the Court's decisions, including the... the Court... the decision that the Chief Justice mentioned, would to... would be to construe that statute as not to preclude this action in this case."
2002.01-1491,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,261.454,270.29,"Well, I appreciate your carefully examining it, but I'd still like to know what language in it leads your careful examination to conclude that it does not cover this case."
2002.01-1491,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,274.976,275.591,"Well, we... we may be--"
2002.01-1491,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,275.591,276.819,Maybe we'll strike it down for that reason.
2002.01-1491,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,277.382,286.958,"--We... we may be wrong, Justice Scalia, but we're referring to and relying on the second sentence which says, no court may set aside any action or decision by the Attorney General under this section."
2002.01-1491,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.531,299.915,--It doesn't refer to the issue.
2002.01-1491,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,313.378,321.028,"--I understand, Justice Scalia, and the Government did, indeed, make that assertion, take that position in early proceedings in this case."
2002.01-1491,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,340.537,344.021,--Can I have a quick answer just to... you said a facial challenge.
2002.01-1491,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,373.694,379.142,"Well, Justice Breyer, the... the case has not been litigated on that basis from its very beginning."
2002.01-1491,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,398.381,399.628,"It uses those words, I know."
2002.01-1491,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,413.328,414.457,--Well--
2002.01-1491,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,414.457,415.451,Is that who I'm supposed to consider?
2002.01-1491,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,415.451,416.036,"--Well, it--"
2002.01-1491,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,416.036,417.844,--or somebody like the plaintiff here?
2002.01-1491,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,417.844,433.453,"--If this... not only is it in the petition for habeas corpus that the individual was challenging on its face, the district court considered it on that basis, and the Ninth Circuit considered it on that basis, and it's been litigated here all the way through by the... by the respondent on that basis."
2002.01-1491,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,449.915,451.185,"General Olson, didn't--"
2002.01-1491,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,451.185,451.911,There... there's been no--
2002.01-1491,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,451.911,455.834,--didn't the Ninth Circuit narrow the group somewhat?
2002.01-1491,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,478.581,479.533,I had the same question.
2002.01-1491,1,32519,judy_rabinovitz,,1595.136,1617.473,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1491,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1632.597,1637.75,"Ms. Rabinovitz, do you have a response to the jurisdiction problem?"
2002.01-1491,1,32519,judy_rabinovitz,,1652.342,1655.082,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1491,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1659.992,1662.109,I have to tell you I don't understand it.
2002.01-1491,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3461.014,3464.792,No.
2002.01-1491,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3478.623,3482.479,"Well, you can rely on the presumption of constitutionality if you haven't briefed it."
2002.01-1491,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3483.622,3486.387,"Well, then I would've have to answer the question differently."
2002.01-1491,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3687.445,3687.901,"Thank you, General Olson."
2002.01-1491,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3687.901,3688.318,Thank you.
2002.01-1491,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3688.318,3689.081,The case is submitted.
