1976.76-674,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,43.323,"We will hear arguments next in 76-674, Third National Bank against Impact limited."
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,46.273,49.422,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,178.796,211.17,"Will you somewhere along the line answer this question and that is, whether respondent Impact instead of being a mortgagee, it simply owned the piece of land and your client sent out of bulldozer and started excavating on the land and the respondent objected and your client said that we are starting our new branch office here and the respondent said well, Gee! I have never sold it to you and it turned out to be simply a mistaken identity on the part of your client."
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,217.45,221.889,"Well, clearly under the decision of the Supreme Court in this case, they would not be disabled if…"
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,221.889,223.638,"Well, under your theory, would they be?"
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,223.638,234.415,"Under our theory, I do not know because in the instance that you pass it to me, the bank is acting on its own initiative without reliance on any contractual rights."
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,243.478,250.979,"You say then it is simply, literally, no injunction in whatever circumstances conceivable, at least you say it could be prospective."
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,250.979,268.31,"Yes sir, this Court in 1888, when it decided the case of Pacific National Bank versus Mixter said that it was an absolute prohibition and that the remedy and that was an attachment case and not an injunction case, I do not think that is important."
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,268.31,297.584,"Well, but it could be quite important, could it not because if you read the Section of the statute you are relying on is used in generous type I think, attachment and execution are both remedies prior to judgment, initiated by a plaintiff and certainly you could read this word injunction is being so limited."
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,297.584,306.788,I do not understand that the limitation that is implied by a reference to the attachment.
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,325.884,337.99,Do you have to go as far as was suggested in the case of the bulldozer and mistakenly on the wrong property?
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,341.339,343.579,"No, sir, you do not."
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,343.579,357.192,"You have business relationships and business transactions and documents upon which your proceeding has distinguished from the other which is a trespass, I would take it?"
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,357.192,371.913,"Precisely, that is what I have tried to respond that we are relying on private contractual right between the lender and the borrower that were defying the nature of the relationship and the rights on the happening of certain events, rather than a unilateral action on the part of the bank."
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,371.913,377.792,"Mr. Kanaday, what in the statute draws a distinction between a breach of contract claim and a tort claim?"
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,378.674,386.534,"There is nothing in the plain reading of the statute that draws such a distinction, but I do not think that we have to embrace such an egregious."
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,386.534,394.809,"No, no, but if you concede that the statute does not apply literally in that situation, are you not saying that in some cases it is read literally and in some cases it is not?"
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,394.809,402.087,"Justice Stevens, I am not saying that I concede how the statute would be read under those extreme cases."
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,406.474,415.999,"Well, if one could distinguish between tort and contract, could one also not distinguish as your opponent does, between cases in which the plaintiff is a creditor and those in which he is a debtor?"
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,415.999,429.086,"Yes, but I am not saying that the statute affords us the liberty to make those distinctions either between tort, contract, debtor, creditor."
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,765.093,772.261,What is the procedure for the bank in this case for closing on its security?
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,772.261,792.655,"Under the terms of the Deed of Trust, the trustee who is appointed in the instrument, in this case there was a substitute trustee appointed, the bank gave notice to the customer of the default, called the loan, then published in a newspaper in Davidson County, Tennessee, in Nashville, once each week..."
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,792.655,800.828,"It takes no official participation, it takes no participation, it is not a judicial foreclosure?"
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,800.828,802.918,"No sir, the courts are not used at all."
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,809.394,811.814,But he is not in any kind of public official?
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,811.814,815.439,"No sir, I am the trustee in this sale was a matter of fact."
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,815.439,819.232,What about at the sale?
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,819.232,828.667,The other trustee then reads the notice of foreclosure whereas there has been a default called the note due and it has been advertised in…
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,828.667,836.097,"But at no time in the whole foreclosure procedure, is there any official participation?"
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,836.097,840.876,"Any public official, no sir, there is not, not at all."
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,842.517,853.437,"Well, in your capacity you have the same responsibility I suppose on constrictions as a public official, do you not?"
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,858.164,866.054,The sale after it is held by the trustee is not reviewed by a court; as I understand some states have a conformation process or something like that.
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,876.057,878.094,Automatic judicial review.
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,878.094,879.151,That is correct.
1976.76-674,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.151,883.276,Was there any constitutional issue presented in the courts below?
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,883.276,898.649,"Mr. Justice White, there was no constitutional issue presented in this case at all, until after I filed my brief after this court had granted Certiorari and it was raised in the respondents reply."
1976.76-674,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,898.649,910.462,What is your position on the – whether the respondent is privileged to attempt to sustain the judgment below by making a constitutional argument?
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,910.462,921.331,I think that you are addressing this to the timeliness issue of…
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,921.331,933.833,"Assume we agree with you except for the constitutional issue that is presented here, do we have to face that or must we…"
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,933.833,939.116,"No, sir I do not think that it is even appropriate that you face this."
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,939.116,940.326,Why?
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,940.326,958.528,"Because in the case of Cardinal versus Louisiana, an unanimous decision which you wrote, you wrote this way “The court has consistently refused to decide federal constitutional issues raised here for the first time on review of a State Court decision."
1976.76-674,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.528,961.773,"So, you think that is a jurisdictional matter, the case is properly here, is not it?"
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,961.773,962.69,"Yes sir, it is."
1976.76-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.69,969.953,"Well, the respondent now wants to sustain the judgment on constitutional ground."
1976.76-674,0,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,969.953,971.974,And your question is what?
1976.76-674,1,25885,gail_p_pigg,,1183.989,1186.803,Mr. Chief Justice and May it appease the court.
1976.76-674,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1206.748,1212.392,What do you think the statute means and what was its purpose?
1976.76-674,1,25885,gail_p_pigg,,1212.392,1227.911,"You Honor I think that the statute clearly on its face, means that its purpose is to protect creditors from ratable distribution, protect the assets of the bank from ratable distribution among its creditors."
1976.76-674,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1521.56,1526.216,"In those three cases it was the, they were creditors of the bank, is that it?"
1976.76-674,1,25885,gail_p_pigg,,1526.216,1528.527,"Yes sir, they were creditors of the bank, Mt. Justice Stewart."
1976.76-674,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1528.527,1529.819,In all three cases…
1976.76-674,1,25885,gail_p_pigg,,1529.819,1540.723,And none of these cases and it’s almost frightening to me that the extension that they have extended this far.
1976.76-674,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1608.001,1609.669,And who is the trustee in this case?
1976.76-674,1,25885,gail_p_pigg,,1609.669,1625.557,"The trustee in this case, I believe now is Mr. Kanaday, but the trustee Your Honor in a situation like this is always selected by the mortgagee always."
1976.76-674,2,42914,thomas_p_kanaday_jr,,2642.279,2646.468,"Yes sir, I do."
