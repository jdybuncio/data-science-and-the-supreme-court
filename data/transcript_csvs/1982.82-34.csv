1982.82-34,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.06,We will hear arguments next in American Paper Institute against the American Electric Power Service Corporation.
1982.82-34,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,95.728,99.602,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.82-34,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,488.367,495.395,"Professor Bator, you put the other first and the full avoid cost second."
1982.82-34,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,501.439,509.92,"Well, Your Honor, if there had been a physical way to state them together simultaneously, I would have because they proceed in tandem."
1982.82-34,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,674.323,685.287,"But is it not true, Mr. Bator, that at all times, even though the full avoided cost may be different at different times of the day and so forth, at all times, it is the maximum rate permitted by the statute?"
1982.82-34,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,685.287,691.192,The full avoided rate system is the maximum rate permitted by the statute.
1982.82-34,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,691.192,700.001,"Well, and at any given time of day, whatever that rate might be if it is equal to the utility's full avoided cost, it is the highest the statute would permit to be charged."
1982.82-34,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,700.001,702.047,It is the highest that the statute permits.
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,1656.215,1659.495,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.82-34,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1731.31,1755.942,"Mr. Berlin, why is it irrational for the commission to say that when we want to get this thing off the ground we do want to bring in every last drop of cogeneration because then we will know that the co-generators are doing as well as they can, and then there will be time enough to adjust and see what proportion of those benefits are passed on to the consumers later after the co-generators are in place?"
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,1755.942,1768.279,"Justice Rehnquist, it undoubtedly is the case that a great deal of cogeneration that will be produced by the rule will be produced in response to the legislation and of the rule fairly immediately."
1982.82-34,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1804.861,1810.654,What do you mean when you say they can get a long-term contract without negotiation?
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,1810.654,1824.148,"Under 304(d) of the commission's rules, a co-generator at its option can in fact force a long-term commitment at 100 percent of avoided cost."
1982.82-34,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1824.148,1828.162,What would be the term as the rules say.
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,1828.162,1829.318,"We use the term,"
1982.82-34,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1845.967,1852.496,Although that rate can vary from time to time as Mr. Bator indicated.
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,1852.496,1864.883,"That is certainly correct, and I think that shows the illogic in simply looking at the utilities' rate in establishing a rate that will be sufficient to encourage cogeneration."
1982.82-34,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1897.665,1917.158,"Mr. Berlin, I guess you agree, do you not, that the standard of review that should be applied in the Court is an abuse-of-discretion standard of review in determining whether the commission properly exercised it."
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,1917.158,1935.902,"Quite frankly, Justice O'Connor, I think that whether it is arbitrary or capricious, a substantial evidence need not be reached in this case because it is our contention that the agency simply failed to carry out the statutory criteria, failed to apply the statutory criteria."
1982.82-34,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1935.902,1938.055,That's just dressing up the same argument another way.
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,1938.055,1941.711,"I think that is probably correct, and we would not dispute."
1982.82-34,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2039.125,2062.818,"Mr. Berlin, it does appear that adoption of the full avoided cost rule is simply the upper limit of what is permitted under the statute, so the commission appears to have acted within the framework of the statute but simply set the rate at the upper limits."
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2069.753,2074.094,"I'm not sure that is the upper limit permitted by the statute, Justice O'Connor."
1982.82-34,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.981,2122.106,Let me just ask one question--
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2122.106,2122.872,"--Yes, sir."
1982.82-34,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.872,2124.027,"--about what you are just talking about, Mr. Berlin."
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2148.221,2157.576,"There is nothing to preclude the commission from changing its rule in the future, and should it change its rule and should it lower the rate below 100 percent, then there would be a possibility."
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2169.79,2173.008,"The commission didn't assume there would be savings, did it?"
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2176.944,2177.132,--Absolutely not.
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2177.132,2177.929,--in explanation of its own--
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2177.929,2178.366,Absolutely not.
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2179.6,2182.911,--It found public benefit because of the reduction in the use of coal and so forth.
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2182.911,2185.222,"--Not even that, Justice Stevens."
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2189.55,2190.222,Correct.
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2190.222,2191.345,"Then it went on and said,"
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2196.374,2197.779,"Well, that's obviously true, isn't it?"
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2197.779,2198.92,That obviously is true--
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2198.92,2199.42,Yes.
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2199.42,2200.622,--and we don't dispute it.
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2200.622,2201.404,And that's a public-interest factor.
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2201.404,2205.246,And there is question that it can take that into consideration.
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2351.998,2355.059,"May I ask, sir, what part of the statute did they not comply with?"
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2355.059,2360.98,"--They made no effort at all, Justice Stevens, to look at any of the 210(b) criteria."
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.495,2372.477,"By hypothesis this is just and reasonable because if they didn't buy the substitute power, they would still have a rate that the local utility said was just and reasonable."
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2372.477,2379.897,"--That, sir, is exactly what Congress knew and told us."
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2390.659,2398.109,"Congress could have said, ""It must be there"", but I think you said they have violated the statute by prescribing the statutory maximum."
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2401.217,2402.685,"Well, let me then correct that, Justice Stevens."
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2402.685,2403.123,Yes.
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2403.123,2411.244,"A 100 percent avoid cost rule is certainly permitted by the statute, and if I have given any contrary indication, let me retract it."
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2673.081,2674.971,May I ask you one broad question?
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2689.449,2692.199,The commission could certainly under my view--
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2692.199,2692.963,Under your view.
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2692.963,2695.229,--And I totally advocate its responsibility.
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2724.154,2734.541,"As I read your brief, you seemed to say that Section 210 of the Power Act is the exclusive authority... statutory authority... for interconnection orders."
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2734.541,2736.369,"With transmission facilities, yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.369,2743.741,"And if that's true, then it would seem to me that that would require that the Federal Power Commission in Washington issue all those orders."
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2743.741,2748.537,"That is correct, and let me respond to what I think lurks behind your question."
1982.82-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2858.787,2861.864,What is the source of the rule-making authority you say is there?
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,2863.114,2868.331,"--No, I think it's a general authority to issue rules and regulations under the Federal Power Act."
1982.82-34,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3103.47,3106.438,We have heard about QF's and PURPA.
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,3108.078,3122.822,A target is the Government's invention for the justification of 210(e)(3)(b) which says that you cannot exempt QF's or co-generators from the Federal Power Act interconnection provision.
1982.82-34,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3148.453,3148.874,Sort of like a take over.
1982.82-34,1,21885,edward_berlin,,3148.874,3151.264,"Yes, and that's when they are a target."
1982.82-34,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3271.247,3273.543,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Bator?"
1982.82-34,2,37751,paul_m_bator,,3273.543,3276.823,"Yes, Chief Justice, just a few comments."
1982.82-34,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3373.955,3377.501,"I think I understand your argument, but I am not entirely sure the commission made that argument."
1982.82-34,2,37751,paul_m_bator,,3377.501,3379.734,"Well, they put it in the rule."
1982.82-34,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3514.587,3515.681,"Thank you, gentlemen."
