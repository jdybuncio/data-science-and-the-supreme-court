1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,16.898,27.203,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1958.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,249.258,265.769,"What is the scale of that map, please do -- just -- just so we would know approximately."
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,265.769,268.642,By maintenance is 5000 -- about 40 miles.
1958.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,268.642,271.723,Period is 40 miles.
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,271.723,275.156,"Yes, you mean the whole -- all of that is 40 miles?"
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,275.156,283.867,"No, Your Honor, from Old Bluefield to Roanoke is about 54 miles."
1958.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,286.47,290.412,The one inch to five miles that's the -- one is to five miles.
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,290.412,293.25,"That's correct, sir."
1958.92,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,334.373,337.398,They pick up the shipment at Bristol and deliver it to Roanoke?
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,337.398,343.992,"It could not, sir."
1958.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,734.819,746.794,May I ask whether the Commonwealth of Virginia through this claim of designed security by evidence other than mere geographical evidence?
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,746.794,749.122,"Nothing, Your Honor."
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,749.122,756.104,"You mean only the map withheld to routes, leads over to Bristol --"
1958.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,756.104,756.397,Roundabout.
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,756.397,760.229,-- to many roots and that's the direct line to South Virginia?
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,760.229,760.721,Yes.
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,761.534,762.271,"Oh, yes."
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,762.271,773.51,"That is the only evidence, Your Honor, that they did -- response of two witnesses who had made the investigations which we admitted that we did handle traffic for example from Roanoke to Whitfield."
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,783.275,787.313,"Now, what was usual points to the --"
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,787.313,788.316,"Whitfield, sir."
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,788.316,789.07,Whitfield?
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,789.07,789.271,Yes.
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,789.271,804.77,"And you point to this to the boundary in some area of Bluefield, that is from (Inaudible) to that from the West Virginia town which you deliver to Whitfield, an economical and to yourselves an economical (Inaudible)"
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,804.77,809.163,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,809.163,815.042,And -- and coming to the direct routes from (Inaudible)
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,815.042,816.744,That's right.
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,817.078,823.475,"It's a direct route to the -- taking all with that factor, thus, would be not favorable."
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,823.475,824.07,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,824.07,825.357,Couldn't define the relevance.
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,825.357,826.853,Yes.
1958.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,826.853,834.938,"Were the roads, the direct roads equally favorable to truck traffic?"
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,834.938,837.872,"In some cases yes, Your Honor, in another cases no."
1958.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,871.512,889.95,"Well, was there any -- was there any attempt to buy the other side to -- to show that you had acted differently so far as that central terminal is concerned in -- in intrastate shipments from interstate shipments."
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,909.716,910.148,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1958.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,910.148,916.764,"Now, did they -- did they claim that that was deliberate, they secure too and for the same reason?"
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,916.764,917.607,"No, they did not."
1958.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,923.608,923.849,Yes.
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,923.849,928.742,Only for the purpose of demonstrating that are clearly interstate movements --
1958.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,928.742,929.29,Yes.
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,929.29,936.085,-- were handled in precisely the same way that the movements moving between Virginia points.
1958.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,936.085,939.162,"Yes, that's what I was saying."
1958.92,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,939.162,945.806,(Inaudible)
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,945.806,950.261,"I do not believe so, Your Honor, not under the -- the decisions of this Court."
1958.92,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,951.435,953.556,What was the question?
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,953.556,960.796,"And then there's a question of state power in relation to a modification or other effects upon the -- basically, the district."
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,964.062,979.77,"Well, it maybe implied, Your Honor, but I believe that the only question is whether -- the first question is whether or not the Interstate Commerce Commission with respect to this particular certificate and this particular operator had occupied the field by having issued him --"
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,979.77,982.071,"Well, that's what I meant and there is that question."
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,982.071,984.957,Yes.
1958.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,984.957,988.064,This was the proceeding started by the Virginia Authorities wasn't it?
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,988.064,988.525,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,988.525,989.683,A criminal proceeding?
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,989.683,990.367,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,990.367,1001.304,"Now, would you be good enough to state what the cause of the litigation was,(a) what did the State prove before it rested?"
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1002.779,1003.323,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1003.323,1012.879,"Now, what did -- what was their case before you were called upon to decide whether to stand pat or put in evidence of your own?"
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1012.879,1035.775,"Their evidence consisted of the presentation of two witnesses stating that they had intercepted that these vehicles on Virginia Highways moving traffic from such points as Roanoke to Whitfield or Bristol, Chicago and in addition to that they presented the state -- the official state highway map and that is all."
1958.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1035.775,1039.615,And -- and they said you had no certificate from their local authority.
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1039.615,1040.145,"Oh, that's true."
1958.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1041.433,1043.182,"Now, when -- that's all."
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1046.396,1049.214,"Your Honor, the whole proceeding was concluded in a day."
1958.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1049.214,1051.115,"Now, what -- what did you do?"
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1055.096,1088.605,If I sponsor the general manager of the company put an evidence to show that traffic moving between Virginia points through Bluefield consisted or three percent of the total of the traffic handled by the company that it was a distribution carrier serving rural areas certainly that the operations performed in Virginia were precisely of the same character as those performed between Virginia and West Virginia.
1958.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1105.663,1113.612,Would the -- would the rate for the shippers be different if you had routed directly?
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1113.612,1114.555,No.
1958.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1123.917,1124.022,The same.
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1124.022,1124.91,-- the same.
1958.92,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1126.415,1127.739,"The area rate, is it not?"
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1127.739,1128.624,That's right.
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1142.878,1145.484,Did you put in your certificate or you did not?
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1145.484,1145.938,"Oh, yes sir."
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1151.217,1152.758,"Now, the Court rules --"
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1152.758,1162.997,This was held before the State Corporation Commission of Virginia which I understand is -- or has the position of a court of record down there.
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1162.997,1163.856,Criminal proceeding?
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1163.856,1165.366,"It was a criminal proceeding, Your Honor."
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1165.366,1168.857,And it's a commission of judgment?
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1168.857,1181.101,They have -- three main commissions sat on this particular case and they have powers quite similar to what judges would have in -- in other States that they have almost the unique status as I understand it.
1958.92,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1181.101,1182.693,There's no jury?
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1182.693,1187.81,No jury.
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1187.81,1193.299,This is an -- what's -- what's the burden without the reason (Inaudible)
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1193.299,1202.337,"Well, I tried to persuade the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia that they had to run, at least have evidence and they didn't accept it."
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1204.573,1212.782,"And it became like a motion to direct a verdict, the federal courts have as opposed to these -- you didn't make a case, before that's here?"
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1212.782,1213.959,I suppose that could have made it.
1958.92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1221.614,1223.034,Did you make that motion?
1958.92,0,24346,francis_w_mcinerny,,1223.034,1223.729,"No, I did not."
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2396.317,2398.565,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2463.353,2473.013,Was that on the theory that merely because traffic originated in Virginia and came back to Virginia makes it local in commerce?
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2473.645,2478.491,"That position plus the fact that a circuitous route was used between those 2 points, Your Honor."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2478.491,2479.688,But which point --
1958.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2479.688,2483.65,But isn't that precise route that the Commission authorizes the certificate?
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2483.65,2484.205,"No, sir."
1958.92,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2497.443,2500.699,Could you refer for me to the exact language that the Commission --
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2500.699,2502.971,"Yes, Your Honor I can."
1958.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2524.195,2531.948,"Well, what about -- what about the petitioner himself, at least may get to -- page 101 going back to the record."
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2535.102,2541.126,"Yes, Your Honor, they are."
1958.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2550.222,2566.602,Although fining those and I think that that was on page 101 (Inaudible)
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2570.882,2577.462,"It -- it is, Your Honor, but it's -- it is not as -- it does not require the use of a specific right."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2594.248,2604.853,"But it -- it is a little bit more specific Mr. McIlwaine, because it says that part of the Virginia West of the U.S. Highway 29 and south of Highway 60."
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2604.853,2604.923,Yes.
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2604.923,2609.953,Are you saying that that is still a geographic designation and not a route designation?
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2609.953,2610.774,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2709.958,2711.094,Normal and logical.
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2728.668,2732.521,"That was the view of the State Corporation Commission in this case, Your Honor."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2761.761,2765.22,"It said 80 is -- is smaller than 160, is that it?"
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2765.22,2765.964,"Yes, if it's over you --"
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2765.964,2768.111,That's all -- that's all they said.
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2768.111,2773.652,"Yes, sir pointing out that it is U.S that it is a good route between at the base."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2773.652,2783.006,"So now, did -- did the petitioners here introduce evidence justifying that security on transportation economics?"
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2783.006,2783.929,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2814.367,2819.075,"Well now, where if it's before us, the evidence for that matter?"
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2819.075,2820.244,For the conclusion that --
1958.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2820.244,2821.035,(Inaudible)
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2821.035,2822.502,"-- said he has no certificate, Your Honor."
1958.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2822.502,2824.692,(Inaudible)
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2824.692,2824.878,Well --
1958.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2824.878,2833.655,Where -- where is the -- where is the basic (Inaudible) merely to the fact that he does not have another certificate before it's in -- to use the circuitous routes?
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2833.655,2843.37,Well I -- I would say the reason for the use of the circuitous route is that he could not use U.S. 11 from Roanoke to Whitfield wholly within the State of Virginia --
1958.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2843.37,2850.882,"Well, I know but isn't -- isn't the evidence that he did not -- that he used the securities route because he didn't have another certificate."
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2850.882,2850.994,"No, sir."
1958.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2850.994,2851.532,That the evidence is --
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2851.532,2854.741,The evidence is that he used it -- for that he could use it economically.
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2854.741,2862.775,"The examiners have -- did you challenge that he had a bona fide business purpose, bona fide transportation reason."
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2878.926,2893.281,"We did not challenge that before in this -- in the Corporation Commission, Your Honor upon -- upon the ground that without a certificate, there would not be any reason to ascertain whether or not this intrastate route could be used."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2901.346,2923.668,"But now, I ssuppose the Interstate Commerce Commission had in that certificate explicitly taking over the fact of the kind of business they're engaged in, they said, that this certificate allowed the certificate holder to go from Bluefield to West Virginia although he knew this route."
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2928.064,2929.875,"It would not have the case we now have, Your Honor."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2929.875,2941.151,"And therefore, the question is whether a certificate which designates, gives the authority, that supreme point one outside the State and one inside the State."
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2941.151,2941.279,That is correct.
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2941.279,2947.696,"Nevertheless, the exercise for that certificate is a bona fide transportation reason."
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2947.696,2948.27,"Yes, sir."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2948.27,2959.916,Does that bar him from exercising that certificate in that way simply because geographically that he might have gone go between those two points on the basis of the triangle.
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2959.916,2960.409,Well --
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2960.409,2961.776,That is your position or isn't it?
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2961.776,2976.885,"Our position is, Your Honor that -- that is substantially our position with one further fact that we would like to make clear on the record namely that this particular case was decided by the Virginia State Corporation Commission."
1958.92,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3028.902,3029.055,As meaning what?
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3029.055,3030.647,But the certificate was outstanding?
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3030.647,3032.326,The certificate was definitely outstanding.
1958.92,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3033.003,3034.159,As meaning what?
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3034.159,3034.678,I beg your pardon?
1958.92,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3034.678,3036.215,As meaning what?

1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3042.98,3055.701,"There is to my mind, Your Honor especially in connection with their reliance upon the Atlantic case because the interpretation of the certificate by the I.C.C. is by no means definite and clear."

1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3093.152,3094.518,-- brief.

1958.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3132.608,3134.278,What did they say to that?
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3134.278,3160.621,"If I may call Your Honors attention to the language on page 29 (a) in the middle of the page, it says petitioner, that is the appellant here asserts that the Virginia State Corporation Commission during the past several months has instituted proceedings against it for the purpose of penalizing it for conducting operations from one point in Virginia to another point in that State, notwithstanding the fact, that the shipments moved through Bluefield West Virginia."
1958.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3264.436,3267.491,"As I understand it did it , it just shows how the certificate was granted."
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3267.491,3267.788,No sir.
1958.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3278.421,3289.101,And I am also correct that while this determination (Inaudible) brought to your attention and this would be the opinion of the Court with no reference that whatever is made here to the opinion.
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3289.101,3289.448,"No, sir."

1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3292.899,3294.905,No -- no consideration.

1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3320.786,3321.403,Yes sir.
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3321.743,3329.618,There was not such justification in transportation economics as the -- as the petitioner made in this case.

1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3344.837,3345.967,I don't understand that the Eichholz case is --
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3345.967,3348.379,I wanted to know of your -- I'm just standing right behind you.
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3348.379,3361.496,"My understanding of that case, Your Honor is that it was not for economic reasons but simply to avoid regulation by the State Commission that in Eichholz the petitioner went across the river and came back in effect --"
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3361.496,3362.316,But -- but --
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3362.316,3364.046,-- simply to escape the regulation not because of --
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3364.046,3378.068,"(Voice Overlap) did I understand you to agree that the petitioners, the defendants in your proceedings did establish that the honest and -- and profitable way of doing business is the way they did it?"
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3378.068,3378.538,"No, sir."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3388.899,3394.85,"But they couldn't have picked up traffic as (Inaudible) they could go on directly, could they?"

1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3402.444,3407.117,"Why did they take the circuitous route?What did they establish, would it be against him?"
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3407.117,3410.519,"Well, it is to Virginia -- of course, we say they took the circuitous route because --"

1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3410.984,3413.253,-- it is the only route they could legally take.
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3413.253,3414.406,But that I understand that.
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3415.497,3416.057,"Yes, sir."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3416.057,3421.776,"But what economic fact did they prove when it came to them, what is their defense?"
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3421.776,3425.051,"Well, they approved what Mr. McInerny had show here."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3451.689,3453.979,I suppose they've done what you wanted them to do.
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3462.007,3464.888,"I don't understand that that is established on the records, Your Honor."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3469.927,3474.088,They couldn't have (Inaudible) with the other -- with the non-bulk with the bulk --
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3474.088,3474.25,"No, sir."

1958.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3539.831,3540.09,Yes.
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3540.09,3548.749,The first is the fact that the routes employed between Virginia points are not unduly circuitous or impracticable.
1958.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3548.749,3549.066,Yes.

1958.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3622.212,3625.655,(Voice Overlap) just a moment to -- right on that point to clarify something in my own mind.
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3637.325,3638.101,"No doubt, Your Honor."
1958.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3672.89,3681.465,"Suppose that is true, I -- I don't quite get (Inaudible), you say they do that, so that's the only way they can legally go."
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3681.465,3682.787,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3682.787,3686.984,"Well, if they can legally go that way, why can they legally go that way?"
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3686.984,3692.931,I mean that is the only way they could -- it would be possible for them to legally go.
1958.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3694.102,3702.012,"Well now, if -- if the Government certificate made it impossible for them legally go there, what right does anybody will do something different?"
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3702.012,3705.109,The question in this -- and that is the question in this case Your Honor.
1958.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3723.377,3730.651,"You would agree, wouldn't you, that if the -- if the Commission wants to give them the certificates to go that circuitous route, then it's all right."

1958.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3731.139,3731.586,And if they --
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3731.586,3731.67,-- would.
1958.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3731.67,3735.43,-- really couldn't anything to go on because it is circuitous.
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3735.43,3739.096,"I think that may someday become a question, Your Honor."
1958.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3759.185,3768.514,"Are you saying that -- I understand you to say (Inaudible) including what the I.C.C. has told them legally he may do what it needs, legally the only way through that."
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3768.514,3773.716,We say that Virginia may penalize this traffic.
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3786.693,3791.436,What you're saying is on that point is that the certificate didn't grant that.
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3791.436,3809.275,That is then it could not be shown by looking at the certificate that it did grant that authority and it is not certain at this point whether or not even under the -- the declaratory judgment which was answered that the I.C.C. was actually passing on the particular case which the Virginia State Corporation Commission had before it.
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3809.275,3813.32,Could the I.C.C. -- I'm asking because I don't know.
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3827.805,3831.154,"I don't believe in that particular proceeding simply as a procedural matter, Your Honor."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3831.154,3837.115,I'm not saying that if they could have if presenting is all they have or didn't they have.
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3839.974,3840.369,"No, sir."
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3840.369,3842.056,And that is definitely certain.
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3842.056,3843.342,I don't think they could have amended this --
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3843.342,3845.158,Does this require an independent proceeding?
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3845.158,3846.233,I believe it would.
1958.92,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3846.293,3848.492,"And with notice to everybody, is that it?"
1958.92,1,39870,robert_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3848.492,3850.787,"I would have -- I would think so, Your Honor."
1958.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3858.46,3867.14,Is the record -- was your record before the Railroad Commission or your Public Utilities Commission before the I.C.C.?
