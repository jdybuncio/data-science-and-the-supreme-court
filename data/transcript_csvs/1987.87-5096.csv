1987.87-5096,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.67,"We will hear argument now in Number 87-5096, Quincy West versus Samuel Atkins."
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,11.808,28.15,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the respondent in this case, Dr. Samuel Atkins, was the physician responsible for orthopedic services for some 17,000 prisoners in the North Carolina prison system."
1987.87-5096,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.827,162.32,"Mr. Stein, do you take the position that any physician performing services and paid by the state would be liable, in your view, and would constitute state action?"
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,162.32,166.474,"Justice O'Connor, I would take that position, but that isn't this case."
1987.87-5096,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,169.01,176.497,"I mean, even a physician serving as a consultant in his own office on a special medical problem?"
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,179.616,214.805,"--Well, the argument there would be that under Estelle there is an Eighth Amendment obligation on the state to provide medical services to the prisoner, and that if the state has then selected this physician, that person is doing the state's work, but it seems to me that Your Honor has described a fact situation on a spectrum of the least involvement of the state presumably up to the position of a medical director who is a regular employee."
1987.87-5096,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.805,223.994,I am just wondering what kind of line-drawing we could have legitimately if we adopted your view of the liability here.
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,223.994,257.715,"Well, my view is that there is no line to be drawn, that indeed the provision of medical services is a state responsibility, but that isn't my case, and I would like to suggest that the facts in the record show that Dr. Atkins in this case was much more like the person who is in charge of the whole medical system, is a regular employee and always has been."
1987.87-5096,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.715,272.975,"What if the North Carolina law were changed, Mr. Stein, and North Carolina allowed prisoners to contract out and find their own doctors if they had a particular kind of case, and the state said, we will just pay for it?"
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,272.975,287.484,"Well, Your Honor, in that circumstance, if the prisoner himself had the choice and the state would pay for all of them, it seems to me that would be a very different case from what we have here."
1987.87-5096,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.327,306.279,"Mr. Stein, you said he is doing the state's work."
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,329.577,345.753,"It is our position that the state has assigned to Dr. Atkins the responsibility for deciding what, if any, orthopedic services are to be provided to any of its prisoners."
1987.87-5096,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.753,348.586,But that is in no sense the punishment that the state is imposing.
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,350.371,366.832,"Well, the punishment is when the doctor, instead of exercising medical judgment, instead takes an action to prevent the prisoner from getting the medical services that he needs."
1987.87-5096,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.832,369.701,"Well, that is malpractice, but I don't see how it is punishment."
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,369.701,374.486,"Your Honor, I submit that it is a good deal more than malpractice."
1987.87-5096,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,448.384,452.419,"I see that that goes beyond negligence, but it is not enough to go beyond negligence."
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,461.375,489.175,"Well, he was given the power to decide whether or not this person would have treatment, just as the guards who are identified in lots of the cases and were identified in the Estelle case, seeing a man needing medical treatment and saying, I am not going to allow you to see the physician, that is an infliction of punishment because that's the only access to the medical care there is."
1987.87-5096,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.175,497.865,"It's an infliction of harm, but I don't know that anyone would call it an infliction of punishment unless that individual had the responsibility for carrying out the state's sentence."
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,511.957,532.953,"Justice, I don't know about that case but we are dealing here with medical care which is one of the core functions within the prison system... there are only a few that the Court has identified that must be satisfied to satisfy the Eighth Amendment in maintaining the system."
1987.87-5096,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.932,570.993,"The person who's responsible for administering the state sentence, if he is knowingly responsible for that, you certainly have him under 1983, but don't you have to reach somebody who is responsible for executing the sentence upon the individual somehow, someone who is in charge of administering the punishment."
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,570.993,591.64,"Well, it is my understanding it is the fact of incarceration which is the punishment, and that everybody who is within the prison system is... and is a prison official is connected with administering the punishment by maintaining the incarceration and by feeding people and so on."
1987.87-5096,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.64,598.21,You don't say in the municipal area that every agent of the city is the city for purposes of municipal liability.
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,603.698,606.733,This is not a municipal case or a Minnell case.
1987.87-5096,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.532,692.382,"The case has never been tried out on its facts, has it?"
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,692.382,693.0,"--No, it hasn't."
1987.87-5096,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,693.0,693.583,The District Court granted summary judgment.
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,693.583,694.133,Just summary judgment.
1987.87-5096,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,694.133,698.702,"And what were your allegations, deliberate indifference?"
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,698.702,699.07,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-5096,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,869.062,873.116,Supervise personnel who were employed by the prison?
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,873.116,877.668,"--Well, the record is not altogether clear on that."
1987.87-5096,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,893.796,908.187,"But my question was, were these people he supervised employees of the prison, and you say... when you say that's my understanding, do you mean yes, they were employees of the prison, or that you really don't know?"
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,908.187,915.109,"--Well, I think that we do know that some of them had to have been."
1987.87-5096,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.246,1076.633,Why the... this is a 1983 suit?
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,1076.633,1077.566,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-5096,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.566,1082.536,Why that suit instead of an ordinary negligence suit?
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,1082.536,1106.735,"Well, a negligence suit would have been easier probably, Your Honor, but he chose his forum, and he acted for himself and filed a pro se complaint, and I suppose being in the custody of the State of North Carolina he was looking to the federal court for the vindication of his federal rights, but that was his decision, and that is what he did."
1987.87-5096,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1106.735,1110.537,"But there would have been... a negligence suit wasn't barred, was it?"
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,1110.537,1117.508,My understanding of North Carolina law is that he could have filed a negligence suit in state court.
1987.87-5096,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.508,1118.46,Who could he have sued?
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,1118.46,1120.193,"Well, he could have sued the doctor."
1987.87-5096,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.193,1121.744,How about the prison?
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,1123.328,1137.604,"Well, he could have sought to bring an action under the State Tort Claims Act, which is a procedure that is administered by the Industrial Commission, and it is heard before a deputy commissioner."
1987.87-5096,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1153.13,1153.997,I see.
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,1171.825,1173.825,That is my understanding.
1987.87-5096,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1173.825,1178.062,It covers any doctor in or out of the prison system.
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,1178.062,1180.595,That's my reading of this--
1987.87-5096,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1180.595,1182.697,Would not be exercising any state action.
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,1182.697,1210.366,"--And of course it based its decision on its reading of this Court's rulings in Polk County against Dodson, where there was language in there and some discussion of a public defender's professional obligations which would cause that public defender to be independent, and--"
1987.87-5096,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1210.366,1219.222,"Mr. Stein, I can understand your response to Justice White, but is the Fourth Circuit theory really so apparent?"
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,1233.28,1251.575,"--Well, it did, but the language in this case, and emphasized a couple times, is that whenever a professional is acting within the bounds of his professional discretion, he does not act under color of state law."
1987.87-5096,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1251.575,1259.728,"That certainly is in the opinion, but also the great emphasis on Calvert makes me wonder really what their basic theory was."
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,1263.596,1280.789,"Well, we have seen recently some unpublished opinions from the Fourth Circuit where we find that if a doctor, a prison doctor is named in the suit, he is... it is... the broad language is cited, and the case is dismissed."
1987.87-5096,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1284.425,1293.948,On that basis there would never be a recovery.
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,1293.948,1296.317,There would never be a recovery against the doctor.
1987.87-5096,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.317,1297.217,Against the person.
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,1297.217,1298.35,Against the person.
1987.87-5096,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.35,1299.102,Under federal law.
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,1299.102,1299.902,Under federal law.
1987.87-5096,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.557,1447.044,"Well, the lawyer can certainly advise the criminal defendant outside of the courtroom, you know, go to the prison."
1987.87-5096,0,16961,adam_stein,,1449.377,1450.329,--No.
1987.87-5096,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1670.689,1672.605,"Thank you, Mr. Stein."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1675.074,1706.528,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we are not here to argue Estelle versus Gamble, nor are we here to deny the fact that an inmate may sue a doctor in state court under conventional tort liability."
1987.87-5096,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1798.722,1803.941,"Mr. Safron, let me ask the converse of Justice O'Connor's question of your opponent."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1816.433,1830.609,"Under Estelle, if we have an administrator, but we would deny that under these facts that Dr. Atkins was an administrator."
1987.87-5096,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1845.018,1854.208,"So even if he is employed full-time and exclusively by the state to render medical care to the prisoners, you take the position no liability."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1854.208,1877.49,"--I would take the same position that the en banc opinion of the Fourth Circuit did, Justice O'Connor, that if he is a doctor, performing medicine, and is not an administrator, that he is not functioning under color of state law merely because he is a physician employed by the state to provide medical services."
1987.87-5096,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1877.49,1889.547,"Well, what if the prison hired on a contract basis prison guards, all of whom are licensed under some state licensing scheme to make them professionals?"
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1889.547,1890.831,If Your Honor please--
1987.87-5096,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1890.831,1891.833,No liability?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1893.499,1895.118,"--I am not going to say that, Your Honor."
1987.87-5096,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1929.356,1933.493,"That is a little difficult to argue in the face of Estelle, isn't it?"
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1933.493,1937.445,"Estelle, Your Honor, establishes deliberate indifference."
1987.87-5096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.578,1961.261,Excuse me.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1968.583,1970.866,"--No, not at all, Your Honor."
1987.87-5096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.866,1972.218,You are sticking by the... so--
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1972.218,1973.451,"Oh, yes, I certainly am."
1987.87-5096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1974.32,1977.439,--So the janitor who soaps the floor would indeed be liable?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1977.439,1978.789,"Well, no."
1987.87-5096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1978.789,1979.722,No?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,1981.557,1982.791,Let me present these example.
1987.87-5096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.695,2012.978,Excuse me.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2022.051,2022.984,"No, certainly not."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2050.618,2063.378,"Mr. Stein, getting back to Justice O'Connor's question, you kind of left off between the guard and the doctor as to the difference under the color of state law."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2067.663,2069.496,"Justice Marshall, I would say this."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2082.204,2084.756,What is the doctor hired to be?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2084.756,2089.159,--The doctor is hired to provide the very service he provides.
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2095.813,2097.765,But that's not what this case is about.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2106.204,2109.24,"Your Honor, this case is about what he did as a physician."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2109.24,2112.025,What's the difference between a prison doctor and a guard?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2112.025,2116.66,"I would submit there is a world of difference, Your Honor."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2116.66,2117.744,Start on it.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2120.112,2125.5,"A doctor is a doctor, and he has... he is licensed by the state."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2147.948,2150.567,And not responsible to the prisoner at all?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2150.567,2152.25,I didn't say not responsible.
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2155.035,2160.089,So the only difference is that a doctor is a doctor and a prison guard is a prison guard.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2166.077,2170.129,"They are both hired by the state and that I will not disagree with, but--"
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2170.129,2180.252,"And was the guard doing what he was supposed to do, and was the doctor doing what he was supposed to do under the state law?"
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2180.252,2188.692,"--Well, in this case I would argue, and we haven't gotten to the facts--"
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2188.692,2192.477,Was the doctor operating under color of state law?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2192.477,2194.846,"--No, Your Honor, he was operating under his license."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2194.846,2196.046,Was he operating under the state law?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2196.046,2200.048,"He was hired by the state to provide medical services, Your Honor."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2200.048,2201.1,He's paid by the state.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2201.1,2201.75,"Oh, yes."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2201.75,2204.702,To provide medical services.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2204.702,2206.035,"Yes, he was."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2206.035,2208.404,Which allegedly he did wrongly.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2208.404,2211.439,"Allegedly he did wrongly, and therefore--"
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2211.439,2213.89,And therefore the state is not responsible?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2213.89,2218.109,"--He would be liable, as would any other doctor be liable for negligence."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2218.109,2220.077,But this wasn't under color of state law?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2220.077,2220.911,"No, it wasn't."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2220.911,2226.798,Who else was he hired by at the time he acted in this case?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2229.517,2235.069,He was paid by the state to provide medical services to the inmates presented--
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2235.069,2236.087,The complaint is--
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2236.087,2236.971,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2236.971,2242.491,"--that in doing that he did wrong, and you say the state has no responsibility."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2242.491,2253.215,"This... obviously, Your Honor, even under Section 1983, an individual is responsible."
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.916,2284.152,May I just clarify one thing in my mind?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2292.49,2300.344,"--I don't believe it would, but of course under the facts of this case he is a contractor who provided two clients per week."
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2300.344,2306.065,You rely just on the fact that he's a doctor and doctors are different because they have this professional status.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2334.434,2338.469,I just submit that is a particular scenario I have never given consideration to.
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2338.469,2340.338,How is that different from this?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2362.437,2364.17,You are presenting a difficult case.
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2364.17,2366.472,"--He is not acting as a professional should act, obviously."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2386.135,2390.421,I would still argue against liability but that is not to stay there is no liability in state--
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2390.421,2393.456,But why is that different from the food service company?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2393.456,2405.347,--I really don't know if the food service company would in fact be liable under Section 1983.
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.347,2411.351,"Even though they are paid by the state, and they carry out... supposing instead of having a prison you contracted out the prison."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2442.139,2448.46,"Justice Stevens, I would first of all submit that behind this case, I believe, is the very question you are asking."
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2451.21,2451.678,Right.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2451.678,2459.248,--is really the specter that is the subscript of the arguments being made.
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.248,2463.117,The question is whether that would mean they could avoid any constitutional responsibilities to these--
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2463.117,2482.28,"It would appear to me, and that is not the case in front of us, that there are certain basic obligations that if a private company assumes certain basic obligations and with the intent--"
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2482.28,2484.899,--That would otherwise be state obligations.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2484.899,2491.486,"--That would otherwise be state, but state obligations are still private obligations under Section 1983."
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2498.54,2499.492,But here we have an individual.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2499.492,2500.259,--But still--
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2500.259,2504.611,"We have the independent contractor, like my private prison service."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2510.031,2539.884,"--In that particular instance it would appear to me that the officials in the state, any state have an obligation to review what services are being provided in that regard, and injunctive relief would certainly be available through the state administrators."
1987.87-5096,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.884,2543.002,"Well, but how about the people furnishing the services?"
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2560.797,2561.213,That's what I--
1987.87-5096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2561.213,2566.099,--As opposed to those who are doctors and food servers or whatever else?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2566.099,2566.451,--That's what I--
1987.87-5096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2566.451,2568.601,Isn't that a fairly discernible line?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2568.601,2571.836,"--That was the line I had attempted to start with, Justice."
1987.87-5096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2571.836,2572.186,I know.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2573.705,2592.85,"That there is a difference between being a prison guard and providing security and providing many of the services, medical, food, clothing, laundry... there's a plethora of obvious responsibilities, but which are separate and apart from punishment and providing the security."
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2601.905,2607.342,So your line doesn't depend on whether he is an agent or an independent contractor.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2615.532,2615.998,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2615.998,2617.715,Because they are not in the business of punishing people.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2617.715,2618.15,"Yes, Justice--"
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.15,2621.936,Even if they are deliberately indifferent under the Estelle against Campbell rationale.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2621.936,2636.861,"--The point I am really trying to make is, there is still liability under normal standards of tort law which is much less than the civil rights standard."
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2636.861,2637.877,That doesn't [inaudible] does it?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2637.877,2639.011,"Not really, Your Honor."
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2643.281,2645.098,"What you are saying is, we don't need Section 1983."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2646.864,2647.781,"--Yes, Your Honor, there are."
1987.87-5096,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2677.985,2678.652,But that [inaudible].
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2678.652,2681.437,"No, but what I'm trying to say is this."
1987.87-5096,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.925,2695.179,"I know, but you would say if he didn't give him any service at all he couldn't be sued under 1983."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2700.064,2702.749,--I'd like to get back to the facts.
1987.87-5096,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2730.768,2739.958,"Now, Mr. Safron, we granted certiorari on two questions involving whether prison doctors are state actors under these circumstances."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2748.397,2762.454,"--If Your Honor please, we of course are arguing in light of Calvert versus Sharp, which was decided by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals several weeks before the complaint in this case was served."
1987.87-5096,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2788.022,2791.474,"Yes, and that is what the case is here now for."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2801.346,2806.75,We are arguing that this is not state action.
1987.87-5096,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2841.823,2845.727,That is not the way the court below decided the case.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,2852.297,2911.436,"--And that is... and we are relying, of course, on the en banc opinion of the Fourth Circuit that under Polk County versus Dodson, the same way that a full-time public defender is not a state actor, we are submitting that a doctor has his responsibilities under the appropriate standards of medicine the way the attorney who is the public defender has his responsibilities under the appropriate canons of ethics, and that regardless of the fact that one is a full-time employee, that does not turn one into someone who functions under color of state law so as to subject him or her to 1983 jurisdiction, because unless there is in fact jurisdiction over the individual, unless a person is a state actor, there... this is an inappropriate forum under Section 1983."
1987.87-5096,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3019.605,3043.303,"Well, you take the position, though, I gather, that even if the allegation is that this doctor, simply didn't like the prisoner, thought he was a bad actor, and thought he would get back at him by making him physically suffer and withdrawing and denying medical care, that there can be no liability as a state actor."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3046.272,3053.778,"--At that point, Your Honor, we're getting into language of wantonness that this Court used in Whitley versus Albers."
1987.87-5096,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3053.778,3055.011,Make it as bad as you want.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3069.471,3088.266,"I would still argue, Your Honor, that there is a forum, and because there was a forum, which is the state courts, under a much reduced standard than under Section 1983, that the inmate has a forum available to him, and with the forum available to him--"
1987.87-5096,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3088.266,3089.366,"Well, why is he not a state actor?"
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3093.836,3099.573,--He is not a state actor because he is not functioning under color of state law.
1987.87-5096,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3103.192,3106.727,You fall back under the professional argument now?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3109.179,3118.968,"--Under the facts you are presenting, Your Honor, there is no question that that particular doctor would be violating his Hippocratic Oath, would be violating the standards established--"
1987.87-5096,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3118.968,3121.487,We are talking about whether he is a state actor or not.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3125.558,3129.593,"--The rationale is that he has his medical license, and that--"
1987.87-5096,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3129.593,3131.326,Falling back on the professional.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3131.326,3132.544,--that he is a professional.
1987.87-5096,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3132.544,3133.294,All right.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3139.715,3172.102,"I would argue that he is still the professional, and as the professional his obligations under his medical license, his obligations to the state medical... to the state medical standards, American medical standards, that if he acts in this fashion there is, recourse, recourse at a much lower level than under the Federal Civil Rights Act."
1987.87-5096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3175.823,3177.256,"Mr. Safron, I had thought--"
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3203.574,3205.76,"Obviously, doctors don't execute sentences, Your Honor."
1987.87-5096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3206.46,3211.763,"Nor are food service people, so really it doesn't depend on the professional thing at all."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3211.763,3217.067,"Whether or not punishment is being imposed is, I think, the crux."
1987.87-5096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3218.083,3221.102,"Well, it is surely being imposed."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3225.304,3231.041,"--Well, obviously, but I meant by the particular individual who is asserted to be the state actor."
1987.87-5096,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3231.041,3237.981,--You want us to say as a matter of state law a doctor can never impose punishment?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3237.981,3249.087,"It would seem to me, Your Honor, that if the doctor is functioning as a physician--"
1987.87-5096,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3249.087,3258.56,"Now you are back to the physician analogy, and that means the more control the person has over the prisoner, the less obligation he has to the law?"
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3258.56,3270.702,"--No, Your Honor, control, I think, is the substance, and control over an inmate in terms of imposing the security, imposing the punishment--"
1987.87-5096,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3270.702,3275.92,"You say the more professionalism, the more learning the doctor has, the less control he has over the prisoner?"
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3275.92,3284.962,"--In terms of the normal requirements, that... he has... he is practicing medicine."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3292.282,3297.102,Was he a prisoner when he was treating him?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3297.102,3303.423,Mr. West was a prisoner when Dr. Atkins was treating him.
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3303.423,3307.725,"And he was under guard just the same as in the middle of the jailhouse, right?"
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3307.725,3310.26,I am sure there were guards present.
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3310.26,3313.779,"Well, it was a prison hospital."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3317.147,3318.683,"Obviously, and I am sure--"
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3318.683,3323.753,"So he was still under restraint, subject to the Eighth Amendment."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3323.753,3325.487,--But not Dr. Atkins' restraint.
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3325.487,3327.789,"Well, he was there."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3346.416,3349.904,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3349.904,3351.887,And what is the difference?
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3351.887,3356.224,The doctor is present practicing his profession.
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3359.593,3363.962,Suppose he had been in the prison treating him.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3366.014,3371.318,"He is not an individual imposing security of the institution, Your Honor."
1987.87-5096,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3371.318,3379.055,"If he was treating him inside of the prison, would he still be exempt under your theory?"
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3379.055,3385.976,"Justice Marshall, yes, because he is not imposing the security of the institution, he is merely providing the medical care."
1987.87-5096,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3395.349,3407.824,"Mr. Safron, if this litigation proceeds to a judgment against Dr. Atkins, will the state indemnify him?"
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3407.824,3421.399,"No, well, the reason we are here is because the statutes were amended permitting the attorney general to represent medical professionals when claims of civil rights violations arose."
1987.87-5096,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3421.399,3432.857,"The very fact that you are here out of the State Attorney General's Office on a special assignment perhaps almost indicates, doesn't it, a concession of state action under cover of state law?"
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3432.857,3433.308,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-5096,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3458.424,3461.059,"Well, why doesn't the doctor have his own counsel here instead of relying on the state?"
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3467.946,3476.885,"--No, Your Honor, we are just making sure that we can recruit physicians because when they are sued under color of state law they are on their own."
1987.87-5096,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3476.885,3479.587,Let me ask one irrelevant question before you sit down.
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3487.359,3498.584,"I, in seeing films of graduations of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, I have seen it being given."
1987.87-5096,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3498.584,3505.988,"I have, too, but I might say also that in many medical graduations the Hippocratic Oath is not administered."
1987.87-5096,1,32898,jacob_l_safron,,3505.988,3508.773,"I can't speak nationally, Your Honor."
1987.87-5096,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3508.773,3510.475,"Thank you, Mr. Safron."
1987.87-5096,2,16961,adam_stein,,3512.892,3516.045,"Thank you, Chief Justice."
1987.87-5096,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3538.042,3541.009,"Mr. Stein, you can't mean that."
1987.87-5096,2,16961,adam_stein,,3562.073,3563.942,"--No, because... for several reasons."
1987.87-5096,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3567.227,3573.815,"All right, so you don't mean that simply the denial of medical care is in itself cruel and unusual punishment."
1987.87-5096,2,16961,adam_stein,,3573.815,3574.481,In the prison.
1987.87-5096,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3574.481,3575.5,"Ah, in the prison context."
1987.87-5096,2,16961,adam_stein,,3575.5,3586.105,"Where the prison doctor has the power, as in this case, by withholding, by denying it himself, he is denying it altogether, which is not true in the free world."
1987.87-5096,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3586.105,3604.584,"So in the example I just gave you, if a doctor treated somebody in the general population and intentionally withheld care, that would not be an Eighth Amendment violation, but under the same general state Medicare scheme, if he treated a prisoner, that would be an Eighth Amendment violation, in the same office, the prisoner is brought to his office, he treats the same individual."
1987.87-5096,2,16961,adam_stein,,3612.69,3615.542,"Well, that is not this case but--"
