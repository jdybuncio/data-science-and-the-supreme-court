2013.12-820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.342,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-820, Lozano v. Alvarez."
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,8.732,14.012,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-820,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,54.432,77.437,"Mr. -- Mr. Regan, you -- you want us to apply equitable tolling in a field, family law, where the interest of the child is always of paramount importance and running all through family law is -- is that concern."
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,103.819,118.063,"Justice Ginsburg, we believe that equitable tolling does provide, within the context of the Convention, consideration -- the opportunity for courts to consider the interests of the child."
2013.12-820,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,165.045,167.076,Is that equitable discretion or is that still equitable tolling?
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,186.583,187.818,"--Thank you, Justice Kennedy."
2013.12-820,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,246.686,249.747,Where is Article 13 so we can look at it?
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,249.747,252.45,"I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?"
2013.12-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.45,253.543,Where is it in the materials?
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,253.543,255.496,Mendez v. Lynch.
2013.12-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,255.496,257.09,"Article 13, which you're referring to."
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,257.09,258.635,"Oh, Article 13."
2013.12-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,258.635,259.666,I'd like to read it.
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,259.666,260.432,I'm sorry.
2013.12-820,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,280.829,295.059,"And -- and it does provide -- just while people are looking at it, it does provide that, even though there's in your view equitable tolling, there are still circumstances in which the child would not go back if there's a grave -- grave risk?"
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,295.059,295.715,--Grave risk of harm.
2013.12-820,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,295.715,296.809,Grave risk of harm to the child.
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,296.809,300.572,--or if the court finds that it would be an intolerable situation.
2013.12-820,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,300.572,308.973,"But, again, as Justice Ginsburg questions, it seems to me indicates, there are two different axes here."
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,325.014,328.341,"I respect, Justice Kennedy, it's difficult to balance them."
2013.12-820,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,364.724,370.283,But that still -- but Article 13 still is different from what's in the best interest of the child.
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,370.283,371.768,--I think--
2013.12-820,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,371.768,383.668,"Now, it's true that all we're talking about is for the -- during the time in which the hearing takes place, but these hearings take years and expert witnesses are not available or readily available."
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,383.668,392.135,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, to your point about timing and essentially provisional return, I do think, you know, courts, district courts have shown great adeptness at dealing with those issues."
2013.12-820,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,400.086,400.508,Excuse me.
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,471.353,473.368,There is a significant difference.
2013.12-820,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,487.348,489.174,"Well, that's true."
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,514.821,524.769,"Justice Alito, I hope to make abundantly clear that our position, equitable tolling, would not mandate that that child be returned."
2013.12-820,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,526.988,527.69,"Well, how would it not?"
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,527.69,530.112,--It -- it changes the question that the court asks.
2013.12-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,550.602,560.489,"Well, which of the articles -- which of the provisions in Article 13 would -- would prevent the return in the hypothetical that Justice Alito just gave you?"
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,560.489,563.988,--Courts have looked at -- and I'll say it -- in the decades--
2013.12-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.988,567.597,"I mean, what -- what does Article 13 allow the court to consider?"
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,583.933,585.027,--That's known as acquiescence.
2013.12-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.027,592.15,--That wouldn't have -- or had consent to or -- that wouldn't apply in his hypothetical or in this case.
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,592.15,592.9,It's really B.
2013.12-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,592.9,593.572,B:
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,629.775,635.212,If I may explain by way of illustration in some of the cases what courts have looked at.
2013.12-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.539,676.945,Physical or psychological harm.
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,676.945,677.538,That's correct.
2013.12-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,679.679,694.891,"It might be now and then, but in the routine case that Justice Alito just gave you I don't see how there's any -- any reason at all not to get the child back from wherever he's been for 10 years."
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,694.891,698.451,If I may answer in two ways in the example Justice Alito gave.
2013.12-820,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,712.635,712.743,Which court?
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,713.821,714.633,United States court.
2013.12-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.633,722.708,"Yeah, but Article 13 does not say the child -- the child can state -- well, let's see."
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,731.157,734.936,That's been universally adopted by the courts hearing testimony.
2013.12-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,734.936,735.561,"So that's the one exception, yes."
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,735.561,743.512,"But -- but the grave risk exception, and courts have applied this, it really -- it really just -- it -- it changes the question, like in Cannon."
2013.12-820,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,743.512,749.009,--But in a sense what you're saying is that it's not an automatic -- it's not an automatic rule.
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,758.708,760.223,I understand that point.
2013.12-820,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,785.216,798.742,The Convention says in the preamble that the parties -- that's countries -- are firmly convinced that the interests of the children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody.
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,830.572,831.594,Okay.
2013.12-820,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,831.594,832.48,So we don't know.
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,890.222,892.173,I think we have a lot going for us.
2013.12-820,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,968.174,983.06,"Well, Mr. Regan, aside from the position of the United States, which -- which has changed, you made that point, the determination that's being made at this stage is really one of venue."
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,1043.975,1066.48,"I think, Justice Ginsburg, the domestic violence situation, which I am entirely sensitive to and appreciate, illustrates the difficulty of these cases and -- and that courts can't really figure out what's -- who's right or who did what in these circumstances."
2013.12-820,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1179.749,1185.372,"Mr. Regan, Justice Breyer pointed out that all other countries seem to disagree with you."
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,1196.852,1202.412,We believe that it's neither surprising nor momentous that foreign courts have failed to adopt equitable tolling.
2013.12-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.668,1223.528,But they may be wrong.
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,1243.474,1244.411,"--Not at all, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1299.827,1302.123,None of that is covered by the treaty.
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,1347.121,1364.863,"Our position is that if you look at the drafting history here, the drafting history was preliminary draft Article 11 provided for two periods: Automatic return, if you will, return subject to the Article 13 and 20 defenses if you file within 6 months; or for a period -- a discovery rule capped at one year if you didn't know the whereabouts of the child."
2013.12-820,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1411.932,1412.331,I'm sorry.
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,1474.099,1493.014,"--Justice Sotomayor, we believe that the State Department's reading of that history, of that drafting history, is oversimplified because there were objections to that period, to that -- to that discovery rule that weren't simply to a discovery rule as a general matter."
2013.12-820,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1511.82,1512.695,Don't use up your time.
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,1512.695,1513.88,--The jurisdiction convention is consistent with that idea.
2013.12-820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1513.88,1516.552,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-820,0,41934,shawn_p__regan,,1516.552,1517.395,I'd like to reserve my time.
2013.12-820,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1518.473,1525.658,Ms. Moskowitz.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,1525.658,1528.172,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court:"
2013.12-820,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1625.117,1645.953,"But what -- what troubles me about your position is that it undermines the best interests of children in a very powerful way insofar as it does not deter, and indeed encourages, provides a great incentive for parents to abduct their children."
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,1672.631,1679.36,"Your Honor, your concern is not wrong, but I think it's not founded on what -- what will happen here."
2013.12-820,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1688.388,1689.216,"Well, all right."
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,1725.358,1733.011,"A bit, Your Honor, and it's -- the abduction itself is the -- what triggers the Convention to begin with."
2013.12-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1753.208,1759.36,"I think they had it in mind, not just the interest of children, but the interest of parents."
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,1771.604,1773.448,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2013.12-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1773.448,1773.635,Parents have rights.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,1773.635,1774.431,Absolutely.
2013.12-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.431,1779.04,And that is one of the things that this treaty considers.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,1779.04,1785.508,"Your Honor, it does not consider ultimately the custody determination and with which parent the child should live."
2013.12-820,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1788.412,1797.423,"Well, it may be -- whether or not the child is settled in a particular case is certainly going to be a significant consideration in the custody determination, isn't it?"
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,1797.423,1799.111,"--Yes, Your Honor, I would presume so."
2013.12-820,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1822.086,1822.914,What's the fairness--
2013.12-820,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1822.914,1829.115,The problem is you're each -- you're each using the child as the tool in the objective that you have in representing the parents.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,1888.949,1889.808,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-820,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1909.723,1910.878,But that cuts against you in some respects.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,1923.811,1936.837,"No, Your Honor, because if the parent is concealing the child -- for example, if the parent is moving from place to place to evade detection or changing the child's name or not enrolling the child in school to avoid detection--"
2013.12-820,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1936.837,1940.585,"--My gosh, all it takes it moving to Peoria."
2013.12-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1949.144,1951.189,Justice Sotomayor is from New York.
2013.12-820,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1951.189,1952.346,"--Yes, obviously."
2013.12-820,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1954.408,1958.687,Those are us from the Midwest think it's actually easier to hide a child in New York.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,1959.921,1961.905,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-820,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1961.905,1963.2,I do have a point -- a question though.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,1994.375,1995.547,"Your Honor, I think--"
2013.12-820,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1995.547,2008.933,"What sense does it make when, as Justice Alito indicated, part of the central purposes of the Convention is to avoid the kidnapping of children?"
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2008.933,2019.116,"--Your Honor, absolutely, that is one of the objectives of the Convention, and it exists because that was presumed to be contrary to the interest of children."
2013.12-820,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2038.858,2042.513,So why isn't Article 13 enough protection?
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2053.135,2053.274,--Right.
2013.12-820,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2053.274,2053.977,The return.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2055.243,2056.32,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-820,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2090.025,2093.461,"Ms. Moskowitz, going back to Justice Alito's question."
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2117.077,2126.214,"Your Honor, I -- I -- that's the question of whether and to what extent there is discretion to return a child -- a settled child under Article 12."
2013.12-820,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2127.229,2128.04,Or under Article 18.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2128.04,2149.798,"--Your Honor, Article 18 -- my understanding of Article 18 and the government's interpretation of Article 18 is that Article 18 was designed not as a duty or something arising under the Convention, but a recognition that the Convention is not an exclusive statement and not intended to occupy the space on child abduction and return."
2013.12-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2149.798,2155.813,"I think your answer to Justice Kagan's question has to be no, or else I don't understand what we're doing here."
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2155.813,2161.277,"Your Honor, I struggle with this because I think that there is a reading of the plain language that says no."
2013.12-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2168.259,2169.368,"Well, what is the answer?"
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2204.107,2204.826,--Okay.
2013.12-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2204.826,2209.717,"But send the child back to London, he's going to be just about as settled."
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2238.907,2245.85,"Your Honor, in -- in that question, there's -- there's the question of what can they do under the Convention and what can they do."
2013.12-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2245.85,2247.242,"No, what can they do?"
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2254.417,2255.682,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2255.682,2258.588,And so now what can the judge do?
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2262.509,2276.738,"No, Your Honor, because a full-blown merits, best-interest-of-the-child analysis under the -- the custody-type family court proceeding that is envisioned to follow a return petition under the Convention will take all of those facts into account."
2013.12-820,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2276.738,2277.785,"No, but prior to that."
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2277.785,2277.971,Prior to.
2013.12-820,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2277.971,2285.344,"If you could go back to -- do you agree with Justice Scalia, that really, at that point, there's nothing to do?"
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2291.186,2305.477,"Your Honor, I think there is some discretion under Article 12 to return the settled child, but it cannot be under a set of facts that were completely within the minds of the drafters when they chose the one-year period."
2013.12-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2305.477,2307.446,But you say -- I don't understand what you're saying.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2308.007,2312.318,"Your Honor, it's hard to come up with a specific example, but there can't -- it can't be--"
2013.12-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2312.318,2314.253,You just don't want to say no.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2327.436,2334.831,"--Your Honor, the -- the exception to whether a child that is found to be settled after all the facts--"
2013.12-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2334.831,2335.221,Yes.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2335.221,2337.323,"--of concealment are taken to -- into account, there -- there should remain some discretion--"
2013.12-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.323,2340.713,"Under 13, right?"
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2342.851,2343.601,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-820,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2376.621,2379.837,"Well, you -- you're confusing me."
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2427.693,2429.193,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2447.056,2448.103,But can you give me any authority?
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2480.87,2481.48,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2481.48,2486.056,So I would have thought that that would have opened room for discretionary factors.
2013.12-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2500.847,2507.581,And I -- I assumed from your brief that that was not the reading you were giving it.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2523.713,2524.446,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.165,2525.712,"Oh, it is not."
2013.12-820,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2528.29,2531.321,"Well, if that's the case, if you're reading it that way -- I mean, I was reading it Justice Scalia's way, too."
2013.12-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2531.321,2533.131,Of course.
2013.12-820,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2533.131,2536.505,The first clause says shall and the second clause says shall not.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2548.89,2549.797,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2564.166,2566.54,"So I should read that case because the language says,"
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2580.143,2580.753,"Your Honor, I--"
2013.12-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2580.753,2588.078,And I say -- or you say I read that case in the House of Lords and I will discover it means you don't have to return it.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2588.078,2589.234,--That's the way the House of Lords interpreted it.
2013.12-820,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2589.234,2591.872,"And they relied on Article 18, didn't they?"
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2591.872,2593.169,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.231,2600.51,"Ms. Moskowitz, what do you do about Article 13 in that case, which begins:"
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2621.704,2622.485,Your Honor--
2013.12-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.485,2628.14,"I, frankly, didn't understand that that was your argument in this case and it -- it puts the whole case in a quite different light."
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2628.14,2634.558,"--Article 12, you are absolutely bound to return the child unless you meet one of these exceptions within the one year, forthwith return."
2013.12-820,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2641.041,2641.931,That's the one year.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2641.931,2642.477,--Correct.
2013.12-820,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2666.843,2669.906,In many cases this would be an example.
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2694.019,2700.782,"--Your Honor, I think those facts are exactly why the settled exception exists."
2013.12-820,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2706.218,2711.918,"In other words, settlement is a code word for saying ease of producing witnesses?"
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2711.918,2713.543,"--No, Your Honor, it's not."
2013.12-820,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2725.491,2741.392,"May I -- may I ask you, I think your brief -- I may not be remembering it correctly, but I think you -- you said no equitable tolling, and everybody in all the other countries agree on that."
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2749.42,2750.96,Your Honor--
2013.12-820,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2750.96,2751.45,"Briefly, please."
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2751.45,2751.94,--Thank you.
2013.12-820,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2772.144,2772.925,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-820,1,34843,lauren_moskowitz,,2772.925,2773.956,Thank you.
2013.12-820,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2773.956,2787.593,Ms. O'Connell.
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2787.593,2789.247,Mr. Chief Justice--
2013.12-820,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2789.247,2789.669,Justice Scalia.
2013.12-820,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2789.669,2805.209,"What's the government's position on -- on this question we've just been discussing, whether Article 12 is absolute or whether there is discretion even within Article 12, even though specific elements of discretion are contained in Article 13?"
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2805.209,2813.627,"--It's our position that under Article 12 there is discretion to return a settled child, and that that comes from Article 12 itself."
2013.12-820,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.41,2857.922,"Why doesn't the context include Section 13, which -- which lists specific reasons why you can depart from 12?"
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2867.513,2876.65,"Well, Article -- it's true that Articles 13 and 20 are written in expressly discretionary language, but those are sort of set out as exceptions to the rule of Article 12."
2013.12-820,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2884.365,2889.346,What's -- what's the -- an example of where a settled child might be returned?
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2901.42,2909.434,In exercising the discretion the court should be -- it's not just a free -- free-wheeling discretion that the court is exercising under Article 12.
2013.12-820,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2939.5,2950.151,"You would expect all the signatories to this treaty to come up with essentially the same exceptions, under -- under what you say is -- is the interpretation of Article 12?"
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2950.151,2951.463,Well--
2013.12-820,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2951.463,2958.21,"I mean, it seems to me it just makes that article impossible to apply consistently country to country."
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2958.21,2961.037,"--No, I don't think so."
2013.12-820,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.701,2983.482,Have they exercised it?
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2988.558,2989.636,--I mean--
2013.12-820,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2989.636,2995.541,Have they exercised that discretion not to apply the -- the mandatory requirement of Article 12?
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2995.541,2997.4,--Yes.
2013.12-820,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3001.555,3002.243,I'm talking about foreign courts.
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3002.243,3002.715,--have as well.
2013.12-820,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3003.446,3012.679,"If I understand the way you think this works, you don't -- there's not even a presumption that a settled child will stay, right?"
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3029.139,3053.755,"Well, I think the, the last part, Justice Kagan, is the most important part, that it has to be guided by the objectives of the treaty; that it's not a free-wheeling, best interests of the child analysis or where this child should be, but you could take into account the principle in Article 12 that it's harmful to uproot a settled child, but you can also weigh against that the idea that this Convention is really geared in the first place toward preventing abduction."
2013.12-820,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3053.755,3062.83,"I would think it would be very unusual for a family court in that situation not to go ahead with the custody proceeding before it, because it would think the child is settled."
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3071.622,3079.306,"Well, if there's -- if there's reason to send the child back, even -- even a settled child, we think that the purposes of the Convention should -- should prevail there."
2013.12-820,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3079.306,3085.304,"What kind of reasons, what kind of reasons would there -- would there be?"
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3085.304,3085.961,That the--
2013.12-820,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3085.961,3086.96,To send the child back?
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3086.96,3093.91,"--That the parent engaged in behavior like concealing the child that is -- that is not condoned under the Convention, that--"
2013.12-820,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3093.91,3095.737,So you would visit on the child the behavior of the parent?
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3095.737,3104.218,"--We think the court -- I mean, the court has discretion, we think, to order a child's returned even if she's settled."
2013.12-820,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3133.082,3145.779,"Counsel, whatever fears my colleagues have, I've only found two, or I should say my clerks have only found two, published decisions in which courts have returned the child."
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3166.083,3167.177,--That's -- that's right.
2013.12-820,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3170.472,3187.793,"And so if we're going to give uniform meaning, the uniform meaning of international weight is that abduction is one factor for a court to consider in its equitable weighing on settlement, because that's the whole purpose of the Convention."
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3190.245,3190.902,That's right.
2013.12-820,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3190.902,3191.824,But isn't there--
2013.12-820,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.824,3194.963,There's always -- isn't there always abduction?
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3208.77,3212.066,We understand that an abduction is going to take place in every case.
2013.12-820,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3223.342,3225.592,I don't know what sense -- I don't know what sense that makes.
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3250.003,3250.581,Well--
2013.12-820,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3250.581,3252.018,You don't need to do very much concealment.
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3261.046,3269.869,"--The first thing I'll point out is that Article 12, the drafters assumed that there was going to be some difficulty in locating children, and they decided on this one-year period."
2013.12-820,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3284.644,3287.909,How -- how would that be aid be invoked?
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3300.968,3313.479,"--Typically, the left-behind parent will approach the central authority in his or her own country, and typically with an idea of what the abducting parent's connections are to other countries."
2013.12-820,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3352.307,3364.287,How -- how separate are the two concepts of the well best interest of the child and the interest in policing parents so they don't abduct?
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3366.068,3370.675,"Well, I mean, we think -- the Convention starts with the presumption that a settled child should be returned."
2013.12-820,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3375.016,3378.281,"The child settled, that's when the abduction took place."
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3378.281,3379.437,--Excuse me?
2013.12-820,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3379.437,3382.858,You said it started that a settled child should be returned?
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3382.858,3386.201,That -- that an abducted child should be returned.
2013.12-820,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3386.201,3386.606,"Yes, abducted."
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3386.606,3395.524,"When the -- a determination that the child is settled can overcome that presumption, and then the other equitable factors, like concealment, come into play."
2013.12-820,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3395.524,3396.696,Justice Scalia?
2013.12-820,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3396.696,3398.008,"You know, I have one more question."
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3416.234,3417.062,No--
2013.12-820,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3417.062,3419.608,--and not apply the absolute rule where there's been concealment.
2013.12-820,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3423.184,3441.538,"--I think the positions are quite different, because under an equitable tolling analysis, putting aside that you may be able to satisfy a different Convention defense, like one under Article 13 or 20, under an equitable tolling analysis, the court would be prohibited from taking into account whether the child is settled in her new environment in determining whether to send her back."
2013.12-820,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3441.538,3443.175,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-820,3,41934,shawn_p__regan,,3447.486,3448.236,I would agree--
2013.12-820,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3448.236,3450.548,"That is, in fact, the central difference, isn't it?"
2013.12-820,3,41934,shawn_p__regan,,3450.548,3453.313,--I would agree with Ms. O'Connell that there is a difference.
2013.12-820,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3453.313,3455.203,"A huge one, whether the court can--"
2013.12-820,3,41934,shawn_p__regan,,3455.203,3460.22,The difference is not that a court cannot take the facts and circumstances of the child's life into account.
2013.12-820,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3495.687,3497.953,Are you -- can I ask you how it works here?
2013.12-820,3,41934,shawn_p__regan,,3557.367,3559.226,"Well, the custody proceeding would occur in a different court."
2013.12-820,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3560.522,3564.364,"No, it would go to the family court."
2013.12-820,3,41934,shawn_p__regan,,3568.801,3569.393,--Of course.
2013.12-820,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3569.727,3569.836,Okay.
2013.12-820,3,41934,shawn_p__regan,,3581.122,3582.372,Absolutely.
2013.12-820,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3582.372,3586.917,So the question is whether the custody hearing will be in a family court in Britain or whether it'll be in a family court in the United States.
2013.12-820,3,41934,shawn_p__regan,,3586.917,3589.166,That's right.
2013.12-820,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3589.166,3592.321,That's the correct question; is that right?
2013.12-820,3,41934,shawn_p__regan,,3592.321,3592.837,That is the question.
2013.12-820,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3594.618,3604.145,"So our issue about whether there's discretion or -- it's a little bit secondary because we can have a big, full-blown hearing about who should have custody, though, it will be in a different court."
2013.12-820,3,41934,shawn_p__regan,,3621.719,3623.89,"--And our concern here, Justice Breyer--"
2013.12-820,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3623.89,3624.546,All right.
2013.12-820,3,41934,shawn_p__regan,,3626.234,3628.357,"--Our concern is the deterrence and prevention, which is the goal of the Convention."
2013.12-820,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3753.336,3754.883,"Thank you, counsel."
