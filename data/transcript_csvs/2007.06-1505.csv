2007.06-1505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.638,"We'll hear argument next in Case 06-1505, Meacham versus Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory."
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,8.701,15.448,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents a single important but narrow question."
2007.06-1505,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,44.279,60.399,"Is there a hypothetical universe where a scheme that discriminates on the basis of age is reasonable, but there is another alternative that doesn't discriminate on the basis of age?"
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,68.191,81.359,"This Court made quite clear in City of Jackson that the existence of alternatives, while sufficient perhaps to satisfy Wards Cove and to show a violation under Section 4(a)(2), is not sufficient to show that the action is unreasonable."
2007.06-1505,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,100.054,109.643,"If that's true, then is it necessary either on the burden of production or burden of persuasion aspect of the case to consider other alternatives?"
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,109.643,113.501,--It is in our view necessary in order to decide whether there is a--
2007.06-1505,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,113.501,118.39,Why is it necessary in light of the answer you gave me at the outset?
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,118.39,122.373,--It is necessary in order to establish whether you even get to the RFOA provision.
2007.06-1505,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,123.232,124.42,Whether you even get to--
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,124.42,135.336,"--Even get to it, because by its terms the RFOA provision only applies to conduct that is otherwise prohibited by Section 4(a)(2), and the test for whether something is otherwise prohibited under Section 4(a)(2) is Wards Cove."
2007.06-1505,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,151.049,154.266,"Mr. Russell, this is the problem that I have with your double inquiry."
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,204.401,210.476,"Well, we think that the layering of the tests arises out of the structure of the statute as Congress wrote it."
2007.06-1505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,283.183,300.379,"Well, your friend, of course, makes the point that the age discrimination prohibition is narrower in scope than Title VII, that there are more likely to be instances in which a reasonable factor other than age came into play than there would be a basis for discrimination on the basis of race."
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,300.379,301.41,We acknowledge that.
2007.06-1505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,349.438,359.685,"Isn't it a strain to say that an employment practice was because of an individual's age, but at the same time was based on reasonable factors other than age?"
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,359.685,360.122,Well--
2007.06-1505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,360.122,365.119,Doesn't the latter negate the former or come very close to negating the former?
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,371.82,373.943,--I don't think it does.
2007.06-1505,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,524.805,533.051,"The expression comes from the Equal Pay Act, with a substitution."
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,571.457,576.658,"Well, certainly what you have to show before you get to the defense is different in the two statutes."
2007.06-1505,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,624.999,627.419,"--The burden of production, of course."
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,627.419,627.747,Yes.
2007.06-1505,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,627.747,630.215,And what about the burden of persuasion?
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,630.215,631.355,The burden of persuasion as well.
2007.06-1505,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,631.87,642.944,"Why is it that if the employer has the burden of production, and I assume that is satisfied by his saying, here's the plan that we used, here are the factors we used, here is the reason we used them."
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,654.424,658.454,"--Well, we think there are some difficulties, but it's ultimately I think beside the point."
2007.06-1505,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,668.059,669.293,"You think the statute doesn't make sense, so we don't--"
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,669.293,674.353,"--I think the statute makes perfect sense the way it's written, but if you disagree--"
2007.06-1505,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,674.353,684.568,"Your point that it's sandwiched between two things that are clearly affirmative defenses, BFOQ, the employer has the buried of production and persuasion."
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,686.473,687.645,--The foreign law exception.
2007.06-1505,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,687.645,691.738,--Is also an affirmative defense.
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,696.891,700.265,"Yes, we think it would be entirely odd for Congress--"
2007.06-1505,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,700.265,704.653,"--Well, I'm well aware of the statutory format here."
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,716.29,718.821,--I don't think it's beyond the employee's means.
2007.06-1505,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,752.807,764.223,"Well, if I find the text of the statute neutral or at least not clear, then it is proper for me to ask as a matter of efficiency where the burden should be placed, is it not?"
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,764.223,764.442,It is.
2007.06-1505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,770.627,774.798,"Well, but the facts... I mean, given discovery, that doesn't seem a very compelling case."
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,808.362,816.391,"Well, that's true in every case in which informational disadvantages are cited as a reason for putting the burden of proof on one party or the other."
2007.06-1505,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,832.79,836.806,But the argument was that EEOC never spoke to disparate impact?
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,836.806,869.962,"--Well, it's certainly clear that the EEOC... what their position is, and that they read their regulation as addressing disparate impact; and we think that, although it's an inartfully drafted regulation, by using the terms ""individual claim of discriminatory treatment"" rather than the term of art ""disparate treatment"", the language is broad enough to bear their reading, particularly when you see that it was enacted in the aftermath of a Department of Labor regulation that nobody disputes addresses disparate-impact cases, and it has no indication that they were disavowing that position."
2007.06-1505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,873.462,879.209,"In this area of the law, ""treatment"" and ""impact"" are words that have tremendously different meaning."
2007.06-1505,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,883.146,888.486,"--Well, I... I think that the terms of art are ""adverse impact"" and ""disparate treatment""."
2007.06-1505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,949.698,951.071,"Thank you, Counsel."
2007.06-1505,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,960.161,970.94,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted the ADEA against a settled background rule that defendants bear the burden of persuasion on affirmative defenses and other exceptions to liability."
2007.06-1505,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1028.777,1044.097,"I'm not sure that if the statute contains three different conditions, three different commands, that it follows that the procedural implementations for all of these has to be the same."
2007.06-1505,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1045.675,1047.472,--No.
2007.06-1505,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1055.593,1067.105,"If you want to say that Congress was well aware of burden of persuasion, burden of production problems with affirmative action, then they wouldn't have drafted it this way, that's one thing."
2007.06-1505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1069.837,1075.727,"I suppose you could appeal to the maxim noscitur ex sociis, couldn't you--"
2007.06-1505,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1075.727,1076.32,--Right.
2007.06-1505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.32,1080.661,"--and say if it's in with two other chickens, it's probably a chicken?"
2007.06-1505,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1080.661,1082.067,Exactly.
2007.06-1505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1088.705,1089.408,These are not words.
2007.06-1505,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1091.219,1092.094,--Right.
2007.06-1505,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1115.835,1116.24,Do you think that
2007.06-1505,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1135.983,1138.81,It modifies... it modifies something different.
2007.06-1505,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1242.207,1266.603,"The problem is that you would be making this provision more generous to the plaintiff than... for example, in Title VII the defense is business necessity; the employer has the burden of production; the employee has the burden of persuasion."
2007.06-1505,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1284.05,1285.409,I think... I think I understand the question.
2007.06-1505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1347.82,1353.257,"Counsel, I was surprised not to see Chevron cited in your brief."
2007.06-1505,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1357.083,1367.439,"Auer... in our view the regulation itself as far as it goes is entitled to Chevron deference, because it's a notice and comment rulemaking pursuant to delegated legislative authority."
2007.06-1505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1421.776,1422.011,I'm sorry.
2007.06-1505,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1430.928,1440.299,--My understanding of Auer deference is that the agency gets deference as the reasonable interpretation of its regulation.
2007.06-1505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1441.784,1444.783,We know what the regulation... we give it deference; we know what the regulation means.
2007.06-1505,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1451.638,1453.669,--It would get Chevron deference.
2007.06-1505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1505.602,1506.367,Why is it proving a negative?
2007.06-1505,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1513.363,1514.598,"--Right, and--"
2007.06-1505,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1514.598,1518.611,"Yes, and just adding on to the Chief Justice, it seems the employer is the one that would prove the negative."
2007.06-1505,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1523.267,1526.062,"--No, it's a very simple two-part test."
2007.06-1505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1563.624,1564.843,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1568.888,1578.071,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to make an argument both from elegance and from function and from structure."
2007.06-1505,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1736.087,1736.946,"Mr. Waxman, the first part--"
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1736.946,1738.351,--confession and avoidance defense.
2007.06-1505,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1738.351,1761.888,"--The way you phrased the first part, it sounded to me like you were going back to the interpretation that this Court rejected, that is, under the Age Discrimination Act there is only differential treatment, not neutral factor with a differential impact."
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1761.888,1762.997,"No, not at all."
2007.06-1505,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1915.638,1917.402,"Mr. Waxman, what do you do about the language ""otherwise prohibited""?"
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1917.402,1918.23,--Excuse me?
2007.06-1505,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.23,1921.136,What do you do about that language in the statute?
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1921.136,1923.431,May I just finish my sentence--
2007.06-1505,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1923.431,1923.697,Sure.
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1923.697,1926.477,"--Justice Stevens, and go right to ""otherwise prohibited""?"
2007.06-1505,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.88,1983.049,"Even that, there's a question about not merely statistical disparity, but a causal connection between an identified practice--"
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1983.049,1983.548,--Right.
2007.06-1505,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.548,1984.36,--in the disparity.
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1984.36,1985.767,That's exactly right.
2007.06-1505,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2118.072,2138.424,"Isn't it... isn't the... isn't the weak point in your argument the following: Your argument assumes that when the employer implicitly says I admit the allegations the complainant made, that the employer is admitting, in effect, to disparate treatment."
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2164.758,2165.146,--No.
2007.06-1505,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2190.168,2193.182,"In other words, for the purpose of discriminating against the old."
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2193.182,2194.837,--Whether it's--
2007.06-1505,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2194.837,2197.899,And that's... that's disparate treatment.
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2197.899,2198.368,"--Well, no."
2007.06-1505,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2247.786,2252.675,"Mr. Waxman, you have to keep in mind they are not just showing a disparate impact."
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2274.697,2278.571,"--No, well let... let me see if I can't address Justice Souter's point first."
2007.06-1505,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2316.15,2317.806,In an impact... no.
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2324.505,2325.817,Correct.
2007.06-1505,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2325.817,2331.988,And... and it seems to me that's all he has to admit in an impact case.
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2333.174,2340.172,"What he basically says is: I agree that age was the factor, but I have an excuse for it."
2007.06-1505,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2358.007,2362.224,But then he is not... he didn't do it to discriminate against old people.
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2365.082,2365.551,--That's correct.
2007.06-1505,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2404.379,2410.081,"--Well, then you're... then you're just saying that there... that there is no such thing as a disparate-impact case."
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2410.081,2410.799,--No.
2007.06-1505,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2410.799,2414.579,You're saying... you're saying that there's got to be a disparate-treatment case.
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2414.579,2415.188,"No, no; not at all."
2007.06-1505,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2415.188,2417.656,"Well, then I'm not following you."
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2417.656,2418.733,Let's take their... let's take their 50-pound hypothetical.
2007.06-1505,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2532.328,2538.372,"But you there agree that there is a distinction between ""business necessity"" and ""business reasonableness""?"
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2538.372,2539.434,--Yes.
2007.06-1505,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2736.729,2741.04,"Still, the numbers, the way it came out, are rather startling."
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2750.52,2751.286,That's correct.
2007.06-1505,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2813.37,2821.648,"But the terms ""flexibility"", ""criticality""... I mean the way you described it, it sounds very mechanical, mathematical."
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2827.568,2829.004,They definitely do.
2007.06-1505,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2907.567,2921.513,"Well, maybe because he thought that, given the subjectivity of some of these factors, that there was at least unconscious age bias in the decisions that were made."
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2921.513,2946.849,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, that is why... and it was testimony both from the employees in the case and from our uncross-examined expert and even their expert... the review board... the company set up a central review board which was trained and which examined every single manager about every single decision, whether you call it subjective or objective."
2007.06-1505,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3017.821,3030.097,"--Counsel, is your recent discussion about what happened here go simply to, I guess, your alternative argument, that we should affirm because you're right, regardless of who bears the burden; or does it really go to the legal question before us?"
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3030.097,3031.752,"Well, I think it goes to both."
2007.06-1505,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3048.917,3052.775,Here we have a jury verdict that was affirmed by the court of appeals.
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3052.775,3054.696,"--Well, we have a jury verdict."
2007.06-1505,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3116.764,3120.622,But that was taken out of it by Judge Jacobs when he redid it.
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3127.417,3139.692,"What Judge Jacobs said is the case was tried under business necessity, under which the plaintiffs at least had to prove that there was some other way that the company could equally have achieved its objectives."
2007.06-1505,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3139.692,3145.659,"Well, wasn't the issue of reasonable factor under age tried in the trial court when the case was tried?"
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3145.659,3168.728,"No, because the EEOC regulation at the time, regulation (d), which deals with disparate-impact cases, said that reasonable... the reasonable factors other than age provision is proven by, and only by, the business-necessity defense, a defense as to which the plaintiffs bear the burden."
2007.06-1505,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3196.747,3197.013,Is that--
2007.06-1505,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3197.013,3202.901,Am I correct to understand that your trial counsel then took the position you must prove business necessity?
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3209.96,3218.098,"Well, no, we took the position that reasonable factors other than age was a separate test and was a separate defense."
2007.06-1505,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3218.098,3218.317,Right.
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3218.317,3223.409,The judge instructed the jury to the contrary and said under Wards Cove--
2007.06-1505,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3223.409,3225.142,"--Was Judge Pooler wrong, then?"
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3233.981,3240.682,"--Well, what happened was... I mean, Judge Pooler is wrong in certain respects, but not that respect."
2007.06-1505,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3258.051,3260.643,The jury didn't hear a word about reasonable factors other than age.
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3263.003,3263.501,--That's correct.
2007.06-1505,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3284.104,3288.18,"As everybody now knows, that was wrong."
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3288.18,3288.789,--That's correct.
2007.06-1505,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3338.206,3340.581,But did you plead this as an affirmative defense?
2007.06-1505,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3343.409,3351.013,"--We pleaded it as a... I can't bring the complaint to mind, but we pleaded it as a separately specified defense, yes."
2007.06-1505,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3375.145,3376.145,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-1505,3,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3379.175,3401.04,"I'd like to begin by addressing the general legal question that the Court granted cert on, and particularly going back to this idea, this assertion that the proof of the RFOA is somehow a negation of the obligation that the plaintiff has to prove that they have suffered a disparate impact because of age."
2007.06-1505,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3429.496,3439.525,"Well, the practice... if a practice correlates with a number of... statistically correlates with a number of different factors, is it because of all of those factors?"
2007.06-1505,3,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3439.525,3454.613,"I think, under Wards Cove, this Court has said that it does, and so under Wards Cove you establish that the discrimination is felt by older workers because of age by showing that all the workers as a group suffer disproportionately from it."
2007.06-1505,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3454.613,3460.704,"Wards Cove, in other words, says ""because"" may mean ""correlation"" and it mean ""purpose"", either one."
2007.06-1505,3,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3460.704,3462.0,Yes.
2007.06-1505,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3462.297,3462.688,Yes.
2007.06-1505,3,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3462.688,3469.575,--But I think all you have to show under 4(a)(2) is that the practice tends to disadvantage older workers because of their age.
2007.06-1505,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3546.403,3551.478,"Well, if he put in all the evidence he's described, that would not have proven business necessity."
2007.06-1505,3,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3554.775,3559.133,"It may have been relevant to reasonableness, but that's not why it was put in."
2007.06-1505,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3560.147,3565.412,Was he arguing that it was necessary to follow this one downsizing practice?
2007.06-1505,3,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3565.412,3573.658,"--They certainly, I think... they used that argument to show that they had a business justification and to try to rebut our showing of alternative, equally effective practices."
2007.06-1505,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3592.118,3597.46,"And just one other detail, Did... the district judge not instruct the jury on this defense?"
2007.06-1505,3,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3597.46,3598.756,It did not.
2007.06-1505,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3598.756,3599.491,It did not?
2007.06-1505,3,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3599.491,3604.426,"The only instruction was that we'd be entitled to prevail if we showed Wards Cove, and its--"
2007.06-1505,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3604.426,3610.923,"You have an unusual case where the decisive issue, at least when you get to this Court, is something the jury never passed on."
2007.06-1505,3,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3610.923,3612.673,"--Well, I think that's right."
2007.06-1505,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3642.724,3643.615,"Thank you, counsel."
