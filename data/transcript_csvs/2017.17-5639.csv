2017.17-5639,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.055,8.065,"We'll hear argument next today in Case 17-5639, Chavez-Meza versus United States. Mr. Coberly."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,8.065,13.15,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Judicial discretion is not a whim."
2017.17-5639,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,61.255,65.5,I -- I suppose you're not arguing that that's true in every case.
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,74.775,77.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, we do believe that it would be enough."
2017.17-5639,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,90.1,98.95,What is the standard of review that the court of appeals uses for sentence -- for sentences?
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,98.95,106.56,"Justice Ginsburg, it -- it's -- it's reasonableness, which this Court understands in the original sentencing context to mean --"
2017.17-5639,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,106.56,114.385,"I thought that what -- doesn't the statute say, 3742, ""imposed in violation of law""?"
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,114.385,115.29,It --
2017.17-5639,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,115.29,119.29,The question is whether the sentence is imposed in violation of law?
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,119.29,120.26,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,144.33,162.35,"But how could that be if the -- the district court sentenced within -- within the guidelines? It wasn't the same range, and it wasn't the same point within the guidelines as the original sentence, but it was still within the guidelines."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,168.04,181.9,"Well, I think that's the government's position, which is, well, in a sentence reduction, when it's reduced and it falls within the guidelines, the government's position, as I understand it, is essentially that that decision is unreviewable."
2017.17-5639,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,204.995,211.745,How much of an explanation would -- would be required? Let's say -- and take this very case.
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,215.395,232.84,"Your Honor, we believe what would have sufficed -- I don't want to prejudge the case and tell the district court -- I don't want to presume what the district court was thinking, because that's the whole point, is we simply don't know. And so what we're asking is -- is for the Court to apply the rule it has already applied in Rita and Gall."
2017.17-5639,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,239.26,250.28,"Suppose a case, not this case, suppose a case where the judge sentenced to the middle of the guideline -- or the old guideline range; then the new guideline range comes out and he does the middle of that. Explanation required?"
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,250.28,256.85,"In a -- in a typical case, Your Honor, I think in that situation, that would be what we're calling a proportional reduction."
2017.17-5639,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,286.96,289.845,And there are tens of thousands of these hearings a year?
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,289.845,290.6,Well --
2017.17-5639,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,290.6,292.795,"Of course, it depends on when the guidelines are changed, but --"
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,292.795,302.005,"Exactly, Your Honor. And -- and I believe the Sentencing Commission estimated that there -- that this particular amendment, 782, affected over 46,000 prisoners."
2017.17-5639,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,302.005,310.08,"Does that -- should that be a factor in our decision; i.e., the obvious workload on the federal courts?"
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,310.08,311.87,"Well, Your Honor, I think it --"
2017.17-5639,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,311.87,313.3,Or is that something we don't consider?
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,313.3,317.485,"Well, I think it's certainly something you -- you can consider and I would ask the Court to consider this."
2017.17-5639,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,349.15,353.6,I don't quite understand in practical terms -- excuse me -- what that would mean.
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,375.43499995,379.12,"It so -- it so much depends on context, Justice Alito."
2017.17-5639,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,393.09,401.145,"Let me just tell you, given the workload numbers you've just cited and your answer to Justice Alito, I'm becoming less convinced of your case."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,401.145,423.69,"Justice Kennedy, we -- our concern is that a simple check -- let's -- let's say, for instance, the AO-247 form, which we -- which we think is perfectly fine, had a -- had a -- had a checklist of the 353(a) factors and all that was required was a judge to check a box that he considered -- he or she considered those factors."
2017.17-5639,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,427.52,430.41,"I'm sorry, I just don't understand what ""minimal"" means."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,455.525,459.15,"And that's why I think, I mean, just a few words can matter, Justice Sotomayor."
2017.17-5639,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,459.15,461.025,But you said to Justice Alito no.
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,461.025,461.58,Well --
2017.17-5639,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,461.58,486.94,"I'm asking -- that -- that's shocking to me, to be frank with you, because that answer would mean that the judge not only has to say that the crime was serious, what you did was serious, but I think 108 is not enough because it's the bottom of the guideline range; I don't think the guideline range should control. I mean, what more of an explanation does a judge have to do than to say it was a serious crime, 114 is the right amount?"
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,486.94,492.94,I think just some indication that the judge actually had considered that particular crime.
2017.17-5639,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,501.09,509.29,I'm afraid that -- you keep answering -- you're creating a rule that makes it impossible for district court judges to do anything but what you want.
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,509.29,512.0,"And I certainly -- I certainly don't want that, Justice Sotomayor."
2017.17-5639,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,512.0,513.72,"Well, but that's where it's coming."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,553.75,578.265,"Your Honor, if -- if the district court judge in this particular case had said something to that effect of: I've looked at this case again, and considering the seriousness of the drug trafficking, and tied it specifically -- just said a word that -- that made it clear that that was tied specifically to that case, and I remain convinced that 114 months is reasonable, I think, in that situation, that would be plenty."
2017.17-5639,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,578.265,604.92,"Since the guidelines are advisory, what would make it improper for the judge to say, I don't care what the guidelines say, I think trafficking of this type is serious, and I think that 114 months is the right amount for -- for the seriousness of the crime and the deterrence. How could you appeal that?"
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,604.92,608.27,"I don't -- we would have a tough time appealing that, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,610.98,625.29,I guess my -- I -- I have a great deal of understanding that having the judge say something makes sentencing appear to the public as being less than arbitrary.
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,659.405,661.96,"I think there is a difference, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,680.48,681.4,"Go ahead, please."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,681.4,683.87,It is not -- we're not asking for much.
2017.17-5639,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,703.94,704.06,So if --
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,704.06,717.3,"And, Justice Sotomayor, like you -- like you just said, the need to assure the public that our -- our judiciary is acting on -- on -- with sound legal principles in applying the law and not making arbitrary decisions."
2017.17-5639,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,718.76,721.815,What if he just says same -- same reasons as before?
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,721.815,722.52,Mr. Chief --
2017.17-5639,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,722.52,734.55,"Before he's done a fairly, you know, the usual, what's required under 3553, and those are the same -- what he's saying, those are the same things that is -- that are motivating him in this new context, same reasons as before?"
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,734.55,758.89,"Well, I think, in this particular case, Mr. Chief Justice, if -- if the judge had said that, that would pose a problem because, in -- in this particular case, tied back to the original sentence, it was clear that the district court judge had -- had tied his sentence and adopted the reasoning of the Sentencing Commission. And he sentenced at the bottom of the guidelines."
2017.17-5639,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,773.41,779.93,"So you'd be fine? I mean, that gives you -- you say that would give you the grounds you want to present on appeal, just as you've articulated here."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,781.895,795.04,"I -- I think -- right. And we have to -- I have to remember -- we have to remember that we're talking here just about the -- a procedural component, and that is simply an explanation to get us to understand the judge's reasoning."
2017.17-5639,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,803.91,810.49,"One aspect of this case, it strikes me as curious."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,841.31,850.33,"Justice Ginsburg, we -- there -- there's no -- there's no specific rule in the Rules of Criminal Procedure that allows for that."
2017.17-5639,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,968.69,985.015,"Why would this preclude appellate review? Isn't it pretty obvious what -- or couldn't the court of appeals infer that what the district court did was this: The district court originally thought 135 months was the right sentence -- that was the original sentence, right, 135?"
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,985.015,986.04,"Yes, Justice Alito."
2017.17-5639,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,986.04,986.22,All right.
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1013.50499995,1020.92,"I don't think in that particular case, Justice Alito, that would necessarily be sufficient because it just says in my opinion."
2017.17-5639,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1028.875,1037.99,"Well, why doesn't it tie it to the 3553(a) factors? There's nothing -- there isn't an algorithm that tells you how to put those factors together or to quantify each one."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1046.605,1062.64,"And all we're asking for, Justice Alito, is just a little bit following that, which is why the judge thinks that's the right number, not merely the fact that, yes, I considered the factors and this is the number I come up with, but just something to indicate why, just some --"
2017.17-5639,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1062.64,1065.49,I think you'd be -- I think you'd be better off with the other rule.
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1093.405,1101.83,"And that's exactly the position we're in, because there was nothing in the record and we felt like we had a strong case on appeal to say at least give us something."
2017.17-5639,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1107.7,1130.57,"Yeah, but it depends on the -- the range of the departure. In other words, if whatever you think is what it should look like or the norm, you mention in your brief an argument about where you thought it should be proportionately, and if it's out of whack, and nothing is said, it seems to me you have a stronger case than what you've suggested is what -- you -- you lose if he puts in just a few words that shows that he considered the pertinent factors."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1130.57,1154.79,"Well, the concern here is -- is ultimately with ensuring the integrity of the process, Your Honor, and making sure that -- that there was some reason that was given. And -- and when -- when there is no reason given, it -- the public and, frankly, my client lacks confidence that that decision was actually made on a sound basis of law as opposed to --"
2017.17-5639,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1154.79,1157.43,"Well, what is he supposed to say? He did give reasons."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1182.49,1184.92,"Well, Your Honor, we -- we disagree that that's actually a reason."
2017.17-5639,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1184.92,1185.35,"No, no."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1187.9,1221.84,"What else he -- we believe he is supposed to say is because -- because of the particular nature of the crime here that Mr. -- I don't want to tie it to this particular defendant -- but the defendant was involved in drug trafficking, there has been cases where the -- where -- similar to ours, they've been remanded back, the district court provides a simple sentence, such as given this defendant's recidivism and his wrapping up two -- two young innocent women in this crime, I find that this --"
2017.17-5639,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1221.84,1224.27,So we have in the record what -- what he did.
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1240.8,1245.07,"Something, Your Honor, that -- that ties it as to why they think it's appropriate."
2017.17-5639,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1245.07,1245.82,"Well, then I don't know why."
2017.17-5639,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1245.82,1246.2,"Well, isn't --"
2017.17-5639,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1246.2,1248.23,"They say, I -- I've seen a lot of cases."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1263.24000005,1269.16,How he or she can actually considered the 3553 --
2017.17-5639,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1269.16,1271.11,"He says, I considered it."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1277.47,1281.11,Something tied to the particular facts of the case.
2017.17-5639,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1281.11,1290.635,"So is what you're saying, Mr. Coberly, essentially that the judge should say any lower sentence would not meet the seriousness of this crime?"
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1290.635,1304.07,"I mean, I think that would be helpful, Justice Kagan, but I'm not sure that that actually -- those words either would actually get to our point, which is that there needs to be something that the public can be confident that the judge actually considered this particular case."
2017.17-5639,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1304.07,1306.015,"Well, that -- that's this crime."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1315.97,1318.12,"That would be a close call, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1327.79,1329.6,I don't understand why that would be a close call.
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1351.855,1364.23,Something about the seriousness of the crime tied to the particular facts of that crime to ensure that the judge is actually considering and making a reasoned decision based on --
2017.17-5639,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1364.23,1373.14,You -- you seem to be having some kind of a presumption that the reduction should be proportional.
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1384.755,1393.93,"Thank you, Justice Ginsburg. Our -- our argument regarding proportionality, we're not arguing -- I want to make clear -- we're not arguing that there should be a proportionality."
2017.17-5639,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1441.56,1448.365,"What if it was the -- I think a lot of your objection, right, and a lot of the appeal of your objection is the boilerplate language."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1487.07500005,1490.96,"I think the -- I think, Your Honor, that we would have the same problem."
2017.17-5639,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1504.355,1509.42,"Like what? You -- you've had a lot of experience probably with sentencing cases, much more than I have."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1529.45,1538.355,"They say, Justice Breyer, similar -- I mean, at an original sentencing, there's arguments typically presented by both sides as to a particular sentence."
2017.17-5639,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1565.575,1566.485,"Thank you, counsel."
2017.17-5639,0,62980,todd_a_coberly,,1566.485,1572.55999995,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1572.55999995,1576.12499995,General Rosenstein.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1576.12499995,1594.445,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three reasons why this Court should uphold the district court's discretionary decision to grant a sentencing reduction and to impose a new sentence in the bottom quartile of the applicable sentencing guideline range. The first reason is about judicial integrity."
2017.17-5639,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1636.32,1636.85,What if they --
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1636.85,1637.36,"General, can --"
2017.17-5639,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1637.36,1652.575,"-- a judge is -- has had, you know, 600 of these resentencings, every time just checks the box, 600, he's done nothing but check the box, and the results are a little off; sometimes it's high, sometimes it's low; you can't really tell why? Do you have the same position?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1652.575,1658.175,"Your Honor, we -- we believe that the premise there that the district court is merely checking a box is a mistake."
2017.17-5639,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1667.83,1676.7,"Even if it's -- even if he's done it 600 times, never done anything but check the box, you still presume that he's giving the careful consideration in each of those cases?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1676.7,1690.625,"Well, in no case, Your Honor, is the court merely checking a box. The court is checking a box indicating whether it's granting or denying the motion, but then it's actually required to compute the guideline range and then select a new sentence. And so it's not merely a matter of checking a box."
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1695.37,1713.785,"General, do you have a different position with respect to a denial of a motion for a reduction? If a judge just says sign this form and -- but denied the reduction, would you hold the same position?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1713.785,1721.35,"Your Honor, there have been different variations of this form. The form that's used in this case, we believe, would clearly suffice because the form --"
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1721.35,1721.86,"No, no, no."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1723.47,1723.95,Yes.
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1723.95,1731.0,"The judge denied -- basically denies -- after looking at everything, I deny this motion for reduction."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1731.0,1732.99,With or without --
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1732.99,1738.115,Does that permit intelligent appellate review?
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1738.115,1753.36,"Your Honor, if the court had completed the form and checked the box indicating it had denied the motion, the court would have certified by signing that form that the court had gone through the appropriate considerations, that is, they considered the 3553(a) factors and considered the policy statement."
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1753.36,1776.68,So how about if a judge in the original sentence gives the low end of the guideline but in the -- in the revised reduction gives above the original guideline but below the sentence he gave now? Would that require more of an explanation than signing this form?
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1776.68,1796.08,"No, Your Honor, we don't believe it would, because that would be a lawful sentence within the guideline range specified by the Commission and would reflect, as this Court said in Rita, the presumption -- pardon me -- that in a typical case the court has determined -- essentially has adopted the reasoning of the Commission and has done what the judge is supposed to do."
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1796.08,1860.57999995,"The one thing I hate about absolute rules in this area, dislike intensely, is that why shouldn't we trust the court of appeals to determine how much information it needs or doesn't need to give meaningful appellate review? Some courts have said if you refuse to depart completely, you should explain why. Others have said but if you don't and you pick a sentence within the guidelines, we will infer that you've said enough if you signed the form. Others have said you should always give a little bit more. Another character -- category of court of appeals have done what the Tenth Circuit has done, but I think there's only two that have done what the Tenth Circuit has said. Why isn't it always up to the court of appeals to determine how much it needs to determine whether adequate review can be given?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1860.57999995,1878.77,"Well, Your Honor, the -- this Court in Gall indicated that with regard at least to departures, courts of appeals may, but are not required, to impose a presumption of -- of reasonableness. But with regard to the issue of what the court of appeals is required to do, I think, Your Honor, you're correct."
2017.17-5639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1883.49,1889.6,"Look -- looking at this record, do you know why the district judge did what he did?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1889.6,1890.19,I believe we --
2017.17-5639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1890.19,1895.475,And -- and do I know -- I'm not sure why the district judge did what he did.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1896.61,1904.19,"Justice Kennedy, I believe we know just as well following the sentence reduction motion as we did following the original sentencing."
2017.17-5639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1926.22,1933.64,"Well, do -- do you think that in that original sentence it was because it was -- the sentence was at a particular place in the guidelines, i.e., the low end?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1933.64,1934.96,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe so."
2017.17-5639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1957.57,1959.19,But that's -- that's true in every case.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1959.19,1959.32,Sure.
2017.17-5639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1959.32,1969.15,"But why this number? Why wasn't -- why wasn't this -- if -- if he'd have done at the low end of the new revised guideline range, that would have been okay, wouldn't it?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1969.15,1969.79,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1969.79,1970.995,Without any explanation?
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1970.995,1971.8,Correct.
2017.17-5639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1971.8,1975.12,"Well, then why isn't an explanation required here when he does something different?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,1975.12,1976.91,"Because of the background rule, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1998.56,1998.94,Can you explain --
2017.17-5639,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1998.94,2038.36,"I guess I'm finding it a little bit hard, Mr. Rosenstein, to understand your understanding of the background rule, because my understanding of the background rule comes from Taylor, where it said: ""Where, as here, Congress has declared that a decision will be governed by consideration of particular factors, a district court must carefully consider those factors as applied to the particular case, and whatever its decision, and clearly articulate their effect in order to permit meaningful appellate review."" So we're in one of these ""where, as here"" situations where Congress has declared that a decision is going to be governed by consideration of particular factors."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2064.185,2069.69,"Your Honor, we respectfully submit that Taylor does not apply in the context of sentencing."
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2090.99,2094.74,"You did at the beginning -- I mean, there is something I don't understand about this."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2159.815,2160.565,Correct.
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2160.565,2162.635,But it does say it at the beginning.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2170.38,2170.74,Yes.
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2170.74,2182.16,"I want to know how it works and, after all, if that's the rule, if I'm right that that is the rule, how do they do it, and shouldn't you have whatever they have to do there the same here?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2182.16,2187.39,"No, Your Honor. Respectfully, the -- the background rule that I refer to is the rule in the absence of any statutory --"
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2187.39,2188.43,"Well, here is a statute."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2214.15,2214.44,Yes --
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2214.44,2215.42,-- response? What is the response?
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2215.42,2220.25,"-- Justice Breyer. And the answer to that, Justice Breyer, is that with regard to sentences that are governed by 3553(c) --"
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2220.25,2220.565,Yeah.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2220.565,2223.51,-- there are actually three levels of explanatory requirements.
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2226.95,2227.08,Yeah.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2228.015,2232.81,The second is for a sentence with a range above 24 months --
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2232.81,2233.305,That's right.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2233.305,2236.34,"-- you provide a reason for a particular point in the range, as you articulated."
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2236.34,2236.43,Yes.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2236.43,2238.32,And the third is for a sentence outside the guideline.
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2238.32,2241.57,"Yeah, yeah, right. I'm only interested in the particular point within the range."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2241.57,2241.93,Correct.
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2277.78,2278.85,"Yeah, but I guess that's peculiar."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2298.35,2305.59,"And the reason -- the answer, Your Honor, as articulated by this Court in Dillon, is that we are not at a formal resentencing proceeding here."
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2324.995,2351.87,"So assume there wasn't a form and that the judge's real reason was that he thinks blacks who commit this kind of crime should be punished severely. How are we supposed to know or check, or the public know or check, that racism didn't play a part in this? I'm not assuming that any judge would do this, but I'm assuming --"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2351.87,2352.35,Yes.
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2352.35,2359.51,-- some impermissible motive is -- is at play.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2368.815,2371.26,"And, Your Honor, I would give two answers to that."
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2392.24,2399.75,"But if you know no reason, which is what Justice Kennedy started with, we don't really know why he picked 114."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2399.75,2414.49,"Well, we submit, Your Honor, that you do know enough, just as in any ordinary original sentencing under Rita, you know that the court was familiar with the facts and circumstances of the crime, you know that the court evaluated the 3553(a) factors and the policy statements."
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2422.5,2425.71,So -- so let's do a different hypothetical.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2463.535,2466.895,"In your hypothetical, Justice Sotomayor, the court has articulated that reason?"
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2466.895,2467.495,Yes.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2467.495,2467.83,Yes.
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2468.27,2470.52,But what -- how do we know if they don't articulate --
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2470.52,2470.65,Right.
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2470.65,2477.48,"-- their reason for doing something, that they're not -- that it's not based on an erroneous factual basis?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2477.48,2482.62,"So, once again, we can't deal with what the court doesn't say, but if the court did express --"
2017.17-5639,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2482.62,2504.645,"No, but we should. I mean, when we're making a rule that says you never have to, as the Tenth Circuit has indicated, then we don't know if an impermissible factual or legal basis motivated the judge. And with factual, it's not intentional; it's just wrong."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2504.645,2515.825,"If there were any evidence in the record, Justice Sotomayor, to indicate that such an error had been made, the defendant would be permitted on appeal to argue procedural unreasonableness, just as this Court contemplated in Gall."
2017.17-5639,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2515.825,2516.6,If there were -- if your --
2017.17-5639,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2516.6,2518.27,Can I go back --
2017.17-5639,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2518.27,2525.375,"If your position prevails, why would any district judge ever say anything about why he -- his position on resentencing?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2525.375,2531.91,"We -- we don't presume, Your Honor, the district courts are motivated solely by the desire to be -- to avoid appellate review."
2017.17-5639,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2531.91,2532.23,Well --
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2532.23,2558.66,"I believe a district court, as -- as was contemplated in the Rita opinion, it depends on the circumstances. The district court can make its judgment whether or not it believes that the facts are such that it merits a more detailed opinion, but if it's a routine, typical, run-of-the-mill case, as this one was, and the court looked to the original sentencing, where it had said very little, we believe it's appropriate under these circumstances for the court to impose the appropriate sentence and simply say it had considered the factors."
2017.17-5639,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2558.66,2566.45,"Well, a judge who -- under what circumstances was a judge -- would a judge who did just that be subject to reversal?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2566.45,2568.15,"It would depend upon the record, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2582.25,2589.315,"Well, like -- like what? I'm -- I'm saying the judge doesn't say anything, and you say the presumption is that he adequately considered all of the factors and all that."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2589.315,2589.54,Correct.
2017.17-5639,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2589.54,2594.755,What type of evidence in the record would suggest that that wasn't the case?
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2594.755,2601.16,"Well, if you're talking only about procedural reasonableness, as we're talking about here, you look to whether the guidelines were properly considered."
2017.17-5639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2611.815,2622.18,"So, as -- as I understand it in this case, let's say there -- there are any number of choices, but let's say there are three choices: One, the judge has kept the original sentence."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2640.05999995,2643.13,"Any one of those is okay, Your Honor, as long as there's no --"
2017.17-5639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2643.13,2645.08,No reasons required?
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2645.08,2646.76,"Well, the reasons are required."
2017.17-5639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2657.86,2670.06,"But in -- in -- in all of the circumstances on the revised -- after the sentencing guidelines had been revised, in my three alternatives, in -- in none of those cases is any reason required?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2670.06,2675.02,"In -- in all cases, the court is required to have reasons, premised on the --"
2017.17-5639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2675.02,2681.63,"The statement -- in none of those cases need the court state his reasons, under your view, for the resentencing?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2681.63,2687.7,In none of those cases would it be required to cite a specific reason for a sentence within the guideline range.
2017.17-5639,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2689.09,2700.63,"And your -- your understanding where -- the language that I read you in Taylor where it said that there is some necessity to state some amount of reasoning, what do you think that that applies to?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2700.63,2705.91,"Your Honor -- Your Honor, we believe that the Taylor case is not generalizable."
2017.17-5639,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2714.16,2721.095,"Well, is Taylor just about the statute? In Taylor, is that all it's about? Because, certainly, Taylor seemed to suggest a broader rule."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2737.89,2750.46,"So we believe, Your Honor -- and there are two answers to that. The first is that if you look to the concluding paragraph in the Taylor opinion, the Court indicated that the trial court in that case relied on factors that were unsupported by the record."
2017.17-5639,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2774.12,2797.48,"There's a -- there's another statutory section, which is 3583(e), which directs courts to consider the 3553(a) factors, those -- these same factors that are involved in this case, when terminating periods of supervised release. Do you think a judge can terminate a period of -- of supervised release and send somebody back to prison without any statement of reasons?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2797.48,2803.78,"Your Honor, hypothetically, the court would be permitted to do that only if the record were sufficient --"
2017.17-5639,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2803.78,2804.7,I'm sorry. Hypothetically what?
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2804.7,2811.3,"Well, in some cases, Your Honor, the record might be clear as to what the basis was, but certainly there would have to be a basis for the court to make that decision."
2017.17-5639,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2811.3,2811.95,"Well, a basis."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2818.73,2821.48,"Your Honor, I don't have the language in front of me."
2017.17-5639,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2822.01,2824.13,It doesn't say anything about explanation.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2825.66,2825.75,Right.
2017.17-5639,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2825.75,2830.8,It basically says you have to consider the 3553(a) factors.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2837.6,2837.74,Yes.
2017.17-5639,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2837.74,2843.085,"-- of course, before you send somebody back to prison like that, you have to at least say something."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2843.97,2844.33,Yes.
2017.17-5639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2859.495,2860.05,Can you tell us --
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2860.05,2860.76,So can we do this -- can we do --
2017.17-5639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2860.76,2870.585,"-- a little something about the form? What -- what was the genesis of that, this Administrative Office Form, what, AO-247?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2870.585,2871.27,"Correct, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2871.27,2873.82,How did that come to -- to be?
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2873.82,2897.33,"My understanding, Your Honor, is that form was developed by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, along with input from the Sentencing Commission, in order to expedite these proceedings and ensure that appropriate information was reflected in the record. Interestingly, Your Honor, the original version of the form, I believe from 2008, did not include the language clarifying that the court had considered the 3553(a) factors and the policy statement. In fact --"
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2897.33,2897.5,All right.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2897.56,2899.5,-- one of the lower court opinions -- pardon me?
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2899.5,2902.23,I just want to go back for a second to Taylor.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2983.49,2984.19,"No, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2987.31,2988.49,"Well, I hope it was consistent."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,2996.665,2997.37,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3024.6,3050.205,"Well, that's true, but this case involves what the Petitioner calls a disproportionality; that at the first instance you got the low end of the range and at the second instance, you're no longer at the low end of the range. And so the question that Rita raises is, in a case like that, is something a little bit more required, so that the judge says, you know what, I don't want to be at the low end of the range in -- in -- given this new range, because of the seriousness of the offense."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,3066.16,3067.19,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3086.2,3088.505,"Well, it raises a question, don't you think?"
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,3088.505,3089.94,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3104.89,3105.53,Quite right.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,3132.39,3134.0,"Correct, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3134.0,3148.835,It just seems a -- it's a minor requirement but one that seems as though it would help the appellate court quite a lot to know why the judge had chosen a sentence that was no longer at the low end of the range.
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,3148.835,3173.645,"But I believe, Your Honor, that if you were to look at Rita, that the challenge that they are posing here really would undermine the premise of Rita, which is that for a typical sentence where the court chooses a point within the range, there is no requirement for detailed elaboration of the reasons. And why would more be required in 3582, which this case has -- this Court has indicated in Dillon actually is an abbreviated proceeding, not subject to Booker."
2017.17-5639,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3256.88,3257.95,"Thank you, counsel."
2017.17-5639,1,62979,rod_j_rosenstein,,3257.95,3258.955,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2017.17-5639,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3258.955,3264.41000005,"Mr. Coberly, you have four minutes remaining."
2017.17-5639,2,62980,todd_a_coberly,,3264.41000005,3275.345,I'm surprised that the government suggests that Rita or -- excuse me -- Taylor does not apply in the sentencing context.
2017.17-5639,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3340.26,3343.52,What would be the minimum that would suffice here?
2017.17-5639,2,62980,todd_a_coberly,,3343.52,3374.62,"I think the minimum that would be -- would suffice, Your Honor, in a run-of-the-mill case is I looked -- I'm -- if it's disproportionate, as it is here, the reason I imposed a sentence of 114 months or whatever it is, because of the seriousness of the crime of, you know, the defendant's involved in methamphetamine tracking -- trafficking, something to that effect. Again, I don't want to telegraph to the district court what we think."
2017.17-5639,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3377.31,3379.8,"Well, you're asking us to impose a standard."
2017.17-5639,2,62980,todd_a_coberly,,3392.02,3402.74,"I -- I think if -- if there was something that was tied to the particular circumstances of the case, but, again, I mean, the -- the reality here is that's up to the appellate courts."
2017.17-5639,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3413.315,3420.76,"But in stating a standard, you're essentially asking us to repeat those words that you just read from Rita, is that correct?"
2017.17-5639,2,62980,todd_a_coberly,,3420.76,3439.59,"Exactly, Your Honor. We're -- we're -- we're not asking anything different than what Rita already requires. And, Justice Alito, your -- your cite to Taylor in -- in your dissent in Gall recognized that the reason it's important for a judge to state reasons to ensure that the district court --"
2017.17-5639,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3439.59,3464.625,"What Rita did say on this point, I think -- point within the guidelines that applied, the whole paragraph, which you didn't really have time to read, but the paragraph there talks about sometimes a judicial opinion responds to every argument; sometimes it does not. Sometimes a judge simply writes the word ""granted"" or ""denied"" on the face of the motion; other times the -- and the reasons make everything clear."
2017.17-5639,2,62980,todd_a_coberly,,3490.41,3492.895,"I think that's exactly right, Justice Breyer."
2017.17-5639,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3492.895,3493.3,You do? (Laughter.)
2017.17-5639,2,62980,todd_a_coberly,,3493.3,3495.965,The problem -- the problem with the government --
2017.17-5639,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3495.965,3499.39,"But when you say minimally, you mean more than just check the box, right?"
2017.17-5639,2,62980,todd_a_coberly,,3499.39,3499.95,"Yeah, absolutely."
2017.17-5639,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3514.06,3515.24,"Thank you, counsel."
