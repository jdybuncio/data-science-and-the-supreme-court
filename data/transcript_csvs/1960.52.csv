1960.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,36.352,38.496,17.
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,38.496,54.936,"The underlying issue in this case is whether the State of Florida denied him due process of law when it tried, convicted and sentenced him while he was admittedly unrepresented by counsel."
1960.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,242.513,244.148,How long was the trial take?
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,244.148,246.469,"The trial took one day, Your Honor."

1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,269.061,276.892,There were two questions asked of the first witness who was a Negro as was petitioner.
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,308.774,317.454,"Yes, but does the printed record contain both the proceedings in its (Inaudible) at the trial as well as habeas corpus?"
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,317.454,324.622,"The answer to that, Your Honor, is that it contains a partial transcript of the trial proceedings."
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,354.014,360.543,Was the full -- was the full proceeding at trial before the habea -- in the habeas corpus proceeding?
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,360.543,361.622,"No, sir, Your Honor."
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,361.622,363.104,Are they here?
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,363.104,366.944,They are nonexistent so far as we know.
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,366.944,367.343,"Well, then, how can"

1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,367.462,369.189,-- you tell what took place?
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,369.189,379.353,We have to take the allegations of the petition as to what took place as to the period of time before the first witness testified.
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,430.692,436.076,Have we hear all the testimonial part of the trial?
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,436.076,437.241,"Yes, sir, Your Honor."
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,456.771,459.122,Are there any witnesses for the defense?

1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,463.89,464.892,He did take the stand?
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,464.892,466.006,He did take the stand.
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,466.006,468.123,And his testimony is here?
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,468.123,468.714,"Yes, sir, Your Honor."
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,468.793,469.888,It's in this record?
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,469.888,471.308,"Yes, sir, Your Honor."
1960.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,471.448,473.74,(Inaudible)
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,473.74,480.521,"Well, it started out he looked at the judge or he asked the judge, ""Is he going to ask me questions?"""
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,542.67,549.77,Was there a denial of the defense or a -- or a confession and -- as it were a confession avoidance?
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,549.77,552.648,A denial of the defense of insanity?
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,552.648,553.04,No.
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,555.064,555.814,"No, sir, Your Honor."

1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,557.53,557.788,"Yes, sir."
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,557.788,564.297,-- of the -- of the charge -- of the -- of the occurrence on -- on the basis of which the charge is made?
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,564.297,570.168,I want to give a careful answer to Your Honor's question as I realize its significance.
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,629.939,636.135,"Whether he could've -- ineptness, meaning, personal or legal ineptness?"
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,636.135,638.593,"Both, I would say, Your Honor."
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,743.72,748.305,Did he -- did he address the jury after -- after he left the witness stand?
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,748.305,750.201,"No, sir, Your Honor."
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,795.21,798.276,"Well, we don't know what issues the judge left to the jury."
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,798.276,799.04,"No, sir, Your Honor."
1960.52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,819.289,823.341,(Inaudible)
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,823.341,829.582,"It carried a 20-year penalty, as did the offense for which he was convicted."
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,838.722,843.475,"Well, I thought -- as I understood you a minute ago, you -- the punishment is the same."
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,843.475,845.398,It is identical --
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,845.398,845.561,So he had to --
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,845.561,846.892,-- and he got the maximum.
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,846.892,850.975,"So he achieved getting a different name for the same 20 years, is that it?"
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,850.975,859.87,"I'm sure that as he sits there facing another 17 years, the difference between first and second degree does not interest him in the slightest."
1960.52,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1064.443,1077.917,"Is there anything in the record at all, Mr. Daniels, of the -- of the proceedings in the court at the time of arraignment or whenever the -- whenever the court supposed to advise a man of his rights?"
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1077.917,1093.713,"There is a minute book notation attached to the State's return in the court below which state that the defendant was arraigned on a date not specified, that he admitted identity and pled not guilty."
1960.52,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1096.709,1099.442,Admitted identity and that is --
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1099.442,1100.841,That he was Elijah McNeal.
1960.52,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1100.95,1102.85,"That he was the one who was charged, yes."
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1103.723,1105.307,And pled not guilty.
1960.52,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1106.165,1107.506,Yes.
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1107.506,1121.99,"In testing the decision of the Florida Supreme Court, if we follow existing law, we go to the line of cases inaugurated with Betts versus Brady in 1942."
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1186.439,1193.249,"When you say disproven, am I right in my recollection that in part of the habeas corpus issue is from the Supreme Court itself?"
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1193.249,1194.04,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1194.04,1202.227,"And that the disposition -- if the writ is issued in an order to show cause, the proceedings thereafter are by affidavit?"
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1202.227,1206.193,"The proceedings thereafter are, first, by returns --"
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1206.193,1206.671,Yes.
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1206.671,1209.65,"Then after that, the -- as in Cash's case --"
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1209.65,1209.787,Yes.
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1209.787,1213.98,"-- on remand, they sent the case to a circuit judge to hold a hearing."
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1213.98,1215.189,Kind of a master for those people.
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1215.189,1216.802,"That -- that is correct, Your Honor."
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1216.802,1219.026,"He can hear witnesses, of course, he does."
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1219.026,1220.389,That is absolutely correct.
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1231.451,1236.202,Was it just on the -- the petition for the writ and the return --
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1236.202,1236.231,And the exhibit.
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1236.231,1237.535,-- with all the annexes.
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1238.426,1239.158,That's the record --
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1239.158,1241.944,"-- on the basis of which your Supreme Court did what it did, is that it?"
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1241.944,1242.98,That is correct.
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1267.341,1271.791,That -- that means that we don't have to send it to a county judge whatever you call him.
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1271.791,1278.143,What it means is this complaint didn't state a cause of action and it's dismissed with prejudice.
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1307.391,1309.181,You mean he took no part in -- in choosing --
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1309.181,1311.779,He took no part in the voir dire.
1960.52,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1318.102,1320.021,Did the judge participate?
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1320.021,1324.367,There is no allegation or evidence as to whether the judge participated.
1960.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1327.351,1329.585,"Now, that the record doesn't show that one way or the other?"
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1329.585,1334.682,The record is silent because all of these things happened before the State's transcript attached to its current --
1960.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1334.682,1338.119,"Yes, so you're now relying on the allegations of the petition."
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1338.119,1339.627,That is correct.
1960.52,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1402.65,1403.929,"Where is Bartow, Florida?"
1960.52,0,41208,sam_daniels,,1403.929,1409.035,"Bartow, Florida is in the center of the State, Your Honor."
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,2479.424,2489.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2654.604,2660.531,Was the petitioner represented by counsel in -- before your State Supreme Court?
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,2660.531,2661.043,"No, sir."
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2771.207,2788.021,"You mean -- you mean that it is the practice in Florida, when the Supreme Court entertains a petition for habeas corpus and sends it to a commissioner, it is your practice then to supply the petitioner with a -- with counsel for the proceeding before the commissioner?"
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,2788.021,2790.111,"That is right, sir."
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2790.111,2804.227,"I must say that it seems a little odd that the State should -- is, if I may say so, sensible and fair-minded in providing counsel in a habeas corpus proceeding, shouldn't it be providing counsel in -- in the main cases?"
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,2804.227,2804.51,"Well, while it is not --"
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2804.51,2806.147,It actually could decide.
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,2806.147,2828.209,"-- while it is not mandatory, we, in the Attorney General's Office, take this position that if our Supreme Court feels that there is a question of fact which should be determined, then we think that we owe this -- our Supreme Court the courtesy of -- of providing counsel so that that question of fact can be dealt into."
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2828.209,2831.46,You understood me as commending you for doing that.
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,2831.46,2832.582,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2832.582,2833.54,"Now, I'd like to know this."
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,2845.671,2846.141,"Well, I would --"
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2846.141,2847.748,200 or 50?
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,2847.748,2849.237,It would be over 200.
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2849.237,2850.439,Over 200.
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,2860.715,2862.343,Over 50% of them.
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2862.343,2867.055,"So, the 50% arise on the basis of lack of counsel at the trial."
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,2867.055,2868.05,"Yes, sir."
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2868.05,2874.564,"I should think Florida might save a lot of time and worry in expense and perhaps, prestige."
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,2874.564,2874.7,I --
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2874.7,2876.326,(Voice Overlap) the main evil?
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,2876.326,2883.126,I believe that I can give the Court a reasonable explanation of that as we go along.
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2883.126,2886.925,Alright.
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,2886.925,2924.321,"This -- the question I just mentioned relative to -- to the information has been abandoned in these proceedings and we're now here on a single -- the single issue of whether or not Elijah McNeal was arbitrarily denied his right to counsel in the court below and if so, was such denial a violation of his constitutional rights under our federal and state constitutions."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3285.908,3289.201,"Why isn't it more complete, I wonder?"
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,3289.201,3289.835,"Pardon, sir."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3289.835,3292.16,I wonder why it is not more complete.
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,3304.255,3321.36,"The burden in Florida, as I assume it is in most jurisdictions, is for the person making the allegations to -- to furnish the proof of such allegations."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3359.747,3360.538,I beg your pardon?
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,3360.538,3400.419,"He raised no question of trial irregularities in his petition, his only question, as I've said, the -- another reason why the record isn't any more complete than it is, if Your Honor please, is, again, I go back to our previous statement, that it was the impression of everyone concerned that his primary complaint had to do with the information not being given to him."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3414.073,3438.708,"Well, I -- I don't quite understand how you say that because the very first item in number one in his petition for habeas corpus reads ""The trial court deprived him in his rights to representation by counsel as required by decisional rules and established law of Florida."""
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,3447.149,3457.005,I had reference to the argument contained in the petition wherein he's apparently concentrated on the other question.
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3500.055,3500.598,Well --
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,3500.598,3500.638,-- that's--
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3500.638,3513.517,"-- well, in your -- in your State, whether he has those attributes or not, is it not necessary to inform him at any stage of the proceeding that he's entitled to counsel?"
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,3513.517,3533.423,"No, sir, it is not necessary but under the rules in keeping of, according keeping of the spirit of the rules laid down by this Court and as adopted and articulated in Sneed versus Mayo, a Florida case."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3562.651,3563.554,It's not necessary.
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,3563.554,3565.958,"No, sir, it is not."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3565.958,3569.56,Does the record ever show that -- that it was then?

1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3572.03,3578.031,It's considered a ministerial function and the record seldom shows it.
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3592.654,3601.577,"Would you forgive me for making the suggestion that considering the number of cases that have come up here in my time from Florida, it's quite a number, as you well know."
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,3601.577,3603.291,"Yes, sir."
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3603.291,3643.141,"I should suggest that the wise, the wise attitude disclosed or reflected in your Steiner case that it shouldn't all be left to counsel, to the -- to the skill or exigencies or pressure or what mattered to counsel but it might help to have a record more complete in view of the number of cases that has come up here where we have to be with these inadequate records considering the facts, considering the facts that the Betts and Brady limitation turns on the totality of what the whole proceeding shows."
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,3657.0,3679.373,Our Supreme Court in case after case has admonished our trial judges to make a more complete record and it's well voiced by Mr. Justice Sebring in the Sneed case wherein he -- he tells them and -- and he's throwing it out as advice to all of our judges that that needs to be done.
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3679.373,3679.785,What is it?

1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3774.062,3776.339,And ends through with what?
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,3776.339,3787.919,"And ends with rebuttal, with -- now, the -- that is, if you pay the court reporter extra to take your closing argument, he'll do that."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3793.255,3797.827,Why isn't there a charge in this case?
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,3797.827,3806.314,The -- I don't know.
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3806.314,3826.955,"Isn't it particularly important in a case like this where you have many, many different kinds of assault in the -- in the State of Florida that this man could be convicted of and the difference in the great disparity in punishment between -- between those different kinds of assault?"
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,3843.74,3876.505,"Well, I would say, if Your Honor please, that if the -- we've always taken the position that it is presumed that a trial judge does his duty and we rely on that presumption and now, if it's presumed that -- that the absence of a charge and -- and the record is prima facie evidence that the judge did not do his duty, then, certainly, the burden would have been upon me to furnish some court with it beginning in Florida."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3891.37,3892.924,At what time?
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,3892.924,3896.895,In his original petition.
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3919.522,3969.982,"Well, in -- in the course of your investigation in the Attorney General's Office to determine whether this is a case that should be -- be heard, wouldn't you take into consideration the fact that this man was not represented by counsel, either in this proceeding of the Supreme -- in the Supreme Court or at his original trial and that the -- the question of whether the judge had adequately instructed the jury as to the various degrees and -- and kinds of assault was an important factor in determining whether he had -- had suffered by reason of being deprived of counsel?"
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,3969.982,3979.424,"I didn't, at that time, feel that the obligation was upon me to do -- to go that far."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4003.13,4014.864,"Yes, but you have told me that, normally, the -- the record starts with the first witness of the prosecution and ends with a charge but the charge isn't here."
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4022.791,4029.576,"Well, if the charge were improper, it's -- it would have been a proper subject for appealing this case."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4042.443,4056.543,"Well, this man doesn't -- as I understand it, doesn't attempt to -- to use these questions for the purpose of -- of appealing and getting a reversal of his trial."
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4070.236,4096.187,"Suppose the charge, suppose the charge, the judge in charging the jury, points out these are the differences of degree under your code, if it is a code, and then points out how narrow the distinctions are and how conflicting the views are but it's up to you gentlemen or -- gentlemen and -- do you have ladies on the jury as part?"
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4096.187,4096.515,"Yes, sir."
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4096.515,4098.599,Gentlemen and ladies of the jury.
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4134.984,4139.066,It's evident that the charge was given.
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4147.466,4164.122,"Your position is that the evidence that we have, the testimony of the State's witnesses and the examination -- and cross-examination of McNeal, in your view, show that he was fully fit and capable of dealing with the charge against him."
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4165.426,4178.895,"That's it, Your Honor, and going back to these matters and -- and it's coupled with a previous question, the burden is on the petitioner to furnish those documents necessary to support his allegations."
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4200.922,4217.884,"In a way -- in a way, Mr. Henderson, this is a subtle -- begging of the question because here is a case where a fellow says, ""I'm incapable of meeting the charge"" and you say the burden is on him to have the skill of knowing how to put his case."
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4218.95,4219.069,"Well, you --"
1960.52,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4219.069,4220.152,That's what's involved.

1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4271.035,4272.881,I -- I wouldn't be able to answer that.
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4292.904,4293.726,I beg your pardon?
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4293.726,4296.839,I said the State defends lots of them down there.

1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4300.024,4306.582,"So, that the -- the State advises them from time to time on many matters."
1960.52,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4306.582,4308.322,"Let's see if I get this, Mr. Henderson."
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4308.322,4308.961,Pardon.
1960.52,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4308.961,4310.171,Let's see if I understand this.
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4314.983,4322.16,It might be that I advised him of how -- what procedures to take to get his problem before the Supreme Court of Florida.
1960.52,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4322.16,4327.284,"Well, I'm just wondering, if you did, how can we attribute to him and -- deficiency in the record?"
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4327.284,4336.799,"Well, I take the position that the -- that there is -- the deficiency in the record does not affect the question before the court."
1960.52,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4346.501,4348.907,"Well, there are other cases beside Cash against Culver."
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4348.907,4356.707,"Yes, sir, but we -- we're aware of many of them and we relied on some of them in our brief."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4356.707,4365.768,"Well, Mr. Henderson, did he -- did -- how did he get this transcript -- transcript or this record, whatever it is?"
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4365.768,4367.807,He ordered it from the court reporter.
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4367.807,4374.985,The court -- did he have to pay for it?
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4374.985,4376.394,I don't believe he did.
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4376.394,4377.218,Alright.
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4381.205,4382.393,"Yes, sir."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4382.393,4382.901,Alright.
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4392.243,4408.786,"Well, it depends on the nature of the legal proceedings involved in -- on -- on appeal, it's necessary that the entire record go, especially if there is evidentiary questions involved."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4459.336,4474.602,"Well, I noticed here that, in this one, the first allegation is that the trial court deprived him in his rights to representation by counsel as required by decisional rules and established law of Florida."
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4516.535,4524.964,"Well, it -- the same question might be -- well be asked of how the State would protect."
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4545.682,4555.417,"Well, both -- both sides would -- would be protected if they had the record from which the Supreme Court could -- could determine what the fact was."
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4555.417,4556.254,That's true.
1960.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4556.254,4561.746,"And -- well, why isn't it here?"
1960.52,1,37468,odis_m_henderson,,4561.746,4565.186,"I'm afraid I can't answer that, sir."
