1982.81-1404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.716,We will hear arguments next in Briscoe against LaHue.
1982.81-1404,0,22831,edmund_b_moran_jr,,71.27,74.502,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,161.999,163.826,"May I interrupt you there, Mr. Moran?"
1982.81-1404,0,22831,edmund_b_moran_jr,,170.198,175.869,"--I don't believe he can if, indeed, it has been shown that he committed perjury."
1982.81-1404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,179.054,179.711,Then the good faith--
1982.81-1404,0,22831,edmund_b_moran_jr,,179.711,186.411,"--I do not think that if there is conclusive proof of perjury, that it could ever be assumed that it was given in good faith."
1982.81-1404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,203.638,203.856,--Then it wouldn't be perjury.
1982.81-1404,0,22831,edmund_b_moran_jr,,203.856,204.919,And that would not be perjury.
1982.81-1404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,204.919,215.541,So that you are really saying that there is no defense to a complaint against a police officer that he committed perjury at a trial with regard to a relevant fact.
1982.81-1404,0,22831,edmund_b_moran_jr,,215.541,220.788,I would say that that would be true to the extent that good faith is not consistent with perjury.
1982.81-1404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,220.788,227.409,"So that there... when you say there should be no absolute immunity, you really are also saying there should be no immunity, period."
1982.81-1404,0,22831,edmund_b_moran_jr,,227.409,246.887,"In a sense, yes, except that a few courts that have viewed the situation have considered that perhaps there would be what they have characterized as a qualified good faith immunity in the sense that the police officer would be allowed to come forward with evidence to show that he believed the statements to be true."
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,1961.446,1962.586,Thank you.
1982.81-1404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2053.798,2063.295,Do you think that in 1871 the Congress meant to punish perjurers when it passed the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871?
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2063.295,2070.105,"Your Honor, there is certainly evidence in the legislative history that Congress was concerned about perjury when it was--"
1982.81-1404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2070.105,2070.964,"There was a lot of evidence, wasn't there?"
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2070.964,2072.885,"--Yes, there was evidence of that, Your Honor."
1982.81-1404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2072.885,2073.745,"Not just some, there was a lot."
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2073.745,2078.555,"However, Your Honor, what we would do is to turn to an analogous situation."
1982.81-1404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2107.308,2113.227,So you're saying that the Ku Klux Klan Act does not mean what it says or what its legislative history indicates.
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2113.227,2120.757,"Your Honor, I'm saying that this Court has previously stated time and time again that Congress never intended to abolish wholesale all common law immunities."
1982.81-1404,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2120.757,2123.927,How about any?
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2123.927,2130.049,Certainly this Court has discussed some common law immunities it has not adopted.
1982.81-1404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2206.3,2216.155,"Then you're saying that even in 1872, a perjurer was not covered by 1983."
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2216.155,2217.295,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1982.81-1404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2227.479,2232.961,Even with respect to perjury in a case arising in 1872?
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2232.961,2247.096,"Your Honor, it's our position that Congress never intended to put witnesses on trial for their statements made during the course of a judicial proceeding, that Congress understood that there were ample safeguards to encourage a witness to tell the truth."
1982.81-1404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2253.452,2260.933,So all of this... all of this legislative history about concern about perjurers is down the drain; the Congress really didn't pay any attention to it?
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2260.933,2266.182,"--Well, Your Honor, I believe Congress was concerned about many things when it enacted the Civil Rights Act."
1982.81-1404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2524.28,2528.31,Has your legal department ever prosecuted a policeman for perjury?
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2528.31,2531.528,"--Your Honor, we are only civil attorneys."
1982.81-1404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2532.917,2536.775,"Well, have you... do you know of anyone that has ever been prosecuted in the State of Indiana?"
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2536.775,2540.977,"In the State of Indiana, I am not aware of any."
1982.81-1404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2745.83,2747.877,May I ask you one question before you sit down?
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2747.877,2748.064,"Certainly, Justice Stevens."
1982.81-1404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2748.064,2752.985,Do you think on the record before us that in any case there is a showing of perjury?
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2752.985,2754.389,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1982.81-1404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2754.389,2757.951,I wonder if you really need the absolute immunity defense then.
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2757.951,2764.074,"Your Honor, when the District Court decided, it held that there was not perjury."
1982.81-1404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2782.16,2786.485,But it is only in the case where there really is perjury that you need the immunity.
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2786.485,2789.249,"No, Your Honor, because in either way--"
1982.81-1404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.249,2791.374,Where there is a prima facie showing of perjury.
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2791.374,2798.184,"--Well, Your Honor, in either way, what we would suggest is that a trial would be necessary in order to resolve the dispute."
1982.81-1404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2803.152,2804.807,"Well, but not in this particular case."
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2810.148,2811.492,"I would say so, Your Honor."
1982.81-1404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2811.492,2812.914,Even on the record before us.
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2812.914,2829.124,"Your Honor, what we are trying to do here is, obviously, to have the decision of the Court of Appeals affirmed, but in addition, we would suggest that absolute witness immunity is necessary because police officers should be treated as any other witness and granted absolute witness immunity."
1982.81-1404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2829.124,2839.34,And at the outset of the case have the complaint dismissed if what it claims is liability for perjury.
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2839.34,2840.027,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2840.027,2847.743,"Merely the claim, the claim that perjury was committed invokes automatically the witness privilege, does it not?"
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2847.743,2848.165,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2848.165,2848.883,That's your theory.
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2848.883,2849.821,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2849.821,2850.586,Very well.
1982.81-1404,1,27487,harriet_lipkin,,2851.459,2851.678,Thank you.
1982.81-1404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2851.678,2852.443,The case is submitted.
