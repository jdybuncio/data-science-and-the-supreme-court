2002.02-575,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.251,"We'll hear argument now in Number 02-575, Nike, Inc. versus Marc Kasky."
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,56.603,60.134,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-575,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,279.446,286.973,"Well, certainly some omissions, even though not technically false, could be false in their... in what they convey."
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,286.973,313.236,"Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, and, in fact, one of the suggestions made by the California Supreme Court for how a company could engage in this debate without any problem is simply omit all the facts that might connect it to the situation, and that kind of omission, it would be certainly alleged, would be misleading, so the only solution that Nike is given is, talk in vague generalities."
2002.02-575,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,420.372,426.728,To... to make them realize that raw milk was not as good as pasteurized milk?
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,426.728,431.842,"Well, I guess to make some people... this... that's what the statute says, that some people might have been misled."
2002.02-575,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,456.327,473.262,"Do... do we have a case in which we say that a... a civil scheme... I... I suppose there are some criminal remedies here, but let's just think about this as a civil scheme, that a civil scheme of this type is so burdensome, so extensive that it chills speech and is therefore invalid?"
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,473.851,475.619,"--Well, I suppose Bantam Books--"
2002.02-575,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,475.619,480.794,--We... we have plenty of criminal cases that the criminal laws are either vague or overly broad and that they chill speech.
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,482.694,484.485,--I think Bantam Books comes to mind.
2002.02-575,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,484.485,485.921,Yes.
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,485.921,489.492,"And there it was less than this, it was simply you were on a list of books."
2002.02-575,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,535.226,546.066,"You would have to say that this complaint and the adjudicatory system it wished to invoke chills speech, therefore the complaint must be dismissed."
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,547.473,548.742,"Well, essentially that's right, that--"
2002.02-575,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,548.742,549.978,"--Well, Mr. Tribe, this--"
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,549.978,551.339,--this trial itself is illegitimate.
2002.02-575,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,551.339,560.577,"--this... but this Court has said that even though commercial speech concerns a public issue, it's still commercial speech--"
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,560.577,561.113,Yes.
2002.02-575,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,561.113,563.503,--and we've applied a different test to commercial speech.
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,563.503,564.691,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
2002.02-575,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,564.691,567.584,"We said that in Central Hudson, we said that in Bolger."
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,567.584,568.341,Yes.
2002.02-575,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,568.341,569.818,How do you distinguish those?
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,569.818,571.637,"Well, let me say two things, Justice O'Connor."
2002.02-575,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,607.112,609.25,"Well, do you... you take the view that--"
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,609.25,609.25,--because it's misleading commercial speech.
2002.02-575,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,609.25,616.556,--none of the things alleged in the complaint meet the commercial speech test set out in Central Hudson?
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,616.556,617.295,"Actually, we--"
2002.02-575,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,617.295,618.06,Not one of them?
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,618.06,621.56,"--That's right, Justice O'Connor, we don't think any of them do, but even if they did, this scheme--"
2002.02-575,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,621.56,622.053,What part do they take?
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,622.053,663.007,"--Well, actually, they don't come close in general, and I think the best way to illustrate that is to look not at the various verbal formulas that have been used by this Court in terms of whether it's advertising format, whether it's... in one case I think Justice Stevens talked about something being transaction-driven, but look at the example that this court gave in Central Hudson when it was addressing the question, when we allow greater regulation of speech that is closely connected with the Government's power to regulate commercial transactions we're not in any way limiting your ability directly to comment."
2002.02-575,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,703.945,705.962,"No, no, but there's another... think in your mind of two documents."
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,711.905,712.331,--Yes.
2002.02-575,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,712.331,718.411,"And then put that side by side with the document in the Bolger case, and--"
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,718.411,718.723,Yes.
2002.02-575,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,718.723,721.322,--that's the... the discussion of venereal disease.
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,721.322,721.781,Right.
2002.02-575,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,721.781,724.864,"Now, what... now, I... you have to write an opinion, let's say--"
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,724.864,725.114,Yes.
2002.02-575,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,725.114,728.508,--that says the difference between these is?
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,728.508,748.691,"Is that the letter to the university presidents and to the athletic departments of these universities, which is Exhibit R at page 190 of the lodging, is an extended argument about why the claims against Nike are unfounded."
2002.02-575,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,754.353,755.17,And then the letter about the--
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,755.17,758.7,--the way Trojan condoms were... condoms were at the end of that--
2002.02-575,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,758.7,758.962,--Yes.
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,758.962,778.189,"--submission, and in the Bolger case again, I think if I were writing such an opinion I would say, in Bolger we again reiterated the formula that had been used in Central Hudson and gave as an example of something that was not commercial speech the promotional pamphlet."
2002.02-575,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,801.814,803.47,And as long as we're writing distinctions--
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,803.47,804.161,Yes.
2002.02-575,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,805.049,806.627,--how do I write this distinction?
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,806.627,807.52,--Well--
2002.02-575,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,807.52,809.627,"The FTC... sorry, if you're not finished."
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,809.627,809.91,--I'm sorry.
2002.02-575,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,813.918,814.419,Yes.
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,814.419,835.706,"--does not have standing to sue on behalf of the athletic directors, it turns out, because the California courts in the Rosenbluth case in 2002 said that this is a law where you're supposed to represent the public, not sophisticated organizations, because they might have their own interests, so to the closest this case comes--"
2002.02-575,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,835.706,838.428,"Is it supposed to be like the Attorney General, Mr. Tribe--"
2002.02-575,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,838.428,838.683,"--But Mr. Tribe, as I understand it--"
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,838.683,839.078,--I'm sorry.
2002.02-575,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,839.078,868.986,"--This sets up a Private Attorney General so this... Mr. Kasky is representing the public, but you've been talking about the great breadth of this statute, and I understand all that, but where... at just the threshold, the cases were thrown out in the lower courts because they said there's no circumstances, there's nothing you can narrow this complaint down to, not one piece of literature."
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,868.986,870.166,"Yes, it's--"
2002.02-575,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,870.166,880.299,"Nothing, not one, and the... the problem with this case is that it comes to us at such a preliminary stage."
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,897.29,906.149,"--No, Justice Ginsburg, I think that's not right, because what the court of appeals said in this case... and its opinion I think merits reading."
2002.02-575,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,944.943,948.394,What's... what is your best reason for saying this is a show trial?
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,957.518,957.896,--Yes.
2002.02-575,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,957.896,975.199,"--I thought your best reason was that there is no, no need for any allegation and in fact no allegation that anyone among the plaintiffs or among the... the class on behalf of which they sue, the public, was injured in any demonstrable way."
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,975.938,976.204,That--
2002.02-575,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,976.204,977.458,Is that what the show trial thing--
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,977.458,1005.145,"--That's probably the single strongest point, and let me connect it with a broader theme, because in Discovery Network, when this Court talked about the fact that commercial speech is a category that's relevant when you're going after commercial harm, in a sense to protect consumers from fraud or one kind or another, in the reputation area it is again not speech alone you're going after."
2002.02-575,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1012.531,1018.744,--Suppose a California regulatory agency signed its name as the plaintiff to this... to this complaint.
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1018.744,1023.444,"Well, I think simply adding a name wouldn't necessarily solve the problem."
2002.02-575,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1031.25,1035.048,"No, no, but... but we have... we have some cases, like the Egg Commission case and so forth--"
2002.02-575,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1035.048,1035.384,--Right.
2002.02-575,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1412.843,1423.524,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-575,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1566.241,1579.89,"General Olson, do you think that Congress would be able to authorize a scheme of Private Attorney General, for instance, to enforce SEC regulations?"
2002.02-575,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1579.89,1587.546,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, with respect to concrete harm with respect to specific individuals."
2002.02-575,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1602.453,1617.533,"What will happen is, they'll find in 5 minutes somebody who bought some Nike shoes who feels the same way, you know, so you'll just have this exact suit with a different plaintiff, possibly, or maybe Mr. Kasky once bought some, for all I know, and... and so that isn't really going to help, is it?"
2002.02-575,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1617.533,1619.488,"Yes, it is, Justice Breyer."
2002.02-575,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1628.317,1636.283,"Okay, so in your view, if Mr. Kasky has bought some shoes and is prepared to say, you know, if I hadn't believed their ad and hadn't been deceived, I never would have bought them--"
2002.02-575,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1636.283,1637.081,--Yes.
2002.02-575,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1637.081,1638.026,--we can go right ahead with this suit?
2002.02-575,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1638.026,1661.212,"If... well, if... there are other problems with the California statute in terms of its breadth and its vagueness and things of that nature, but the principal problem that we're talking about here, which avoids the problem of saying that everything is either commercial or noncommercial, is that traditionally, for hundreds of years, the... the private individual who has suffered that injury has been able to bring an action."
2002.02-575,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1661.212,1662.43,And I... I accept that.
2002.02-575,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1671.987,1672.253,--Yes.
2002.02-575,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1672.253,1679.179,"--is, imagine an ad... it's really an ad, and it says, our refrigerators are ozone-friendly."
2002.02-575,2,38022,paul_r_hoeber,,2033.6,2037.974,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2002.02-575,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2128.0,2133.111,"ASARCO, where it's claimed is, it's under the fourth exception listed in ASARCO."
2002.02-575,2,38022,paul_r_hoeber,,2133.111,2135.15,"No, that's... excuse me, Justice Breyer."
2002.02-575,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2136.433,2136.811,"Oh, Cox."
2002.02-575,2,38022,paul_r_hoeber,,2137.525,2138.851,Which I will get to in just--
2002.02-575,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2138.851,2139.513,Sorry.
2002.02-575,2,38022,paul_r_hoeber,,2139.513,2179.692,"--But Nike has the burden under ASARCO to show that it... if the Court gets to it, that it has Article III standing, and I'll direct the Court's attention to the reply brief, page 6, and the only... only factor that Nike points to to show that it has Article III standing is, and I quote, the certain injury Nike confronts from having to defend its speech in this litigation, and I will say that I do not believe that the process of litigation counts, or qualifies, or is sufficient to establish Article III standing."
2002.02-575,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2180.817,2185.639,"You can't think of any civil scheme which is, on its face, so burdensome that it chills speech?"
2002.02-575,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2185.639,2186.573,You can't think of anything?
2002.02-575,2,38022,paul_r_hoeber,,2186.573,2193.009,"--The... the scheme... the scheme would be, Your Honor, perhaps... no doubt, but the process of litigation."
2002.02-575,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2203.612,2207.055,"Well, but here the argument is, the process of litigation is what causes the substantive injury--"
2002.02-575,2,38022,paul_r_hoeber,,2207.055,2209.541,"--Well, I think that... that--"
2002.02-575,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2209.541,2215.285,"--to a First Amendment right, which is clearly something you have Article III standing to assert."
2002.02-575,2,38022,paul_r_hoeber,,2215.285,2232.972,"--The... but... but going through the process of litigation, if it were a criminal case, the arrest and the prosecution and the ultimate, possible conviction, but simply going through the litigation does not distinguish--"
2002.02-575,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2232.972,2235.086,"Well, that's the question on the merits."
2002.02-575,2,38022,paul_r_hoeber,,2235.922,2246.374,--The question on the merits being the chilling effect of the California scheme--
2002.02-575,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2246.374,2248.046,Imagine it was New York Times--
2002.02-575,2,38022,paul_r_hoeber,,2248.046,2250.743,--not the... not the litigation its... not the process of litigation itself.
2002.02-575,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2250.743,2253.152,"--Well, suppose it was, the defendant was the New York Times."
2002.02-575,2,38022,paul_r_hoeber,,2261.832,2264.56,Under ASARCO.
2002.02-575,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2264.56,2266.003,"Yes, I mean--"
2002.02-575,2,38022,paul_r_hoeber,,2266.003,2266.321,Under--
2002.02-575,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2266.321,2275.869,"--I don't know if literally it's ASARCO, but what we have is a... is a plausible claim that speech of an important political nature is being stopped."
2002.02-575,2,38022,paul_r_hoeber,,2284.478,2305.303,"--Well... well, what I'm saying is, that may... that may well be true, and it may well be true that... that a scheme can... can stifle speech and establish harm, but the... the simple process of litigation, responding to discovery and going through the litigation is not what is stifling the speech."
2002.02-575,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2306.059,2307.498,"--Well, that's one of the issues in the case."
2002.02-575,2,38022,paul_r_hoeber,,2307.498,2348.473,"--Well, all right, then I'll move to my second jurisdictional point, because I want to make sure it comes out, and this is under Cox, and that is, there is no final judgment because this is a... in a traditional sense because this is the overruling of a demurrer, but the fourth exception set forth in Cox provides a way that this Court can hear a case in this circumstance, but one of the conditions, necessary conditions is that were this Court to hear the case and reverse, that would put an end to the... to the... to the litigation, at least to the relevant cause of action."
2002.02-575,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2369.363,2369.687,Well--
2002.02-575,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2369.687,2370.553,--I don't see that--
2002.02-575,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2370.553,2372.918,--that's what the intermediate court of appeals said in California.
2002.02-575,2,38022,paul_r_hoeber,,2374.413,2386.773,"--What the court of appeals said in California was that we could not amend the complaint, or the facts in the... in the complaint could not be amended to allege noncommercial speech, noncommercial speech, and that's true."
