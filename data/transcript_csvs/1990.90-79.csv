1990.90-79,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.639,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-79, Richard B. Kay v. Bremer Ehrler and Kentucky Board of Elections."
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,49.193,59.309,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,95.194,100.867,What was the standing in this case?
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,100.867,101.478,In this case?
1990.90-79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,101.478,101.848,"In this case, yeah."
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,101.848,102.399,He was a--
1990.90-79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,102.399,103.417,Was he a candidate or something?
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,103.417,103.718,--Yes.
1990.90-79,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.465,150.069,"Was it ever established, Mr. Dyk, that he was admitted to the bar in the Eastern District of Kentucky, or Western District, wherever it was?"
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,150.069,154.892,He didn't need to be admitted to the bar pro hac vice.
1990.90-79,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,168.801,174.735,"So he was enabled to proceed in Kentucky not because he was admitted to the bar, but because he was pro se?"
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,174.735,182.831,"Well, he could have... he could have proceeded either to seek admission pro hac vice or to proceed under this rule."
1990.90-79,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.974,195.378,"So at any rate he was not admitted to practice as an attorney, either for this case or generally, in the Federal court in Kentucky?"
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,195.378,196.389,"That is correct, he was not."
1990.90-79,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,196.389,208.247,"Now, Mr. Dyk, you don't take the position that all pro se litigants are eligible for attorneys' fees, just those who are attorneys?"
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,208.247,210.35,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1990.90-79,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,224.699,233.304,"Well, the statute also refers to prevailing parties, which might more easily be read to cover all than just attorneys."
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,237.956,249.356,"--I... Justice O'Connor, I would agree that there are many of the policies of this statute which would be fulfilled by allowing attorneys' fees to non-attorney pro se litigants."
1990.90-79,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,258.761,274.771,"Well, if you... if you look to the language the phrase ""attorneys' fee"", isn't the more natural meaning of that to presuppose that there is an attorney-client relationship?"
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,274.771,277.363,"I think not, Justice O'Connor."
1990.90-79,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,324.997,329.531,"True, but it may still contemplate an attorney-client relationship."
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,329.531,352.316,"I think... I think not, Justice O'Connor, because not only does the statutory language not draft it in a way that requires representation, and I think it would have been relatively easy for Congress to do that if it intended to do it, but the policies of the statute are fully served in the case of an individual attorney who is proceeding pro se."
1990.90-79,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,356.058,363.402,What about that old saw that he who represents himself has a fool for a client?
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,363.402,365.085,"--Well, I realize--"
1990.90-79,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,365.085,374.071,Maybe Congress had in mind that people should get attorneys in order to vindicate civil rights causes of action.
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,374.071,378.042,--I think there is no question but that Congress wanted attorneys to be involved.
1990.90-79,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,515.823,524.318,In all of those cases the entity is larger than the attorney who is appearing before the court on its behalf.
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,524.318,538.848,"--I think there are, there are in the examples that I have given so far, that is true, Mr. Chief Justice, but Mr. Kay could also have sued in the name of the Kay for President Committee, which may consist of one or two people."
1990.90-79,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,569.717,578.082,"Mr. Dyk, what is your answer to the situation where house counsel represents a nonprofit organization?"
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,578.082,581.835,That does happen with some frequency.
1990.90-79,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,616.958,626.505,"Well, I suppose organizations, corporations and other organizations have to be represented by counsel."
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,637.344,641.274,"Well, I think, Justice O'Connor, that is true in the case of a corporation."
1990.90-79,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,669.534,674.757,"Is that, is that for certain, Mr. Dyk?"
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,677.64,678.421,Yes.
1990.90-79,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,817.591,829.497,"Well, the whole idea of our profession is that that degree of insulation, independence, and professionalism prevails because there is a distance between you and the client."
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,854.204,876.2,"The problem, Justice Kennedy, that the Congress faced in 1976 after this Court's decision in Alyeska was that they thought these cases would not be brought because they could not be brought based on the traditional attorney-client relationship in which the client retained the attorney and agreed to pay the attorney."
1990.90-79,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,900.725,904.787,"Well, I suppose you could say the same about some pro se's who are not attorneys."
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,904.787,913.713,"--I agree with you, Justice Kennedy, that is quite true that there are purposes of this statute which would be served by awarding fees to individuals who are not attorneys."
1990.90-79,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.348,954.602,"Mr. Dyk, I don't understand how you make that distinction."
1990.90-79,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,987.553,992.075,"I think I'm not, Justice Scalia, ignoring the word fee."
1990.90-79,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1084.266,1086.687,"Very well, Mr. Dyk."
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1089.858,1098.654,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-79,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.383,1186.482,"But it also assumes that there is a charge, and we have ignored that assumption because we allow pro bono attorneys to, we allow the recovery of fees for pro bono attorneys."
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1186.482,1188.365,"Yes, Your Honor, but here--"
1990.90-79,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1188.365,1191.005,"So if we ignore the one, why can't we ignore the other?"
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1191.005,1202.523,"--We believe that if you look at the words in the entire context, attorney's fee as part of costs, that it would indicate that there is an attorney-client relationship from which a fee arrangement springs."
1990.90-79,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1236.033,1244.45,"Well, what about the house counsel's situation or the pro bono organization's situation?"
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1244.45,1247.243,--We believe that there is still a fee arrangement.
1990.90-79,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1312.285,1314.425,May I ask this question?
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1328.874,1338.522,"If the petitioner were representing someone other than himself, then we believe he would have qualified for fees for that particular representation."
1990.90-79,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1343.554,1348.496,"How do you differentiate if there, if a common interest... say the vice presidential candidate was plaintiff also."
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1355.372,1364.388,It may be in that situation that when the court is asked to examine the facts connected with it that it might not be possible to make a distinction.
1990.90-79,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1372.613,1374.445,Which means he would or would not get a fee?
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1374.445,1377.885,"It means he would, if he were representing a party other than himself."
1990.90-79,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1377.885,1378.356,I see.
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1378.356,1383.07,Because there would in fact be an attorney-client relationship and a fee arrangement that would stem from that.
1990.90-79,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.07,1396.969,"You say, Ms. Sheadel, that the statute contemplates an attorney-client relationship which will ultimately give rise to some sort of fee arrangement."
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1406.607,1428.188,The language used by Congress in the legislative history indicates that Congress was concerned with enabling individuals who might not be able to afford to hire attorneys and get into court the means by which they would be able to hire an attorney to represent him or her in the court in order to vindicate his or her civil rights.
1990.90-79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1444.561,1465.248,Are you arguing that... that because a man was a lawyer he didn't need to go out and find a good lawyer?
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1467.186,1468.947,We would not say it that way.
1990.90-79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1499.92,1518.529,"Well, unless a pro se lawyer gets paid, I suppose he would be less likely to bring a civil rights suit, because while he's pursuing it he can't take any other clients."
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1518.529,1525.374,We don't believe he would be any less likely to bring the suit than any other individual who is contemplating it.
1990.90-79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1529.248,1532.13,"Well, I don't know about that."
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1548.031,1552.815,--It might apply to some pro se litigants and might not apply to others.
1990.90-79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.128,1571.127,"Well, it's certainly likely if the lawyer, if the fellow is making his living as a lawyer it is likely that, that... well, he normally doesn't take cases that interfere with his practice."
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1571.127,1576.18,"--Yes, that's true, Your Honor, but we do not believe--"
1990.90-79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1576.18,1581.285,So he won't be likely to be going out pursuing civil rights cases if he's not going to get paid.
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1581.285,1582.275,--That's right.
1990.90-79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.309,1629.346,"There's always the risk, naturally there's always the risk of losing."
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1641.443,1644.305,--That certainly is the possibility.
1990.90-79,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1760.992,1763.564,May I ask you a question?
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1771.008,1782.705,"We don't believe that it would make a difference, if you mean if the attorney should get attorney's fees for representing clients, we believe that in that situation the attorney would be eligible for fees."
1990.90-79,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1782.705,1784.408,"Because of the class members, yes."
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1784.408,1791.982,He does in fact represent parties other than himself and has the attorney-client relationship that the statute contemplates.
1990.90-79,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1791.982,1793.584,Another example occurs to me.
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1806.222,1814.518,"Assuming from your question that the partners were representing him and there was the attorney-client relationship, we believe that the partners would be eligible."
1990.90-79,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1814.518,1819.72,But he couldn't... he probably couldn't count his own hours working on the case as part of the fee?
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1819.72,1824.595,We would agree that he should not be able to be compensated for his own representation of himself.
1990.90-79,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.171,1898.64,"You would apply that to all organizations, including partnerships?"
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1903.175,1914.133,I don't know if courts allow partnerships to proceed pro se without a licensed attorney there in the courtroom for them.
1990.90-79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1944.688,1956.06,"Well, would you... a law partnership where a lawyer represents the partnership, would you treat the partnership and that lawyer like a... like a corporation?"
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1956.06,1961.281,"Yes, we would, if the lawyer is representing the partnership and there is the attorney-client relationship."
1990.90-79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1961.281,1961.931,"Well, he's representing himself, too."
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1963.5,1963.933,Yes.
1990.90-79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1986.515,1991.733,"What, what courts have been against you?"
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1991.733,1995.037,The Ninth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit have held--
1990.90-79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.037,1997.304,"Are those, are there only three circuits ruled on that?"
1990.90-79,1,16945,ann_m_sheadel,,1997.304,2017.8,"--There are only three circuits that have ruled on this specific question, although the Duncan case involved a defendant obtaining attorney's fees, and so the question is enough different that it's difficult to know if that court would also make the same ruling for a plaintiff that was proceeding pro se."
1990.90-79,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2085.529,2087.147,"Thank you, Ms. Sheadel."
1990.90-79,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2090.416,2107.644,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-79,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.212,2139.515,Corporations can't litigate pro se because the corporation can't come into court?
1990.90-79,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2139.515,2144.05,It could not appear through its president or through some officer of the corporation.
1990.90-79,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.602,2148.871,"Well, what if its vice president is a lawyer?"
1990.90-79,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2148.871,2155.041,I think that then the courts have allowed the attorney--
1990.90-79,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.041,2156.258,They don't need to go out and hire anybody.
1990.90-79,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2158.393,2162.779,"--Well, that would be the in-house counsel situation, and that is certainly okay."
1990.90-79,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2163.981,2173.42,"But how about a voluntary organization, say an environmental organization or, you know, any one of the groups that litigate."
1990.90-79,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2180.925,2201.839,"--We think the general rule is they are not, and the cases on this are collected under 28 U.S. Code 1654, which is a statute we did not cite in our brief, but that is a statute that generally gives all parties in Federal courts a right to conduct their own cases personally or by counsel."
1990.90-79,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2201.839,2211.878,"So, under your view an organization would have to be represented by an attorney, but it could be an attorney who was also a member of the organization?"
1990.90-79,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2211.878,2215.164,"Yes, that's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-79,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2274.535,2275.72,Let me ask you a question there.
1990.90-79,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2293.199,2295.799,He is the beneficiary of the trust?
1990.90-79,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2295.799,2299.603,"He is both the beneficiary... he brought an action on behalf of all... well, I suppose you could say, say he's the sole beneficiary."
1990.90-79,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2301.136,2304.454,I think in that case it is simply a pro se example.
1990.90-79,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2312.41,2320.749,"No, I'm thinking of an action where he creates... a common fund case, where he creates a fund for the trust and he is the individual beneficiary."
1990.90-79,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2320.749,2326.403,"--If he is the sole beneficiary, I think our position would be that he is not entitled to a fee."
1990.90-79,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.937,2332.557,I suppose in most of those cases that there would be... he in effect would be doing a service for the trust as a whole.
1990.90-79,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2332.557,2335.093,"--Yes, and in that case he might well get a fee."
1990.90-79,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2588.974,2592.343,Why would a pro se lawyer be any more apt to do that than any other lawyer?
1990.90-79,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2592.343,2593.61,"--Well, if a lawyer--"
1990.90-79,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2593.61,2594.445,They both have the same--
1990.90-79,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2594.445,2606.003,"--has a client, the lawyer has to consult with the client about various important parts of the litigation, including settlement offers, and presumably the client is going to be particularly interested in achieving the result on the merits."
1990.90-79,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2631.801,2635.669,"--Thank you, Mr. Long."
1990.90-79,3,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2640.138,2655.832,"As I listen to the United States and the respondent, I begin to hear that almost everybody other than an individual can litigate on a pro se basis and recover under the statute."
1990.90-79,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2718.257,2728.946,"Wouldn't the statutory purpose been have served just as well in this case if your client had retained an attorney to represent him, and then there would be no question that attorney could get an attorney's fee?"
