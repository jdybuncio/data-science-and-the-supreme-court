2016.14-1055,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.22,"We will hear argument next in Case No. 14-1055, Lightfoot v. Cendant Mortgage Corporation. Mr. Rosenkranz."
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,8.22,17.005,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is only one natural way to read the language at issue here."
2016.14-1055,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,73.91,91.19,"Does that include -- you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but ""is this court competent to hear this controversy"" would include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?"
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,91.19,100.36,I -- I am not limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action. It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction.
2016.14-1055,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,207.4,249.625,"What did you do -- what does Justice Souter's statement in Red Cross do to your argument? I'm talking about the statement on page 257 of Red Cross, ""In expressly authorizing suit in Federal court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal jurisdiction."" That seems to say if you authorize suit in Federal court, then that's it."
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,255.23,256.98,"Understood, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.14-1055,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,307.21,308.7,It's tough.
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,331.765,332.52,"Well, Your Honor --"
2016.14-1055,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,332.52,338.965,"It comes out the other way. And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it comes out the other way."
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,344.42,347.15,"No, Your Honor."
2016.14-1055,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,347.15,349.84,"Do you want to deny that legislative history? It helps you, doesn't it?"
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,349.84,350.28,"No, no."
2016.14-1055,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,351.75,351.995,Right.
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,351.995,354.64,But we have a lot more going for us than that.
2016.14-1055,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,376.22,377.13,"Well, that's true."
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,409.91,425.93,"Your Honor, I disagree respectfully with how they -- how you've characterized these cases. So Osborn, if you wanted to write a provision that parses the legislative language the way Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision."
2016.14-1055,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,437.735,438.58,I got that one.
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,438.58,439.23,Okay.
2016.14-1055,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,439.23,443.365,"D'Oench, Duhme, my God, is the -- that's identical to the Bankers' one."
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,447.6,453.04,"So, Your Honor, D'Oench, Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or Federal."
2016.14-1055,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,477.225,506.94,"Now, is there a difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision from a provision creating a cause of action? Let's do the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which authorizes suit in any Federal district court of competent jurisdiction. How do you deal with the fact that the ADA generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal courts?"
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,506.94,515.805,"Well, Your Honor, so the answer is that provision -- excuse me. The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of that jurisdiction."
2016.14-1055,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,530.36,533.19,"Well, there, I'm presuming they mean personal jurisdiction."
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,538.29,539.55,"Well, Your Honor, I disagree."
2016.14-1055,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,716.91,725.135,"Well, that's arguably to keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else."
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,725.135,726.07,"No, Your Honor."
2016.14-1055,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,775.04,780.845,"Well, that's just a belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me."
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,787.405,802.32,"Well -- understood, Your Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie. So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now, it's -- it's the same charter."
2016.14-1055,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,829.55,830.07,Go ahead.
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,830.3,830.39,No.
2016.14-1055,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,831.31,837.2,"This is what's really bothering me here, and I don't know if you can help or not."
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,911.94,912.36,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.14-1055,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,912.36,922.56,"So I don't know whether to look into it deeply in this particular case where you're going to end up with a result that seems to be different than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it."
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,932.7,933.27,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.14-1055,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,933.27,937.77,And that's the dilemma that I'm in. Anything anybody wants to say to help me would be welcome.
2016.14-1055,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,937.77,938.27,"Sure, Your Honor."
2016.14-1055,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1007.435,1023.89,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. O'Connell."
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1023.89,1101.62,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government's view is that the rule of Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or be sued in a ""court of competent jurisdiction."" The best reading of that phrase in Fannie Mae's charter is that it authorizes the corporation to sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of law. We think there is a plausible story for why Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if you don't find that explanation completely satisfying, the text of the statute should control. The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the Federal courts. In this case, the Court should give Congress the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language ""suit is authorized in a State or Federal 'court of competent jurisdiction,'"" then that means that you have to look to some other provision of law to see if that court is vested with jurisdiction."
2016.14-1055,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1101.62,1130.985,"I've done -- or had -- my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been able to identify, eight other statutes that use the ""incompetent jurisdiction"" language. Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B, are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie Mae is?"
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1130.985,1133.24,I -- I am aware of those statutes.
2016.14-1055,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1143.23,1143.95,We are off by one.
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1143.95,1144.235,Right.
2016.14-1055,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1144.235,1145.8,But tell me what you mean.
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1145.8,1148.19,"So, no, I am not troubled by this."
2016.14-1055,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1158.025,1160.35,So a Federal question would be --
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1160.35,1166.07,"No, the Federal agencies have the power to bring a suit in Federal court."
2016.14-1055,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1258.375,1267.44,"So those are five statutes that don't -- is not -- are -- don't involve Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the two --"
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1267.44,1268.05,Yes.
2016.14-1055,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1270.49,1273.29,Have all of them read the statute in the same way you have?
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1273.29,1284.575,I know that the Seventh Circuit has interpreted the V.A.'s sue-and-be-sued clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction.
2016.14-1055,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1304.325,1310.229,"I mean, the one that used the word ""competent jurisdiction,"" ""having competent jurisdiction,"" was Osborn."
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1310.229,1311.19,"Right, but it --"
2016.14-1055,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1311.19,1311.91,What do you do about that?
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1311.91,1331.34,"But in -- in Osborn, I think Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says, ""all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any circuit court of the United States."" So I think in that case what the Court said was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on all circuit courts of the United States."
2016.14-1055,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1399.94,1421.64,"What happens to all the judgments that have been entered, reading this the way the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split jurisdiction with district courts going other ways? What happens to those old judgments where there wasn't Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?"
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1421.64,1422.97,I would think that if --
2016.14-1055,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1422.97,1425.04,If we read things the way you want us to read them.
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1425.04,1432.605,"I would think if those cases are already finished that res judicata would -- you know, their -- those cases would still stand on their own."
2016.14-1055,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1441.77,1445.015,How could you have res judicata if you never had subject-matter jurisdiction?
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1445.015,1448.94,So -- so you're talking about a case where --
2016.14-1055,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1448.94,1456.55,"You can bring up subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but you can't when you --"
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1456.55,1457.25,Once the case is --
2016.14-1055,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1457.25,1461.62,-- haven't brought it up to final judgment and you're trying to use it collaterally.
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1461.62,1463.26,I -- correct.
2016.14-1055,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1476.52,1495.495,"I forgot the name of the ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as wholly as it is, when you've gone -- when you have a final judgment you've got -- done everything on direct review, then you can't collaterally review."
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1495.495,1496.71,Correct.
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1499.39,1508.725,"The -- the words ""court of competent jurisdiction"" in the statute tell you to look at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you could bring a claim there."
2016.14-1055,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1512.945,1523.845,"I mean, I guess language that hurts you is ""any court of law, equity, State, or Federal."" I mean, that's the D'Oench, Duhme one, and they say that puts you in Federal court."
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1539.08,1544.6,"Well, those -- those can be in Federal court, per the Court's decisions in D'Oench, Duhme and in Red Cross."
2016.14-1055,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1545.39,1564.83,"But what we have to say is, once you added these words ""in any competent jurisdiction,"" what they did, those words took the case out of Federal court unless it's some other basis for getting there and require you to go to State court, and to subtract words -- God, it's -- I mean, as a matter of the English language, it just seems a little tough."
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1564.83,1565.08,"No, no."
2016.14-1055,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1568.21,1568.56,It is.
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1568.56,1582.1,"That natural reading of that phrase, a ""court of competent jurisdiction"" means that you have to look somewhere else to determine if the court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a ""court of competent jurisdiction."" The Court has observed that about various statutes --"
2016.14-1055,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1582.1,1582.41,I see.
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1582.95,1595.85,"-- and -- and we are just asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal district courts. The Respondents refer to the Federal district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction."
2016.14-1055,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1642.535,1643.4,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.14-1055,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1643.4,1646.845,Thank you.
2016.14-1055,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1646.845,1650.8,Mr. Brooks.
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,1650.8,1683.28,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong and long-standing rule going back through D'Oench, Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal policy through the corporate form. Now, when Congress expressly provides that a federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction under D'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and their prodigy. Congress can obviously displace that rule if it wants to."
2016.14-1055,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1706.26,1712.585,Why is competent jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court.
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,1721.865,1722.37,Right.
2016.14-1055,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1783.94,1786.37,But why didn't they do the same thing in Ginnie Mae?
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,1786.37,1787.35,"Well, Ginnie --"
2016.14-1055,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1787.35,1792.425,"They chose very different language, so doesn't that show a conscious act."
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,1792.425,1799.29,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae historically has had the identical language to Fannie Mae."
2016.14-1055,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1877.29,1885.6,"Well, your -- your position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as you have the word ""Federal"" -- ""State"" or ""Federal,"" you're home free."
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,1904.63,1910.435,"Well, actually, Your Honor, in the context of the late New Deal era, the words ""competent jurisdiction"" meant a lot."
2016.14-1055,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1976.25,1979.49,"Well, the court said ""general jurisdiction,"" right?"
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,1979.49,1980.35,They -- they certainly did.
2016.14-1055,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1980.35,2007.765,"""General jurisdiction,"" instead of saying ""of competent jurisdiction"" when ""competent"" generally means -- is this -- the -- the sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed to the Court. Does this Court have authority to proceed in this category of cases?"
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2007.765,2009.49,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.14-1055,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2090.9,2094.31,"We now have three versions, but that's okay. (Laughter.)"
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2094.31,2097.13,I'm going to go with nine. (Laughter.)
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2097.13,2105.82,"But here's what else we know. The number of statutes that have the phrase ""competent jurisdiction"" alone, based on some Lexis research very early this morning, is 781."
2016.14-1055,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2139.795,2140.995,If -- I'm sorry.
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2140.995,2143.0,"So Your Honor, I was going to -- go ahead."
2016.14-1055,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2143.0,2152.285,"Your friend on the other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases that are going to be added to the Federal docket. Do you have an answer to that?"
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2152.285,2157.41,"I have many answers to that, Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this. The easiest answer is no --"
2016.14-1055,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2157.41,2162.19,Don't tell us we're not working hard enough. (Laughter.)
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2162.19,2167.58,"I do recall, Justice Kennedy, that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year. Maybe foreclosures could be among them."
2016.14-1055,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2167.58,2169.375,They were easier cases.
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2169.375,2173.445,Perhaps I should sit down. (Laughter.)
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2173.445,2185.185,"Your Honor, the easiest answer to that is that it's undisputed in this case that Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction."
2016.14-1055,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2190.1,2193.29,But there is a specific statute that makes that crystal clear.
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2207.195,2210.57,"Well, so, Your Honor, we know a couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie Mac."
2016.14-1055,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2275.88,2283.475,"I just want you to -- to talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of legislative history, which could not be more clear."
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2328.56,2329.72,"Well, Justice Breyer, on the --"
2016.14-1055,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2329.72,2333.74,Let me give you that -- what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn't look at legislative history.
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2339.17,2349.98,"Justice Breyer, two -- two points. So first of all, on the -- on the natural reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of ""competent jurisdiction"" standing alone is different from the natural reading of ""competent jurisdiction"" State or Federal."
2016.14-1055,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2414.745,2417.81,For this reason. (Laughter.)
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2417.81,2425.7,"We -- we -- we can only assume, or perhaps hope. But in any case, 1938 was a different statute."
2016.14-1055,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2456.57,2459.68,The -- the Federal courts -- may be stepping back a bit.
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2486.33,2499.52,"So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice, there's no question that the courts are limited jurisdiction courts, and we should look at subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye. Having said that, this fundamentally is a case about statutory construction."
2016.14-1055,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2507.2,2529.78,"But there's so many ways that you could -- if you want to make sure that this entity gets into Federal court all the time, what Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and removal purposes. Now, that is very clear."
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2556.35,2610.64,"So, Your Honor, let me begin where you ended, if I might, and just say that this Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase ""competent jurisdiction"" again, standing alone, okay, has multiple different meanings depending on context. In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal jurisdiction citing cases. In the earlier case law of Blackmar v. Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before our statute was decided, it said that in that context, the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction. So I think the only way to harmonize all of these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross language/Osborn/D'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the other things that ""competent jurisdiction"" normally means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general jurisdiction, et cetera."
2016.14-1055,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2612.0,2622.57,"That's because this Court's competence is general competence, which is subject matter, and it's specific competence, which is personal."
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2622.57,2622.9,Correct.
2016.14-1055,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2767.44,2769.34,It shouldn't matter to the Federal court.
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2775.44,2776.4,"That's true, Your Honor."
2016.14-1055,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2794.59,2798.94,But Red Cross didn't have the competence language.
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2800.955,2802.08,That's true.
2016.14-1055,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2840.89,2843.905,So why didn't they do that for Fannie Mae?
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2843.905,2850.87,"Because we -- I mean, it's hard to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of the Framers of our charter."
2016.14-1055,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2986.16,2996.465,"Did you look it up? I mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it. It didn't just have computers write it."
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,2998.85,2999.165,Yeah.
2016.14-1055,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2999.165,3004.355,But who? Where did he come from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know?
2016.14-1055,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3004.355,3005.215,He was fired.
2016.14-1055,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3005.215,3007.06,He was fired.
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,3007.06,3013.9,"It's possible it was a former staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope not. Your Honor, the -- here is what we know."
2016.14-1055,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3016.94,3020.765,"Are those words, ""competent"" -- you know, in any ""court of competent jurisdiction"" --"
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,3020.765,3022.225,"""State or Federal."""
2016.14-1055,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3022.225,3025.62,"Yeah, ""State or Federal."" You know, I've got that point."
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,3030.224,3038.305,"If I find them, I will let you know. Your Honor, here's what we do know: We know the language was not de novo in 1954."
2016.14-1055,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3118.24,3132.415,"Well, there is a reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests there was a reason for treating them differently, which is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that Fannie's board, two-thirds of it does not."
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,3132.415,3133.805,Right.
2016.14-1055,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3177.635,3182.09,Do you know why they have that different structure on the board of directors?
2016.14-1055,2,62763,brian_p_brooks,,3182.09,3204.97,"Well, again, Your Honor, and it's interesting, I've actually personally spoken to some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late '60s, okay? They were all former government officials, because Fannie was, in '68, being extricated from its Federal agency role. Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper. Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of 1970 would have wanted it."
2016.14-1055,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3255.42,3259.265,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rosenkranz, three minutes."
2016.14-1055,3,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3259.265,3307.24,"Thank you, Your Honor. Just a couple of points. First, Justice Breyer wanted to know: What do you do when the language points one way and the cases seem to point another? I would -- I'd dispute the ""the cases seem to point another,"" but my direct answer is: This Court has never gone wrong by going with the language, and in those previous cases, what the Court was trying to do in each case was go with the language, right down to Red Cross where the operative principle was: What did this very language mean last time this Court addressed it? Justice Breyer, you also asked: Which is simpler for lawyers? Now -- now, Fannie doesn't dispute that our reading is a natural reading of the language. Fannie doesn't even dispute that it's the most natural reading."
2016.14-1055,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3341.6,3343.54,"Well, suppose it means personal jurisdiction."
2016.14-1055,3,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3344.98,3345.48,Okay.
2016.14-1055,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3409.01,3411.915,Isn't that USG's position in Portsmouth?
2016.14-1055,3,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3411.915,3432.86,"Well, Your Honor, I can't explain the position that the government has taken, but the government has said that those were also kind of drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply did not involve the question of what is the source of Federal jurisdiction. If I may, one last point on Fannie and Freddie."
2016.14-1055,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3480.74,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
