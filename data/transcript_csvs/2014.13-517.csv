2014.13-517,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.837,"We'll here argument next in case 13-517, Warger v. Shauers."
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,7.67,10.889,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-517,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,43.427,50.081,But -- but wasn't that a case in which a third party came and gave the information?
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,50.081,51.416,That is correct.
2014.13-517,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,100.014,113.256,I thought that the whole rationale behind this is we don't want to invade the jury province with information about what went on in the jury room.
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,143.876,155.433,"Justice Ginsburg, we're certainly talking about statements made during deliberations, and we are not disputing that this is the type of evidence that is subject to the rule."
2014.13-517,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,189.673,197.862,But it's too easy to convert anything that occurs into the jury room as reflecting on the voir dire.
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,226.362,229.064,"So two responses to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-517,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,246.776,247.493,"Well, perhaps if you prevail."
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,248.895,261.619,"Well, that goes to my second response, which is that I think that it is going to be very difficult in the hypothetical you posit for a party to make out a successful McDonough claim."
2014.13-517,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,284.717,288.619,I think you're missing the point of Justice Ginsburg's question.
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,304.814,305.263,--Well--
2014.13-517,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,305.263,313.067,And I guess your answer to -- what's implicit in what you're saying is that it would be permissible to receive that testimony in that situation.
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,313.067,315.969,"--Well, Justice Alito, I think there are two separate issues here."
2014.13-517,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,344.356,344.656,I'm sorry.
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,352.944,374.441,"--Well, I think at a minimum, Mr. Chief Justice, lawyers certainly would have that incentive, even if we were to lose this case, because in talking to jurors, that conversation could very well lead to evidence that unquestionably would be admissible, because, after all, a party can always make a McDonough claim based on extrinsic evidence."
2014.13-517,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,455.61,460.314,But what is the strong evidence of intentional dishonesty in this case?
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,485.112,492.866,"--Well, again, I think that this really goes to the requirements of McDonough as opposed to the interpretation of Rule 606(b)."
2014.13-517,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,564.378,564.814,"Well, it's pretty ambiguous."
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,578.038,581.174,"--Well, she said it would have ruined her life if she had been sued."
2014.13-517,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,605.289,607.407,I guess the reason I ask is precisely for that reason.
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,626.469,629.757,"--And again, that really goes to the application of the McDonough standard."
2014.13-517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,635.91,652.02,"But McDonough did not have -- my problem is not -- is not that, the difficulty of proving that it did demonstrate dishonesty during the voir dire."
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,663.911,666.78,"Well, thank you, Justice Scalia, because this is obviously--"
2014.13-517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,666.78,670.998,"Look at 606(b)(1), and why are you raising this issue?"
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,673.934,678.003,"--Well, this is obviously a case about the interpretation of that language."
2014.13-517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,678.003,678.303,Right.
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,678.303,683.307,But I think it's critical to realize that that language does not simply refer to any challenge to the verdict.
2014.13-517,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,689.711,700.351,Except -- why -- why would you have an inquiry into the validity of the verdict absent juror misconduct?
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,704.405,716.362,"--But the critical point, Justice Sotomayor, is that that language focuses on the inquiry and it focuses on the substantive inquiry mandated by the claim at issue."
2014.13-517,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,737.876,739.228,"I guess I don't understand that, Mr. Shanmugam."
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,762.091,762.676,--Sure.
2014.13-517,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,803.168,805.62,"I know, but -- so maybe we're just going back and forth here."
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,821.03,824.584,But that is not the question that a McDonough claim asks.
2014.13-517,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,832.521,836.892,"I haven't -- I haven't quite counted, but you keep saying the McDonough claim."
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,846.53,848.199,You're absolutely correct.
2014.13-517,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,848.199,851.651,"And so you want to tell us, don't look at Rule 606."
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,855.153,859.071,I am eager for you to look at the language of Rule 606 because I think it supports our position.
2014.13-517,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,872.481,875.867,--But it also requires you to look at who is producing the evidence.
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,880.936,888.69,"--Well, the rest of Rule 606(b) is, of course, all about that, because it is all about the type of evidence that is subject to exclusion."
2014.13-517,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,903.117,911.206,But you're taking a case that had nothing to do with a juror testifying about what -- what -- the deliberations in the jury room.
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,926.8,942.659,"--But, Justice Ginsburg, I do think that the nature of a McDonough claim points up one of the oddities of Respondent's position, which is that there's really no dispute that if a McDonough claim is brought before a verdict has been reached, that evidence -- even evidence from the jury room would be admissible."
2014.13-517,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,964.506,966.875,This is what troubles me about your -- your argument.
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1020.06,1021.594,--I -- I see the problem.
2014.13-517,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1062.752,1072.36,"Is -- under your reading of 606(b), is there anything that is an inquiry into the validity of a verdict other than a motion to set aside the verdict?"
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1072.36,1079.864,"Well, I think that there might be certain types of claims of which prejudice is a component."
2014.13-517,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1091.504,1094.806,"Well, what would -- that motion would be presumably a motion to set aside the verdict."
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1094.806,1099.027,--I assume it would be framed that way rather than as a motion for a new trial.
2014.13-517,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1099.027,1102.812,The reason I ask is because they don't say that.
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1113.52,1114.437,Yeah.
2014.13-517,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1245.272,1249.058,"A party has a right to a competent jury, doesn't it?"
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1249.058,1251.292,"--Yes, that is true."
2014.13-517,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1251.292,1252.944,Constitutional right to that.
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1260.281,1263.233,"Well, that is true."
2014.13-517,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1311.383,1318.987,"That was leaving out the conspicuous difference, there was no jury verdict impugned in the contempt case."
2014.13-517,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1318.987,1319.822,--That is correct.
2014.13-517,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1375.573,1376.341,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,1380.293,1381.41,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2014.13-517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1528.655,1534.476,Your friend says that hasn't been the experience in a large portion of the country.
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,1534.476,1543.497,"Well, that's not true because, first of all, my friend doesn't tell you that there are only five States that allow in this kind of evidence at all."
2014.13-517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1543.497,1544.816,Is California one of them?
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,1544.816,1545.949,California is one of them.
2014.13-517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1545.949,1546.466,Well--
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,1546.466,1551.42,"But even in California, Your Honor, there are different requirements."
2014.13-517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1598.684,1602.705,--But your argument -- your argument is this is going to be something lawyers are going to ask about in every case.
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,1602.705,1603.555,--And they will--
2014.13-517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1603.555,1612.078,"It seems to me -- it seems to me if you're dealing with California, you would have a lot more evidence of that, since they operate under the rule that your friend is arguing for."
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,1612.078,1615.195,"--Well, they do and they don't, Your Honor."
2014.13-517,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1680.622,1697.916,"Ms. Birnbaum, what sense does it make to do what we did in Clark, which is to say you can invade the jury deliberations in a contempt proceeding."
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,1722.299,1730.988,"But, Your Honor, the reason that we allow it in a contempt proceeding is it doesn't affect the validity of the verdict."
2014.13-517,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1771.398,1782.689,"Is -- Ms. Birnbaum, is there no way, is there no way to police the honesty of jurors' answers on voir dire?"
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,1791.493,1800.097,"Your Honor, in this case especially, and I'm not sure I'm answering your question, we could have had a different kind of voir dire."
2014.13-517,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1902.044,1902.577,And why not?
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,1902.577,1907.531,"Because, Your Honor, this is generalized information."
2014.13-517,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1971.54,1974.575,What would happen in the really egregious case?
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,1997.206,2001.56,"I think, Your Honor, under 606(b), there would be no difference."
2014.13-517,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2058.429,2073.773,"Well, do you think that with respect to the kind of case that Justice Alito has in mind, a case of racial bias and let's put it in a criminal context, that maybe it's not up to Congress, that at some point one begins to run into constitutional issues?"
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,2073.773,2089.885,"Well, I think at least if this Court, in Tanner, looked at those constitutional issues not in -- not in the racial bias context, but in the context of having a drunk juror deciding a particular case--"
2014.13-517,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.885,2097.638,"Why -- why is that the -- I mean, would we make an exception to normal hearsay rules where racial bias is the issue?"
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,2097.638,2098.806,"--You would not, Your Honor."
2014.13-517,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.806,2099.473,I don't think so.
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,2099.473,2119.72,"But the -- but the further answer to that is this Court has already said there are other safeguards that are in place that we feel will be sufficient in order to safeguard the Sixth Amendment rights in that particular instance, or the Seventh Amendment rights, of a fair trial."
2014.13-517,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2155.243,2163.683,"I suppose one idea -- because we have relied a lot on the efficacy of other safeguards, and this isn't this case, so you can just say it's not this case."
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,2177.858,2183.41,"--I think, Your Honor, again I'll come back to really this is an issue for Congress."
2014.13-517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2205.326,2210.314,Is there any -- is there any alternative remedy available that doesn't go to the validity of the verdict?
2014.13-517,1,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,2225.089,2228.108,"--No, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't think so."
2014.13-517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2324.085,2325.687,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-517,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2337.245,2339.613,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-517,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2558.634,2560.67,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-517,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2560.67,2561.186,Thank you.
2014.13-517,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2561.186,2566.057,"Mr. Shanmugam, you have 7 minutes remaining."
2014.13-517,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2566.057,2567.457,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-517,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2625.013,2625.629,Yes.
2014.13-517,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2635.485,2637.753,"Well, that is -- that is certainly true, but the--"
2014.13-517,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.753,2640.022,Nobody is going to make the claim before verdict comes out.
2014.13-517,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2640.022,2650.661,"--Well, there are cases where the evidence comes to light, typically when a juror actually comes to the judge and then the judge takes some action based on the statements that have been recorded."
2014.13-517,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2678.396,2682.514,Can you explain the manner in which the jury reached its verdict?
2014.13-517,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2706.998,2715.754,"--Justice Ginsburg, the Titus affidavit does contain those allegations, but those allegations are utterly irrelevant to the resolution of a McDonough claim."
2014.13-517,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2741.219,2744.188,"Well, presumably that's because we assume impact, isn't it?"
2014.13-517,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2746.706,2751.594,"--Well, it's built into the rule only in the sense that it has to be material dishonesty."
2014.13-517,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2928.124,2929.242,How about religious bias?
2014.13-517,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2931.161,2932.294,Well--
2014.13-517,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2932.294,2934.963,What about bias against handicapped people?
2014.13-517,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2938.231,2951.639,"--Well, it raises constitutional concerns, beyond the constitutional concerns that we think are applicable in every case of this variety, because, after all, regardless of the type of bias, what we're talking about here is the right to trial by an impartial jury."
2014.13-517,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3011.944,3012.694,"Thank you, counsel."
