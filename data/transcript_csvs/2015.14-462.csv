2015.14-462,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.075,"We'll hear argument next in Case 14-462, DIRECTV v. Imburgia. Mr. Landau."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,9.075,50.75,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court below violated the Federal Arbitration Act by refusing to enforce the parties' arbitration agreement on grounds the Ninth Circuit characterized as ""nonsensical."" The agreement provides for individual arbitration and expressly precludes class arbitration. And just to underscore that point, it specifies that if State law would force the parties into class arbitration, then the entire arbitration agreement would be unenforceable. The court below interpreted the reference to State law to mean inoperative State law preempted by the FAA."
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,63.75,88.14,"What about the problem that this is California law and a California court said that's what the contract means under California law? In other words, I can't find a case that we're supposed to say -- or we have the power to say that they're wrong, even if they were to say the words ""do not turn on the light"" mean turn on all the lights."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,88.14,88.87,Your Honor.
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,88.87,91.705,So -- so -- and they may have done that in this case.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,91.705,92.17,Here --
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,92.17,93.885,"Nonetheless, what do we do about it?"
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,93.885,96.715,What you do about it is look to the Federal Arbitration Act.
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,110.62,128.22,"The principle of contract interpretation -- I -- I beg to differ with Justice Scalia, the -- I thought that what the court asked itself is what did the parties intend when they used the words ""State law""?"
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,128.22,128.89,Correct.
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,128.89,129.675,Is that correct?
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,129.675,132.49,That's what the court purported to answer.
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,132.49,133.67,That's the interesting part.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,139.38,140.2,Correct.
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,140.2,145.315,-- that disfavors arbitration? What contract principle did they use?
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,145.315,154.9,"Well, again, a lot of cases, you have courts that are -- are bringing in some principle external to the contract, and those are kind of easy cases."
2015.14-462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.2,190.605,"What was the point of putting State law in at all? If Federal law applies, then it makes no sense to have any reference to State law."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,201.74,202.33,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,221.27,226.1,And we had not yet held at the time this contract was made that those laws are invalid.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,226.1,227.2,"Precisely, Your Honor."
2015.14-462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,253.17,269.375,"I'm still not sure that I understood your answer to Justice Breyer's question. His question was, this Court purported, and did, give an interpretation of the intent the two parties had when they entered into a contract."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,271.58,272.625,Your Honor.
2015.14-462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,272.625,276.495,I -- I understand the problem of preemption.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,318.07,318.48,I'm sorry.
2015.14-462,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,385.87,409.7,"Does that mean that whenever there is a dispute about the scope of an arbitration clause and a State court says that it includes a certain subject or doesn't -- it doesn't include a certain subject, that there is, then, the question of Federal law because insufficient weight has been given to the presumption of arbitrability?"
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,409.7,410.74,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-462,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,439.65,444.08,"Well, this may be an extreme case, but where -- how do you define the borderline?"
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,444.08,474.34,"Again, Your Honor, I think in the average case, the State court can interpret State law as it sees fit, but then this Court's responsibility in reviewing State law -- this Court obviously can decide what cases it wants to take to review State law has -- this Court's responsibility is to basically do what Volt said it would do, which is did the State court, in applying State law principles, give due regard to the Federal policy favoring arbitration and construed out in favor of arbitration?"
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,474.34,477.005,And I found no case ever that's done that.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,480.51,480.88,Well --
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,480.88,503.3,"I mean, once we start with this case, even if this is not too difficult under State law, we've got every arbitration contract in the world where one lawyer or another will suddenly be saying, oh, the interpretation of the contract here by the State court judge is not favorable enough to arbitration or hostile to the act."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,508.465,509.02,Your Honor --
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,509.02,510.38,"Now, there's another way to do it."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,514.52,514.9,Well --
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,514.9,518.12,Or -- or come up with an answer to what Justice Alito just asked.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,518.12,518.6,"No, your Honor."
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,522.72,523.36,Why not ask.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,539.815,549.19,"Even if this case came from the California Supreme Court, and the California Supreme Court said we -- again, it has never done that, and that's one of the odd things about this case."
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,571.44,572.16,Maybe that's so.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,610.59,614.46,"And that's, Your Honor, where, respectfully, the Federal Arbitration Act, again --"
2015.14-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.46,616.35,"But you -- you need a test, Mr. Landau."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,625.435,625.96,Your Honor --
2015.14-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,625.96,637.835,Where does it stop? We're going to reinterpret every State interpretation of -- of State law that -- that ends up invalidating an arbitration agreement? Certainly not.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,639.02,639.66,The test is --
2015.14-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.66,656.705,"Can't you say that at least in this case where -- where the State court's interpretation flouts well-accepted, universal contract law principles, the most important of which is you interpret a contract in a manner that makes it valid rather than invalid."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,663.1,663.65,"Correct, Your Honor."
2015.14-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,664.57,665.45,So give us a test.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,666.36,666.855,The test --
2015.14-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,666.855,673.9,"You don't have to go any further than that, where it -- where it flouts standard contract interpretation principles."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,673.9,677.96,"Well, certainly, Your Honor, that is clearly one way to look at --"
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,677.96,691.865,"Do you really think that the parties here -- this is something that I don't know whether to quarrel with or not. The California court said, we don't know what the parties even thought about preemption."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,708.58,716.5,"Absolutely, Your Honor, because the only reason that they were not arbitrating from the get-go was because --"
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,716.5,718.41,Was because California law said --
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,718.41,718.75,Correct.
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,718.75,719.4,-- you don't.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,719.4,719.975,Correct.
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,719.975,724.81,"That's what they wanted. If California law said no, they wouldn't."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,724.81,725.2,Right.
2015.14-462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,739.99,752.5,"But when they entered -- when they entered the agreement, both parties contemplated that State law meant California law. That's why you did not object to the lawsuit being brought in court."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,776.77,777.52,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,796.1,802.7,"If we're trying to find out what the parties meant, why wouldn't we look to see what they meant at the time the contract was formed?"
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,802.7,806.93,"Well, because, again, it's -- what the contract that they chose used an important verb."
2015.14-462,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,835.72,840.91,"So, Mr. Landau, let's assume you're right, that this is a really bad mistake when it comes to arbitration."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,848.25,848.43,Correct.
2015.14-462,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,848.43,850.865,-- when State courts interpret State law.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,907.475,908.06,Fair enough.
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,975.13,977.225,How do we draw the line between --
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,977.225,978.09,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,978.09,983.35,How do we draw the line between wrong and the standards you're arguing?
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,983.35,987.255,"Your Honor, again, I think -- I was quoting to you the language from Volt."
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1008.5,1009.94,I'm back to my point.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1011.705,1011.94,Right.
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1011.94,1020.715,The South passed statute after statute like the city in the statutes and so forth to try to prevent the equal protection clause from being implemented.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1040.07,1040.62,Well --
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1040.62,1045.32,"They've gone that far, because we think the State would interpret the State law this way."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1047.96,1048.56,"Well, again, Your Honor --"
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1048.56,1055.46,We'd have to say an interpretation of a contract where that interpretation is -- is what?
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1055.46,1056.87,Please go back to Volt.
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1056.87,1058.5,What -- I'm looking for the standard.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1058.5,1059.36,Is not --
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1059.36,1060.49,You read me the words.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1061.97,1062.29,Okay.
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1062.29,1064.23,It said they have to conform with Federal --
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1064.23,1064.58,"Well, no."
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1068.45,1073.12,That looks like we're the supervisor of all State contract interpretation judges.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1073.12,1073.56,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1092.82,1106.85,"My other suggestion -- we're not going to make too much progress on finding the standard, but California does accept requests from us, or other Federal courts, to explain what California law is."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1114.87,1115.89,"Because, again, Your Honor --"
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1115.89,1117.53,They have not considered this case.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1117.53,1121.505,They -- they denied certiorari over the -- one of the justices.
2015.14-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.5,1172.71,"Why -- give us all the reasons why this case is on the wrong side of the line. Justice Breyer has -- has mentioned the -- the rule of contra proferentem, that you interpret a -- a contract against -- against the person who drafted it. Now, that's on the other side."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1177.895,1181.81,"I think, Your Honor, you started out by, one, that you want a contract to be valid."
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1187.0,1188.725,Make what unenforceable?
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1188.725,1190.07,The arbitration agreement.
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1190.07,1194.65,"No, the arbitration agreement was enforceable in lots of situations."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1194.65,1196.16,"No, Your Honor --"
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1196.16,1199.48,There was no agreement to arbitrate class actions.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1199.48,1199.76,Right.
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1199.99,1203.945,But there was an agreement to arbitrate other disputes.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1203.945,1204.47,That's not their --
2015.14-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1204.47,1205.985,And single disputes.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1205.985,1212.37,Their position is that the arbitration provision is entirely unenforceable in this case.
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1235.51,1237.26,"Go back to Justice Scalia, please."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1264.87,1265.49,Right.
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1265.49,1265.92,-- business.
2015.14-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1274.64,1275.63,Of course.
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1275.63,1275.91,All right.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1276.7,1277.225,Right.
2015.14-462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1277.225,1278.68,"Now, is there any another?"
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1278.68,1286.535,"There's another one, Your Honor that in Section 10 here, there's a choice of law provision specifically addressing the arbitration clause."
2015.14-462,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1321.91,1341.01,"Mr. Landau, I completely take your point as to what the parties must have wanted, and it does make this State court opinion unsatisfying, would be a kind word for it, but -- but, you know, in fairness to the State court, part of the problem was the way this contract was worded."
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1378.79,1384.34,"Your Honor, but, again, wrongness is not what you do here, but this is an arbitration contract."
2015.14-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1386.77,1388.49,"Did you draft this provision, Mr. Landau?"
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1388.49,1391.31,"I did not, Your Honor. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1391.31,1395.15,"But, again, I -- I -- I am not defensive about the way this was drafted."
2015.14-462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1395.15,1395.33,How --
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1395.33,1396.12,They said State --
2015.14-462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1396.12,1402.365,"How was the provision changed? Now, this provision is no longer in DIRECTV contracts; is that right?"
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1402.365,1403.25,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2015.14-462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1403.25,1407.365,"And what -- what -- it was taken out, and what was put in instead?"
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1407.365,1424.0,"The new provision, Your Honor, which I have here, it says -- it just -- it takes out the word ""State law"" and just says ""if this is unenforceable."" And, again, the -- but the reason it said State law was not to suggest that inoperative State law should do it."
2015.14-462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1433.16,1440.08,Do we have -- do we have someplace that has the change that was made in the language of the contract?
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1440.08,1441.15,"I do, Your Honor."
2015.14-462,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1550.85,1568.175,But the -- Volt says the law of the place interprets the law of the place exactly in the way -- or allows that interpretation exactly in the way that this State court interpreted it. The law of the place was just the law of the State unmodified by any possibly preempting Federal law.
2015.14-462,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1568.175,1568.42,Right.
2015.14-462,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1603.045,1606.91,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein."
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1606.91,1619.5,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is a reprise of Oxford Health. The argument of the party that wanted arbitration in Oxford Health, is that the arbitrator had just gotten it terribly wrong under this Court's decision in Stolt-Nielsen."
2015.14-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1657.58,1658.4,"No, but that's --"
2015.14-462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1658.4,1659.21,So if you said that --
2015.14-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1659.21,1661.12,If -- that may be a problem with the FAA.
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1710.225,1710.69,"So, sir --"
2015.14-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1710.69,1723.91,"In other words, I understand -- I'm sympathetic to the notion that this is a matter of State contract interpretation, but that is precisely what the FAA was getting after, State judges interpreting contracts under special rules hostile to arbitration."
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1723.91,1744.83,"So, Mr. Chief Justice, if I could deal with your real concern about where this statute comes from, the idea that this is kind of the core discrimination against arbitration that the statute is after kind of structurally and then what exactly happened in this case. The root of the FAA -- and it's reflected in the -- in the statutory text in Section 2 -- is that State courts were adopting doctrines that were hostile to arbitration."
2015.14-462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1781.32,1784.05,I'm not sure that I understand what you're arguing.
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1784.05,1784.25,Sure.
2015.14-462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.25,1798.1,You're arguing that the -- the FAA does not cover State gimmicks that disfavor arbitration so as long as what they say is there is no arbitration agreement in the first place.
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1798.1,1800.115,"No, Justice Scalia, don't -- don't misunderstand me."
2015.14-462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.09,1801.7,That's what you said.
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1801.7,1810.68,"I apologize, then. If the Court were to conclude that this is just an effort to discriminate against arbitration, then I think the Court has doctrines, and the lower courts have doctrines."
2015.14-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1824.54,1827.52,So if we were to look to determine whether it is --
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1827.52,1827.67,Yeah.
2015.14-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1827.67,1829.55,"-- surely, that's a Federal question."
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1829.55,1830.195,Yes.
2015.14-462,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1858.5,1884.595,"That's exactly what Volt says, what Mr. Landau quoted, is ""Due regard must be given to the Federal"" -- in interpreting a contract. We're talking about interpreting the intent of the parties -- ""Due regard must be given to the Federal policy favoring arbitration and ambiguities"" -- we could ask whether or not this clause is -- this statute is ambiguous -- ""and so the scope of the arbitration agreement must be resolved in favor of arbitration."""
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1884.595,1884.86,Okay.
2015.14-462,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1885.92,1896.43,"Now, if this was a State law contract looking at State law principles, but there is a Federal rule that must be followed in -- in making that interpretation, and that is a matter for us to review."
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1896.43,1896.74,Okay.
2015.14-462,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1971.615,1990.82,"I guess I just don't understand, then, Mr. Goldstein -- and maybe it's the same question that Justice Scalia asked -- I don't see why it's better somehow to discriminate against arbitration by declaring arbitration agreements unenforceable writ large than it is by narrowing the scope of arbitration agreements unfairly."
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1990.82,1991.09,Okay.
2015.14-462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.0,2030.92,"What he'll say, I think, is -- we certainly pressed him on it enough -- is that the -- read the sentence, the relevant sentence."
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2120.705,2126.7,"First, is that there is no administrable line that he can identify between something that's wrong and really, really wrong."
2015.14-462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2169.84,2179.865,"But does California have a law, a valid law that would find the agreement to dispense with class action unenforceable? Does it or doesn't it?"
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2179.865,2180.54,It does.
2015.14-462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2181.305,2182.045,It does.
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2189.11,2190.11,In several respects.
2015.14-462,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2202.05,2217.1,"But you have to agree with Justice Breyer -- or do you not -- that California interpreted this contract as saying if there is an invalid State law that prohibits arbitration, then that's binding on us."
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2217.1,2217.44,Okay.
2015.14-462,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2217.44,2218.79,That's what you're saying.
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2218.79,2232.255,"We don't, Your Honor. So remember, my point is this: If you and I have a contract to follow that State law, which is this is a contract, then it's not invalid because Concepcion and preemption only apply when the State forces you to do something."
2015.14-462,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2233.11,2233.51,"Well, sure."
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2239.87,2240.13,Right.
2015.14-462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.15,2269.04,"That's one horrible, and the horrible on the other side is if we -- if we agree with you, the States can do whatever they want to -- to invalidate arbitration agreements so long as they're doing it under the guise of contract interpretation."
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2270.68,2272.69,"It is -- is a possible horrible, Justice Scalia."
2015.14-462,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2301.68,2322.735,"Well, if we could see a State court opinion that doesn't say anything that is explicitly against arbitration, but it interprets a contract in such a strange way that the only possible explanation for the interpretation is hostility to arbitration, can that be invalidated?"
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2322.735,2324.22,"I think so, Your Honor. And --"
2015.14-462,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2324.22,2326.92,So that's the question. Does this case fall to that category?
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2326.92,2327.07,All right.
2015.14-462,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2347.61,2349.34,"Well, you say that's not the Volt principle."
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2361.35,2367.63,"Okay, Justice Kennedy. Because in my -- I may be mistaken, but I think that you and Justice Alito are describing two different legal rules."
2015.14-462,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2401.865,2406.25,"And add to that, what did the Ninth Circuit say about this? The Ninth Circuit said it was absurd."
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2407.055,2407.92,"Yeah, it was --"
2015.14-462,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2407.92,2408.01,Right.
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2408.01,2408.665,-- nonsensical.
2015.14-462,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2408.665,2412.08,"Nonsensical. If we agreed with the Ninth Circuit that it was nonsensical, we --"
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2412.08,2415.68,"I mean, I just don't want to -- I don't want to play around with words, Your Honor, about nonsensical or not."
2015.14-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2623.04,2627.49,I guess I don't understand why it's a question of way out of bounds or slightly out of bounds.
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2667.035,2667.35,Okay.
2015.14-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2688.33,2697.7,"That's -- I understand the point and -- but, as I understand the arbitration law, if you have an arbitration agreement, says you're going to arbitrate workplace disputes, but not safety disputes --"
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2697.7,2698.04,Yes.
2015.14-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2698.04,2702.665,"-- and if there's an issue, is this a safety dispute or not, that's covered by the arbitration agreement."
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2723.925,2725.07,Excellent.
2015.14-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2757.44,2763.01,"Well, but just clear up, there is an agreement to arbitrate some disputes between DIRECTV and its customers."
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2763.01,2763.47,Your Honor --
2015.14-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2763.47,2764.75,It's the arbitration agreement.
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2764.75,2766.27,"Your Honor, so -- if I could just distinguish."
2015.14-462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2884.24,2889.945,"It may be, but that's quite different from the question of whether there was an arbitration agreement."
2015.14-462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2909.14,2911.755,There is no doubt that there was an agreement.
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2918.325,2927.29,"Okay. Justice Scalia, what I am saying is you -- I -- you and I agree, but the consequence of the place we disagree is important; that is, you and I agree that this is in the contract."
2015.14-462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2946.48,2947.01,It may have.
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2950.75,2950.985,Yeah.
2015.14-462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2950.985,2956.375,"Because it's in my mind, and I'd like you to respond to it, if you wish."
2015.14-462,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3027.665,3038.16,"Justice Breyer, there's one threshold point that needs to be made, and that is five members of the Court in Concepcion, as I understand their opinions, would not have applied Concepcion in this circumstance."
2015.14-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3245.88,3249.235,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Landau, you have three minutes remaining."
2015.14-462,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3249.235,3249.98,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2015.14-462,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3306.64,3306.98,Excuse me.
2015.14-462,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3338.795,3341.7,"Because prior to Concepcion, State law was valid."
2015.14-462,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3342.42,3343.45,"No, it wasn't."
2015.14-462,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3345.41,3346.58,"Well, Your Honor, but it's hard --"
2015.14-462,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3346.58,3347.57,And -- and it's preempted forever.
2015.14-462,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3347.57,3349.23,And it would have been futile to make that argument.
2015.14-462,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3352.82,3357.35,Probably could have done what happened here and bring it up to the Supreme Court.
2015.14-462,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3357.35,3362.885,"Well, again, you know, hats off to AT&T for doing that, but there are futility doctrines that recognize that not everybody has to do that."
2015.14-462,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3362.885,3366.46,And how far does this go? When do we make this judgment?
2015.14-462,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3366.46,3376.04,"Again, Your Honor, you could decide this case on the ground, as the Chamber of Commerce urged in its amicus brief, that this is so far beyond the pale as an interpretation, that it can only be explained as discrimination."
2015.14-462,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3395.03,3399.86,So why -- why is it that it's so farfetched --
2015.14-462,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3399.86,3401.53,It's so farfetched --
2015.14-462,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3401.53,3415.665,-- to place the legitimacy of this action at the time the complaint is filed as opposed to three years later or the day before a trial or the day after a trial before judgment is entered?
2015.14-462,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3415.665,3416.64,Because the parties use --
2015.14-462,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3416.64,3420.76,You could come in and make a motion at any of those times.
2015.14-462,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3423.215,3423.63,They use --
2015.14-462,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3423.63,3426.71,-- have to be at the time that you make your --
2015.14-462,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3426.71,3428.77,"Because they use the verb tense ""would find,"" Your Honor."
2015.14-462,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3464.83,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
