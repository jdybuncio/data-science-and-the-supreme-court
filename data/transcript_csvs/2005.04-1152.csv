2005.04-1152,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.959,We'll hear argument first this morning in Rumsfeld versus Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights.
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,7.386,10.824,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,61.398,78.703,"When you say that it asks what other employers receive, but these institutions, I gather, would not allow other employers, who have the same policy against the hiring of homosexuals, to interview at their institutions."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,84.58,89.956,"Well, I think, Justice Scalia, that you have to look at the... I think, the statute in two steps."
2005.04-1152,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,99.947,107.417,"Yes, but it says... I thought it says that the military must have equal access with any other employer."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,112.876,117.158,"Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, I think there's several points to be made in response to that."
2005.04-1152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,133.158,137.984,"Well, that's fine, but you were the one that made the argument that they want the same access as other employers."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,138.267,139.578,--And what--
2005.04-1152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,139.578,140.161,--when you... I just--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,140.161,140.411,--what I would say--
2005.04-1152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,140.411,143.349,"--want to make sure what the calculus is, at the outset."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,143.349,154.351,"--Well, and Justice Kennedy, I think the point I would say is, in terms of gaining access to campus, we want to gain access at a level, and under circumstances, that perhaps some other employer would be excluded."
2005.04-1152,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,198.87,201.559,"The constitutional argument, I guess, is,"
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,213.655,216.343,"That's exactly right, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-1152,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,216.343,216.459,All right.
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,216.926,217.592,"And, of course, we take the--"
2005.04-1152,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,217.592,217.776,"--So, then what you're saying, it--"
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,217.776,218.62,--position that--
2005.04-1152,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,218.62,224.312,"--and then what's the answer to that question, ""Does the Constitution""... how does the... what's the answer?"
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,224.312,229.522,"--I think there's... I mean, there's... the Constitution is... has no difficulty with such a statute."
2005.04-1152,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,242.879,242.879,"Well, your argument--"
2005.04-1152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,242.879,247.744,"No, but it seems me you've got us off galloping in the wrong direction."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,299.329,300.856,"I think that's right, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,302.683,302.683,General--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,302.683,302.683,I think there is this debate--
2005.04-1152,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,302.683,309.486,"Yes, but it is an important question, because the... there is an amicus brief that says, ""Go read the statute""."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,338.044,339.722,"--Well, a couple of points, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,428.145,428.828,May I interrupt with one--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,428.828,428.945,--Sure.
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,428.945,429.822,--brief question?
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,435.448,441.668,"As a regulatory matter, the military took the position that if they simply barred access to--"
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,441.668,441.885,No--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,441.885,442.218,--anybody--
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,442.218,443.429,--not the regulatory matter.
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,444.273,447.812,"--I think you could read the statute either way on that question, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-1152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,493.492,493.575,--General--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,493.575,493.942,But I think--
2005.04-1152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,493.942,508.276,"--Clement, do I understand, with respect to that brief that offered a statutory interpretation to avoid a constitutional question, your answer is, that would be an unreasonable interpretation of the statute that we now have?"
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,527.176,529.781,"--No, that's true, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-1152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.112,616.55,What does Title X of the United States Code deal with?
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,616.55,618.904,--It deals with the military.
2005.04-1152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.904,637.888,"Why do you chose to defend this principally on the basis of the Spending Clause, and not on the basis of what it... what it was, seemed to me, enacted in order to achieve, and that is the congressional power to raise and support armies."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,637.888,647.213,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think the statute is clearly supported under both provisions, under the spending authority and the Article I authority to raise and support armies."
2005.04-1152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,724.667,724.917,That would--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,724.917,725.117,--seems--
2005.04-1152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,725.117,726.344,--be rather farfetched.
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,740.534,745.494,"--Well, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I'm not sure I understand why not."
2005.04-1152,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,833.522,862.014,"--Okay, but even if you do that, you're still left, it seems to me, with the problem... whether you characterize the problem as discriminatory and antidiscriminatory university policy or not, you're still left with a speech problem that they raise, that, in effect, you are forcing them, in effect, to underwrite your speech, up to a point, and you are forcing them to change their own message."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,873.61,883.085,"I think that's exactly right Justice Souter, and I think those arguments would be the same even if what was going on here was a concern about the military's other policies."
2005.04-1152,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,891.066,891.566,"So, discrimination--"
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,891.566,891.766,--the university--
2005.04-1152,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,891.766,895.431,"--or no discrimination, you've got a speech issue that you're going to address."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,895.431,895.698,--I agree.
2005.04-1152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.158,937.596,"It happens, in this case, to be specifically authorized by the Constitution."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,937.596,949.526,"--It does, indeed, Justice Scalia, and I think, though... I mean, there is this sense in which we certainly concede that there maybe some incidental speech involved; certainly, the military recruiters are engaged in speech."
2005.04-1152,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,952.975,963.049,"No, but you're making a... if I understand what you're saying, you are making a kind of O'Brien argument that the... that the burden on speech, whatever it may be, is an incidental burden to something else."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,998.922,1008.414,"--Well, Justice Souter, I guess... I'm inferring that you're drawing that conclusion from some of the statements of some of the floor sponsors about their purposes enacting the Solomon Amendment."
2005.04-1152,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1009.925,1010.091,I don't--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1010.091,1010.458,--I don't think--
2005.04-1152,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1010.458,1013.312,--know of any other reason for the Solomon Amendment.
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1013.312,1024.231,"--Well, I think the reason for the Solomon Amendment is to ensure that military recruiters, in fact, have an equal opportunity to recruit the same pool of individuals that all the other employers are trying--"
2005.04-1152,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1024.231,1024.698,But--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1024.698,1025.791,--to recruit.
2005.04-1152,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1025.791,1038.683,"--But they're... but the Solomon Amendment, in order to accomplish that, is addressed to a particular expressive problem which occurs for the military... and for the law schools, for that matter... in law school recruiting."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1066.314,1072.523,"Well, if by... ""the expressive objective"" you're talking about is the military's own recruiting, I guess--"
2005.04-1152,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1072.523,1073.484,"No, this express--"
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1073.484,1073.917,--I agree with you.
2005.04-1152,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1073.917,1079.16,"--Yes, but the expressive objective is, the law schools are taking a position on first amendment grounds."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1103.453,1105.291,"No, I would disagree, Justice Souter."
2005.04-1152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.034,1136.62,"You cannot convert a law into a law directed at the first... at first amendment rights, can you, by simply saying,"
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1153.081,1154.842,"Absolutely not, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1152,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1166.606,1166.606,"Well, in--"
2005.04-1152,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1166.606,1170.888,"Well, let me ask another question that may shed a little light on it."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1199.757,1201.267,"Yes, they can, Justice O'Connor."
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.447,1213.897,But--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1213.897,1215.741,--nothing in the Act that prevents the universities--
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1215.741,1215.907,--Let me ask you--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1215.907,1216.141,--from disclaiming--
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1216.141,1219.239,"--this question, to follow up on Justice O'Connor's thought."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1256.361,1269.236,"--Well, Justice Stevens, I would say, to the... I think, the main thrust of your question, no, which is to say that if what you have in mind is really forcing them to go to the undergraduate campus, I think the military would take the position that that's not equal in scope."
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1269.919,1276.539,But is it not equal because of the message it sends or because it denies the opportunity to recruit as effectively?
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1276.539,1278.299,"--It's the latter, Justice Stevens, and only the latter--"
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1278.299,1284.852,What if I had an example where they were equal... equally effective as recruitment avenues.
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1293.083,1293.845,"--I mean, my own--"
2005.04-1152,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1293.845,1295.439,Sort of like a separate but equal.
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.439,1296.105,Yes.
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1296.105,1297.033,"--Well, I mean--"
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1302.575,1302.825,"So, the--"
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1302.825,1302.925,--hypothetical.
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1302.925,1312.066,"--the point I'm trying to make is, Does your agreement, that you can engage in speech by posting banners or handing a note, apply to symbolic speech--"
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1312.066,1312.466,It could--
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1312.466,1314.837,--the kind of conduct that is symbolic speech?
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1314.837,1316.598,"--It could apply to some symbolic speech, I believe."
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1335.687,1335.687,"No, that's a functional--"
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1335.687,1337.697,"--the main campus, which is a mile and a half away."
2005.04-1152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1337.697,1338.375,But the--
2005.04-1152,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1338.375,1338.375,--That's a functional difference.
2005.04-1152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1338.375,1342.757,"--the resistance to any statute, I assume, could be justified as symbolic speech."
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1342.757,1350.804,"Well, and I think... I mean, I'm... I think that some resistance by some parts of the university might be fine."
2005.04-1152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1361.557,1364.078,"--General Clement, can you be affirmative now?"
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1396.585,1405.66,"I mean, concretely, they could put signs on the bulletin board next to the door, they could engage in speech, they could help organize student protests."
2005.04-1152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1411.036,1421.027,"You mean, they could organize a student protest at the hiring interview rooms, so that everybody jeers when the applicant comes in the door and the school could organize that?"
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1421.027,1421.954,--The school could--
2005.04-1152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1421.954,1422.12,As... when it's--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1422.12,1422.32,--organize--
2005.04-1152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1422.32,1434.633,"--when it's, say, a job fair, and all the employers are there, but then they jeer just the... and the school organizes a line jeering the... both the recruiters and the applicants, that's equal access?"
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1434.633,1436.56,--I think that would be equal access.
2005.04-1152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1438.154,1439.015,I'm surprised that--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1439.015,1439.015,--here between--
2005.04-1152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1439.015,1439.631,--you think that--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1439.631,1443.297,"--between access and allowing the speech, but I think it... you have to be--"
2005.04-1152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.297,1445.391,"You're not going to be an Army recruiter, are you?"
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1448.673,1461.619,"--I don't think the military and the Army recruiters... and I... and I won't be one of them... but I think the Army recruiters are not worried about being confronted with speech, they're worried about actually not being allowed onto the same law schools--"
2005.04-1152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1461.619,1462.529,"--Well, worried about--"
2005.04-1152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1462.529,1465.134,--having students driven off.
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1470.928,1476.304,"--I don't know if it would fulfill every purpose, but I think the amendment has to accommodate the first amendment--"
2005.04-1152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1476.304,1476.387,--You think if you--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1476.387,1476.587,--interests at--
2005.04-1152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1476.587,1476.687,--have jeering--
2005.04-1152,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1476.687,1476.904,--a university.
2005.04-1152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1476.904,1483.857,--jeering and picketing if a black person came to recruit and people didn't... and a school faculty didn't like blacks?
