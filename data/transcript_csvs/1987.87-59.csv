1987.87-59,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.406,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 87-59, United States Postal Service v. National Association of Letter Carriers."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,13.974,17.093,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-59,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,93.843,95.628,"May I ask you a factual question, Mr. Nager."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,106.269,108.802,"--Justice Stevens, I really do not know the answer to that."
1987.87-59,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,116.558,119.093,It is kind of hard to understand how mail that old could be.
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,121.279,127.099,"I think that is probably right, but the record does not reflect it, and I just do not know."
1987.87-59,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,127.099,130.467,"Was any of that junk mail, or was it all good mail, I mean if it was junk mail--"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,130.467,135.169,"The U.S. Treasury checks, I doubt were junk mail."
1987.87-59,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.096,184.786,"Mr. Nager, I take it that there has been a stay entered, so that this employee has not been back on the job?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,184.786,186.119,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1987.87-59,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.522,197.843,"And the case is not moot, because the employee still wants to return to being a letter carrier?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,197.843,198.759,"Yes, that is right."
1987.87-59,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,211.436,219.84,"Mr. Nager, what is the connection between compulsive gambling on the one hand and not delivering mail on the other?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,219.84,223.161,"Justice Blackmun, the record does not reflect it."
1987.87-59,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,252.93,256.882,It is a little easier to understand if it was alcoholism.
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,261.267,261.619,No.
1987.87-59,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,342.202,350.991,"Mr. Nager, in this case, there is a statute that provides that delivery of the mail is the highest priority of the Postal Service."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,350.991,351.541,That is correct.
1987.87-59,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.541,367.185,"On the other hand, there are statutes saying that the Postal Service will engage in collective bargaining, and there are statutes reflecting that rehabilitation is also appropriate for the employer to consider."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,380.243,387.147,I think that it is clearly the case where Congress has indicated what the highest priority is among several competing statutes.
1987.87-59,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,390.551,392.585,And if there were not such language?
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,392.585,401.574,"If there were not such language, I think that the Court would, as it does in every case in which it is faced with statutes."
1987.87-59,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,401.574,405.16,With competing public policies?
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,405.16,405.611,Correct.
1987.87-59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,415.75,421.487,"But Mr. Nager, labor arbitration has a high priority, too, does it not?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,421.487,423.522,"It does, Justice Brennan."
1987.87-59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,442.651,446.37,You are arguing for a public policy exception?
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,446.37,449.222,"Yes, as this Court has recognized."
1987.87-59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,451.09,457.578,"It has been recognized, but to be kept in very narrow limits, is it not?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,457.578,458.244,--That is correct.
1987.87-59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,594.282,599.02,"Well, Mr. Nager, I do not think that your opposition challenges the existence of a public policy exception."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,610.328,613.28,"I think that is correct, Justice White, and let me turn to that."
1987.87-59,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,622.719,629.222,"Let me ask before you get to that, because this is brought to my mind by your reference to the Kaiser case."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,640.43,642.549,We have not disputed that in this case.
1987.87-59,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,642.549,655.873,"So the case that we have to decide is one in which we could assume arguendo that the parties had spelled out that if this particular problem should arise in the future, that this solution will be given, that this will be the solution."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,659.475,660.927,That is correct.
1987.87-59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.097,726.369,Do I understand from what you say that it would have been illegal for the Postal Department to have complied with this arbitration award?
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,726.369,731.273,"That is absolutely correct, Justice White, and let me turn to why that is the case."
1987.87-59,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.273,747.799,"Before you do, it really might help both the employer and the union in those situations as well as help the courts if we made it pretty clear, as I thought that we had done in Misco, what the lines are."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,766.161,766.563,No.
1987.87-59,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.563,769.648,I thought that we just had a case that is very much like this.
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,769.648,772.35,We think that it is fundamentally different from this case.
1987.87-59,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,876.584,881.988,"Of course, that mandate if broadly read could certainly override anything."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,896.931,899.2,"That is absolutely correct, Justice O'Connor."
1987.87-59,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,956.869,967.694,"But how about an employee who is just slow, just not very efficient; he did not steal the mail, but the employee just moved slowly?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,967.694,974.665,"--That is an act of misfeasance by the employee, but it is not an act of statutory malfeasance."
1987.87-59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,992.126,995.994,"Well, the Court of Appeals certainly did not think that it violated any statute."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,995.994,1014.825,The Postal Service looked at the statute and said that in order... the Court of Appeals said in order for us to agree not to enforce this arbitration award that we have to find a provision in the statute which says in its terms that the Postal Service cannot employ an individual who has committed this act or who presents a threat to the Postal Service.
1987.87-59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.598,1025.498,It was not required in Misco either.
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1025.498,1027.55,It was not required in Misco.
1987.87-59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.417,1039.373,"I thought that you said that it would have been illegal, illegal for the Postal Service to rehire this fellow."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1039.373,1046.194,"That is how we read our own statutory obligations, to preclude us from employing an individual."
1987.87-59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.194,1050.081,"The Court of Appeals certainly rejected that notion, I think."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1050.081,1052.448,"Well, it did, we think incorrectly."
1987.87-59,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.762,1087.469,"Maybe not, but have we not required a judgment on the part of the person who has been given that call that is so outrageous that no reasonable person could come to it."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1102.062,1103.514,"No, we are not arguing that at all."
1987.87-59,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1116.838,1126.443,"What is the rule then, that whenever any Postal Service employee has committed a crime involving the mails that he must be dismissed?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1126.443,1139.603,Unless the arbitrator makes a factual finding based on the evidence presented at the arbitration hearing that he finds that there is not a risk that the misconduct will occur again in the future.
1987.87-59,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.603,1142.389,"No risk, zero risk."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1144.841,1155.697,"When I say no risk, that he does not find the basis of the facts before him that there is a undue risk that that misconduct will occur again in the future."
1987.87-59,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1155.697,1161.184,"Well, did he not make that finding here, undue in the sense of the policy of trying to rehabilitate people?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1161.184,1166.087,What the arbitrator said in this case was that he found the risk.
1987.87-59,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1246.372,1261.299,"Here the arbitrator's findings, if I remember correctly, were to the effect that the arbitrator is not totally persuaded that the employee presently has the emotional ability to perform the work in an acceptable manner."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1272.44,1273.24,That is correct.
1987.87-59,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1305.078,1315.784,"Well, suppose we agreed with you, what is the remedy, is it to remand to the arbitrator for a more appropriate remedy or new findings?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1315.784,1317.719,"I do not think so, Justice O'Connor."
1987.87-59,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1348.774,1361.765,It just seems to me that your rule is really going to displace the arbitrator's judgment in most cases of discharge for wrongful acts.
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1385.277,1387.713,"Justice Kennedy, let me make two comments."
1987.87-59,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1408.81,1413.446,What was your answer with respect to the question about theft from the mails?
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1413.446,1416.398,Theft from the mail is statutorily prohibited.
1987.87-59,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1423.319,1427.956,"My point is that realistically that finding simply cannot be made, can it?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1427.956,1433.325,"I do not dispute the difficulty of making clinical judgments, Justice Kennedy."
1987.87-59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.947,1495.332,I thought that you agreed that the arbitrator would make decisions like this.
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1495.332,1501.152,We have agreed that the arbitrator would make the decision as to whether or not there is a future risk.
1987.87-59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1512.794,1518.898,"I know, but that is up to him to decide whether there was cause for the discharge."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1518.898,1519.8,That is correct.
1987.87-59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1519.8,1526.37,"That is not only making these findings, but deciding whether... construing the word cause in the contract."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1526.37,1527.354,That is correct.
1987.87-59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.354,1528.989,"And that is his job, and he did it."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1528.989,1529.706,"That is correct, he did."
1987.87-59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.483,1582.54,"Would you be here if he had not been a compulsive gambler, but he just had been negligent, he just was a lousy Postal Service man?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1582.54,1599.918,"If he had just been a negligent or lousy Postal Service employee, he would not have met what we consider to be the threshold standard for these cases, that he had engaged in conduct that would have put him in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1703 and that there would not be a risk for him."
1987.87-59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1599.918,1607.406,"Well, he certainly would have these 3500 letters undelivered which would have been a crime."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1607.406,1615.993,"Not if he were just negligent in doing so, again--"
1987.87-59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1615.993,1625.784,"In the findings in this case, there is no causal connection between his gambling and the non-delivery."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1625.784,1627.401,That is what the arbitrator found.
1987.87-59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.945,1648.38,"You are bound by some of them, and you do not want to be bound by some others."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1648.38,1650.482,--We think that we are bound by all of them.
1987.87-59,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1650.482,1660.521,"Given those findings, you could not put him in a job where he could not steal mail, you really say that there is no way that you can accept his findings without violating the law?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1660.521,1661.289,That is correct.
1987.87-59,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1661.289,1661.773,I cannot believe.
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1671.079,1689.357,"We are not suggesting that if the Letter Carriers in their grievance had said he did it, but he has got a problem, would you put him in another job where he does not have access to the mails, that if the arbitrator found that that was contractually appropriate, that that would put us in violation of our statutory mandate."
1987.87-59,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.357,1691.309,To prevent that?
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1691.309,1693.243,His order says reinstatement.
1987.87-59,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1704.616,1705.568,May I clear up one factual thing.
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1712.139,1713.272,This is not a theft case.
1987.87-59,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1713.272,1714.341,It is just a delay case.
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1714.341,1714.958,Unlawful delay.
1987.87-59,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1714.958,1717.96,He just left unopened and undelivered mail in his case.
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1717.96,1724.114,And did not report it back to the Postal Service that he has failed to deliver it at the end of the day.
1987.87-59,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.114,1726.732,"And the criminal proceeding did not involve any theft, it was just delay?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1726.732,1729.934,It was a guilty plea for unlawful delay.
1987.87-59,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1729.934,1739.706,"And did that criminal proceeding require scienter, does the statute require an intent to violate?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1739.706,1743.074,"I believe it does, although I will have to--"
1987.87-59,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1743.074,1747.11,My reading is that gross negligence would suffice for a violation.
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1747.11,1755.299,"Well, again, if you put the term gross negligence on it, Justice Kennedy, you have got one of those statutory acts of misfeasance."
1987.87-59,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1778.914,1794.274,"Maybe you have not had the opportunity to do this, but can you tell me, is this an unusual statement of mission, or does every agency have a statement that its primary mission is to perform certain functions?"
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1794.274,1795.357,Every agency--
1987.87-59,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1795.357,1800.745,"Because it seems to me that what you are saying is, as we go through the statutes, that we could find this in every agency in the government."
1987.87-59,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1801.696,1808.35,"--You will find it with respect to every employer who has statutory obligations, some of whom do not have to be agencies in government."
1987.87-59,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.203,1839.253,"Thank you, Mr. Nager."
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,1844.189,1846.391,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1895.722,1912.001,"Well, they can happen, but I am not sure that the Union would lie down for having him reinstated in some other job on the grounds that there is a risk of his repeating his conduct."
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,1912.001,1914.703,"Justice White, I do not think that is a fair presumption."
1987.87-59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.891,1930.962,Maybe we ought to dismiss the case as improvidently granted then.
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,1930.962,1944.639,"Well, I think that the point is that the risk to the security of the mails that is posed by the government does not exist here, because, and we have not contested, there are other things that can happen here."
1987.87-59,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1956.03,1965.985,"Does not reinstatement require reinstatement to that job or an equivalent one, and is not this person a letter carrier?"
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,1965.985,1968.151,"Yes, this person is a letter carrier, but there are."
1987.87-59,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1968.151,1976.674,"So he has got to go back into a letter carrier's position that is equivalent, that position of an equivalent one."
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,1976.674,1979.476,The answer is that he can be kept in the office.
1987.87-59,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1982.428,1986.197,You are saying that the Post Office can just keep him on the payroll and not give him any duties.
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,1986.197,1989.164,"No, he can sort mail within the office."
1987.87-59,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2007.792,2018.314,"Are you saying that you would not be here if the order said that he is reinstated to his previous position, subject to the conditions?"
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,2018.314,2030.039,"Even if the award said that, what I am in effect conceding is that under our contract and under postal regulations that the Postal Service is not locked into sending this man out on the street."
1987.87-59,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2031.257,2033.443,Does the case turn on that?
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,2033.443,2035.643,I think that is one possible disposition.
1987.87-59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.186,2082.274,The Postal Service says that it would have been illegal for them to retain this man on the payroll.
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,2082.274,2082.657,That is right.
1987.87-59,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2259.537,2268.393,I thought that the evidence showed that some of these pieces of mail found in his personal automobile had been there for a year.
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,2272.614,2273.914,That is true.
1987.87-59,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2275.831,2281.135,"I mean this was an extended period of time, and we are not talking about junk mail."
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,2281.135,2284.937,"Well, actually, for the most part, we are talking about junk mail."
1987.87-59,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2430.816,2441.123,"Mr. Secular, at page 22(a) of the award, of the arbitrator's opinion, it says,"
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,2452.931,2453.464,That is right.
1987.87-59,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2503.28,2503.714,Yes.
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,2532.899,2540.137,"Well, let me respond to that question, which I think goes to the heart of the case in this manner."
1987.87-59,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2713.098,2718.152,"You are not saying that it does not have any application in Post Office matters, are you?"
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,2718.152,2718.552,"No, no."
1987.87-59,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2776.19,2784.463,Suppose the arbitrator said that there was a high risk of recurrence?
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,2784.463,2786.863,That goes to how the statute is interpreted.
1987.87-59,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2796.771,2799.306,"But we interpret the statute, I take it?"
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,2799.306,2800.173,--That is right.
1987.87-59,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2900.354,2905.658,But you are saying that just cause will always be synonymous with the public policy?
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,2905.658,2907.442,I think that it can be in the Postal Service.
1987.87-59,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2907.442,2910.36,"But that is up to the arbitrator, I take it?"
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,2910.36,2920.835,"Well, I think that the arbitrator will not interpret or does not have to say that just cause means that I will read the statute."
1987.87-59,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2983.342,2986.277,You do have a plea of guilty to a criminal offense.
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,2986.277,2988.396,That is right.
1987.87-59,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3036.608,3042.179,But that is usual punishment that Congress provides for the violation of a criminal statute.
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,3055.237,3064.008,"Well, there are actually some statutes which do provide for loss of federal employment, and the striker example is one key example here."
1987.87-59,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3083.922,3088.91,You could say the same of someone who was convicted of theft from the mails.
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,3104.169,3116.31,"Um... I think the public policy, I would suggest that the criminal statutes are not a basis for that kind of public policy inquiry."
1987.87-59,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3148.864,3160.922,"Mr. Secular, on the other side of the coin, there have been instances where people have been acquitted of a postal violation and still discharged from the Postal Office."
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,3160.922,3162.022,That is correct.
1987.87-59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.263,3400.409,"Do I understand that you say that the public policy exception is limited as to the circumstances that the Court of Appeals stated, that the award must actually command illegal conduct?"
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,3400.409,3404.98,I think that is the issue in this case given the way that it has been postulated.
1987.87-59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3404.98,3409.348,That is your standard for the public policy exception?
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,3409.348,3409.815,Yes.
1987.87-59,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3409.815,3420.506,"It has to command it, it would not be enough if no reasonable person could believe other than it would result in illegal conduct?"
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,3426.727,3430.362,I used the crystal ball example before.
1987.87-59,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3439.867,3452.211,"If a reasonable person would have to come to the conclusion that it would result in the violation of a statute, surely, that would be enough, would it not, if that is the only conclusion that a reasonable person could draw?"
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,3452.211,3454.311,I would agree with that proposition in the abstract.
1987.87-59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3490.836,3505.846,"But do you not think that the Court of Appeals has adopted in several cases the standard that there is no violation of public policy in enforcing an award, unless the award orders illegal conduct?"
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,3505.846,3506.212,Yes.
1987.87-59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3523.304,3527.323,But what if it is not limited to commanding illegal conduct?
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,3527.323,3535.196,"Well, I do not see how a possibility of a theory based on the broader view of the public policy doctrine helps the government here."
1987.87-59,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3563.865,3565.681,May I ask you one last question.
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,3579.791,3583.909,"Well, I assume that it would be shown initially to management."
1987.87-59,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3587.33,3589.73,To go back before the arbitrator if you had to?
1987.87-59,1,33990,keith_e_secular,,3589.73,3591.615,That is right.
1987.87-59,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3593.467,3594.5,"Thank you, Mr. Secular."
1987.87-59,2,25826,glen_d_nager,,3599.038,3601.906,I would like to use the minute to address three quick points.
1987.87-59,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3661.111,3662.179,"Thank you, Mr. Nager."
