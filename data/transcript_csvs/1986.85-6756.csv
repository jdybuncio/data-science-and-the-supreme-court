1986.85-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,86.606,"Mr. Barnard, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,86.606,90.691,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,129.884,143.376,"Mr. Barnard, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in this case I think made a finding that the State of Florida law at that time on whether you could introduce non-statutory mitigating circumstances was ambiguous."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,149.096,151.714,I disagree with the Eleventh Circuit in saying that.
1986.85-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,151.714,156.0,"You agree that the Eleventh Circuit said it, but you disagree with the Eleventh Circuit?"
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,156.0,157.452,I disagree with the Eleventh Circuit.
1986.85-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,157.452,166.391,"Ordinarily, of course, we take the view of a Court of Appeals as to the law of a state in which that court sits."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,166.391,178.882,"The same Court of Appeals had previously expressed the view that the Florida statute was limited, at least after the Cooper decision in 1976."
1986.85-6756,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,449.693,464.203,"Well, Mr. Barnard, in this case I take it the defense counsel did offer mitigating evidence that went beyond the purely statutory mitigating factors?"
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,464.203,466.019,"Yes, that is correct."
1986.85-6756,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.019,478.295,And how is a reviewing court to determine whether other mitigating evidence would have been obtained or offered?
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,495.305,502.661,"Perhaps I should take a moment, because that is the Respondent's chief contention here as concerns the facts."
1986.85-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,580.744,587.6,"Well, if that isn't the key, as you put it, to the constitutional question, what is the key to the constitutional question?"
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,603.393,612.382,"It has to do, Mr. Chief Justice, with what could be considered by the sentencer under the statutory framework."
1986.85-6756,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,652.024,659.863,"Mr. Barnard, your contention here is that it wasn't introduced effectively; it was introduced, but that the judge told the jury they couldn't consider it."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,661.482,661.982,Yes.
1986.85-6756,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.982,666.767,Aren't you relying on the statement of the judge that they could only consider the identified mitigating factors?
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,666.767,667.802,That is correct.
1986.85-6756,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.802,674.872,"So in effect, everything the lawyer had said was washed out by the judge, just as though he had given the jury an instruction to disregard it."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,679.026,690.315,"Yes, because the relevancy under this question legally is whether the evidence was being given independent mitigating weight under the system."
1986.85-6756,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,690.315,692.584,And the judge here said it couldn't be.
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,692.584,698.988,"The judge here said it couldn't be, and there's nothing in our record to indicate that it was."
1986.85-6756,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,712.915,720.936,"Mr. Barnard, how many Florida inmates are in the same position as Hitchcock?"
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,720.936,728.524,"--Well, we have presented in appendix B, I believe, the post--"
1986.85-6756,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,728.524,729.459,"Well, roughly how many?"
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,729.459,742.267,"--Twelve that are still pending in some manner, that were tried after Cooper."
1986.85-6756,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,756.193,757.426,So roughly--
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,757.426,758.811,Depending where the line is drawn.
1986.85-6756,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,758.811,760.361,"--Roughly in the twenties, then?"
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,760.361,761.763,Yes.
1986.85-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,867.698,878.855,"Mr. Barnard, did the Eleventh Circuit majority opinion treat your assertion that the trial judge had charged the jury that they might not consider non-statutory mitigating circumstances?"
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,878.855,894.082,"They did not separately in this case, other than at the beginning of the panel brief, where they just generally set out the issue that we were alleging denial of individualized consideration."
1986.85-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,894.082,907.908,"But of course, denial of individualized consideration is quite general, as opposed to claiming that the trial judge charged the jury that it might not consider non-statutory mitigating circumstances."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,907.908,911.294,"Well, I think the claim is actually the constitutionality of the statute."
1986.85-6756,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,919.482,920.265,"Well, but the statute--"
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,920.265,921.584,And the jury instructions are reflective of--
1986.85-6756,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.584,928.421,"--Let's assume that the statute was, or the operation of the statute was vague, as the state claims."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,946.167,947.083,--That is true.
1986.85-6756,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1011.742,1016.479,One way to get around all of that is to make a proffer of proof.
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1016.479,1018.462,"To make a proffer of proof, that is correct."
1986.85-6756,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1018.462,1019.597,I say that's one way to do it.
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1019.597,1020.431,It is.
1986.85-6756,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1020.431,1021.631,But they didn't?
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1021.631,1024.299,At the trial of this case there was no proffer.
1986.85-6756,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1024.299,1024.848,They didn't?
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1024.848,1025.835,Did not.
1986.85-6756,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1025.835,1026.935,They did or they did not?
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1026.935,1028.703,Did not.
1986.85-6756,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1028.703,1030.119,"Well, isn't that the end?"
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1030.119,1036.191,It is not the end because of the status of the law at the time.
1986.85-6756,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1101.665,1108.303,How do we determine between the lawyer that believed it and the lawyer that didn't know it?
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1108.303,1114.457,I don't know that there would be a legal difference at that time.
1986.85-6756,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1114.457,1118.111,Is there any difference?
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1122.313,1128.031,You have to take the lawyer's sworn testimony.
1986.85-6756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.031,1130.85,I'm a little puzzled at your argument.
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1150.88,1154.248,We submit that it is plain constitutional error.
1986.85-6756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1166.472,1185.934,"Of course, if the jury's role is advisory in Florida and if it turned out that the judge in imposing the death penalty had said, I am considering all the mitigating evidence that there is, I'm not sure his instruction to the jury would be very relevant."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1185.934,1190.671,"Well, of course, that's not the situation we have here."
1986.85-6756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1190.671,1191.437,"Well, I know it certainly isn't."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1203.812,1205.681,"Yes, under the statutory scheme, yes."
1986.85-6756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.777,1237.033,"Yes, but in this case is it not clear that we have both the erroneous jury instruction and we also have the judge in his own sentencing order saying that he based his decision on the statutory circumstances and that's it?"
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1247.424,1255.262,"--Well, the argument is... has been brought about through the evolution of Florida law and constitutional law."
1986.85-6756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1255.262,1260.816,And this case was tried at a time when they weren't under... before Lockett.
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1264.72,1271.206,"I agree that it's that simple, but we haven't been able to convince other courts that it's been that simple."
1986.85-6756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1272.973,1282.312,"But the thing that puzzles me is that you're arguing things that might be necessary to argue in other cases, but seem to me to be kind of an interesting detour in this case."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1288.701,1326.14,"The Florida statute, thus we are submitting, operated to deny what we have proffered is very relevant character evidence concerning Mr. Hitchcock, and that is evidence concerning his emotional history and his family background, in order to prove specific relevant character traits that are relevant to sentencing, that are at the core of the capital sentencing determination."
1986.85-6756,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1521.367,1528.455,"Mr. Barnard, was there any objection made to the instruction to the sentencing jury?"
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1528.455,1529.557,No.
1986.85-6756,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1529.557,1536.461,Nor to the statement that the judge made when he imposed the sentence that he was limiting it to the mitigating factors?
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1536.461,1537.511,No.
1986.85-6756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.621,1592.213,"What do you do with the Court of Appeals' decision that they locked at the facts and said, well, all the... there's no proof that anything else would ever have come out?"
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1593.497,1593.88,Yes.
1986.85-6756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.88,1610.775,"And that so they concluded that your client wasn't denied an individualized sentencing hearing, just on their analysis of what happened and what your proof was or allegations at the habeas hearing."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1614.144,1622.567,"If that judgment had been made after an evidentiary hearing, that might be a valid judgment to make."
1986.85-6756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.567,1628.721,"Well, I know, but they said that after reading your habeas corpus petition."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1628.721,1629.922,I also say they're wrong.
1986.85-6756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.922,1634.807,And they said that there was a failure to indicate how things would have been different.
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1634.807,1643.813,"Our allegation was that things would have been different because of the evidence that I've just summarized to you, all of which was in the record--"
1986.85-6756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1643.813,1650.752,So to reverse we have to say they were just wrong in reading the record in the habeas court?
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1650.752,1657.406,"--Well, our allegation is that they too narrowly construed the mandate of Lockett, which allowed them to reach that result."
1986.85-6756,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1657.406,1658.64,"That's not what you say, Mr. Barnard."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1670.648,1671.165,That's true.
1986.85-6756,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.165,1680.105,"Even if you can't prove that anything more would have come in, those statements about mitigating factors that the attorney made were not allowed to be considered by the jury."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1683.14,1683.64,Yes.
1986.85-6756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.64,1693.763,"And I suppose you would also argue that if constitutional error was committed, the Court of Appeals here plainly applied the wrong harmless error constitutional standard."
1986.85-6756,0,18449,craig_s_barnard,,1703.971,1707.006,That's correct.
1986.85-6756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1855.785,1856.835,"Thank you, Mr. Barnard."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,1861.256,1864.208,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-6756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1924.496,1928.531,"That of course came down after Hitchcock's sentence, didn't it?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,1928.531,1938.256,It does beg the question as to the ambiguity that counsel or judicial officers may have been faced with in trying to interpret these decisions.
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.256,1949.045,"Well, even if you're right that the statute shouldn't be declared unconstitutional, the issue is about the constitutionality of this particular death sentence."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,1949.045,1949.897,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1949.897,1960.335,And do you agree that the trial judge limited his consideration to just the statutory mitigating circumstances?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,1960.335,1963.037,"No, sir, and we submit that the district court's--"
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1963.037,1964.989,"Well, how about his instruction to the jury?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,1964.989,1972.993,--His instruction to the jury is interesting in that it limits only those aggravating circumstances which may be considered.
1986.85-6756,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1987.237,1987.753,That's not what he said.
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2000.346,2012.887,"This of course must be read in contrast to the instruction just prior to that, which specifically limits their consideration of statutory aggravating circumstances in much more specific language."
1986.85-6756,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.887,2015.172,"Well, perhaps, but I consider that specific enough:"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2026.98,2029.599,"Well, of course, the district court did not read it that way."
1986.85-6756,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2035.503,2043.406,"Well, Mr. Daly, shouldn't we look at the plain language of the instruction, as any juror would be expected to do?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2061.135,2062.07,--The court also noted--
1986.85-6756,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2062.07,2069.907,And doesn't that at least suggest that the judge didn't think consideration of other factors was appropriate?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2069.907,2088.554,"--While it might suggest that, it is certainly balanced by the fact that, as noted again by the district court in a detailed analysis of each of these issues, that the trial court also specifically noted that, the court has weighed and considered the total evidence received in this case."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2100.612,2102.295,You mean the argument by defense counsel?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2102.295,2103.314,By defense counsel.
1986.85-6756,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2103.314,2124.893,"Mr. Daly, the charge to the jury also said, in addition to saying the mitigating circumstances you may consider shall be the following and then listing the statutory list, the judge went on to say later: After you've considered all the aggravating circumstances, then you are to consider the mitigating circumstances and consider them by number."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2126.31,2128.862,"Well, it certainly refers to the statutory mitigating circumstances."
1986.85-6756,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2128.862,2132.647,"Well, what do you do with the non-statutory ones that you say they were free to consider?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2134.166,2137.951,"Well, once again, they were not instructed that they could not consider them."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.022,2179.028,Was this same kind of an argument made or arise in the Court of Appeals?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2179.028,2179.745,"Yes, sir, it did."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.745,2194.219,"I find it very strange that the Court of Appeals' opinion on this phase of the case didn't even mention what the trial court's instruction was to the jury, to the jury or what he considered himself in imposing sentence."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2194.219,2202.491,"Well, of course, as noted by the district court, that issue had already been resolved by the Court of Appeals, and that's why it wasn't specifically addressed by the--"
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.491,2206.312,You mean in the prior... in the prior Hitchcock decision?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2206.312,2214.799,"--No, in prior decisions on that same issue, because this issue... what happened in this case is you have the standard jury instruction being read."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.559,2251.174,"Well, let's just assume that there is just no argument whatsoever that the judge plainly told the jury: You may consider these five mitigating circumstances and no others, and in your balancing aggravation, aggravating circumstances, against mitigating, you just must consider these five mitigating and no others."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2275.79,2276.54,"--Yes, Your Honor, it would be."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2276.54,2278.409,And should we reverse.
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2278.409,2279.709,If that had happened in this case.
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.709,2280.111,All right.
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2286.514,2288.43,I definitely do not agree.
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2311.196,2315.867,Was that your only defense of the Court of Appeals' decision?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2338.363,2342.101,"--Well, I don't necessarily know that it would affected this case."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2343.701,2349.921,"Well, their rationale was there's no proof here that any different... that there would have been any different evidence."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2349.921,2350.805,--That is exactly--
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2350.805,2353.223,"Well, what if they had thought there would have been different evidence?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2354.325,2360.263,"--I'm sure they would have analyzed that in their case by case analysis test, which incorporates all of those factors."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.334,2379.107,"Well, what the problem is is that what the judge heard were a lot of non-statutory mitigating circumstances that he didn't consider."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2379.107,2381.642,That he potentially didn't consider.
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.642,2382.042,"Yes, all right."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2382.042,2392.165,"Of course, we have a finding by the district court that that is not the case, to the contrary, that the evidence of record to his mind indicated that the judge did not feel himself so limited."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.438,2436.563,So it's a case of agreeing or disagreeing with the Court of Appeals on their interpretation of what the judge said and what the defense attorney believed?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2436.563,2449.903,--It's a case of evaluating all of the factors involved in their case by case analysis test to see if that adequately protects the individualized capital sentencing determination right of the Petitioner.
1986.85-6756,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2449.903,2468.165,"Well, what do you have that indicates that this language doesn't mean what it seems to me it says, other than the fact that non-statutory mitigating elements were allowed to be referred to by the defense counsel?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2484.21,2487.511,"Well, of course, in defense counsel's... not in the charge instructions."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.886,2503.688,"Well, I don't think the Court of Appeals even addressed it in this case."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2503.688,2504.271,Not in this case.
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.99,2509.409,"Well, it's a case by case analysis."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2522.169,2533.29,--I would submit it was because the tenor of the argument submitted by the Petitioner in this case at both levels was not typically addressed to the trial judge's instruction.
1986.85-6756,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2626.236,2630.021,Was an objection ever raised and overruled?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2630.021,2638.46,"At trial level, to the relevance at that point in time to these factors, it was, An objection was in fact sustained."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2739.492,2740.659,"Is that harmless error, then?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2740.659,2742.111,It is basically a harmless error argument.
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2742.111,2743.377,So you say there was error?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2743.377,2744.494,"No, I don't."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.494,2745.896,But harmless?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2745.896,2759.906,I submit that in the context of this Lockett case that the case by case analysis adopted by the Eleventh Circuit is adequate to determine whether an evidentiary hearing is called for in the post-conviction context.
1986.85-6756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2794.127,2799.448,"Well, in your view who has the burden of demonstrating that the error did or did not affect the outcome?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2799.448,2805.768,"It still lies with the Petitioner, given the post-conviction context and given the challenge to the efficiency of counsel."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2829.567,2840.775,"Well, don't you agree that in the guilt phase of the trial there were a lot of facts brought out about this Petitioner?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2840.775,2843.275,"Oh, very true."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2843.275,2850.131,And a lot of them aren't listed in the statutory mitigating circumstances.
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2850.131,2851.764,And they weren't argued as a basis for--
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2851.764,2852.832,Isn't that true?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2852.832,2853.682,--That's true.
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.682,2862.188,"Well, and yet the jury was told, don't consider any except A, B, C, and D."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2862.188,2862.771,And no argument--
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.771,2868.425,Just forget all the mitigating circumstances that you might have heard in the guilt phase.
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2868.425,2870.377,"--Well, we'd also note that no argument--"
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.377,2879.4,"So it's sort of, it's really no complete answer to say that the lawyer might not have offered anything more than he did."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2890.589,2908.55,"--If you look in this case, you're also going to note that the prosecutor never argued any of these extraneous facts as non-statutory aggravating circumstances at the sentencing phase, nor did he in his responsive argument at sentencing say, listen, you've all heard this other stuff, you can't consider that, that's non-statutory mitigating evidence and you can't consider it."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2915.739,2920.56,"Well, what are they going to do, disobey their instructions from the judge?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,2920.56,2923.512,--I don't believe that the instruction limited them.
1986.85-6756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3046.958,3052.528,"I suppose what we do in the McCleskey case will affect what we do here on this issue, won't it?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3052.528,3053.612,"It certainly will, sir."
1986.85-6756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3079.179,3085.333,"You think your case is any different and, if so, in what respects from the Georgia case?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3085.333,3093.439,"It's certainly different in that the Florida scheme is different, in that the Florida scheme does not follow the jury's recommendation to have a judge involved."
1986.85-6756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3105.497,3108.614,"Well, I take it your position is that any study isn't going to be very--"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3108.614,3109.664,"Yes, sir, exactly."
1986.85-6756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3109.664,3111.816,--So statistics should be thrown out completely?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3111.816,3117.554,This type of regression analysis in the capital sentencing context cannot work.
1986.85-6756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3133.397,3137.199,"Well, some states thought for a while they could have mandatory death penalties."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3137.199,3137.968,That's exactly right.
1986.85-6756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3158.714,3160.347,You don't like statisticians.
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3160.347,3161.231,Not in this context.
1986.85-6756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3233.679,3240.166,Wasn't it true in Florida up until about 25 years ago?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3240.166,3241.582,--I have no way of knowing.
1986.85-6756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3241.582,3244.201,"Well, you ought to look it up some time."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3244.201,3245.401,I just know now that this Court--
1986.85-6756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3245.401,3257.026,No Negro was ever executed in any of the southern states or northern states for killing a Negro until around about the thirties or forties.
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3257.026,3258.794,"--Of course, that's not the case in the State of Florida now."
1986.85-6756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3258.794,3260.995,"I know, but you were getting so broad."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3262.479,3263.279,I understand.
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3298.335,3299.537,What about the prosecutors?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3299.537,3303.406,"Well, prosecutors, we submit--"
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.406,3308.41,They make a decision of whether to make a capital case out of a set of facts.
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3308.41,3312.095,"--Well, they make the decision of whether to present it for indictment, certainly."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3314.714,3322.784,"Well, how about, is there some choice made after the finding of guilt as to whether to proceed to a sentencing hearing?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3322.784,3325.169,"--Yes, there is that discretion."
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3325.169,3326.354,By the prosecutor?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3326.354,3327.404,By the prosecutor.
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3327.404,3328.92,Uncontrolled?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3328.92,3329.587,Uncontrolled.
1986.85-6756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3331.906,3332.806,He has to evaluate the evidence.
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3332.806,3333.222,Right.
1986.85-6756,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3365.343,3372.933,I assume the statistician's answer to that is that all those variables will likely break out even.
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3372.933,3374.599,--They certainly can assume that.
1986.85-6756,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3374.599,3383.657,"And that where you have a statistical result that is wildly disparate, you can come to the conclusion there's something wrong."
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3383.657,3385.091,"Well, one of the aspects--"
1986.85-6756,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3385.091,3391.644,"I know you can't take account of all the factors, but why shouldn't you assume that all the factors you can't take account of more or less even out?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3395.464,3402.135,--The reason is because you're making a basic attack on the punishment system in the state.
1986.85-6756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3402.135,3406.404,"Well, on the whole system; you're making the mistake of looking at the forest instead of the trees?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3406.404,3410.308,I submit that that's exactly true.
1986.85-6756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3416.045,3418.997,There have been several studies made of juries.
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3430.553,3431.721,--I'm sure that's true.
1986.85-6756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3433.404,3434.523,"Well, have you read them?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3434.523,3435.189,--I'm sure in specific--
1986.85-6756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3435.189,3435.973,Have you read them?
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3435.973,3436.625,"--No, sir."
1986.85-6756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3436.625,3438.991,"Well, don't you think you should?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3438.991,3442.26,I submit that it would be impossible to condemn the system as a whole.
1986.85-6756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3507.02,3514.791,"Mr. Daly, what if federal had a statute that said the death penalty shall not be imposed in cases like this if the victim is black?"
1986.85-6756,1,41230,sean_daly,,3518.01,3518.777,I believe so.
1986.85-6756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3612.972,3614.989,"Thank you, Mr. Daly."
