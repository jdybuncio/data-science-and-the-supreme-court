1985.84-2030,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.819,We will hear arguments next in Brown-Forman Distillers against New York State Liquor Authority.
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,80.693,90.18,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is an appeal from a judgment by the New York State Court of Appeals."
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,128.956,143.695,"It does it by setting the... by requiring the filing of prices in New York and telling them not to vary, telling them it can't be... it can't be higher than any place else."
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,143.695,145.805,"--Yes, Justice White, that is correct."
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,150.21,157.213,It really doesn't say what the prices have to be in some other state.
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,157.213,159.446,--New York does not set the price.
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,302.449,307.271,Do you think that is really a promise?
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,311.805,315.107,"It is in just that form, Justice White."
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,322.561,333.27,"What is the penalty if, contrary to the affirmation, some company lowers its price in another state?"
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,333.27,344.747,"--The penalties cover a variety of alternatives, from a criminal misdemeanor sanction all the way to a revocation or a suspension of the license."
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.747,356.354,"What would the charge be if a company, after making its affirmation in New York, lowers the price in New Jersey, and New York finds out about it?"
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,357.524,364.048,They charge you with having falsely affirmed and violated the provisions of the statute.
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,379.359,379.68,I understand.
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,379.68,387.513,"--which were paid, a license revocation proceeding was instituted by the state liquor authority against Brown-Forman."
1985.84-2030,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,439.689,452.386,Suppose the penalty were that anyone violating the maximum factor here would never thereafter be permitted to operate in New York?
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,452.386,456.771,"We might have some additional arguments, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-2030,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,477.153,482.339,Wouldn't it... against Gibbons against Ogden if it prohibited future--
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,482.339,487.361,"It could well be, Your Honor, and there could be in addition certain due process claims."
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,506.554,511.566,--How did you convince the authorities that you wouldn't be violating the affirmation in the future?
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,511.566,513.737,"We have not convinced them, Your Honor."
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,518.69,522.383,"You are still going on with your promotion allowances in other states, I suppose."
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,522.383,527.897,"The lump sum allowances, to my knowledge, Justice White, are still being given by Brown-Forman."
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,527.897,533.382,"You wanted to give them to somebody in New York, too, but they wouldn't permit it."
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,533.382,545.488,"We offered to do that, and the state liquor authority, and frankly, we cannot find fault with the liquor authority's determination on this issue, said that another section of the same chapter--"
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.488,547.861,So it is just plainly forbidden under the New York law.
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,547.861,557.516,"--That is right, and unfortunately, this Court has allowed us to argue in plenary argument only the facial challenge to the New York statute."
1985.84-2030,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,557.516,558.888,I am interested.
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,561.44,565.153,I am not asking that you overrule Seagram.
1985.84-2030,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,565.834,568.644,Can you distinguish Seagram from this case?
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,568.644,570.415,"--I believe, sir, that I can."
1985.84-2030,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,570.415,575.328,Is there a difference as a practical matter between a retrospective statute and a prospective one?
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,575.328,577.721,"I believe that there is, Justice Blackmun."
1985.84-2030,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,600.766,603.428,"Well, I raise the question whether it is an entirely different one."
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,603.428,603.839,All right.
1985.84-2030,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,603.839,608.78,"If you prevail here, New York might well go back to the old statute, and you will be up here again."
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,608.78,618.126,"I think there are pragmatic reasons why New York will not go back to a retrospective statute, but let me try to satisfy and answer your question."
1985.84-2030,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,684.46,695.458,"But, Mr. Flinn, even in the retrospective situation, it seems that the statute would actually affect prices out of state eventually."
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,701.731,702.971,"Justice O'Connor, clearly you are right."
1985.84-2030,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,735.382,736.484,"I thought it was unanimous, wasn't it?"
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,736.484,737.363,--Beg pardon?
1985.84-2030,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,737.363,738.455,I thought it was unanimous.
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,738.455,738.725,"Yes, sir, it was."
1985.84-2030,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,742.899,744.649,"Well, the Court might have been wrong."
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,747.261,756.077,"Your Honor, I am... Justice Blackmun, I fall back on the traditional plaintive cry of counsel before this Court."
1985.84-2030,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,770.018,770.615,I guess--
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,770.615,786.407,"The answer clearly is that I believe that had Seagram v. Hostetter been decided at a time when there was more than a single retrospective statute, the result conceivably could have been different."
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.139,837.1,--For a month.
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,837.1,837.799,For a month.
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,841.342,852.0,Or maybe the real limit is how long it takes the New York Liquor Authority to decide to permit you to change your price in New York.
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,852.0,857.132,"I submit, Justice White, that it is something more than that."
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.033,872.534,"Well, isn't there a provision that you could decide you wanted to lower your price in some other state, and so you lower the price in New York, and so you ask the authority, may I lower the price of this--"
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,872.534,880.197,"--In this case, Justice White, that argument has been made by New York for the first time before this Court."
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,885.04,886.121,"--Yes, but it is in the statute, isn't it?"
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,886.121,889.083,"--It is in the statute, and I would like to address it, Justice White."
1985.84-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.972,949.973,"Mr. Flinn, could I interrupt with just one question on this point?"
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,957.108,958.55,"--A very good point, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.986,1053.613,"It sounds awfully sensible to say... say you posted this price, and said, these are going to be the prices for the next month, and you know you can't charge less than any other state, but you go up and say, we would like to amend our filing for the rest of this month, and believe it or not, we are going to drop our prices here and everywhere else."
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,1059.136,1061.747,"Let me speak to that, Justice White."
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.354,1074.446,That may be.
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,1074.446,1075.846,The very--
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.846,1079.8,"But if they were going to be fast at anything, I would think they would be fast at this one."
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,1079.8,1083.232,"--The interesting thing is, they might not, Justice White."
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.232,1083.673,Lowering the price of whiskey?
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,1083.673,1086.515,May I suggest why they might not be?
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.932,1176.444,Suppose there are some distillers that don't sell in New York?
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,1176.444,1177.984,There are a few.
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.492,1198.558,"But any distiller that doesn't sell in New York that you are competing with in other states, you really can't compete with them if they undersell you."
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,1198.558,1205.183,"That is perhaps an overstatement, but clearly there is truth to the point you are making, Justice--"
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1205.183,1206.752,If there are any distillers who don't sell in New York.
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,1206.752,1209.934,--There are some distillers who do not sell in New York.
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.037,1216.159,"That people at Brown-Forman are competing with, I suppose."
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,1216.159,1226.167,"In some states, Brown-Forman competes with one or more other suppliers, whether distillers of brown goods, rectifiers of white goods or not, who are purely regional."
1985.84-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1279.392,1288.758,"Mr. Flinn, may I just... your argument is strongest, it seems to me, when you focus on a mid-month price reduction, something like that, but are there such price reductions?"
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,1295.41,1296.722,The record does not tell us.
1985.84-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1311.553,1325.039,"It would seem to me this is entirely possible, and I don't know whether this is a fact or not, that if there is a substantial number of states that require posting on a monthly basis, that maybe there is an industry custom of price changes at monthly intervals, and there may not be the problem you describe."
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,1325.78,1330.923,"--The question, it seems to me, has to turn on this result."
1985.84-2030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1473.478,1486.818,"Mr. Flinn, supposing you are in the New York legislature, and you have the report of this Moreland Commission that says New York consumers are being discriminated against because they are getting higher prices than anybody else in the country."
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,1491.29,1493.553,I would answer your question.
1985.84-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1660.891,1672.449,"Even moving to a strictly current affirmation approach, I would suppose you would still be arguing that New York is affecting the prices in other states."
1985.84-2030,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,1672.449,1679.635,"I think, Justice White, that would be the case that I would have to come to you with a record and not a purely facial challenge."
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,1815.094,1836.899,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question before the Court today is whether New York may insist that liquor prices to New York wholesalers be as low as prices charged elsewhere in the country as part of its comprehensive regulatory scheme for liquor."
1985.84-2030,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1981.484,1992.139,"Mr. Constantine, it does appear that the New York statute effectively sets minimum prices outside New York, at least for an interval of time, doesn't it?"
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,1992.139,1993.611,"--No, Your Honor, it doesn't."
1985.84-2030,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.27,2053.399,"Mr. Constantine, may I interrupt?"
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2071.73,2091.285,"It would not be free of commerce clause challenge, Your Honor, but if the Court were consistent with its commerce clause jurisprudence up to today, that challenge should be rejected because the type of effect which Brown-Forman talks about has never been considered to be a burden on commerce under the Court's commerce clause jurisprudence."
1985.84-2030,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.669,2116.875,"If, for example, in automobiles, say there is a big transportation cost of getting a car from Michigan to New York."
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2128.042,2133.527,"The New York affirmation law, Your Honor, provides for differentials in transportation cost and taxes."
1985.84-2030,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2135.808,2144.172,"Well, say just because of different competitive situations, there certainly are market forces that vary in different parts of the country."
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2148.464,2154.759,"I would say that if a court adhered to the principles and it is heretofore stated under the commerce clause, there would be no problem."
1985.84-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.745,2205.634,"Well, if there is a distiller in the midwest, and he is selling in New York, and be... at his posted prices, if he wants to, he cannot lower the prices for his liquor that he is sending out to California for a month."
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2205.634,2208.328,"That is not correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2220.757,2222.147,Then what is all the big argument about?
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2222.147,2226.099,"--Well, Your Honor, the argument is about what Brown-Forman came to this Court about."
1985.84-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2233.633,2235.135,Let me get it straight.
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2241.758,2242.399,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2242.399,2254.237,"And the price you charge in New York has to be as low as you are selling any place else, so you are promising for that month not to sell in any other state at any lower price."
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2254.237,2259.901,"You are promising for that month, Your Honor, to sell to New York at the lowest price you charge elsewhere."
1985.84-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.901,2260.391,Exactly.
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2268.295,2269.186,"Well, Your Honor."
1985.84-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2269.186,2270.158,Isn't that right?
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2270.158,2275.03,"Your Honor, I don't know, because in the 20 years since the case--"
1985.84-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2275.03,2276.49,What does the law mean if it doesn't mean that?
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2276.49,2279.805,"--The law means that New York has to be granted parity with other states, Your Honor."
1985.84-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2280.534,2281.174,I know.
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2292.122,2301.418,"--If the distiller charges a price in another state and thereafter charges a higher price in New York, he is violating the law."
1985.84-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.418,2302.199,That is right.
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2316.767,2321.359,"That's right, Your Honor, and that is because the law says exactly what--"
1985.84-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2321.359,2338.103,"And you say that just because it has a substantial impact on interstate commerce between the distiller and his California customers, you just say that isn't much of an impact."
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2338.103,2352.561,"--Well, Your Honor, this Court has always held that the states retain a residuum of power to enact regulations concerning matters of local concern which to some extent regulate commerce or affect commerce."
1985.84-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2549.911,2557.013,"What is Brown-Forman going to do, have to do about these promotion allowances that the authority is after them about?"
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2557.013,2571.784,"The promotion allowance issue, which, of course, Your Honor, the Court declined to hear, what the state has said in that regard is that if you are going to provide the promotion allowances in other states, they have to be simply cashed out in New York."
1985.84-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.485,2593.768,Don't tell me that the authority has never challenged what amounts to a reduction of price in another state--
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2593.768,2594.769,It has never challenged--
1985.84-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.769,2597.13,--without lowering it in New York.
1985.84-2030,1,34213,lloyd_e_constantine,,2598.58,2601.192,--It has never challenged a bid month price change.
