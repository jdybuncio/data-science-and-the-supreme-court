1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,26.144,31.895,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,62.198,63.492,This wasn't currency.
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,65.105,65.524,Rare coins.
1968.770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,65.524,65.803,Collector's items.
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,65.803,69.669,"Collector's items, Your Honor, yes."
1968.770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,107.074,111.61,"He was a fellow member of a collector's club with the Pulati's, was he?"
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,111.61,112.503,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,112.503,117.224,And he missed a meeting one night and that's the night at the Pulati's house was burglarized?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,117.224,119.489,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,291.158,293.228,Was there somebody else in the house?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,293.228,296.976,"His wife was there, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,296.976,298.833,Does it show how he gained entry into the house?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,302.94,311.886,"The record simply shows that the officer requested admittance to wait for Mr. Chimel, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,311.886,321.944,"Well, is that to say that at least his presence, the officer's presence is not an unlawful presence inside the house, based on the consent of the wife?"
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,321.944,326.341,"I don't think this record is clear enough to show one way or the other, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,403.695,406.137,What's your position about the arrest?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,412.431,424.907,"I can't answer this simply yes or no, Your Honor, for the reason that in this case we raised the issue, so far as I know for the first time in California, that the arrest warrant had been unlawfully issued."
1968.770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,424.907,426.757,Under State law?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,426.757,433.473,"Under Federal law, Giordenello versus U.S. and Aguilar that --"
1968.770,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,433.473,436.234,"The California Court so held, didn't it?"
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,436.234,438.527,"The California court did so hold, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,438.527,446.78,But then -- so we now have a ruling of the State Courts that this warrant is invalid.
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,446.78,447.594,That's correct.
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,447.594,451.357,Only -- Didn't they rule that it was invalid under California law?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,451.357,451.933,"No, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,454.726,455.522,I see.
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,455.522,456.449,Cases from this Court.
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,456.449,460.585,"The arrest warrant itself, on a probable cause basis."
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,460.585,461.464,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,478.88,495.691,"Well, I suppose it's going to be relevant, isn't it to what we have to decide as to the scope of the search, whether that arrest was or was not lawful, whether on the basis of the warrant or on the basis of probable cause in respect to the law?"
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,495.691,499.398,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,510.078,520.077,"And well, without making a concession, I guess you are going to argue on the assumption that it was lawful, nevertheless in scope, this exceeded the speed limit under the Fourth Amendment."
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,520.077,521.322,"This is correct, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,521.322,527.185,"But you are going to argue, aren't you, that there should be no arrest without a warrant at all?"
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,527.185,528.989,"No, Your Honor, I don't intend to make that argument."
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.989,533.719,"You do concede that you may arrest without a warrant, constitutionally?"
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,533.719,534.106,Oh!
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,541.397,541.608,Oh!
1968.770,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,545.037,550.468,"Well, I don't understand your position in view of what you said."
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,583.083,589.23,"My primary focus, Your Honor, is on the search itself."
1968.770,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,603.773,621.643,"I understand that, but I am trying to find out, following my brother Brennan's question to you, whether secondarily, or however -- whatever order you want to do it, you challenge the lawfulness of the arrest here."
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,621.643,622.601,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,622.601,627.945,"I thought you did, but if you don't, I'd certainly like to know."
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,653.213,677.508,"If I can clarify, Your Honor, to back up and change the facts a little bit, if the officer had simply put the petitioner under arrest at his home, and taken him down to the station, had that been all that had gone on, I would not challenge that arrest on probable cause."
1968.770,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,677.508,682.673,And you would not challenge that arrest on the grounds that he should have obtained a warrant?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,682.673,683.637,No.
1968.770,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,683.637,685.505,Because you say there was.
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,701.814,714.016,"That is not my position, Your Honor, but so far as the arrest which involves no search, I don't think that it is fairly before this Court on this record."
1968.770,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,714.016,715.533,I don't understand that at all.
1968.770,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,715.533,721.324,"Well, you would have a hard time getting a remedy if that is all you had, as far as this case is concerned."
1968.770,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,736.561,753.91,"No, but involved in this, as I understand it, one of the arguments that the State makes is that the search and the seizure were lawful as incident to a valid arrest."
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,753.91,754.745,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,754.745,768.205,"Now, do you or do you not argue that the arrest was invalid as one branch of your submission to this Court?"
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,768.205,774.045,"For the sake of argument, Your Honor, I'll concede that this arrest was invalid, for the sake of argument here."
1968.770,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,774.045,774.66,"No, no."
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,799.787,810.191,"Pursuing the facts of the case, then, after this search, or going back to this search of September 13."
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,843.042,849.741,Were these the -- were these the fruit of another burglary?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,849.741,851.883,"This was what later developed, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.883,853.946,Did the police know it at the time?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,853.946,854.799,No.
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,854.799,859.793,Didn't they -- they never even knew of the other robbery or burglary?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,859.793,872.98,"The record indicates that Officer Del Coma, who is the central figure here, had heard something of the Pulati burglary, the first burglary, but that --"
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,872.98,875.369,He doesn't know what was stolen there?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,875.369,882.966,"I think he knew there were coins which had been taken, but he did not have any detailed information so far as the record shows."
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.966,909.976,"Assume if he had known specifically what was stolen in the Pulati case and he encountered it in the house that he searched, in the course of searching for coins stolen in another burglary, would you say he couldn't seize the fruit of the Pulati?"
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,909.976,911.32,"Oh, no."
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.252,932.942,"So this is -- this is your fundamental question, the legality of the search?"
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,932.942,933.634,That's correct.
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.634,937.259,Without either a valid arrest warrant or without a valid search warrant?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,937.259,940.317,That's correct.
1968.770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,940.317,948.234,"Well, the legality of the search, as I understand your case, depends upon two issues."
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,957.533,958.151,That's correct.
1968.770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,958.151,963.183,Because the only justification for the search is that it was incident to a lawful arrest.
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,987.843,993.953,"That is correct, Your Honor, plus on additional point."
1968.770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1027.742,1054.18,"Well, there can certainly -- let's assume a lawful street arrest of somebody that you have reasonable cause to believe has a concealed weapon and let's assume the arrest, that there is probable cause, sufficient probable cause, and that you do stop and arrest that man, then certainly incident to that arrest you can search him."
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,1055.383,1056.362,No quarrel.
1968.770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1056.362,1067.526,"And if in addition or if instead of a gun, you don't find a gun at all, but what you do find is narcotics on him, right in his pocket."
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,1078.266,1078.392,Oh!
1968.770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1079.44,1083.986,Even though there was no ground at all to search him for narcotics.
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,1083.986,1098.838,"Searches of the person, I think, stand on an altogether different plane, because the officer arresting a person obviously has a primary need to search that man and see that he is not assaulted with some sort of weapon."
1968.770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1103.769,1104.653,"Well, let's see, then, Mr. Monroe."
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,1123.512,1130.857,"If I may, Your Honor, I wouldn't say really that it's independent of the probable cause to arrest."
1968.770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1132.122,1134.077,"Well, in addition to, rather than independent."
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,1134.077,1143.357,"There has to be that other element of some reason to think, if I, as the officer, am going to search the place of arrest, then I have to have some reason to think --"
1968.770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1143.357,1160.337,"Well, all of our cases so far, I gather, have sustained searches, so long as there was probable cause to make the arrest and that the search was incident to that arrest, whether or not the officers had knowledge of what it was they might pick up."
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,1162.112,1167.198,"I think there's a strong suggestion in the cases, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.589,1221.386,"Well what if -- well, what more do you need -- what more do you suggest we need if you have probable cause, or a warrant to arrest a fellow for stealing some coins, and you go to his house and arrest him in his house?"
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,1229.772,1230.558,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1230.558,1235.99,You have to have some reason to believe that he has not only stolen them but that he has actually got them there?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,1235.99,1238.853,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1238.853,1243.026,And you suggest our cases support that submission?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,1243.026,1249.059,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1249.059,1254.383,Has that ever -- has that question ever been explicitly addressed in any of our opinions?
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,1254.383,1257.788,No.
1968.770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1259.828,1266.179,You get more comfort out of the pre-Harris cases than you do out of the Harris.
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,1266.179,1268.893,"The Harris case is not comforting at all, Your Honor."
1968.770,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1268.893,1270.48,Or Rabinowitz.
1968.770,0,33904,keith_c_monroe,,1270.48,1271.326,No.
1968.770,1,39396,ronald_m_george,,1893.941,1913.868,"The issues in this case basically are was the search, which was an incident of the concededly valid arrest on probable cause, rendered unreasonable solely by virtue of the fact that it extended beyond the room in which petitioner was arrested?"
1968.770,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1937.77,1945.032,In what basis did the California Court hold that the warrant was invalid?
1968.770,1,39396,ronald_m_george,,1945.032,1978.489,"The California Supreme Court, in this case and in the companion case of People versus Sesslin, held that the procedure which had been followed in the State of California for many, many years, of issuing warrants upon complaints which did not set out the factual elements of probable cause, were invalid, but the Court held that, although this arrest warrant was invalid, there was ample probable cause --"
1968.770,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1978.489,1979.11,I understand that.
1968.770,1,39396,ronald_m_george,,1987.659,1987.738,Well --
1968.770,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1987.738,1989.75,Is that involved in this case?
1968.770,1,39396,ronald_m_george,,1989.75,1992.334,That has been raised by the petitioner.
1968.770,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2011.523,2025.046,"You mean, assuming that the warrant was otherwise valid, petitioner argues that its effect was spent, or it was invalid or ineffective because of the delay."
1968.770,1,39396,ronald_m_george,,2025.046,2025.135,Yes.
1968.770,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2025.135,2026.09,Is that the point?
1968.770,1,39396,ronald_m_george,,2026.09,2033.587,"Yes, but the State Supreme Court specifically upheld the arrest on the theory of probable cause apart from the warrant."
1968.770,2,33904,keith_c_monroe,,4430.971,4433.826,None I also have some figures.
1968.770,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4433.826,4436.491,Very well we -- I'd like to have them.
1968.770,3,39396,ronald_m_george,,4440.444,4443.636,May I file with the Court the letter that I received from the District Attorney's office?
1968.770,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4443.636,4445.769,"Yes, please."
1968.770,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4445.769,4448.624,"Mr. George, I wanted to ask you one question."
1968.770,3,39396,ronald_m_george,,4461.963,4462.371,Yes.
1968.770,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4462.371,4466.76,Could you state briefly what evidence there was that they had?
1968.770,3,39396,ronald_m_george,,4466.76,4468.794,Yes.
1968.770,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4495.547,4497.743,Was this a pawnshop?
1968.770,3,39396,ronald_m_george,,4497.743,4498.416,A coin shop.
1968.770,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4498.416,4499.946,A coin shop.
1968.770,3,39396,ronald_m_george,,4499.946,4511.116,"Then shortly afterwards, he told the same friend, “Well, we broke through the two walls and we came across the wires, but we didn't really go through with the job completely.”"
1968.770,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4531.521,4532.852,He negotiated for the return of the coins.
1968.770,3,39396,ronald_m_george,,4532.852,4535.383,"For the return of the coins, yes."
1968.770,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4535.383,4537.054,What -- how do you mean “negotiate”.
1968.770,3,39396,ronald_m_george,,4537.054,4550.622,"He and another suspect and an attorney, who the record indicates was representing both suspects, negotiated for the return of the coins for a civil release."
1968.770,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4550.622,4552.494,Actually negotiated at the police station.
1968.770,3,39396,ronald_m_george,,4552.494,4554.208,At the police station so this --
1968.770,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4554.208,4555.305,Before arrest.
