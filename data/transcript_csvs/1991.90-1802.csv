1991.90-1802,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.149,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-1802, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company v. Robert Darden."
1991.90-1802,0,25948,george_r_ragsdale,,55.248,59.139,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1802,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,684.683,693.578,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1802,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,854.265,857.157,May I... I thought you'd finished that thought.
1991.90-1802,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,877.248,879.419,"That's right, Your Honor."
1991.90-1802,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,879.419,882.411,What do you add to the common law test?
1991.90-1802,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,882.411,893.01,"We do, as Justice O'Connor put it, think that it has to be applied in terms of the remedial purposes of ERISA, and let me try to tell you what I mean by that."
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,1278.333,1279.395,Thank you.
1991.90-1802,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1496.978,1512.418,"Well, Mr. Follin, if I understand what you're saying, you're saying we should look to the same definition and test as the Court did in Rutherford Food under a statute, a different statute with similar language."
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,1513.569,1516.76,"--Well, that would be one way to look at it."
1991.90-1802,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1518.592,1523.213,I thought that was the position taken by the Solicitor General.
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,1534.721,1540.006,"--Well, what I'm asking the Court to do is to focus on the purposes of ERISA."
1991.90-1802,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1563.381,1567.435,I just want to be clear as to what your argument is.
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,1567.435,1567.905,--Yes.
1991.90-1802,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1567.905,1579.053,"If I'm hearing you as I think I am, you are saying exactly what the Solicitor General is saying is the test, but you come out differently."
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,1579.053,1582.726,"No, I don't say exactly the same as the Solicitor General."
1991.90-1802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1658.286,1662.427,"Well, why are not these other physical properties that he owns also assets?"
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,1667.77,1668.451,They are assets.
1991.90-1802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.592,1689.735,Do you think the Fourth Circuit opinion is consistent with Rutherford Food?
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,1695.69,1704.646,"Well, there is an inconsistency there, Your Honor, because Rutherford Food considered some typical common law factors as well as the purposes of the statute."
1991.90-1802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1707.257,1716.362,"Yes, and Rutherford Food is much closer to endorsing the common law test than Hearst or Silk were, I think."
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,1718.102,1720.335,"Well, I'm not so sure I do."
1991.90-1802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1724.537,1726.059,In Rutherford Food?
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,1726.059,1726.239,Yes.
1991.90-1802,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.475,1806.171,So the taking into account the broad remedial purposes of the statute means finding to be employees those who need the money.
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,1807.751,1808.612,"No, Your Honor, that's not true."
1991.90-1802,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1845.816,1863.477,"Well, I thought the agreement also provided that if the agency were terminated and the agent then went into competition within a 25-mile radius, that the benefits would be lost."
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,1863.477,1864.349,--That's correct.
1991.90-1802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1965.606,1983.427,Does the definition section of ERISA include the provision in the Fair Labor Standards Act that says an employee includes any individual employed by an employer?
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,1989.04,1991.021,"That's not in ERISA, Your Honor."
1991.90-1802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1991.021,1991.602,It is not?
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,1991.602,1992.303,"No, sir."
1991.90-1802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.303,2006.111,"Well, that is the... that seems to have been very important under Rutherford, because that definition was taken from the Child Labor Act."
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,2006.111,2011.775,"Well, I'm not aware of the origin of it, but I agree it had bearing on the court's decision."
1991.90-1802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2013.545,2018.16,"But that certainly doesn't sound like a... the common law definition, does it?"
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,2018.16,2020.721,"--Well, I don't know."
1991.90-1802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2048.789,2058.097,"Well, then would you still feel that Rutherford was controlling in the interpretation of the ERISA definition of employee?"
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,2058.097,2059.315,"--I would think it would be, yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2059.315,2074.376,"Well, why if the ERISA did not carry over the full definition of employee from the FLSA and the Court in Rutherford relied in part in its determination on the part that was not carried over into ERISA?"
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,2074.376,2086.114,"Well, I think that the statement in Rutherford that the definitions of the law employed should look to the purposes of the legislation in a broad remedial statute."
1991.90-1802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2088.415,2090.966,"Well, what statute isn't remedial, Mr. Follin?"
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,2094.82,2100.924,"--Well, I'm sure they are, but I don't... I wouldn't consider the Internal Revenue Service Act a broad remedial statute."
1991.90-1802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.924,2102.266,Why not?
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,2116.866,2125.501,"Well, I just... the ones they said are broad remedial statutes dealt with problems that people had facing some kind of economic difficulty."
1991.90-1802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2125.501,2132.496,You think only statutes designed to help people in economic difficulty should be broadly construed?
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,2132.496,2148.407,I was just trying to compare ones that the courts have said are that way.
1991.90-1802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2169.849,2174.982,"Well, certainly you wouldn't look to Silk or to Hearst where Congress overruled the holdings?"
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,2174.982,2178.085,"Well, they overruled it only with respect to those particular acts."
1991.90-1802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.642,2187.882,No.
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,2197.91,2199.089,"No, absolutely."
1991.90-1802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2209.577,2213.328,"Well, why would you do that if Congress later overruled it?"
1991.90-1802,2,35833,marion_g_follin_iii,,2213.328,2217.471,"Well, because just... in that... let me just give you an example."
1991.90-1802,3,25948,george_r_ragsdale,,2558.774,2560.656,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-1802,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2638.047,2653.828,"He also said in his brief, and he said here, that while those courts have avoided the erroneous path taken by the court below, it is unclear whether they are giving appropriate weight to this Court's decisions involving remedial social legislation, such as Rutherford Food, et cetera."
1991.90-1802,3,25948,george_r_ragsdale,,2653.828,2660.353,"--I concede that he discussed it, as he should, but he does not propose it here."
1991.90-1802,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2802.395,2819.857,"Mr. Ragsdale, I notice in your opening... in your brief, you managed to find the Hearst case, which dealt with the NLRB, and the Silk case, which dealt with Social Security, but you didn't manage to find the Rutherford Food case, which dealt with the Fair Labor Standards Act."
1991.90-1802,3,25948,george_r_ragsdale,,2821.86,2823.269,I didn't find it?
1991.90-1802,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2823.269,2827.343,"Well, it isn't listed in your table of authorities."
1991.90-1802,3,25948,george_r_ragsdale,,2827.343,2832.586,"We don't believe it is authoritative for these circumstances, and should not be followed in this case."
1991.90-1802,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2838.54,2841.832,How about the... how about your reply brief?
1991.90-1802,3,25948,george_r_ragsdale,,2850.778,2852.328,Yes.
1991.90-1802,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2852.328,2856.742,And it certainly used Rutherford Food.
1991.90-1802,3,25948,george_r_ragsdale,,2856.742,2857.273,Yes.
1991.90-1802,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2857.273,2858.402,Did you ever discuss it--
1991.90-1802,3,25948,george_r_ragsdale,,2862.175,2863.046,We discussed it.
1991.90-1802,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2917.461,2921.584,"We like to view that as Congress just amending the law, Mr. Ragsdale."
1991.90-1802,3,25948,george_r_ragsdale,,2924.165,2925.497,"No, I didn't say the Court was wrong."
1991.90-1802,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2925.497,2930.43,I think the Court properly interpreted the previous National Labor Relations Act and Congress enacted a new one.
1991.90-1802,3,25948,george_r_ragsdale,,2930.43,2931.661,I don't think it's a matter of--
1991.90-1802,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2931.661,2934.473,Maybe even a different Congress from the one that passed the original act.
1991.90-1802,3,25948,george_r_ragsdale,,2934.473,2937.075,"--I take that point, and I concede it."
1991.90-1802,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.871,2955.888,"Well, they might have said, why you were quite right, Mr. Court, in construing the old act, but we just don't like it anymore."
1991.90-1802,3,25948,george_r_ragsdale,,2957.257,2957.918,Maybe.
1991.90-1802,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2957.918,2963.862,Which doesn't affect how you should construe the old act.
1991.90-1802,3,25948,george_r_ragsdale,,2963.862,2972.558,"Well, Your Honor, the decisions of the United... the decision of United Insurance was 7 years on the books before ERISA was enacted."
1991.90-1802,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3027.085,3028.851,"Thank you, Mr. Ragsdale."
