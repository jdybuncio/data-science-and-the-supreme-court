2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.72,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-419, Dawson versus Steager."
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,6.72,37.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State's exemption violates Section 111 and this Court's precedents because it facially discriminates based on the source of the compensation, as only retirement benefits from state retirement plans are exempted, and the State cannot show any significant differences between retired employees of the U.S. Marshals Service and the exempted state retirees because the State concedes that their job duties are the same. This Court should reverse."
2018.17-419,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,37.64,58.64,What do we do with the fact that the job duties of marshals overlap with the two categories of the state? They overlap with the people paying less tax and with other law enforcement agents who pay more tax. So how do we go about identifying --
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,58.64,61.04,So --
2018.17-419,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,61.04,63.4,-- who they're most similar to?
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,63.4,66.68,"-- two responses, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.17-419,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,105.32,111.92,"But what if there are two groups of state employees, let's say group 1 and group 2, and they're similarly situated to each other --"
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,111.92,111.96,Uh-huh.
2018.17-419,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,111.96,138.04,"-- and then a group of federal -- federal employees who are similarly situated to both group 1 and group 2? In that situation, does the State have to treat the federal employees the same as the most favored group, if group 1 has a favorable tax treatment, or does the State in that example have discretion since the federal employees are similarly situated to both group 1, who gets the favorable, and group 2, who does not?"
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,138.04,143.76,"Justice Kavanaugh, the State has to treat the federal employees the same as the favored state employees."
2018.17-419,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,158.92,159.76,I -- I don't follow --
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,159.76,160.32,What if --
2018.17-419,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,160.32,161.44,-- why that is so.
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,186.68,194.72,"So, Justice Alito, I don't think you have to determine that because, again, it's an individual right against discrimination."
2018.17-419,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,214.08,219.76,But an antidiscrimination provision doesn't necessarily require a most favored nation clause.
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,228.88,230.2,"Justice Kagan, two responses."
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,254.52,254.8,Have any --
2018.17-419,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,254.8,268.68,"Can we get away from the academic two -- two classes and compare the two state groups? I take it that police officers, firefighters, and others are exempt."
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,284.24,292.48,"Justice Ginsburg, the larger group, as far as we can tell and the record reflects, is the state law enforcement personnel who are exempt."
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,326.76,329.88,"Well, but there -- he -- he was different things."
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,339.68,340.24,Right.
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,340.24,344.36,-- and that is not like a cop on the beat.
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,361.44,364.16,"I believe some of it does, but some also from when he was a deputy."
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,364.16,372.6,"Well, what do you do in that situation? I mean, we have different comparators on the state side, but he himself embodies, at least arguably, two entirely different types of job."
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,372.6,378.04,"He embodies multiple jobs, but his basic duties as a law enforcement officer didn't change."
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,385.32,386.0,I don't think that's right.
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,395.6,395.68,What --
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,395.68,401.52,"I mean, would you say the Attorney General would qualify in this situation? He has law enforcement duties."
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,401.52,406.84,"Probably not, but -- but that -- that's a different circumstance. On pages -- in the JA, pages 176 --"
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,406.84,410.92,"Well, how different? I mean, a marshal is appointed by the President, right?"
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,410.92,411.56,Yes.
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,411.56,414.04,"And -- and confirmed by the Senate, right?"
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,414.04,414.48,That's true.
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,414.48,424.56,"Well, that seems to me a little bit different than -- than, as I said, the -- you know, someone who's, day one, starting at the bottom level at the Marshals Service."
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,424.56,428.12,"Well, he did work for quite a while as a deputy United States Marshal."
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,428.12,434.72,"Well, yeah, but I'm wondering whether or not we should be parsing out if part of his retirement seems similar and part not."
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,434.72,447.32,"Well, I think it's all similar because, as a United States Marshal, even presidentially appointed, he still had the same law enforcement authority as the covered state employees. And this is the problem with the State's test."
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,475.72,483.12,"Is the head of the Marshals Service covered? In other words, not one of the state marshals but the -- the head of the Marshals Service?"
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,483.12,484.04,The U.S. Marshals Service?
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,484.04,485.4,Yes.
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,485.4,486.56,I -- I believe so.
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,486.56,490.72,So his -- his duties are the same as somebody who's on his first day?
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,490.72,493.0,"Oh, you mean the head of the Marshals Service nationally?"
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,493.0,493.84,Yeah.
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,493.84,497.08,"Well, I don't know that that person's in West Virginia, but I think there'd be an argument that he was --"
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,497.08,497.8,"Well, he lives somewhere."
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,497.8,498.24,Yeah.
2018.17-419,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,541.76,544.76,Could I go back to the two categories?
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,544.76,545.4,Yes.
2018.17-419,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,545.4,547.36,Let's assume they're identical.
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,547.36,547.88,Uh-huh.
2018.17-419,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,547.88,605.72,"All right? And I know that you're arguing that they're not, and this may be an issue, if we get to it, to remand, okay? But assuming they were, and if the difference was as articulated by Respondents here, one paid more than the other to the pension plan, so they -- the State wanted to be more generous to those who paid more, as I think is the case here. Why is that any different in kind to our suggestions in Davis and in other places that, if a scheme relied on the benefits paid out, anybody who made less than $15,000 a year in retirement benefits was exempt, but someone who made more wasn't, why is that different in kind to this situation?"
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,605.72,611.76,"Several responses, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's different in kind here because it's not the line the State drew."
2018.17-419,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,623.2,664.28,"What difference does that make? I mean, let's assume a situation where the State says state employees who are in one of these four plans, and let's further assume that everybody in those four plans receives a lesser benefit or, alternatively, contributes a greater percentage of their salary to the plan. So, you know, it's -- it's -- it's -- the State has just decided, look, this is a convenient way of identifying these people, but, in fact, all the people in these plans have that characteristic, which makes them different from the federal employees, that they contribute more or that they receive less in other benefits."
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,664.28,667.48,"Because that's still facially discriminatory, Justice Kagan."
2018.17-419,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,722.72,725.92,"Well, I guess my hypothetical was meant to take that off the table."
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,725.92,726.2,Sure.
2018.17-419,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,726.2,728.4,To say assuming that that's not true --
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,728.4,728.72,Right.
2018.17-419,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,728.72,742.92,"-- and the State really has categorized precisely as -- as to benefit levels or contribution levels but not in those terms, you're -- you know, not in those terms, and you're saying that in itself is impermissible?"
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,742.92,745.36,"Right, because it's facially discriminatory."
2018.17-419,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,869.68,903.28,"Suppose what -- suppose that the person who's drafting this bill for the state is trying to -- they think that the police officers and the others really -- they aren't paid very much and it's a particularly dangerous job, and you know those characteristics, so -- so they think they should give them a tax break. And then someone says, well, what about the federal marshals, they do the same thing? And then the person replies: Yes, they do, but they get paid a lot more, you see. And so the feds pay them a lot more than we pay the state people."
2018.17-419,0,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,906.56,909.48,"It -- it's not for three reasons, Justice Breyer."
2018.17-419,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,939.48,949.84,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Huston."
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,949.84,960.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree with Petitioner that this West Virginia tax exemption here is facially discriminatory."
2018.17-419,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,975.48,978.16,"Could you just say what you mean by ""facially discriminatory""?"
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,978.16,993.72,"Absolutely, Your Honor. A tax is facially discriminatory when it's not open to any federal employees ever, regardless of what job duties they perform or what their benefit level is or what their contribution rate is. And that was true of the statute -- the tax statutes in Davis and Barker."
2018.17-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,996.76,1003.52,"If that's the problem, why were you suggesting that we remand this? It would just seem as though we should decide it if that's the problem."
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1003.52,1030.16,"Well, I -- I think that even when a tax is facially discriminatory, Your Honor, there is going to be a second question, which is, is this particular employee actually suffering discrimination? And I think it gets to one of the questions that you were asking my friend in support of Petitioner, which is there can -- if you imagine, for example, that Mr. Dawson was a federally employed teacher, as opposed to a law enforcement officer, this tax exemption is still facially discriminatory."
2018.17-419,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1037.12,1046.16,So what would -- what precisely would you say would be open on remand? You're -- you're suggesting not reverse but vacate and remand.
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1053.52,1083.04,"Well, the West Virginia state court never undertook the analysis of whether Mr. Dawson is materially different from the federal employees -- excuse me, from the state employees who benefit from the exemption. Now, if the Court feels like it has all the information it needs, West Virginia has now come forward in its brief and put forward several purported justifications that it thinks can sustain its law, we agree with Petitioner that we don't think that the record bears out any of those. And if the Court thinks it has enough to decide the case, we're comfortable with --"
2018.17-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1083.04,1084.84,I -- I guess what I don't --
2018.17-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1084.84,1088.68,"Well -- well, it's, I think, related to your point."
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1098.12,1098.4,Your Honor --
2018.17-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1098.4,1103.08,Think carefully before answering. (Laughter.)
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1103.08,1113.16,"The government is much more interested in the courts, lower courts applying the correct legal rule than it is in exactly where a state court draws the line."
2018.17-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1113.16,1113.56,"Well, I'm sure."
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1124.32,1128.6,"Well, again, I think this -- it depends on how the state has drawn the class."
2018.17-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1165.8,1213.08,"But I guess what I -- I don't understand about -- about what you think ought to be left open on remand is, if you think that the prime evil of this legislation is that it's not facially neutral, that a federal employee can't be a part of these state plans, so could never be treated in the same way, then all the State justifications like these people get fewer benefits, these people pay more in -- in -- in -- make more of a contribution, all of that, do I understand your position correctly, is just irrelevant? The -- you know, the -- the state court could find that these people get less benefits and that these people, the state employees, make a greater contribution, and -- and yet not be able to rule for the State."
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1213.8,1253.8,"It's not quite correct, Your Honor, in this respect: The critical question is, is this plaintiff suffering discrimination on the basis of source of pay? And so, to return to your hypothetical from the last -- from the last session, if you imagine that it turns out that the State actually has selected only those plans where the employees, say, contribute less than 5 percent to their retirement and it has put in the, you know, disfavored category all employees who contribute more than 5 percent, if Mr. Dawson is in the disfavored class, if it turns out that he lines up with the class of -- of workers that West Virginia is not affording the benefit, he has not suffered discrimination. Now, at the time we wrote the --"
2018.17-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1253.8,1261.12,"No, but even if he is in the favored class, you're saying he's not -- no, I -- I -- okay, I get it."
2018.17-419,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1261.44,1267.04,What if he's -- what if he's equivalent to both the favored and the disfavored class? Then what?
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1267.04,1289.68,"If -- if there's really no basis at all on which to -- to make a distinction between who the state has selected and -- and who it has disfavored -- now, again, we don't think there are really any cases like that, but in that -- in that sort of unusual situation, I do think Mr. Dawson would be entitled to the exemption. And the reason is that the State would not be able to meet its burden to defend its facially discriminatory law."
2018.17-419,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1289.68,1321.92,"Let me try this out. Let me try this out and see if this is close to what you're saying. Where you have a variety of categories of state employees and some get the benefit in question and some don't get the benefit in question, so the first step would be you compare all the categories of -- the relevant categories of state employees and you identify the characteristics that distinguish the employees in the favored class from the -- from the characteristics of those in the disfavored class."
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1355.16,1356.84,"Your Honor, I think you have it exactly right."
2018.17-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1382.04,1382.56,I'm sorry --
2018.17-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1382.56,1382.96,Could you --
2018.17-419,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1382.96,1405.6,"-- can you go back and answer Justice Kagan's earlier question, which is, what are -- what are we remanding for? I -- I do think that there's been a concession that the job duties of federal marshals are similar to the exempted class. So what's left? You -- you said something to her that confused me."
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1431.08,1431.36,Right.
2018.17-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1452.72,1456.2,"Well, what -- what could -- what could -- this is going to the exact same thing."
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1467.6,1467.92,If --
2018.17-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1467.92,1473.16,"Like, how would that opinion read, a pro West Virginia opinion on remand?"
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1473.16,1486.32,"If the -- if the West Virginia Supreme Court found that, although the tax that's at issue here is facially discriminatory, the state actually drew the line to track a neutral criterion like contribution rates or something."
2018.17-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1490.36,1492.72,"Oh, well, that's -- that was exactly my hypothetical."
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1492.72,1493.56,Right.
2018.17-419,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1493.56,1495.64,And your friend answered it the other way.
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1509.44,1511.76,It is facial -- it is still facially discriminatory.
2018.17-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1529.84,1538.08,"Well, but that seems to me that you're looking at the State's purpose, and I thought the whole point was that you look just to the source of income."
2018.17-419,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1538.08,1549.52,"Well, you certainly do look to the source of income, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think you also look at is -- Davis said and -- and cases like Barker said, we're going to look at what is the justification the State has put forward for its law."
2018.17-419,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1562.28,1571.0,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. See."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1571.0,1589.48,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court's decision in Jefferson County demonstrates whatever else is required at the first stage in the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, at minimum, the challenging taxpayer must show that he is treated different from similarly-situated state employees."
2018.17-419,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1611.28,1615.32,"I'm sorry, the court below didn't say that."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1625.72,1625.88,The --
2018.17-419,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1625.88,1632.24,And they didn't even look at the comparison at all.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1638.84,1645.36,"Your Honor, it is true that the state trial court found that federal marshals have similar job duties to those who receive the exemption."
2018.17-419,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1649.32,1649.6,That's right.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1652.04,1652.6,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-419,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1652.6,1655.48,You have to -- you have to defend its judgment.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1664.04,1664.2,Yeah --
2018.17-419,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1664.2,1670.68,Now that's a hard line for me to accept because discrimination is treating someone differently.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1680.0,1707.4,"Well, Your Honor, it is true that the West Virginia Supreme Court focused on the first step of the analysis, and, there, the court did undertake a totality of the circumstances review. But it was simply taking this Court at its word in Davis, where this Court said that the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine is coextensive with Section 111 and that that doctrine incorporates the entire history and purpose of that doctrine. And from the time of McCulloch, that doctrine prevents discrimination against the federal government."
2018.17-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1712.48,1721.64,The statute prohibits discrimination against an officer or employee because of the source of pay or compensation.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1736.8,1740.96,"Yes, Your Honor, it's discrimination based on source of pay or compensation."
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1754.8,1772.96,"Well, if that were true, then this would apply only when the discrimination -- the alleged discrimination affects a lot of employees, because other than -- in fact, how many employees would have to be affected before it would have any kind of tangible effect on the finances of the federal government?"
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1772.96,1773.76,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1789.84,1799.32,"Well, I think that -- I understand your point is because there's discrimination, it's not necessarily discrimination on the basis of source, if you can find some other basis."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1836.12,1863.72,"No, Your Honor, that -- that's not the appropriate analysis here, because, in Phillips Chemical, which this Court relied on heavily in Davis, this Court expressly rejected the argument that a fact that on its face a statute targeted in that case specifically targeted those who dealt with the federal government, that that was enough without more to find discrimination. Instead, the Court said the appropriate analysis was to consider whether the challenged taxpayer was, in fact, being treated different from similarly-situated employees."
2018.17-419,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1865.04,1883.64,"I think you're having the problem I did from the beginning, which is everybody breaks this down into two steps, but it really is one step. It -- it -- because you don't even get to this inquiry unless state and federal employees are being treated different."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1891.12,1892.76,"Yes, Your Honor, that is the --"
2018.17-419,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1892.76,1901.4,And similarly situated in the sense of can you differentiate them on something other than the source of payment?
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1901.4,1902.88,"Correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1905.0,1905.88,I'm not sure.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1951.64,1952.32,"No, Your Honor --"
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1952.32,1964.36,"We don't see, in fact, whether there's some other thing that -- that distinguishes why you wanted to give this break to the state police."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1964.36,1964.76,"No, Your Honor --"
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1964.76,1967.4,You have here virtually all the state police.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1982.2,1984.88,"Well -- well, Your Honor, respectfully, I would dispute the premise there."
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1989.08,1989.64,It's not?
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,1989.64,1989.92,No.
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1989.92,2002.28,"I had it actually there was federal, there -- sorry, there were the state people, the sheriffs, the head sheriffs, the local policemen, that's where I thought -- and it says -- I thought I read that it said that they were eligible."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2002.92,2008.6,"Your Honor, it says that they are eligible if they are part of a specific retirement plan that applies to police or firefighters."
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2008.6,2010.56,And who decides?
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2010.56,2013.92,"Well, it's -- it's -- it's the particular retirement plan they're part of. So most --"
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2013.92,2019.68,"Who decides, whether I am a firefighter or a local policeman, who decides which plan I join?"
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2019.68,2020.56,"I -- I understand, Your Honor."
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.56,2020.6,Who?
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2020.6,2020.96,It's -- it's --
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.96,2021.84,"No, I don't understand."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2021.84,2022.44,"Oh, I -- I'm sorry."
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.44,2024.44,I want an answer to the question. (Laughter.)
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2024.44,2025.2,I understand your question.
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2025.2,2025.36,Yeah.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2025.36,2027.28,It's their particular locality that decides.
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2027.28,2033.84,So the individual policeman can't decide? It has to be a vote or a -- a municipality?
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2033.84,2035.92,"Yes, Your Honor, which is true for many employees."
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2038.36,2042.68,So how many local police are roughly in this program and how many local police aren't?
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2042.68,2046.08,"Your Honor, the State of West Virginia Tax Department does not keep those exact numbers."
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2047.24,2048.44,You can't give them to me at all?
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2048.44,2055.88,"Well, what I can represent to you is that, of the roughly 200 cities that have separate police, only 30 of them have a separate police retirement plan."
2018.17-419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2056.28,2058.04,"Well, but, I mean, you've got to figure how -- how many."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2066.6,2074.6,"Well -- well, Your Honor, it does -- it does bring us back to the situation where there are some employees who have identical job descriptions who receive the exemption and some who don't."
2018.17-419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2078.24,2103.16,"Well, and to get back -- this is pertinent, I think, to your response to Justice Breyer and to me -- how do you reconcile with your answer this language from Davis? In Davis, it said a tax exemption truly intended to account for differences in retirement benefits would not discriminate on the basis of the source of those benefits, as Michigan's statute does, whether it would discriminate on the basis of the amount of benefits received by individual retirees."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2103.16,2103.68,Yes.
2018.17-419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2103.88,2113.0,"So that's why I -- I mean, I'm concerned about the idea that, yes, it says the source, is it federal or state, but we really think it's something else. And Davis seems to say you can't do that."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2113.0,2136.84,"Well, Your Honor, first, I would note that that language comes at the second step of the analysis, whether the burden shifts to the state to find significant differences between the state taxpayers. But even so, the question would simply be, what does the tax actually do on the ground? This Court has said in Phillips Chemical and in Jefferson County that the Court looks beyond the particular labels. In City of Detroit, this Court said that's necessary in order to give due regard for state taxing power."
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2136.84,2137.48,What are the characteristics --
2018.17-419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2137.48,2138.84,"Well, here, Phillips -- Phillips -- I'm sorry."
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2138.84,2139.52,No.
2018.17-419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2139.52,2141.48,Phillips Chemical said the same thing.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2156.72,2157.44,Correct.
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2162.84,2163.04,Okay.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2163.68,2163.76,Here --
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2163.76,2174.84,"I mean, what is it that the -- the 20 towns with the police and the state sheriffs and the state deputy sheriffs and all these different -- what is it they do that the federal marshals don't do?"
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2174.84,2184.68,"Your Honor, the point of commonality for those who receive the exemption and those who don't is that they are state -- they are law enforcement officers who are part of a retirement plan that is open exclusively to law enforcement."
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2184.68,2185.36,That -- that can't be --
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2185.36,2188.72,That sounds like you're saying we discriminate on the basis of source.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2188.72,2202.84,"No, Your Honor, because, to -- to succeed at the similarly-situated analysis, the State of West Virginia agrees that if there were a retired federal law enforcement officer who had a retirement plan with similar characteristics, that that would be enough to succeed at this stage."
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2202.84,2203.0,Yeah.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2228.6,2231.88,The -- the question is whether there is discrimination based on the source of income.
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2239.52,2259.36,"Could you just explain, what are the unique characteristics of those who get the favorable treatment, the characteristics that distinguish them from the state employees who don't get it? What are the characteristics that they -- they have? And then we can see whether a marshal or a deputy marshal has those characteristics."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2259.36,2263.36,All of those characteristics go to the particular retirement plan that they're part of.
2018.17-419,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2263.36,2265.68,It's this benefits and contributions?
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2265.68,2267.88,"Benefits and contributions is part of it, yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2282.2,2283.2,All right.
2018.17-419,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2283.2,2284.6,"Well, we can't possibly -- I'm sorry."
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2284.6,2287.68,Deputy marshals have a risk too.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2287.68,2292.6,There are some deputy marshals who are eligible for the exemption but not all of them.
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2304.12,2305.64,Why does that matter?
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2305.64,2312.04,It matters because the state has decided that the particular funding considerations of those plans warrant separate tax treatment.
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2318.08,2344.56,"Ah, that's the nub of this, it seemed to me, that -- that -- is it the case that if the state never thought of this, it wasn't against the marshals; it just developed a system that meant that they have a lot more money -- less money in their pocket than comparable state. Does that violate the statute? Now I thought the answer to that question is yes, it does violate the statute."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2361.88,2367.96,"Well, Your Honor, we -- we agree that the State's -- the State's reason is not the deciding line here."
2018.17-419,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2375.76,2385.56,"So if I understand what you -- what you're saying, I think you suggested three characteristics of the members of these plans, and one is that they receive low benefits."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2399.48,2400.32,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-419,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2400.32,2444.88,"Now it seems to me that we couldn't possibly do anything -- suppose -- even if you were right, that -- that if the State showed all of that, I mean, we're not in a position to rule in your favor here. At the very most, you're entitled to -- or at the very most, what we should do is remand so that the state court could figure out whether, in fact, the members of this state plan, as compared to federal employees, receive lower benefits, make higher contributions, and are similarly in a -- you know, and -- and -- and don't share this characteristic of a law-enforcement-only plan?"
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2444.88,2455.68,"Well, Your Honor, we agree that if this Court -- if this Court believes that the determination of the case turns on those fact-specific inquiries, particularly on the significant differences test, the West Virginia Supreme Court did not reach them."
2018.17-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2459.24,2459.8,But what happens to --
2018.17-419,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2459.8,2461.4,So that is very interesting because --
2018.17-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2461.4,2466.4,-- the -- this was not raised the first time around.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2468.64,2475.12,"Well, Your Honor, it was raised the first time around, both the similarly-situated point and the step two significant differences."
2018.17-419,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2498.92,2508.76,"What -- what -- what strikes me about the way this argument has gone, it's a little bit unexpected for me, is that you and the SG actually agree."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2508.76,2510.44,"We do, Your Honor, on most parts."
2018.17-419,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2510.44,2525.28,"Because you think that the states should be able to prove that the members of this plan are different from federal employees, notwithstanding that the State has made a non-neutral distinction."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2534.52,2539.68,"Well, Your Honor, respectfully, my friend's position for Petitioners would be at odds with what this Court has done before."
2018.17-419,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2539.68,2540.72,"Well, but, counsel --"
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2540.72,2541.2,This --
2018.17-419,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2541.2,2543.96,-- I guess I'm struggling with what Justice Kagan is.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2583.68,2591.32,"Because, Your Honor, even under that approach, Mr. Dawson, this Petitioner, is not being treated different from state employees."
2018.17-419,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2610.32,2611.12,I'm sorry --
2018.17-419,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2611.12,2611.44,Is that --
2018.17-419,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2611.44,2626.68,-- there's never going to be an identical federal plan to an identical state plan unless the state chooses to model its plan on -- out of a federal plan. This is an invitation to just throw Davis away.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2638.84,2668.84,"Well, no, Your Honor, because we're not arguing that the Court needs to look at all of the particular details of the plan, but only what -- what is the broadest point of commonality that sweeps in all of those plans that receive the exemption and those who don't. And the State's position is that point of commonality is that there are plans that are available only to law enforcement officers. That's all that this Court has to do. And this Court may second-guess the wisdom of a state giving a tax exemption based on that criteria, but, respectfully, that's not a decision for this Court and not one that the government requests that it --"
2018.17-419,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2668.84,2679.12,"So, even if the two plans are identical, merely because the state chooses a police-officer-only plan, that's enough of a difference to do away with Davis?"
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2679.12,2686.76,"Yes, Your Honor, to the extent that they are identical in terms of benefits or -- or -- or the way that term of service is concluded."
2018.17-419,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2690.24,2692.44,Why isn't that just plain source?
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2692.44,2712.0,"It's not plain source because, as the State agrees, if there were a federal retiree who was also part of a law-enforcement-only retirement plan, then they would pass this first stage. But that does not mean that that -- that that statute would automatically be struck down, because the State would still have the opportunity at the second stage of the analysis to show that there are significant differences."
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2712.0,2737.92,"Well, what would be the argument for giving favorable treatment -- suppose we're just talking about categories of state employees, and you have -- you have law enforcement -- you have law enforcement officers who are basically identical, but one is in a law-enforcement-only plan and the other is in a plan that includes other employees. What would be the reason for treating those -- those differently?"
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2737.92,2746.64,"Well -- well, the reason, we suggest, is because there are special funding considerations when you have a retirement plan that's only available to those in a high-risk profession, such as law enforcement."
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2746.64,2746.8,Okay.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2752.96,2759.24,"No, Your Honor, I'm saying that would be the justification for a state to draw a line between law-enforcement-only and something else."
2018.17-419,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2772.84,2773.52,In terms of job duties --
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2773.52,2774.12,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-419,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2774.12,2783.96,"-- in terms of job duties, is there a distinction that you see between the favored state employees and the disfavored state employees in terms of job duties?"
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2783.96,2784.8,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-419,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2803.92,2811.76,"And what are the distinctions between the state -- again, just on my question, the distinctions between the state favored class and the disfavored state class? I just want to --"
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2811.76,2818.44,"Well -- well, with respect to sheriffs, most sheriffs, in fact, virtually all state sheriffs in West Virginia, do not receive the exemption."
2018.17-419,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2822.28,2824.24,How do their job duties differ?
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2824.24,2825.64,"Well, the job -- the job duties are different."

2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2841.84,2843.12,Suppose a retiree --
2018.17-419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2843.12,2843.48,"No, go ahead."
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2843.48,2851.8,"Suppose a retiree had worked for 20 years as a deputy sheriff, one year as a sheriff, and then retired."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2856.4,2865.24,"Well, if the employee had worked -- worked for 20 years as a deputy sheriff, let's assume that their deputy sheriff retirement benefits had vested, they would have the ability to receive those benefits."
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2876.36,2876.68,Okay.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2895.68,2902.0,"Because, Your Honor, I was assuming for the purposes of that question that this hypothetical deputy sheriff was part of the deputy sheriffs' retirement system in West Virginia."
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2902.48,2904.32,"Well, I don't know where you're going with that --"
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2904.32,2904.56,-- that's true.
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2904.56,2915.52,"-- because suppose the state -- the state has a -- all of its employees are in one plan, okay, and the state says those people get this benefit."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2924.12,2929.48,"We would say that employee, yes, has made out a case that he or she is being treated different than similarly-situated state employees."
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2929.48,2929.76,Okay.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2935.64,2938.56,It -- it turns on the particular components of the plan.
2018.17-419,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2938.56,2947.68,"Yeah, the components of the plan, but not the mere fact that you are or are not a -- a member of that plan."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2947.68,2956.96,"Your Honor, it does depend on whether someone is a member of the plan, but in order to determine if a similarly-situated federal employee is being treated different, we have to look at what describes that plan."
2018.17-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2966.6,2977.6,"But, in fact, there is no such -- we know what the federal retirement plans are, and there's no retirement plan like these four."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,2977.6,2978.32,"Correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2979.44,2985.36,And you say -- and you say that that's enough and it doesn't matter that the job duties are identical.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3005.6,3008.52,"Yes, Your Honor, that's what this Court held in Jefferson County."
2018.17-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3016.76,3021.96,I thought the Court said in Jefferson County that state judges and federal judges were treated the same.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3021.96,3033.4,"They did say they were treated the same, and job duties was relevant there because the statute drew distinctions based on individuals who were members of covered professions who did or did not pay other state license fees."
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3033.84,3038.8,I began to see this as a different issue than I had initially thought.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3042.4,3043.56,All right. (Laughter.)
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3043.56,3045.44,"And if I'm off base, just say it."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3062.24,3062.44,Yes.
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3062.44,3063.16,Okay.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3088.56,3103.36,"Yes, if the distinction is based on the type of retirement fund, and, again, the only reason that distinction matters is because that's the distinction in the state tax code. And in Phillips Chemical, this Court said that is the line the Court should look at. How has the state drawn the favored class --"
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3103.36,3103.68,Okay.
2018.17-419,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3103.68,3104.32,It's a simple --
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3104.32,3119.8,"So where did I get -- I didn't -- for some reason, it's not necessarily your fault, but I -- this is a fairly simple point. Look at the retirement fund, and if that's the basis for the discrimination against the federal employees, that's fine."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3124.84,3126.36,"Your Honor, I would add to that --"
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3126.36,3127.0,Is that right?
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3127.0,3128.8,"Yes, but I would add to that."
2018.17-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3128.8,3131.84,"Then I didn't get that out of the brief too well, but maybe that's my fault."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3132.52,3158.68,"Well, if -- if the distinction is that is a federal retirement plan and that is the reason that someone is or is not in the favored class, then that would be discriminatory under the doctrine. But that's not what this West Virginia tax regime is doing, because the reality is there are many state -- state retirees, over 98 percent, who are in the disfavored class. And there are many state law enforcement officers, some with identical jobs, who are also in the disfavored class."
2018.17-419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3158.68,3163.56,It seems to me that Davis makes it very clear that that's not a significant consideration.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3185.92,3191.44,"Well, Your Honor, the first question would be whether the particular challenger is, in fact, in that tiny category."
2018.17-419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3191.44,3193.84,"Yeah, but that first question was not the one I asked."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3216.08,3218.24,"Your Honor, in that case, it probably would."
2018.17-419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3228.8,3231.32,"Well, you just said it doesn't matter and then you tell me it matters."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3231.32,3237.84,"Well, Your Honor, it matters only because it's indication that the actual dividing line in the state tax code is not state versus federal."
2018.17-419,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3249.48,3259.48,"On -- on job duties, if -- if we conclude that that's most significant, were Dawson's job duties similar to the duties of the favored state employees?"
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3259.48,3266.76,"They were similar, yes, Your Honor, but that does not end the inquiry because they were just as similar to the disfavored state law enforcement employees."
2018.17-419,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3266.76,3267.12,Okay.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3285.4,3292.4,Because courts are never required to turn a blind eye to evidence in the record that shows that the comparison class a plaintiff has brought forward is inappropriate.
2018.17-419,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3292.4,3294.28,"Well, why is it inappropriate? That's the point."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3297.4,3297.76,Because --
2018.17-419,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3297.76,3300.84,-- in the sense that they're similarly situated in both the favored and the disfavored.
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3303.16,3306.92,"Right, because it doesn't show what -- what the actual dividing line is in that case."
2018.17-419,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3321.6,3344.0,"But I think the only way to be sure in that circumstance that we're describing that you're not discriminating against the federal employees is to be -- to give them the treatment that the favored state employees get. If you give them the treatment that the disfavored state employees get, you're never going to be sure whether that's based on discrimination against the federal government or not."
2018.17-419,2,63062,lindsay_s_see,,3349.56,3370.72,"Your Honor, this Court has never held a most favored taxpayer standard. In fact, in Jefferson County, that was just as true there, because there were many state officers who received the exemption and did not. This Court found that the fact that there were some who were like the federal challengers there in the disfavored class, that was enough to find that similarly-situated taxpayers were, in fact, treated the same."
2018.17-419,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3376.24,3379.44,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, LAWRENCE D. ROSENBERG."
2018.17-419,3,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,3379.44,3395.48,"I just have a few points in rebuttal. First of all, in response to the question that Justice Breyer and the Chief Justice posed at the end, this plainly is discrimination based on the source."
2018.17-419,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3453.12,3454.08,Could you slow down?
2018.17-419,3,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,3454.08,3454.28,I'm sorry.
2018.17-419,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3454.28,3455.48,You've got a lot of generalities.
2018.17-419,3,35042,lawrence_d_rosenberg,,3456.44,3456.6,Sorry.
2018.17-419,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3628.16,3629.28,"Thank you, counsel."
