2010.09-1227,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.42,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 09-1227, Bond v. United States."
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,9.189,12.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1227,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,58.253,62.472,Do our -- any of our opinions talk about the standing of the defendant?
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,64.74,78.833,"Well, I think it was in the habeas context, but the Spencer decision does talk about how, when you have a criminal defendant or somebody who is serving a sentence, their standing to challenge the conviction is essentially one of the easiest standing cases you can imagine."
2010.09-1227,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.881,111.035,"Well, it seems to me there are certainly some arguments you could make as a defendant for which you have no standing."
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,115.939,119.224,"--Well, I'm not sure you would call it normal standing principles, Your Honor."
2010.09-1227,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.83,142.923,Suppose I raise an Establishment Clause objection in a matter that -- that does not involve legislation and which our recent opinions say therefore does not violate the Establishment Clause?
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,142.923,149.826,"--Well, I guess I would have to know why you were a defendant in that case and how it had anything to do with the price of tea in that particular case."
2010.09-1227,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.926,151.559,"No, you wouldn't."
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,166.455,168.205,"--With respect, I don't think that follows."
2010.09-1227,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,180.929,182.262,I'd say it's a Free Exercise Clause violation.
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,184.381,192.051,"--Well, if they said, well, we're hereby establishing a religion and you're not part of our religion and we're therefore imprisoning you, I would think you could bring that claim."
2010.09-1227,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,206.458,216.58,"Mr. Clement, in the case before us, are you making any claims other than that Congress was acting outside its enumerated powers in enacting this statute?"
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,238.577,243.112,"Well, Justice Kagan, principally our argument here is an enumerated powers argument."
2010.09-1227,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,253.92,264.359,"Well, let's just use the Printz case and say, even though Congress might have the ability to enact a statute under Article I, there's an independent Tenth Amendment limitation."
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,267.661,272.279,"Well, I don't think so, but let me just say that my problem is -- take the Printz case."
2010.09-1227,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,284.803,296.461,"Well, let's assume, Mr. Clement, that there is such a thing as a claim in which you're saying, I can see that this is within Congress's Article I powers, but there is an independent Tenth Amendment limitation on this."
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,298.413,313.69,"--I don't think so, Justice Kagan, but I'd hate to sort of bet my case that on remand, I'm not going to say something in making an argument that the government or somebody else thinks is too much of a commandeering claim and too much -- not enough of an enumerated power claim."
2010.09-1227,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,313.69,317.975,The government agrees that it's an enumerated power claim in this case.
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,317.975,321.509,"Again, Justice Ginsburg, that is the basis of our claim."
2010.09-1227,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,322.359,341.304,"You are -- you are at no risk if the Court were just limited to what both of you agree is involved -- Article I, Section 8 -- and if there is a difference for commandeering claims, when the case arises, we can deal with it."
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,341.304,354.897,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, you could certainly do that, and as long as it is crystal clear that there will be no obstacle to my client making a constitutional attack on section 229 on remand, I suppose that's fair enough for my client."
2010.09-1227,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,379.762,398.724,"So you want us to say that when there is a specific injury, specific to your client, that your client has the right to make any argument to show that the government has exceeded its powers under the Constitution, because those powers are limited to protect the liberties of the individual?"
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,398.724,409.281,"Exactly right, Justice Kennedy, and that's the fundamental worry I have here, is that this Court's cases have not drawn a distinction between commandeering claims and enumerated powers claims."
2010.09-1227,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,460.047,466.784,Can't there be some Tenth Amendment claims that go just to State prerogatives and not to the rights of individuals?
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,481.544,482.91,"I think it would, Justice Alito."
2010.09-1227,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,520.685,525.637,"Mr. Clement, if you are not making a commandeering claim, then we would be going out of our way to decide that question."
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,528.838,533.092,--I don't -- I don't self-identify as having made a commandeering claim.
2010.09-1227,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,544.964,556.088,"Well, the problem is if you're just making a treaty power claim, then how are you going to possibly win on remand in the Third Circuit if we reverse and say that your -- your client has standing?"
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,563.742,565.694,"Well two things, Justice Alito."
2010.09-1227,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,615.741,618.31,Does that depend on the nature of the chemical that's involved?
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,632.118,633.653,"--I think it does, Justice Alito."
2010.09-1227,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,650.012,653.281,But that's a merits question rather than a standing question.
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,656.047,660.018,"No, I was trying to respond to the question of whether we would be foreclosed."
2010.09-1227,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,660.018,660.485,All right.
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,662.435,665.37,"No, we're not asking you to do more than do standing."
2010.09-1227,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,708.463,715.95,"What do you say about the one thing -- the strongest point against you, I think, is a single sentence in that TVA case."
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,780.19,785.742,"Could I say two things about that sentence, and then explain what I really think you should say?"
2010.09-1227,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,803.537,807.523,"So it comes out of left field, and it's an overall ""any, even, if""."
2010.09-1227,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,809.873,812.306,And it's dictum in another way.
2010.09-1227,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,933.566,934.666,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,942.754,945.52,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1227,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1009.694,1030.255,"It's kind of hard under our precedents to draw that precise line between enumerated powers and the Tenth Amendment, and it seems a bit much to put defendant to the trouble of trying to do that under the theory from TVA that they have no standing to make a particular type of Tenth Amendment claim."
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1030.255,1049.569,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that the defendant needs to be put in any trouble in this case because the kind of claim that counsel is making on her behalf does assert her right not to be subject to criminal punishment under a law that he says, counsel says, Congress lacks the authority to enact."
2010.09-1227,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1049.569,1064.995,"Well, what if they argue -- what if she argues on remand, if there is a remand, that, assuming for the sake of argument Congress can enact any law that is necessary and proper to implement a treaty?"
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1079.921,1112.809,"It falls into the enumerated powers category, Justice Alito, just as last term in United States v. Comstock one of the elements that this Court looked at when it decided whether the law authorizing civil commitment in that case was within Congress's enumerated authority plus the Necessary and Proper Clause, the Court looked at the extent to which the law accommodated State interests or, alternatively, invaded them in an unlawful manner, which is what Mr. Comstock had alleged in that case."
2010.09-1227,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1112.809,1132.52,"But you're -- you want us to say that, even if the defendant in some case might show that a constitutional violation is causing that defendant specific injury, the defendant may not be able to raise the claim of its, what you call sovereignty claim?"
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1204.048,1208.267,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I -- I don't take issue with almost everything that you said."
2010.09-1227,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1248.077,1254.563,I don't know whether that's a correct characterization of the argument that was made in -- in the Tennessee Electric case.
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1278.512,1281.048,"That may be, Justice Alito."
2010.09-1227,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1308.881,1311.481,Why didn't it just consider it as outside the Commerce Clause?
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1329.96,1331.827,Justice Breyer--
2010.09-1227,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1331.827,1334.762,"In this case, which -- because of the Tenth Amendment and a lot of other things."
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1334.762,1335.698,"--I understand that, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-1227,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1335.698,1340.4,"And this case seems the same, saying it's beyond the power of Congress to enact because of the treaty."
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1340.4,1343.602,Well I think if you intrude today's analytical model--
2010.09-1227,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1343.602,1343.952,Yes.
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1343.952,1347.004,"--under today's jurisprudence, that is how the case would be viewed."
2010.09-1227,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1349.704,1350.772,How do we know that?
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1352.538,1356.24,"The language from the sentence, Justice Breyer, that you in fact read--"
2010.09-1227,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1356.24,1356.676,Yes.
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1356.676,1373.868,"--discussing whether the presence or absence of a State objection mattered, the Court said: As we've seen there's no objection from the State, and if this were not so the appellants, absent the States or their officers, have no standing to raise any objection under the amendment."
2010.09-1227,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1373.868,1380.624,"Let's assume in this hypothetical -- just that case, TVA."
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1406.007,1407.691,That is not an anti-commandeering claim.
2010.09-1227,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1412.226,1428.272,"So my question goes back to one that's been asked before, which is, give me a hypothetical of a defendant who has been convicted where it would be a pure anticommandeering claim that you say they have no standing for."
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1428.272,1439.746,"This will take me back to -- to Justice Kennedy's question, because I wanted to answer the part that I thought distinguished a commandeering case from what Justice Kennedy was talking about."
2010.09-1227,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1490.428,1493.73,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, why shouldn't the defendant be able to raise that argument?"
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1504.936,1514.292,"Well, Justice Kagan, this is the absolutely crucial point that distinguishes commandeering from most of the structural constitutional provisions that we've been discussing this morning."
2010.09-1227,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1543.461,1547.031,"Well, all you're saying is that there's -- in that hypothetical is that there's no violation?"
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1547.031,1547.831,--That's correct.
2010.09-1227,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1547.831,1548.748,Everybody goes home.
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1548.748,1557.821,There -- the reason why in that hypothetical the defendant should not raise the issue is because there will be no violation--
2010.09-1227,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1557.821,1558.923,But that's a merits question.
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1563.975,1577.3,"--You could say that, Justice Kagan, but I think that part of the enduring force of TVA is that it adopted a third-party standing rule that is still part of this Court's jurisprudence."
2010.09-1227,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1577.3,1595.595,"Well, why couldn't you have said the same thing in TVA, that, while companies are -- are -- not -- yes, the Federal -- the Federal statute requires the companies to charge this price, but they might have decided to charge it on their own anyway, and therefore you have no standing?"
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1595.595,1609.585,"Well, the Court did say that there was no standing on the grounds that when the specific argument was made, this takes away the right of the State to regulate because the Federal Government is regulating."
2010.09-1227,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1609.585,1614.973,"Mr. Dreeben, is your concern that there would be a clash in these cases?"
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1635.469,1640.039,"That is a major factor in third-party standing generally, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1227,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1640.039,1642.824,Suppose a State wanted to be commandeered in Printz?
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1650.728,1652.096,They can do that.
2010.09-1227,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1653.179,1655.381,I -- I have -- I have -- I have serious trouble with that.
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1666.069,1668.188,"--No, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-1227,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1680.246,1688.769,Why isn't standard standing doctrine able to give you the protection that you're looking after?
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1699.41,1704.212,That is a perfectly acceptable route of analysis.
2010.09-1227,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1704.212,1709.265,I would rather use that route of analysis than inventing the new one that you're -- that you're urging upon us.
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1709.265,1711.217,"Well, I don't think they're different, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-1227,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1715.502,1723.108,"Well, then let's use the one we already have and -- and not -- not have to get into developing one that I've never heard of before."
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1723.108,1739.285,"--I think, Justice Scalia, that all the Government is doing in this case is applying conventional standing principles of redressability and third-party standing in a specific context, which as Mr. Clement has made clear, is not before the Court today."
2010.09-1227,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1792.002,1799.073,Does that analysis differ in any way because this is a treaty power claim versus a Commerce Clause claim?
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1812.93,1823.055,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, I believe that the statute is valid under either the Treaty Clause plus the Necessary and Proper Clause analysis under Missouri v. Holland."
2010.09-1227,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1850.288,1855.342,"Given the breadth of this statute, that would be a very far-reaching decision, wouldn't it?"
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1874.97,1877.189,"I'm not sure, Justice Alito."
2010.09-1227,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1879.524,1882.826,If she possesses a chemical weapon.
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1882.826,1885.611,--I'm not sure that vinegar is a chemical weapon.
2010.09-1227,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1885.611,1890.349,"Well, a chemical weapon is a weapon that includes toxic chemicals."
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1901.471,1922.451,"I'm willing to make the assumption with you and accept that it is a broad-reaching statute, but it was adopted as a broad-reaching statute because this is an area, like the medical marijuana instance in Raich, where effective control of the interstate market requires control of an intrastate market."
2010.09-1227,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1943.197,1946.399,"The difference is that Raich involved one commodity, right?"
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1977.634,1994.046,"--Well, I think it's pretty well recognized, Justice Alito, that when Congress seeks to regulate an interstate market as to which there cannot be any question under the Commerce Clause Congress could do, it can control the intrastate market as necessary in order to assure that its prohibition is effective."
2010.09-1227,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.046,1995.962,You're trying to drive vinegar out of the interstate market?
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2005.752,2006.87,"No, of course not."
2010.09-1227,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2006.87,2010.739,"Mr. Dreeben, are we getting to the merits of the case?"
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2010.739,2014.191,"A lot further than I had intended, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1227,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2134.635,2144.556,"In the category that you would like to have saved, you said commandeering, but you said there conceivably could be others."
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2152.746,2162.352,"Well, as Justice Alito pointed out, the Court has indicated that moving a State capital, a direction to move the State capital, might be an intrusion on sovereignty."
2010.09-1227,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2162.352,2166.256,Unlikely to come up as a defense in a criminal case.
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2166.256,2167.106,Highly unlikely.
2010.09-1227,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2167.106,2168.539,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2010.09-1227,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2168.539,2168.972,Thank you.
2010.09-1227,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2168.972,2178.564,Mr. McAllister.
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2178.564,2181.765,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1227,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2209.915,2217.002,"Pretty harsh, if we're talking about prudential standing, to deny that to a criminal defendant, isn't it?"
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2217.002,2222.656,"It's potentially harsh, Your Honor, but there are lower court cases that have certainly done it."
2010.09-1227,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2313.63,2314.096,Excuse me.
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2341.363,2345.332,"Well, I would say at least a couple things, Your Honor."
2010.09-1227,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2375.37,2381.274,Do you think Pennsylvania would be upset that the Federal Government got her when they couldn't?
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2381.274,2382.39,"--No, that's my point."
2010.09-1227,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.929,2411.992,"Well, in a -- in another case, conceivably, the State Attorney General can exercise his or her prosecutorial discretion not to -- not to prosecute this woman, or at least not to prosecute her under the antiterrorism law that gives her 8 years."
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2425.3,2436.608,"Well, it's standard that both sovereigns have the ability often to prosecute if the definitions of crimes overlap, and there's nothing that prevents Pennsylvania from prosecuting her again here."
2010.09-1227,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2436.608,2439.56,She wants to make the argument that the definitions don't overlap.
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2454.82,2455.72,"Well, in--"
2010.09-1227,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2455.72,2456.92,That's what she's trying to do.
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2458.853,2466.791,"--Because the lower courts, at least, in their defense, understood this to be a Tenth Amendment claim, and there are reasons for that."
2010.09-1227,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2505.983,2509.768,That single sentence doesn't seem -- I'm trying to figure it out.
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2576.538,2579.223,"As a -- I mean, she's arguing a lack of power."
2010.09-1227,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2580.075,2580.675,Yes.
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2584.277,2593.467,"--Well, I think, again, the sentence -- I mean, if we're talking about the sentence in TVA barring standing in Tenth Amendment claims--"
2010.09-1227,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.467,2594.3,Yes.
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2595.519,2604.191,"--It says ""in this case"", but there's no suggestion that it will -- frankly, it's hard for us to even tell exactly what this case was in terms of the facts."
2010.09-1227,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2605.607,2606.207,"No, he cites."
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2609.575,2614.194,For that particular instance -- and that's certainly an example the Court had in mind.
2010.09-1227,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2669.061,2684.921,"Could you just articulate for me -- we're speaking in generalities -- what in the nature of her claim, taking the labels away, do you think is a pure Tenth Amendment challenge?"
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2684.921,2685.921,"Well, that's--"
2010.09-1227,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2685.921,2695.609,"As I read her complaint, and it's always that it's a Tenth Amendment claim because Congress and the president have exceeded their powers in some--"
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2695.609,2710.302,"--As I understand her complaint, basically her argument is that unless this statute is authorized by something in Article I, section 8, the first 17 clauses, there's no power to enact it."
2010.09-1227,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2732.199,2734.465,--That's -- you haven't answered my -- my question.
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2744.256,2766.27,"Well, Your Honor, in essence, at the end of the day, it will be a merits question, but from a standing argument, trying to define what is a Tenth Amendment claim -- and the point I was trying to make, perhaps not successfully, is that she's not saying -- well, she is sort of saying the Article I, section 8 enumerated powers are the limits."
2010.09-1227,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2798.305,2799.657,"Well, why do we have to do that?"
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2839.299,2840.151,Well--
2010.09-1227,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2840.151,2842.351,--In an enumerated powers argument.
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2842.351,2845.603,"--In an enumerated powers case, yes."
2010.09-1227,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2888.274,2891.226,"Mr. McAllister, I guess I don't understand why that makes a difference."
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2919.274,2933.701,"--Well, I would disagree somewhat, Your Honor, respectfully, that -- her argument about the Necessary and Proper Clause I don't think is that this -- this -- she's not arguing the statute is an irrational or unreasonable way to implement the treaty obligations of the United States."
2010.09-1227,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2988.354,2991.14,I'm not sure I -- I'm not sure I understood what you just said.
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3009.601,3012.219,"No, I'm not sure that's what I meant to say, Justice Alito."
2010.09-1227,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3081.197,3096.957,"Mr. McAllister, have you found any case other than this one where a criminal defendant was held to have lacked standing to challenge a statute under which the defendant was prosecuted?"
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3096.957,3102.211,"Not in this Court, Justice Ginsburg, but there are examples in the circuits, a few."
2010.09-1227,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3177.008,3180.96,Isn't that an issue for a civil lawsuit as opposed to a criminal one?
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3194.184,3208.628,"--Well, the State isn't a party, but what gets said in those cases about the scope of the State's prerogatives vis -- vis the Federal Government could well be brought to bear in other cases in other settings, commandeering cases."
2010.09-1227,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3228.005,3228.889,"Well, there's two things that could happen."
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3246.401,3261.91,"Well, I guess again, and maybe I'm misapprehending, but the long-term interest is a -- is a decision, say in the criminal case, that says, no, this doesn't intrude on the State's sovereignty, is there as a matter of stare decisis."
2010.09-1227,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3278.705,3295.315,"Your underlying premise is that the individual has no interest in whether or not the State has surrendered its powers to the Federal Government, and I just don't think the Constitution was framed on that theory."
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3295.315,3307.455,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I don't know that I would say they have no interest, but I am -- I guess the premise I'm asserting is they do not necessarily get to assert the Tenth Amendment claim of the States."
2010.09-1227,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3325.234,3336.106,"But it does -- it does assume, as Justice Kennedy said, that the reason that is there in the Constitution is only for the benefits of the States, and not for the benefit of the people in the States."
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3362.34,3365.358,"--Well, and that's a conclusion the Court can reach."
2010.09-1227,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3379.867,3393.961,"There -- there's a question of causality, so some of them will -- will not be valid because you can't show that the -- that the State was coerced into doing something and therefore you can't show that the violation of the Constitution caused your injury."
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3393.961,3398.929,And that's -- but you're talking now really the causality; that's an Article III inquiry.
2010.09-1227,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3410.301,3412.337,"Thank you, Mr. McAllister."
2010.09-1227,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3412.337,3412.67,Thank you.
2010.09-1227,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3412.67,3414.855,"Mr. Clement, you have four minutes remaining."
2010.09-1227,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3414.855,3416.605,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1227,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3623.767,3625.1,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
