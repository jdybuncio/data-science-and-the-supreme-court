2015.14-1095,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.274,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-1095, Musacchio v. United States. Mr. Jaffe."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,9.274,35.045,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents two questions concerning the consequences of the failure to object or raise an issue at trial. On the question of whether jury instructions not objected to by the government become the baseline for measuring the sufficiency of the evidence at later stages in the case, the critical point here is that only the jury can determine that a defendant is guilty."
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,49.035,62.74,"Well, there -- there's -- there's no doubt in this case, is there, that the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had committed a crime set forth in the indictment?"
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,62.74,66.355,"Your Honor, I think that is not entirely correct."
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,71.63,72.2,They -- they had to.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,72.2,72.81,-- a different matter.
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,72.81,77.03,"They had to find that, plus something else, isn't -- wasn't that --"
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,77.03,77.6,So --
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,77.6,78.535,-- that the issue?
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,78.535,79.43,It was the issue.
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,79.43,85.64,"So if -- if they came in and said both are true, the first has to -- has to have been true."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,85.64,98.78,"In the Fifth Circuit, we pointed out that there was the potential for confusion the way ""and"" could have been misread by them as ""or,"" and they would not have necessarily had unanimity on -- on which elements of the ""and"" added up."
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,98.78,101.72,I didn't read that as being a part of your case here.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,101.72,103.865,It is only so indirectly.
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.11,126.99,"Well -- well, the -- the ""or"" would have been accurate, wouldn't it have?"
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,126.99,134.125,"Well, the ""or"" would have been accurate, but would have required a unanimity instruction to be clear which of the ""ors"" they agreed on."
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,139.42,154.75,"On the basis of the argument in this case, I didn't think there was any argument that the government tried this case solely on the theory that he encourage others to exceed their authority."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,154.75,155.26,I think --
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,155.26,157.0,That's how they argued the case.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,162.54,166.83,"Well, because the evidence is not sufficient to actually support that conclusion."
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,168.29,174.155,It's not sufficient to support the conclusion that he exceeded authority.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,174.155,174.9,Yes.
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,174.9,187.67,"But it is more than sufficient, if not the only theory they could have convicted on, was that they -- that he had encouraged others to exceed their authority."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,187.67,188.88,No.
2015.14-1095,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,200.03,201.38,Could I ask you -- I'm sorry.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,201.38,201.47,Yes.
2015.14-1095,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,201.47,202.55,You wanted to finish that.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,202.55,217.97,"I was saying the government's theory about what is and is not exceeding authority is somewhat confused in this case as it was confused in the presentation at the trial level; and therefore, it wouldn't have been clear that that evidence would have been sufficient to show conspiracy to exceed."
2015.14-1095,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,217.97,223.145,It doesn't seem clear to me that these two theories are actually separate.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,307.09,310.3,"Your Honor, that question is actually not before this Court."
2015.14-1095,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,351.395,353.74,If I could go back to your main argument.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,384.14,386.21,"I partially agree with you, Your Honor."
2015.14-1095,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,414.47,418.205,But they convicted on the first portion and that was enough.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,418.205,420.5,They convicted on a combined --
2015.14-1095,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,420.5,427.915,"They found, beyond a reasonable doubt, intentionally accessing a computer without authorization, period."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,433.46,441.31,It is not clear they understood that because the unanimity instruction did not distinguish between unauthorized access and exceeding authorized access.
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.31,449.015,That -- that -- that's what your case comes down to: Failure to instruct the jury that they had to be unanimous as to both?
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,449.015,457.55,"No, that is what our objection to the government's harmlessness argument comes down to, which is the government cannot resolve the uncertainty in the jury room."
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.55,459.92,It isn't a harmlessness argument.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,482.42,483.16,Let me give you --
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,483.16,484.865,I -- I just don't see how you get around that.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,484.865,493.165,"I'll give an example that may help clarify it: In murder charges, it is typically charged that one knowingly and intentionally killed a person."
2015.14-1095,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,511.21,522.24,But that's not this case. What you -- you -- what you have hypothesized is an erroneous instruction that -- or -- or a -- a -- a failure to find what was necessary.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,525.875,534.305,"Well, the ""what was necessary"" sort of begs the question a bit on necessary to whom. To the jury, it was necessary to find both."
2015.14-1095,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,540.36,550.83,"I can see that your argument might work in some cases if the jury was confused, if -- if this meant that it took their attention away from a critical element."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,564.655,572.005,"Well, as I said, I believe Justice Alito's comments are a fair issue to be litigated, and it could be litigated on remand if this case goes back."
2015.14-1095,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,588.6,592.215,That sounds like what you're saying -- I don't understand the point.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,612.86,613.12,Well --
2015.14-1095,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,613.12,618.44,The problem seems to have been that they were also charged that they had to find B.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,650.575,650.92,Sure.
2015.14-1095,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,670.86,673.43,"Is there anybody -- well -- well, I don't see the theory of it."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,698.415,698.85,Sure.
2015.14-1095,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,703.26,705.29,It was not a case involving a jury instruction.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,705.29,707.44,It was a case involving sufficiency of the evidence --
2015.14-1095,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,707.44,715.03,To show that the charge met -- the charge -- the evidence proved the crime on either the statute or the indictment.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,715.03,721.5,But the reasons behind Jackson explain that we are looking to whether or not the jury could have rationally reached that conclusion.
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,748.045,777.75,"My problem is that I don't know that it's rational to say that a jury in -- that sufficiency of the evidence has to do with what was charged as -- what was charged to the jury as opposed to what was laid out in the statute and/or in the indictment. If it's sufficient under both, what you're trying to say now is it may be sufficient under both. You're conceding it is."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,788.3,789.285,Absolutely.
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,790.92,794.27,Do you have any case where we've held that or anything close to it?
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,794.27,795.2,"This Court, no."
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,795.2,805.145,Have you had any case discussing sufficiency of the evidence where we look to the jury instruction as opposed to the statute and the indictment?
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,805.145,807.045,I'm not aware of one where that has come up.
2015.14-1095,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,815.67,838.59,"Suppose that there's a -- that there's a two-count indictment and there's plenty of evidence to convict on Count I and zero evidence, not one scintilla of evidence, on Count II, and the jury convicts on both counts; so the -- defendant is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on Count II. But you seem to be saying in that situation, the court would say, this is a crazy jury."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,854.04,855.13,Not entirely.
2015.14-1095,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,860.225,863.555,"Well, what's different -- what's the difference between that and the argument you just made?"
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,863.555,871.08,"This Court has treated separate counts as significant and distinct -- the Smith case, for example, that the government cites."
2015.14-1095,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,903.95,905.94,That -- that would be a revolutionary holding.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,905.94,906.34,It would.
2015.14-1095,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,907.71,914.315,"But, now, I don't see a difference, other than a purely formal difference, between that situation and what you're -- what you're arguing."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,914.315,917.81,"At some level, there is a certain formality to it, but that is Smith."
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.91,932.855,"Of course, this --"
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,932.855,933.61,Yes.
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.61,946.065,"-- this case is even -- is even worse than the hypothetical that Justice Alito posits in that -- in his hypothetical, Count II was a real count."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,957.98,962.29,It was not our burden to object. But the reason it's not worse is --
2015.14-1095,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,962.29,965.18,You didn't object because it was favorable to your client.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,970.13,972.17,We didn't object because we were confused.
2015.14-1095,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,985.69,993.56,"Didn't the -- didn't the government correct the indictment so it would be ""or"" not ""and""?"
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,993.56,1019.26,"They corrected the formal portion of the charge, but all of the allegations, the means, the mechanisms of the conspiracy, the particular facts charged as being supporting acts, all of that included, continued to include ""exceeding,"" just as the prior indictment had. And so, understandably or not, there was some confusion both on the part of counsel, I believe on the part of the court, potentially on the part of the government that continued to argue ""exceeding"" even through its closing."
2015.14-1095,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1019.26,1024.275,"Counsel, I'd like to hear your argument on the statute of limitations question at this point."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1024.275,1034.02,"Yes, Your Honor. On the statute of limitations, both parties agree that it is inevitable that a court will review a forfeited limitations bar."
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.24,1062.895,That's a -- that's a -- that's a rule that will have application in a lot of other situations.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1080.52,1082.09,"No, Your Honor, that is not what we are saying."
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.09,1083.575,"Well, why -- why wouldn't it? I mean --"
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1083.575,1084.26,Several reasons.
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.26,1085.42,Why doesn't it follow?
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1085.42,1086.09,Because that's --
2015.14-1095,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.09,1089.56,"That's your argument: Since it can be raised in habeas, why not do it now?"
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1089.56,1094.03,Because statutes of limitations can be distinguished from those other types of arguments.
2015.14-1095,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1112.28,1127.505,"So you are, Mr. Jaffe, at least saying, in every statute of limitations case, whenever a statute of limitations is involved in every case, the defendant can raise it for the first time on appeal, every statute of limitations."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1127.505,1132.315,"Yes, though the theory under which that would happen might be different."
2015.14-1095,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1142.655,1144.93,Maybe you should take the exception out.
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1144.93,1145.64,The court below --
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1145.64,1145.89,Yes.
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1145.89,1147.095,The court below --
2015.14-1095,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1147.095,1147.905,Maybe you should --
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1147.905,1148.18,Yes.
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1148.18,1149.45,-- is by waiver.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1149.89,1150.1,The --
2015.14-1095,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1150.1,1153.2,You -- you just get your exception out and then answer --
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1153.2,1163.07,"The exception would be in the -- the example of the Powell case, where the burden to prove withdrawal was actually on the defendant and not the burden of proof complies with state of limitations on the government."
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1169.53,1177.74,"I'd like to get to the substance of your argument, but as I understand your argument, this wasn't a waiver which the court found below."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1179.43,1180.07,Correct.
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1180.07,1183.22,Forfeiture because it was unintentionally done.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1183.22,1183.985,Correct.
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1183.985,1186.86,And so you are going under plain error.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1186.86,1190.33,Plain error is the -- the -- the narrowest and easiest of the theories.
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1190.33,1190.56,All right.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1190.56,1190.95,You have to call up --
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1190.95,1202.62,"So you're saying when there is plain error, when there isn't an intentional -- you don't disagree with the government that there are intentional waivers that you can't raise on appeal of the statute of limitations."
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1204.025,1207.62,"For purposes of our case, we would be perfectly content to accept that."
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1212.0,1212.3,All right.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1212.3,1213.0,-- to vote in our favor.
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1213.0,1215.09,So let's assume this is under plain error.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1234.11,1250.025,"You need -- if you're under plain error, one need not conclude it as jurisdictional. One simply needs to conclude that the government has failed to bring the suit within the time required by a statute. On its face, the date of the indictment compared to the date of the alleged crime is very simple, very plain."
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1256.67,1257.02,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1257.24,1257.775,-- it's plain.
2015.14-1095,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1257.775,1260.9,-- I -- I -- I'm having a very hard time accepting that argument.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1270.925,1277.12,I believe there are two separate lines of cases that are getting conflated. Plain error could involve any error.
2015.14-1095,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1308.13,1328.365,"Your -- your -- your argument really does -- this is true of all jurisdictional defenses, but I think it's particularly problematic here, which is it encourages gamesmanship. I mean, if you have what you think is an arguable statute-of-limitations argument, you know, take your chance at trial, and if you win, fine, but if you lose, then raise this statute-of-limitations argument."

2015.14-1095,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1366.305,1377.01,And your jurisdictional argument surprised me because you cite a line of cases that were meant to cabin the use of jurisdiction.
2015.14-1095,0,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,1377.01,1377.85,Correct.

And I think my -- my friend on the other side pointed out that -- that -- that Petitioner's counsel was confused as to what the case was about at that stage, but if you look at what Petitioner said the case was about when he was briefing this case in the Fifth Circuit, he made very, very clear that, in Petitioner's view, the government had abandoned the conspiracy to commit exceeding authorized access, and it had abandoned that with its superseding indictments, and it had abandoned that by the fact that, when we proposed three different sets of jury instructions as to the conspiracy count, the -- the instructions that we proposed were limited to a conspiracy to commit unauthorized access. Petitioner's other counsel, Mr. Kendall, during his oral argument in the Fifth Circuit, over and over again -- at the beginning of his argument, in the middle of his argument, at the end of his argument -- emphasized that the government had tried this case as a ""unauthorized access case from start to finish."""

So if there were a circumstance in which there was no authorization in the first place to -- to access the computer, I think we would be in trouble. But we would, of course, have the other -- the other way of -- of proving that the statute had been violated, which was the unauthorized access charge. And that's why in this case, I think, there was no dispute and there was no confusion whatsoever that a conspiracy to commit unauthorized access was alleged."

2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,2037.1,2063.43,"I -- I think what the -- the purpose of the indictment is to give the defendant notice of the -- the crime with which he is charged. But a lot of times, as the Court well knows, the indictment is going to be a lengthy document that contains a lot of allegations, a lot of different facts. And what this Court has made clear is that, just because the indictment says something happened at a certain time or -- or in the narrative of a description of the offense it includes some information, that doesn't mean that the government is required to prove everything that's identified there."

And so I think -- I -- I think that's -- that's fairly well-established that the government can charge in the conjunctive in that sense. But I think what's important for this case is that the -- the indictment in this case was very specific."

So just to -- to go back, Your Honors, I think that the purpose of sufficiency review, both from -- from Jackson and the due process origins of -- of sufficiency review, that they make clear the jury instructions are distinct."

First of all, with respect to the jurisdictional point, this Court has said for over 140 years that the statute of limitations is a matter of defense that the defendant has the burden of introducing into the case."

2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,2644.4,2669.98,"Well, I think that -- for -- for a couple reasons, the most important of which is that Rule 52(b) governs this case where Rule 52(b) does not directly govern the filing of a -- of a habeas petition. And so Rule 52(b) makes clear that the -- the exclusive means by which a criminal defendant can obtain appellate review of a -- of a claimed error where they didn't object below is by satisfying the four-prong Olano standard."

2015.14-1095,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2836.21,2853.98,It still in all doesn't make any sense to say we're going to let him off on habeas because of inadequate assistance of counsel who failed to raise the statute of limitations and yet he cannot raise that point on appeal --
2015.14-1095,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2853.98,2855.45,-- on direct appeal.
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,2869.52,2870.29,"Well, I think -- I think --"
2015.14-1095,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2870.29,2873.11,"Bear in mind I dissented in both Day and Wood, so --"
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,2873.11,2877.7,"As I recall, Your Honor, I think -- I think there's a -- there's a couple of reasons."
2015.14-1095,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2991.555,3008.42,Suppose the court of appeals in -- in a direct appeal sees that the statute of limitations for a particular offense is six years and the indictment was filed 25 years after the event.
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,3025.655,3031.01,I -- I think that the -- the -- the better way is to wait until habeas to -- to correct that.
2015.14-1095,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3050.995,3054.86,"Well, that might be true sometimes, but it doesn't seem as though that's the ordinary case."
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,3070.17,3075.69,I think I appreciate the -- I -- the sort of practical concern embedded in that question.
2015.14-1095,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3079.1,3081.99,"Why formal? I mean, we've been through this many times."
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,3099.295,3099.705,Right.
2015.14-1095,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3099.705,3114.13,"And therefore I think every circuit -- I don't know what this Court has said -- has said that you raise IAC claims in collateral proceedings. Now, if we start making exceptions from that, you're going to get a jurisprudence of when the exception comes up --"
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,3114.13,3114.57,I think --
2015.14-1095,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3114.57,3125.295,"-- and when it doesn't and how clear does it have to be, and then we'll just add further delay because I guess if I were a court of appeals judge and I saw some obvious mistake, I would say, go file it tomorrow."
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,3125.295,3125.82,Right.
2015.14-1095,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3167.99,3179.52,"Of course -- of course, if there was a -- a strong statute-of-limitations bar, isn't it likely that the trial judge would suggest to defense counsel, don't you want to raise a -- a limitations defense?"
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,3179.52,3183.59,"I think that's very, very likely that the trial court might do that."
2015.14-1095,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3200.66,3203.57,What type of strategic reason are you talking about?
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,3203.57,3205.955,"Well, I think there -- there could be a couple of them."
2015.14-1095,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3277.23,3281.45,Could you summarize for me your position on three arguments he made.
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,3281.45,3281.83,Sure.
2015.14-1095,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3281.83,3284.485,I -- I know the jurisdictional one.
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,3284.485,3285.125,Yes.
2015.14-1095,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3285.125,3287.33,But then there's the --
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,3287.33,3287.69,So --
2015.14-1095,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3287.69,3288.29,-- the other two.
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,3288.29,3303.64,"So -- so on -- on his claim for de novo review on appeal, we think that's inconsistent with Rule 52(b), and we think that that misreads Wood and Day, the habeas cases, because those are really about the habeas context. He makes another argument about Nguyen."
2015.14-1095,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3376.73,3379.705,So what would you argue if this was brought up on habeas?
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,3379.705,3380.37,On habeas?
2015.14-1095,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3380.37,3385.59,"Let's assume counsel comes in and says, I just didn't notice it."
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,3385.59,3386.77,"In this particular case, Your Honor?"
2015.14-1095,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3386.77,3386.88,Yes.
2015.14-1095,1,56052,roman_martinez,,3395.06,3400.98,"Well, I -- I -- I think -- I think -- in some cases, I think it would be fair for -- for the parties to litigate why the defense wasn't raised."
2015.14-1095,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3421.105,3426.09,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Jaffe."
2015.14-1095,2,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,3426.09,3436.02,"On the issue of whether or not the jury instructions are binding, several points: First of all, the confusion persists to this day."
2015.14-1095,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3550.43,3561.605,"The law of the case you -- you are -- you are asserting that, if there is a mistake but it's the law of the case, that applies on appeal."
2015.14-1095,2,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,3576.73,3578.665,Law of the case is a terrible name.
2015.14-1095,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3668.975,3670.975,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
2015.14-1095,2,62623,erik_s_jaffe,,3670.975,0.0,Thank you.
