2015.15-6418,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.12,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15-6418, Welch v. United States. Mr. Ali."
2015.15-6418,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,8.12,21.015,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Johnson is retroactive because it is a rule of substantive criminal law, not a procedural rule that regulates only the manner of determining a defendant's culpability or sentence."
2015.15-6418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,43.12,43.51,Well --
2015.15-6418,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,43.51,43.995,If --
2015.15-6418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,43.995,63.05,"What do you do with the -- the argument that the -- the concern that motivated Johnson is all procedural? Fair notice to the defendant that checks against arbitrary enforcement, those are procedural concerns?"
2015.15-6418,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,63.05,68.9,"Your Honor, we think under this Court's decision in Bousley, it's clear that you don't look to the source of the rule and that that's not governing."
2015.15-6418,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,158.975,214.75,"Well, before you get -- you continue too deeply into the substance of your argument, could I just ask a possibly irritating question about the facts of this particular case? The first question that you raise in the cert petition is whether the district court was in error when it denied relief on Petitioner's 2255 motion. And, I mean, I want to -- if you look at page 96A of the Joint Appendix, the first sentence of -- I'm sorry, the paragraph 8 on that page, can you tell me if you were a district court judge, would you have seen in that argument the argument that the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act is unconstitutionally vague?"
2015.15-6418,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,214.75,237.6,"Your Honor, we believe that with liberal pro se pleading standards, that what's said on 96 and what's said on page 83 where Petitioner invokes his Fifth Amendment right to due process, combining that with the language here, that he does not mean -- meet Armed Career Criminal requirements because it's, quote, ""ambiguous, vague, and without any violence,"" we think that would satisfy it."
2015.15-6418,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,239.2,242.94,"Well, just -- and, I mean, this wasn't exactly the question I asked."
2015.15-6418,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,275.695,277.38,"Your Honor, I think the answer is yes."
2015.15-6418,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,277.57,277.86,You would have --
2015.15-6418,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,277.86,288.52,"-- when you read it with the sentence before -- and -- and but more fundamentally, I think the answer is that it doesn't matter because there's no question that Petitioner is entitled to the benefit of Johnson in this case."
2015.15-6418,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,288.52,298.54,"How can it not matter? You're arguing that the district judge made a mistake. So your answer is you would have seen it there, and you would be a very prescient district judge."
2015.15-6418,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,299.17,320.15,"Well, Your Honor, my more complete answer is that the questions presented that were drafted in this case and granted about the Court were drafted by a pro se litigant. And I think that taking the two questions together, what those questions ask are: Did the court of appeals err in reversing -- or in denying a certificate of appealability? So the first question is referring to, did it err on the basis of the elements clause question."
2015.15-6418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,351.98,353.83,You mention the elements clause.
2015.15-6418,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,366.59,380.985,"Your Honor, with respect to the elements clause, on direct appeal, the Petitioner challenged whether he qualified under either of the two clauses, the residual clause or the elements clause. And the Eleventh Circuit on direct appeal said it's arguable that the elements clause would not have -- have applied."
2015.15-6418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,383.01,384.93,They didn't make that a holding.
2015.15-6418,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,384.93,387.76,"It did not make that a holding. That's correct, Your Honor."
2015.15-6418,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,542.215,551.23,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben."
2015.15-6418,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,551.23,563.735,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States agrees that Johnson constitutes a substantive decision that's retroactively applicable on collateral review."
2015.15-6418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,589.92,597.77,"I'm a little troubled by the use of the word ""class of people."" Amicae is right that that's almost a circular argument."
2015.15-6418,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,630.895,633.74,"Well, I -- I think that's a fine way, Justice Sotomayor, of --"
2015.15-6418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,633.74,636.645,Pretty simple rule. What's wrong with it?
2015.15-6418,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,636.645,643.03,"The only caveat that I have about it at all is, as this Court knows from Montgomery v."
2015.15-6418,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,746.815,747.44,What happens --
2015.15-6418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,747.44,747.59,If --
2015.15-6418,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,747.59,774.28,"-- in a State court -- a State criminal system if the statute says that the judge may take into account whether or not past acts and past crimes were crimes of violence, and a judge makes that finding? It's almost in -- in the same terms as the statute that was struck down in Johnson."
2015.15-6418,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,775.7,786.65,"Justice Kennedy, I think the result would be the same if it were actually an -- an analogous State law provision that was worded the same and that was invalidated on vagueness grounds in other words."
2015.15-6418,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,786.65,795.675,And that's -- that's even assuming that the sentence the judge gave after making that finding was within the maximum permitted by the statute?
2015.15-6418,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,795.675,796.515,Yes.
2015.15-6418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,819.43,823.695,"Can you explain it, how -- how this elements clause might work."
2015.15-6418,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,838.105,845.31,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, the time of the conviction, he was convicted of strong-arm robbery."
2015.15-6418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,930.9,940.22,"The Eleventh Circuit, as counsel said, decided the case on the basis of the residual clause."
2015.15-6418,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,952.965,954.155,That is correct.
2015.15-6418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,954.155,959.4,And there's something about successive -- second or successive motions.
2015.15-6418,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,961.795,964.94,"It works very differently, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.15-6418,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1280.88,1295.32,"Well, so suppose the -- the judge says in a guidelines case, because you are guilty of a crime of violence, I find you within that class of persons to whom I will give a -- an enhanced sentence? Procedural?"
2015.15-6418,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1295.32,1321.75,I think it is still procedural within the meaning of the Teague line of jurisprudence because errors that result in a judge giving too much weight to a particular factor in making a discretionary decision fall into the procedural basket. This Court has a number of death penalty cases in which either the jury was deprived of considering certain information or it improperly gave weight to certain factors.
2015.15-6418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1359.099,1366.8,Do you have any view about what we should say about whether the vagueness issue was properly raised?
2015.15-6418,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1366.8,1377.9,"I believe that the appropriate thing to do, Justice Alito, would be to leave that issue open for the Eleventh Circuit to evaluate in the first instance."
2015.15-6418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1425.71,1432.965,Can we do that? Can we just decide an abstract legal question without deciding whether the issue is before us --
2015.15-6418,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1432.965,1433.84,Yes.
2015.15-6418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1433.84,1434.64,-- properly before us?
2015.15-6418,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1434.64,1445.89,"I -- I think that the Court has jurisdiction to resolve a pure question of law and to make clear that other procedural impediments, which have not been ruled on below, remain open for the lower court."
2015.15-6418,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1455.83,1456.105,Sure.
2015.15-6418,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1456.105,1464.185,"-- and remanded to a lower court with leave for that court to apply a bar if, in fact, that was the appropriate thing to do."
2015.15-6418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1464.185,1466.705,But the government didn't raise a procedural bar.
2015.15-6418,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1466.705,1482.43,"We are most certainly, Justice Ginsburg, not raising procedural default in this case. I was meaning to refer generically to the category of procedural issues along the lines that Justice Alito mentioned that should remain open for consideration below."
2015.15-6418,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1486.365,1493.045,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Walker."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1493.045,1519.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the 25 years since Teague was decided, this Court has never held that a new rule based on the central procedural guarantees of the due process clause, in either the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment, nonetheless constituted a substantive rule that could apply to overturn final criminal judgments. You should not do so for the first time here."
2015.15-6418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1519.64,1545.945,"How can it not be substantive when, under one rule, the sentence range goes minimum of 15 years up to life, and the other reading, it's zero to ten years? I can't imagine anything more substantive than five extra -- a minimum of five extra years in prison."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1545.945,1581.24,"Because the government's articulation of the test, which is an effects-based test that they draw from a statutory construction case, Bousley, is not the proper inquiry for asking whether a new constitutional rule is substantive or procedural. Since Penry, which, after all, was the case that first extended Teague's first exception into the sentencing context in the first place, there, the Court looked for the existence of a, quote, ""substantive categorical constitutional guarantee."" And ever since, that's what this Court has looked for."
2015.15-6418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1598.045,1607.05,"And what is the substantive constitutional guarantees? Much of the Sixth Amendment is -- is all procedure, right?"
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1607.05,1607.99,That's true.
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1687.24,1697.17,"What -- what procedures would allow somebody to be convicted under the residual clause? If it's a procedural protection, there must be some procedures that would allow people to be convicted."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1697.67,1698.35,Absolutely.
2015.15-6418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1744.82,1745.22,Why don't we --
2015.15-6418,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1745.22,1750.655,Suppose you have a statute which makes it a crime to engage in conduct annoying to others?
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1750.655,1751.81,That was Coates.
2015.15-6418,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1751.81,1756.215,And the Court said this is void because it is vague.
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1758.195,1791.285,"That's the Coates decision, which said -- struck down a State law, I think it was -- that said that you can't stand on the street and annoy other people, and you definitely can't annoy a police officer. The Court said that is void-for-vagueness, because nobody can tell what the particular standard is. What the Court actually went out of its way to say, certainly States can regulate behavior on the street. We're not saying that States lack the power to do this. We're just saying you have to do this in a sufficiently clear way. So Coates fully supports our reading of the void-for-vagueness doctrine."
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1791.285,1795.695,So the procedural protection is that Congress can change the law?
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1795.695,1801.94,The procedural protection is the right to fair notice and an avoidance of the risk of arbitrary enforcement.
2015.15-6418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1832.81,1842.455,"Why did we make Bailey retroactive? Congress could have made mere possession. I think it subsequently did, in some form."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1860.42,1865.98,"They're different in two ways. Yes, you did, Justice Sotomayor. First, Bailey was a statutory construction case."
2015.15-6418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1875.34,1877.325,But we have excluded particular conduct.
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1883.39,1886.81,"With all respect, that is not how we read Johnson."
2015.15-6418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1902.63,1906.46,"Whether it's Bailey or here, Congress has to redefine the crime."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1906.46,1907.83,That is --
2015.15-6418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1907.83,1911.13,It has to step in and pass a new statute.
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1920.135,1924.32,Because we have to ask why the law has to be changed.
2015.15-6418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1950.16,1957.845,"You said when you started that Congress could change the statute to make nonuse criminal, just possession."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1957.845,1959.1,"Yes, and that showed --"
2015.15-6418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1959.1,1964.42,And so Congress could change the statute and make this conduct criminal.
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1966.555,1966.94,So what --
2015.15-6418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1966.94,1970.635,I don't see -- you still need a congressional act --
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1970.635,1971.27,Right.
2015.15-6418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1971.27,1972.175,-- to --
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,1972.175,1984.85,"And the fact that you needed a congressional act both in Bailey and here just shows our ultimate point, which is that Johnson didn't deprive Congress of the power to legislate in this area."
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2009.595,2011.14,So it's a --
2015.15-6418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2011.14,2012.795,How do you --
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2012.795,2013.205,Please.
2015.15-6418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2013.205,2027.32,"How do you deal with the argument that counsel made saying it would be passing strange if, when a law is narrowed, then it's substantive."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2042.125,2052.43,"Well, I would submit it doesn't ultimately work at the end of the day for two reasons, Justice Ginsburg. First, the case of Bousley is a statutory construction case."
2015.15-6418,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2136.24,2152.54,"If we could go back to Justice Kennedy's question and the Chief Justice's, I may not have the distinction correct, but I thought the distinction, at least as we've interpreted it in Teague, we provided -- produced a different answer."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2188.175,2189.92,I don't think they do --
2015.15-6418,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2189.92,2230.45,"Well, that amazes me. Because I thought the point of Teague was that if the statute under which they are convicted doesn't exist anymore because -- for whatever reason -- because, for example -- and did not exist at the time, because it was an unconstitutional statute -- they are serving time under a statute which was then and is now nonexistent and, therefore, they get out. But if the change that was made in the law is a change having to do with the accuracy of the procedure that was used to convict them of that statute, that statute still exists."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2260.0,2274.205,"Justice Breyer, what Justice Harlan said, and what the Court adopted in Teague, is that habeas should issue when private, primary conduct has been put -- and this Court reiterated in Montgomery --"
2015.15-6418,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.205,2274.54,Yeah.
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2274.54,2276.55,-- altogether beyond the power --
2015.15-6418,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2276.55,2289.665,That's what he says there. But later we say substantive rules include decisions of this Court holding that a substantive Federal criminal statute does not reach certain conduct.
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2289.665,2290.56,And that's --
2015.15-6418,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.56,2290.66,See?
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2290.66,2291.23,-- the statute --
2015.15-6418,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2291.23,2294.68,"Therefore, there is a statute, perhaps."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2307.16,2314.97,"And that's the statutory construction decision, which is all my friends have to rely on here, when of course what we're analyzing is a constitutional rule."
2015.15-6418,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2333.48,2356.245,"Well, why would Justice Harlan have wanted that distinction in the world of constitutional rules, because it seems to me Justice Harlan, as Justice Breyer suggested, would have looked at this and said, well, yes, but these -- this person or these 32 people could not -- it is improper for this person to be sitting in jail under any statute that Congress lawfully passed."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2378.915,2386.605,What Justice Harlan was concerned about in Mackey was situations where the conduct at issue is immune from punishment.
2015.15-6418,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2408.88,2409.78,I understand your test.
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2427.865,2436.98,"Well, one is in jail lawfully if, at the time the sentence became final, he was there under the law as it stood at the time."
2015.15-6418,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2490.22,2497.96,"Yeah, but that's still -- you have a point that, because it's not quite like the pest statute."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2584.21,2584.75,"Well, it actually --"
2015.15-6418,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2584.75,2586.51,I don't know if you want to address that or not.
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2587.245,2587.83,I would love to.
2015.15-6418,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2587.83,2588.825,All right. (Laughter.)
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2588.825,2594.795,Johnson has to be substantive if it's going to apply on collateral review.
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2656.25,2694.92,"How -- my understanding is that it's properly categorized as procedural if there's some people who could be convicted under it legitimately; in other words, Miranda -- you didn't get Miranda warnings, but you know, you were a criminal law professor, you knew what your rights were. But who is it who could be convicted legitimately under the residual clause? We're sure, yes, okay, it's -- it's vague, whatever, but you are definitely covered, so you shouldn't get the protection of what you would regard as a procedural flaw."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2694.92,2725.06,"We certainly agree that Johnson invalidated the residual clause, and therefore, to answer your question, Mr. Chief Justice, nobody can be sentenced under the residual clause going forward, and the residual -- anybody that was sentenced under the residual clause would get the benefit of that new rule on direct appeal. But the question that Teague asks is whether that remedy should be available on collateral review. And the answer to that depends upon -- and this was reaffirmed just two months ago in Montgomery -- the existence of a substantive procedural guarantee."
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2735.89,2753.73,"But I -- but my understanding is that the characterization of that as procedural, it turns on whether or not there is a significant group of people who could be convicted under that provision where vagueness would be off the table. Now, however, it may appear to other people engaging in this type of conduct."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2761.86,2766.26,But we can't know that about everybody that was sentenced under residual clause.
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2773.09,2773.28,Right.
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2776.17,2776.93,Absolutely.
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2776.93,2779.1,So who shouldn't the residual clause apply to?
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2779.1,2783.145,"Well, for instance, let's take the Petitioner in this case, Mr. Welch."
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2798.12,2800.43,"What -- what I'm talking about, the residual clause."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2800.43,2800.64,Yes.
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2800.64,2810.695,"I guess what I'm trying to ask you is who are the people who you can say, without a doubt, their conduct otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury?"
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2810.695,2821.56,"The people who committed the crimes that were at issue in this Court's decisions in James and Sykes, the people who had engaged in vehicular flight, and the second crime is now escaping."
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2821.56,2831.31,"The problem in Johnson, I think we took a look back and said, yeah, well, we did say that, but I have to think Johnson suggests that those decisions were not clear."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2831.31,2846.1,"Certainly Johnson overruled those decisions with respect to the vagueness holding, but this Court itself said that people who engaged in those two particular crimes were entirely correctly sentenced under the residual clause."
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2873.01,2911.005,"So you would go back and say that we think that vehicular homicide is conduct that -- today, with the benefit of the analysis in Johnson -- I mean, assuming we were wrong in those cases, which I think Johnson suggests or said, that nonetheless it's clear that those people, the vehicular homicide people, we shouldn't be concerned about applying this -- not applying this retroactively because they, and other -- and other category clearly are covered by it. In other words, put aside our cases where I think -- I understand your argument, well, we decided that, but I -- I think Johnson suggests we decided it wrongly."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2911.005,2911.26,Right.
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2912.96,2913.12,Yes.
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2913.12,2914.5,"I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. There's other --"
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2914.5,2915.17,What's another example?
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2915.17,2925.52,"Other kinds of crimes that have been found by the lower courts to count are attempted rape, child molestation, assault with intent to kill."
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2996.429,2997.745,"Thank you, Counsel."
2015.15-6418,2,62685,helgi_c_walker,,2997.745,2998.75,Thank you.
2015.15-6418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2998.75,3002.065,"Mr. Ali, you have six minutes remaining."
2015.15-6418,3,62684,amir_h_ali,,3002.065,3015.49,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I just have a couple of quick points to make. The first, when questioned by you, Mr. Chief Justice, the Court's amicae suggested that the clear examples under Johnson would be James and Sykes."
2015.15-6418,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3027.975,3028.33,Yeah.
2015.15-6418,3,62684,amir_h_ali,,3036.81,3048.95,"Well, Your Honor, what this Court said was that it was skeptical that those clear examples cited by the government in -- in Johnson and cited by the dissent in Johnson were so easy once you looked at those more closely."
2015.15-6418,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3063.96,3064.13,Yeah.
2015.15-6418,3,62684,amir_h_ali,,3070.01,3073.75,"Well, the court accepted that there may be some clear cases."
2015.15-6418,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3092.3,3101.7,What would be your rule on -- on this issue I posited to Mr. -- to the Assistant Solicitor General.
2015.15-6418,3,62684,amir_h_ali,,3105.92,3108.56,"Your Honor, with respect to the advisory guidelines, we --"
2015.15-6418,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3108.56,3112.6,"And I know that's not the issue we've posed, but I -- I just want to have a general idea."
2015.15-6418,3,62684,amir_h_ali,,3112.6,3113.08,That's fine.
2015.15-6418,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3151.99,3154.345,"That not -- that's not it, the residual clause."
2015.15-6418,3,62684,amir_h_ali,,3158.5,3158.81,Sure.
2015.15-6418,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3158.81,3165.1,-- is what we're saying is a person whose sentence -- it's not conviction of the crime.
2015.15-6418,3,62684,amir_h_ali,,3213.54,3214.46,"Your Honor, I agree with that, and I --"
2015.15-6418,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3214.46,3222.03,And what I can't foresee in this -- and maybe you have -- is what effect it would have on sentencing across the board.
2015.15-6418,3,62684,amir_h_ali,,3232.505,3234.485,"Your Honor, I -- I will be reassuring on that."
2015.15-6418,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3234.485,3236.21,I'm sure you would.
2015.15-6418,3,62684,amir_h_ali,,3236.21,3260.96,"What we're saying is this court, to be clear, has not distinguished in the context of retroactivity or habeas between conviction or sentence. And that distinction wouldn't make sense, because we're talking about whether someone's confinement is unlawful. Now, what we're saying and what the -- I think the government -- the reason it wouldn't have such a great effect, is what we're saying is that when it is just one of those substantive criterion in a particular provision which is setting forth the sentence, which is struck down."
2015.15-6418,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3366.745,3376.6,"Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Walker, this Court appointed you to brief and argue this case in an amicus curiae in support of the judgment below."
