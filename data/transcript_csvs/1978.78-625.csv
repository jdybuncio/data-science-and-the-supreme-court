1978.78-625,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.74,"We'll hear arguments next in 625, Andrus against the Sierra Club."
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,61.326,65.823,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-625,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,241.169,259.365,"I suppose Mr. Harmon that some of the actions of the 400 plus district judges in the United States and soon well over a hundred circuit judges to say nothing of other judges, might have an impact on the human environment."
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,265.871,284.134,"Mr. Chief Justice in the sense -- in the theory of this case that in fact the actions, a decision would necessitate action below that may be major federal action significantly affecting the environment on that theory."
1978.78-625,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,303.564,319.631,"But the thrust of my question was partly about impact as a -- it's really pretty difficult to major isn't it, to define and to bound?"
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,319.631,348.071,"Well, that is certainly our contention in the sense that the argument made by respondents throughout this case indeed adopted by the District Court was that the budget estimates submitted by an agency in fact were proposals for all the actions which would be financed by the appropriation."
1978.78-625,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,402.23,416.719,"Do you understand this holding to be for the presumed benefit of the agencies who are submitting their requests to OMB, or for OMB in submitting its recommendations to the President?"
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,416.719,428.412,"It is our understanding of the holding, Your Honors that in fact it is for the benefit, the identification for the agencies which would be submitting their requests to OMB."
1978.78-625,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,443.715,452.066,You get any sense that there is balance of taken a “new look” at their position from their brief in this Court?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,452.066,459.254,"Your Honor, that is our contention, the contention we have made in our reply brief which we have filed for this Court."
1978.78-625,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,544.236,547.581,And what is your position as to that?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,547.581,556.024,"It is our position that one, these are not proposals that the budget estimate submitted by --"
1978.78-625,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,556.024,560.629,Suppose we hold they are then what?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,560.629,573.957,"Even if, even if the budget estimate is found by this Court to be a proposal within the meaning of the Act, it's our position that they are not a proposal for legislation."
1978.78-625,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,590.262,597.534,I think I followed you with respect to a positive proposal to build a dam.
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,630.64,632.239,Your Honor --
1978.78-625,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,632.239,635.747,I'm drawing the distinction between a positive action and a negative one.
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,635.747,637.661,And I appreciate your point.
1978.78-625,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,984.587,1001.107,Would you analogize it Mr. Harmon to the process which a division of a department submits to the head of the department before the department itself submits the total budget request to the OMB.
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1001.107,1018.004,"Mr. Chief Justice it would be exactly our point that if the respondents contention were correct that the fact that the agency has had its final word, its last say that no further action is required by the agency."
1978.78-625,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1042.09,1044.347,Of course at least a proposal.
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1044.347,1045.521,That is correct.
1978.78-625,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1045.521,1049.505,You keep putting the word final in their final proposal.
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1051.954,1061.638,"The statute does not use that, Your Honor, but this Court used that phraseology in Kleppe, in its decision in Kleppe versus Sierra Club."
1978.78-625,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1112.561,1122.517,"Of course I must confess, for me the word proposal reeks of something that is not final."
1978.78-625,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1122.517,1125.971,"Well, is it final when it goes up to the Congress from the President in that sense?"
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1125.971,1126.747,Certainly not.
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1147.015,1151.626,When does it the proposal become final?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1151.626,1152.141,The proposal becomes final --
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1152.141,1155.053,I assume you're going to say to what Congress acts?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1157.85,1159.556,"That is correct Your Honor, and that is not our position."
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1160.334,1166.689,"Well, isn't your position that you don't need any statements until after it gets to Congress?"
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1166.689,1167.823,"No, it is our position that --"
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1167.823,1168.674,Well when?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1171.487,1174.117,It's our position that we would not be obliged to file a statement.
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1174.117,1174.99,Ever?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1174.99,1175.626,For the budget.
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1175.626,1179.192,You mean by -- nobody will ever have to file the statement?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1179.192,1180.219,For the budget.
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1180.219,1181.078,Right.
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1182.325,1183.098,That's our position.
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1211.484,1214.257,Well why didn't you use the word proposal at all?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1221.772,1222.092,The proposal --
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1222.092,1223.927,Isn't that your position?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1223.927,1225.331,"No, Your Honor, it is not."
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1237.515,1255.279,"Yes, the Department of Interior wants to propose that you build a dam and somebody from Congress suggests that."
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1267.622,1268.264,When the --
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1268.264,1271.472,On this one item.
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1271.472,1283.708,"When the Secretary of Interior proposes and let's suppose it is a proposal to build a dam, a piece of substantive legislation seeking the authorization to build the dam."
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1291.646,1295.798,"The question is, when does it need the impact statement?"
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1295.798,1302.317,"When the Secretary of Interior has formulated, has before him a proposal."
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1310.163,1317.792,What would be required in order to require the impact statement in the Interior Department?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1317.792,1320.443,That will be a proposal for legislation.
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1320.443,1324.789,"Well, what would make it a proposal, the word proposal?"
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1324.789,1332.07,"The fact that the Secretary of Interior had a final plan before him, a final proposal."
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1332.07,1332.604,No.
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1332.604,1332.927,Perhaps alternatives.
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1332.927,1336.794,Are all final plans proposals?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1336.794,1339.306,"If they are proposals for legislation, yes Your Honor."
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1339.306,1346.295,All final plans for a legislation are a proposals under this Act?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1346.295,1350.2,"If in fact they will be proposed by -- yes, yes I think that would be my position."
1978.78-625,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1350.2,1351.042,Congress could (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1351.042,1352.364,I really don't approve.
1978.78-625,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1352.364,1356.331,-- entirely independent of this particular legislation.
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1369.03,1370.291,"Absolutely correct, Your Honor, and certainly --"
1978.78-625,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1370.291,1375.73,They can do that at every stage while they're considering the legislation couldn't they?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1375.73,1392.784,That is our position and that goes to the question of the appropriateness of traditional intervention in a process where Congress has before it the means as it always has to require the information that it needs to make its decisions.
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1446.444,1453.844,Suppose Congress doesn't do it in a particular act?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1461.647,1461.814,It's our position --
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1461.814,1466.82,I don't know -- I didn't know if (Inaudible) this act was whether Congress asked for something?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1466.82,1467.868,No.
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1471.647,1471.873,At all?
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1471.873,1473.238,That Congress did not intend it to apply --
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1473.238,1475.781,"Well, Congress could said that, couldn't it very easily?"
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1475.781,1477.195,That is our position exactly.
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1477.195,1478.487,But Congress didn't say that.
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1478.487,1489.703,"Congress did not say that and there is nothing, nothing in the legislative history to suggest that Congress considered this Act is applying to the budget process."
1978.78-625,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1540.112,1549.991,"In order to maintain you position, you don't have to move so far as to say all budgetary items are immunized, do you?"
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1549.991,1560.825,Our position is that all budget -- all budgetary items that the budget process is not covered and is not subject to the environment impact statement requirements.
1978.78-625,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1631.395,1637.379,"In the scenario of zero budgeting, I guess it would that approach?"
1978.78-625,0,30841,john_m_harmon,,1637.379,1662.02,"Your Honor, it's our submission that that logic -- that the logic of that position is necessarily that with the -- with all of the actions that are funded by each budget appropriation that in fact it would apply practically to all agencies and all budget proposals."
1978.78-625,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1667.879,1688.411,Mr. Cohen.
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,1688.411,1693.033,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-625,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.433,1824.342,"Let me ask you a question, Mr. Cohen, if I may about the regulations by the CEQ?"
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,1835.347,1837.657,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.78-625,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1855.456,1860.613,But those -- though that authority extends from an executive order and not from an Act of Congress.
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,1860.613,1881.7,"That is correct, Your Honor, in except in so far as CEQ itself was directed under the terms of NEPA to assist in agency decision making in terms of the interpretations for implementing NEPA, and I'm speaking now of Section 102 (2) (b) of the Act."
1978.78-625,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.7,1893.419,Do you think that's the same thing as the authority Congress has conferred on some agencies to issue rules and regulations interpreting meaning of this legislative section itself?
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,1893.419,1908.203,We certainly feel Your Honor that the ability by CEQ to prepare these guidelines and regulations has at least the same authority as those which would emanate from the Congress.
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.625,1928.32,"Which would -- which -- oh, excuse me Mr. Rehnquist go ahead."
1978.78-625,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1928.32,1938.529,You're relying on an executive order then yet the executive branch is here arguing against you.
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,1938.529,1947.666,"That is correct Your Honor in so far as the authority for CEQ to actually interpret the Act, that is correct."
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.428,1959.275,Was CEQ still of the view that you suggest?
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,1959.275,1961.573,CEQ is not still of the view Mr. Justice White.
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1961.573,1966.608,So which view do we give deference to?
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,1966.608,1977.914,Well it is our contention as we have indicated Your Honor that the deference ought to be accorded to eight years of consistent and contemporaneous interpretation.
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1977.914,1983.44,"So if this suit had come up ten years from now, you'd give deference to the most recent one?"
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,1983.44,2000.91,"We are concerned, as we've indicated, Your Honor, that the interpretations are without any reasonable basis in so far as under the new interpretations they provide and express exclusion for budget request from the definition of legislation."
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2039.6,2057.23,So don't you think the -- is it correct or not that CEQ now is before this Court in the -- through the United States indicating that these requests should not be within the reach of NEPA?
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2057.23,2063.904,"I believe CEQ has indicated in its regulations themselves, Your Honor that it felt that the budget process --"
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.904,2067.554,So if you -- is essentially being represented here by the United States?
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2067.554,2072.542,I believe that is correct Your Honor.
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.007,2162.191,And what about OMB's proposals to the President or recommendations?
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2162.191,2170.562,"Well under the terms of the budget in Accounting Act, Your Honor, we'll recall that the President transmit --"
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.562,2171.564,Thank you very much.
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2171.564,2172.744,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2172.744,2176.213,"No, I'm sure that I don't recall the --"
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2176.213,2190.565,"The President transmits the budget to the Congress, whereas the -- under Section 206 -- 201 rather of the Act, the agency head is required to prepare the budget."
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.8,2204.532,I understand that but what's the next step after that?
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2204.532,2210.908,"After it goes through OMB, Your Honor, it then is transmitted to the President for his formal --"
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2210.908,2218.842,"And what about that stage, because there're a lot of changes go on and --"
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2218.842,2219.247,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.247,2220.131,-- in OMB.
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2224.232,2225.676,We certainly do not Your Honor.
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.687,2241.246,Well what if OMB just cancels out a proposal or decides to shut down the existing program?
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2241.246,2251.58,"Indeed that represents the particular instance where an environmental impact statement would be most needed and most valuable, because it would serve."
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.58,2259.597,But I thought you said you didn't need a statement supporting an OMB recommendation of the President?
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2259.597,2263.985,"That is correct, Your Honor, the EIS would be prepared by the agency for --"
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2263.985,2276.233,"Well I know but the agency has prepared one, let's just say -- assume the agency has prepared one and it wants to have a new program or it wants to continue an existing program."
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2287.287,2304.261,We would submit that it is not Your Honor that the EIS has served its purpose of assisting in identifying in considering environmental consequences by the time the forwarding agency which is prepared the budget forwards its submission to OMB.
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2304.261,2317.824,"But you don't -- you don't argue that if that an agency that just wants the same money that it did last year for the same program needs to prepare an environmental impact statement, do you?"
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2317.824,2320.858,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.858,2336.344,"Say a -- the Department of Interior has program “X” that's been going on for 20 years and every year it has taken “Y” dollars, and again it submits its budget proposal to OMB, program “X” for “Y” dollars."
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2338.984,2351.812,We are supporting the proposition articulated by the Court of Appeals that only in those instances where the agency has actually undergone a careful review of its program and has determined --
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.812,2354.681,"Alright, so is your answer is no to my question?"
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2354.681,2355.501,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.501,2363.05,"And then it goes to OMB and OMB says, “We look at this ‘X' program for ‘Y' dollars, it's gone long enough."
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2378.228,2386.873,"It may be, Your Honor, and we would submit that so long as the environmental considerations have been identified and analyzed and the President --"
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2386.873,2387.513,"They'd never been, they'd never been."
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2395.94,2411.65,If the program commitment of resources to the program represents a programmatic course of action following a review then we would submit that the agency forwarding its budget request would have to prepare an EIS.
1978.78-625,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.65,2415.645,I understand that but in my example it did not have to submit one.
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2435.013,2435.616,That --
1978.78-625,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2435.616,2448.063,Suppose the program that we're talking about that Mr. Justice White has postulated is a program of $200 million for clean air and the OMB just cuts it out.
1978.78-625,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2448.517,2450.475,Let me interrupt you also.
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2455.622,2476.971,"Your Honor, the question which Mr. Justice Blackmun addressed to opposing counsel as I understood it was a -- involved a situation where the forwarding the agency had determined that it wished to dramatically reduce or to eliminate a program from its program commitments."
1978.78-625,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2484.568,2486.641,Does it make a difference?
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2486.641,2489.339,"Well, we would submit it is, Your Honor."
1978.78-625,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2547.306,2562.88,What you're saying then is that you really said it two ways that it's a proposal then it goes from OMB to the President that it's also a proposal then it goes from the agency to the OMB in the first instance.
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2562.88,2568.654,"We would suggest, Your Honor, that it is a proposal by the time it leaves the agency and goes to OMB."
1978.78-625,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2568.654,2585.385,"Mr. Cohen, supposing that the National Wildlife and Refuge Service proposes a 100% increase in its budget to OMB so they can acquire a good deal of new land for wildlife refuges."
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2608.055,2611.815,"No, we would submit that only one EIS needs to be prepared --"
1978.78-625,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2611.815,2612.455,Where?
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2612.455,2615.207,-- from the agency.
1978.78-625,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2615.207,2629.802,"But when the President, he might not -- he might be too busy to know what the agency proposed then he's going to be perhaps victimized and the environment victimized by the OMB?"
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2629.802,2643.122,"Well we would submit, Your Honor, that the preparation of an EIS, even if it were not publicly disclosed and not made available for comment to the public until the budget request were submitted to the Congress."
1978.78-625,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2653.214,2664.744,-- you don't really think that the President going through budgets which are like several New York telephone books is going to be when you look at the impact statements on very many of those programs?
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2664.744,2693.785,"We would assume, Your Honor, that in the very limited number of instances where an EIS would need to be prepared under the articulation of the Court of Appeals opinion that in those few instances, the President and his staff would be available to review significant environmental consequences of a considered programmatic review which issues -- ushers in a programmatic course of action."
1978.78-625,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2693.785,2701.906,"Well Mr. Cohen, is there anything to stop the President for asking for it, assuming there's nothing there?"
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2703.975,2705.224,I believe that --
1978.78-625,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2705.224,2706.411,You believe?
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2706.411,2709.396,We believe that the President certainly could ask for an EIS.
1978.78-625,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2709.396,2713.178,You believe he -- you have some doubt that he could ask for it?
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2713.178,2714.493,"We have no doubt, Your Honor."
1978.78-625,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2714.493,2715.562,Alright.
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2718.872,2721.043,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-625,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2722.3,2725.596,"Well, didn't that solve your problem?"
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2725.596,2728.326,"It doesn't solve the problem, Your Honor because --"
1978.78-625,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2728.326,2731.77,If the President wants it he can get it.
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2731.77,2732.723,That is correct.
1978.78-625,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2732.723,2735.009,Your point is that one is required.
1978.78-625,1,29508,james_hillson_cohen,,2735.009,2753.631,"Our point is that one is required under the terms of NEPA itself and more importantly that the primary purpose of an environmental impact statement is to serve the agency which is making a proposal for legislation, or making a proposal for major federal action."
1978.78-625,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3025.468,3025.803,Thank you.
1978.78-625,2,30841,john_m_harmon,,3032.58,3067.648,"Mr. Chief Justice, in response to counsel's point attempt to describe the consistent interpretation of the NEPA requirement, I would simply like to point out that the Congress which passed NEPA has for 10 years received and acted upon budget proposals from the President without the preparation of environmental impact statements by the agencies making their individual proposals."
1978.78-625,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3085.299,3086.287,Thank you very much gentlemen.
