1963.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.117,"Number 209, Joseph Lyle Stoner, Petitioner, versus California."
1963.209,0,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,11.168,14.695,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1963.209,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,153.205,155.823,Where this had this check book and this deposit --
1963.209,0,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,155.823,161.866,"They had been found Mr. Justice Stewart in the parking lot, adjacent to the grocery store."
1963.209,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,602.193,604.25,Were they introduce into evidence?
1963.209,0,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,604.25,605.509,Yes they were Mr. Justice Stewart.
1963.209,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,605.509,609.148,Where in the record?
1963.209,0,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,609.148,610.761,Let's see.
1963.209,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,610.761,612.266,You read as where they were identified.
1963.209,0,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,612.266,612.9,Yes.
1963.209,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,612.9,614.329,But that --
1963.209,0,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,614.329,615.905,My opponent is helping me.
1963.209,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,747.699,749.319,Well that's no longer an issue.
1963.209,0,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,749.319,769.534,"Well I, if I am, if I am free to rely entirely upon the concession of the state it certainly isn't and of course it's open to the court to decide, but the state now does concede and they didn't argue in the court below that the search was incident to arrest, it was 37 hours after the arrest and in a different state."
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1825.99,1834.869,"Your Honors, facts -- pardon me, the facts of this case are quite simple."
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2206.979,2210.06,But what is your basis if you say --
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2210.06,2212.137,We say it stems from --
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2212.137,2213.554,Stems from what?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2213.554,2220.852,It stems from the fact that under California law the innkeeper has control of all of the premises.
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2226.545,2228.073,(Inaudible)
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2228.073,2231.027,That's general California Law.
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2233.313,2234.253,Common law you mean of California?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2234.253,2237.938,Yes the general common law applicable to innkeeper's rights.
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2237.938,2241.287,They have a right go in at any time?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2241.287,2244.648,"Yes sir, but I think we need not argue that here."
1963.209,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2251.325,2252.516,Who searched the rooms?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2252.516,2254.761,The officers searched the room.
1963.209,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2254.761,2256.175,The innkeeper didn't search it?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2256.175,2258.086,He was there.
1963.209,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2258.086,2260.315,He said be my guest.
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2260.315,2269.868,"He said I give you my permission to search, his exact language Mr. Justice Clark, in that case I give you my permission."
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2269.868,2273.117,"And you say California law permits him to do that of course, you have to --"
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2273.117,2275.771,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2310.286,2312.954,(Inaudible)
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2312.954,2316.01,We had reasonable cause for believing that he possessed it.
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2316.01,2317.953,What was the reasonable cause?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2317.953,2328.903,"The fact that there was reasonable cause to believe that Stoner committed the robbery with a 45, that he had it in his possession."
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2344.95,2346.246,Or carried on his person?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2346.246,2348.626,Or carried on his person.
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2348.626,2350.706,Are you trying (Inaudible)
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2350.706,2352.075,To defend --
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2352.075,2366.399,"(Inaudible) that California has a right by its law to determine who can search a room, hotel room and seize the stuff in it."
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2366.399,2369.357,"I don't think we have to defend on that, I think we can defend on --"
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2369.357,2371.756,But you argue -- that's your first point.
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2371.756,2385.678,"Our first point is that the property -- the property law in California is such that this is a permissible agreement that this is part of the innkeeper's rights, yes."
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2385.678,2394.343,"You are saying innkeepers' right and you said at another point agreement, those are two different things as I understand it and I'm --"
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2394.343,2394.995,That's correct.
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2394.995,2426.353,"Though it seems to me that the question you pose is rather serious or rather serious constitutional question if you are right, that the law of California permits searches to be made, which under the law of federal government would be unreasonable searches and seizures except for the fact that California law says they are not unreasonable searches and seizures and wouldn't that go directly contrary to what we held in Mapp?"
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2426.353,2428.692,I don't believe they fall in the facts of this case.
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2428.692,2432.733,"I'm not talking about the fact, I'm talking about that principle by which you are arguing."
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2439.917,2440.679,That is correct.
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2440.679,2451.929,"But you are saying that California can have a property law that exempts people in California, or denies them the benefit of that constitutional protection."
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2451.929,2460.184,"But we do not say that California could pass a law stating that any police officer could search a hotel room, that plainly wouldn't --"
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2460.184,2468.078,I understand it but you are saying that a innkeeper under your law has the right to do it and therefore he can let policemen do it for him?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2468.078,2468.401,That's right.
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2469.843,2490.214,"It would amount in the end to a search which might, we assume that, for purposes of this argument, which let's assume that it was a direct unequivocal violation of the Fourth Amendment protection, but for the California law saying that the man had a right to do it."
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2490.214,2490.815,That's correct.
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2492.024,2493.265,"Between the two, wouldn't it?"
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2493.265,2493.977,It's correct.
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2496.608,2497.228,But that --
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2497.228,2497.472,Within the meaning of –
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2497.472,2502.082,But that's the different -- now that's the question of whether it is unreasonable within under the Fourth Amendment.
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2502.082,2504.841,"Under the Fourth, and under the Fourteenth."
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2504.841,2520.673,"I get that but -- and maybe you are not arguing the other, but it sounds to me like you are arguing the Fourth Amendment can't control there if California cannot because it has property laws which permits searches and seizures of a man's room without a warrant."
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2520.673,2527.792,"No, I do not contend that you cannot through the Fourteenth Amendment control it, no."
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2527.792,2536.609,"Mr. Smith, I go to California every opportunity I have and much of the time I stay in hotels."
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2562.012,2568.115,I think that we need not go that far on the facts of this case.
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2568.115,2570.135,"No, I just ask you that question."
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2570.135,2574.487,I think that I would be compelled to answer that question in the affirmative.
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2574.487,2575.424,In the affirmative.
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2575.424,2575.705,Now –
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2575.705,2582.896,Would you tell me if that has ever been decided directly by the State of California?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2582.896,2584.044,It has not.
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2584.044,2588.479,What is the nearest case you have to it?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2588.479,2596.24,"The case of People versus Ambrose, the case of Fox versus Windemere, which we have cited?"
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2596.24,2598.25,What does Ambrose hold?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2598.25,2601.313,Ambrose really goes off on an apparent authority doctrine.
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2617.512,2619.283,What kind of a case was that?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2619.283,2623.152,Criminal case.
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2623.152,2625.02,What other case besides Ambrose?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2625.02,2629.044,The other cases we cite are not directly at point.
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2644.5,2650.408,And you're of the opinion that Burke does not cut against -- cut across your argument?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2650.408,2660.073,"No sir, we feel one that it is dictum; two that it plainly states that there are no facts to warrant a contrary finding."
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2787.929,2793.946,"That wouldn't be technical, would it, if it violated the Fourth Amendment?"
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2793.946,2802.324,"The technical area in the introduction of the evidence, which is another point."
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2838.189,2839.764,A good faith violation?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2839.764,2840.487,What?
1963.209,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2840.487,2842.648,You mean a good faith violation of the Fourth Amendment.
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2842.648,2852.76,"A good faith violation yes Your Honor, which brings me to what I deem to be a very crucial point."
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2955.629,2964.323,"Well on that score, you don't contend this is in furtherance of lawful arrest, do you?"
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2964.323,2965.471,No sir.
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2965.471,2966.271,Alright.
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2974.765,2979.451,I think they could have.
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2979.451,2989.523,Well then do you mean that it is reasonable for them to get a search warrant they can disregard it and say we'll just search anyway?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2989.523,2991.008,No sir.
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2991.922,2995.382,Why didn't they get a search warrant in this case?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2995.382,3016.567,"The record is not clear, but the -- it is plain from the sequence of events that they were occurring very rapidly, that they discovered the notebook, they discovered -- connected this man up as a ex-felon, they got a mug shot, they went to the clerks, they were identified, they then went to the hotel room, but I say that --"
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3016.567,3021.307,But they stayed in the room for a full day didn't they?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3021.307,3021.917,Oh no.
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3021.917,3023.963,In and around the room.
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3023.963,3026.981,"Oh, they did stay around late, that is correct."
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3026.981,3030.74,"Or in the room as I understood it, isn't that --"
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3030.74,3032.3,That's right they awaited his return.
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3032.3,3045.938,"Around or in the room they stayed for a full day, and why in that length of time shouldn't they have gotten a search warrant, before they searched the room?"
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3045.938,3046.948,I say --
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3046.948,3049.899,Beg your pardon?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3049.899,3059.139,"First off of course they were not even certain that he was not perhaps in the room, there was a suggestion that perhaps he was in spite of the fact that the key was at the desk."
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3059.139,3063.269,"Well, they went -- they searched -- they looked in and about the room and he wasn't there."
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3063.269,3064.545,That's correct.
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3064.545,3069.878,"Well then why -- if they wanted to search the room, why couldn't they have gotten the search warrant?"
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3069.878,3077.461,They felt that they were justified and based on the permission to search.
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3086.022,3092.616,"And justice wouldn't have suffered at all in the meantime they if had, would it?"
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3092.616,3099.227,"No sir, but the law -- the Fourth Amendment does not require every search to be made with a search warrant."
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3117.766,3127.414,"Well, isn't the question of whether they have the time to get a search warrant, doesn't that goes to the question of reasonableness of an immediate search?"
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3127.414,3130.669,"I do not believe so Your Honor, I don't believe so."
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3135.966,3136.616,"Well, there wasn't any –"
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3136.616,3139.913,If the arrest is proper they can search properly as an incident to consent.
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3139.913,3141.43,There wasn't an arrest here?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3141.43,3143.826,"Well, as an incident to consent."
1963.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3163.506,3169.883,"But your entire case then rests upon consent, if that clerk didn't have the right to give it to you, you are out of court."
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3169.883,3171.513,No Your Honor.
1963.209,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3191.347,3192.858,He said (Inaudible)
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3192.858,3196.034,He said in that case I give you permission.
1963.209,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3207.731,3209.717,(Inaudible)
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3209.717,3211.094,Certainly Your Honor.
1963.209,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3211.094,3226.887,(Inaudible)
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3226.887,3228.883,Yes Your Honor there is a distinction.
1963.209,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3228.883,3233.15,Why didn't we just rely on the permission?
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3250.792,3262.253,But we felt that the California Law giving him the right to enter in that situation was quiet clear and presented on that basis Your Honor.
1963.209,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3262.253,3274.428,"You wouldn't have to go through all that trouble of saying, police open the door (Inaudible) destroy it, all you got to say under the California Law implied permission (Inaudible)"
1963.209,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,3274.428,3279.381,Implied permission you are talking about good faith.
1963.209,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3279.381,3285.344,In that case the officer got a key from the building (Inaudible) and entered the apartment.
