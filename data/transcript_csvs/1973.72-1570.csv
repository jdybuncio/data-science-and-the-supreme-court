1973.72-1570,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.258,"We'll hear arguments next in 72-1570, Donnelly against Dechristoforo."
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,28.261,30.093,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1973.72-1570,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,529.665,531.346,Under what page?
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,531.346,535.381,From petitioner’s brief Your Honor at page 9.
1973.72-1570,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.713,705.2,Mr. Mills I am just curious.
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,707.664,708.142,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1570,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,708.142,711.381,Is he the one that’s now the Assistant A.G. at Massachusetts?
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,711.381,714.408,He is an Assistant Attorney General in Massachusetts Your Honor.
1973.72-1570,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,714.408,715.948,His name is on the briefs here?
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,715.948,727.683,"It is, yes Your Honor."
1973.72-1570,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,749.834,757.108,So the unsworn statement by the defendant comes after the closing argument of counsel in Massachusetts?
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,757.108,758.754,"Yes, Your Honor it does."
1973.72-1570,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,764.754,765.922,But it did it this time?
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,765.922,770.33,"In 1969, yes Your Honor."
1973.72-1570,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,999.103,1009.935,"Before you leave this factual situation, you’ve already pointed out that the record shows that there where three pistols involved here."
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,1034.891,1064.944,"Your Honor, interestingly enough, the only identification about weapon as to any particular defendant had to do with the position of the weapon in the car and the fact that one weapon was found in an area with the driver Gagliardi had left for after being questioned by the police and the record explicitly shows that all identification had been previously removed from the firearms."
1973.72-1570,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1121.623,1131.605,Did the Defense counsel in his opening statement to the jury outline some evidence that he intended to prove which he later did not support with evidence?
1973.72-1570,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1142.703,1146.068,This isn’t a unique failing is it?
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,1146.068,1146.945,"Unique in what, excuse me Your Honor?"
1973.72-1570,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1146.945,1153.905,"Well, it is not unique in the experience of trying a case that something you saying in your opening statement."
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,1156.666,1165.48,"Unique in the sense that if it’s also contained in your closing statement Your Honor, we suggest that it perhaps is unique."
1973.72-1570,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1191.461,1207.974,Your opponent contends as I understand it that Court adjourned rather suddenly after the argument in the afternoon that he really didn’t have an opportunity to make the request to the trial judge until the next morning.
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,1207.974,1240.804,"I suggest there is nothing in the record to indicate Your Honor that respondent’s count, excuse me, defendants counsel could not have continued his objection in requested a bench conference at that junction in the instruction as he had at various portion in the trial, and it should be noted that as additional components of this trial objection numbering approximately 200 were made and 105 explicit exceptions noted on the record of this trial."
1973.72-1570,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1245.105,1251.015,"Is the lobby conference, the Massachusetts equivalent of incumbents and chambers?"
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,1251.015,1257.811,"I can only -- there is nothing in the record Your Honor, but I can only suggest that there are lobby conferences and bench conferences."
1973.72-1570,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1557.743,1560.239,Was the full trial record in the Court?
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,1560.239,1561.142,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1973.72-1570,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1561.142,1564.381,Was the full trial record before the Court of Appeal?
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,1564.381,1565.39,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1570,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1565.709,1570.435,How can you assume that they didn’t look at it?
1973.72-1570,0,21268,david_a_mills,,1570.435,1592.417,"Well explicitly, the Court did not say that they looked at that Your Honor and stated -- I suppose the petitioner would have felt better if the Court said it had examined all of the trial Your Honor including all of the components of the trial."
1973.72-1570,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1798.82,1803.546,Thank you Mr. Mills.
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,1804.183,1808.059,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1570,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.215,1862.596,"And Mr. Smith, why was the Court of Appeals able to reach that conclusion as empathetically as it did on the basis of a statement, they hope that you find him not guilty."
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,1872.631,1882.932,"Well I think Mr. Justice, that rational of the Court my argument is that when a prosecutor made that statement."
1973.72-1570,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1915.109,1923.127,"But to the words used weren’t that he sought some, then you find him guilty of something a little less than first-degree murder."
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,1935.339,1936.348,I would not.
1973.72-1570,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1939.439,1940.289,You would have.
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,1943.209,1948.147,Because he couldn’t have had that opinion Your Honor.
1973.72-1570,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1995.699,1998.46,Do I know that from the record that both of them pleaded guilty the second-degree murder.
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,1998.46,2001.062,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2041.06,2047.75,But to understand the Court of Appeal said that the jury could interpret that they have been plead bargaining?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2047.75,2053.909,I didn’t know of read anything only opinion of the Court says anything about plead bargaining.
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2053.909,2055.875,Or offered of plead guilty?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2055.875,2057.362,Or there was a stipulation.
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2057.362,2057.734,"No, no."
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2062.565,2064.159,Nothing I know off.
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2064.159,2066.973,You didn’t know anything about pleading guilty?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2066.973,2070.264,They knew that Gagliardi to plead guilty.
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2070.264,2072.547,But you did know what did man or anything?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2072.547,2072.761,No.
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2072.761,2073.132,No.
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2073.132,2074.089,"No, no."
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2074.089,2087.045,"So, how can you draw that any conclusion from what the prosecutor said other than that this man expects to get a lesser crime conviction right here on the basis of what he put in?"
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2087.045,2088.797,That he is seeking something less.
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2088.797,2090.284,Yes.
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2090.284,2103.771,"Well, I think the conclusion as obvious that he was saying to the jury that I as a prosecutor who went along with a plea of guilty for Gagliardi at the evidence than in before that jury."
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2119.859,2121.559,That the jury did not know?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2121.559,2122.143,"I beg you, pardon?"
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2122.143,2124.851,The jury didn’t know that the prosecutor recommended it.
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2128.143,2129.258,That so Your Honor.
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2129.258,2129.789,Right?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2129.789,2131.608,That so.
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2131.608,2136.387,I am just condemned to this to what he said and I could interpret as a juror.
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2145.467,2147.113,This maybe so Mr. Justice.
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2147.113,2149.078,What else can you get out that language?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2149.078,2150.034,"I beg you, pardon?"
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2150.034,2153.379,What else can you get out of the prosecutors language?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2153.379,2163.839,"Well, I think that what you get out of that language is that the -- that the respondent was admitting his guilt."
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2169.733,2179.556,"Well, in Massachusetts, is it permissible for Defense counsel to argue that his man is innocent but at the same time if you find him guilty, give him guilty of manslaughter."
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2181.574,2182.37,Yes.
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2182.37,2184.229,"Well, that’s what I am talking about."
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2184.229,2189.857,"But Mr. Justice, that wasn’t the case here by way of the very stipulation."
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2191.079,2195.008,The stipulation came in after this.
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2195.008,2196.442,Yes.
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2197.079,2201.433,"That the jury hasn’t seen the stipulation until yet, right?"
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2201.433,2202.07,That is correct Mr. Justice.
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2202.07,2206.265,And you’re talking about the effect on the jury.
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2209.557,2228.938,"Well, I am only saying that the stipulation establishes that Dechristoforo had never sought to plead guilty to any offense and that the statement by the prosecutor knowing that he had never sought to plead guilty to any offense."
1973.72-1570,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2248.903,2252.089,"Now, let me pursue that with you a little."
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2282.833,2285.01,That is correct and I would like to explain what --
1973.72-1570,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2285.01,2293.665,"Let me pursue at the moment, the three pistols in the car and three men and a dead man."
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2308.161,2312.356,"Well, I -- Yes that maybe so Mr. Chief Justice but of course I would like the brief --"
1973.72-1570,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2312.356,2314.852,"Tell us, it would be a reasonable inference, wouldnt it?"
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2320.427,2331.896,"I think that Mr. Mills unwittingly mislead Your Honor in answering your question put to you, put to him by you."
1973.72-1570,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2451.674,2460.063,But what he said was that they hope that you find him guilty of something a little he did not say anything about a plea.
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2460.063,2485.646,"Well, but he is -- Mr. Justice, he is testifying from his knowledge, that jury seating there has a right to believe that when a District Attorney says to them I quite frankly believe something that he has a source of information unknown to them, not in the record, not put on in a trial of the case that as a District Attorney he knows something."
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2503.381,2510.762,Mr. Smith what offences would the jury given a choice can be instruction?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2510.762,2519.576,"Under the Massachusetts Law, the Court is required to instruct on first-degree, second-degree and manslaughter."
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2519.576,2532.266,"So, what he is saying here is that you, the counsel for the defendant in this case really would like to get manslaughter?"
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2532.266,2535.027,I think you want further than that.
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2539.647,2542.302,"Well if not, what’s wrong with her?"
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2542.302,2554.408,"Well, because it isn’t the fact and he knew it wasn’t the fact and stating that to the jury obviously is a statement that Dechristoforo has indicated that he is guilty of something."
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2554.408,2557.435,So?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2557.435,2563.86,"Well, this was a case of joint venture charge."
1973.72-1570,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2581.952,2586.306,His still could have been guilty of first-degree murder all in Massachusetts.
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2586.306,2602.554,"Yes, surely, if he had been engaged in a joint venture here and I argue that to the Court in the lobby or in chambers and the District Attorneys said that he would not agree to any such -- he would not agree to that."
1973.72-1570,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2630.271,2634.2,The Defense Attorney opens the closing arguments?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2634.2,2634.625,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1570,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2634.625,2637.174,And then the prosecutor responds then do you have a right to rebut?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2637.174,2637.705,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-1570,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2727.301,2735.956,"Mr. Smith, let me ask you what is obviously hypothetical question to prove that the impact to this kind of statement on the jury."
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2763.886,2769.992,I don’t think it would have reached the dimensions that his argument made into that.
1973.72-1570,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2781.355,2788.523,Your suggesting that it would be an impropriety to pose the kind of questions the jurors should consider?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2788.523,2789.001,"Oh, no."
1973.72-1570,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2835.78,2850.01,"Well, isn’t it quite common for the jury to find the triggerman as he would be called guilty of a higher degree of homicide than the driver of the car for example? Not --"
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2850.01,2850.382,"Well, it is --"
1973.72-1570,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2850.382,2853.515,Perfectly a common everyday and every state in the union?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2853.515,2854.205,"Yes, it does."
1973.72-1570,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2854.205,2862.064,"Now,so that you have a reasonable case for lesser offense in first-degree murder here?"
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2862.064,2880.329,"Well, frankly I wasn’t thinking of those terms of manslaughter or anything else and certainly by the very fact that we didn’t make any attempt to negotiate a plea."
1973.72-1570,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2924.56,2927.64,You mean as to the question they should ask themselves?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2927.64,2935.552,I don’t think that be any quarrel. But I think when he says I quite frankly believe this.
1973.72-1570,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2957.959,2959.287,A life or some I presume this case?
1973.72-1570,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2959.287,2959.977,Yes.
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,2959.977,2975.429,"And I might point this at -- although he says in his brief, the petitioners saying in their brief that it doesn’t make or would of sense that they wouldn’t have offered him Dechristoforo something lessen first-degree murder."
1973.72-1570,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3168.566,3170.637,How will you going to prove that Mr. Smith?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,3172.124,3179.717,"Well, grandmother was prepare to testify the he came running up to the house and the offer of proof was nana."
1973.72-1570,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3190.602,3195.912,Did he speak to that effect in his unsworn statement?
1973.72-1570,1,38299,paul_t_smith,,3195.912,3199.576,He did not use that language as I recall it Mr. Justice.
