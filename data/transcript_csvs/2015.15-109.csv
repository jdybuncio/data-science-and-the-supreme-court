2015.15-109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.49,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15-109, Simmons v. Himmelreich. Mr. Martinez."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,8.49,20.715,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When an FTCA action is dismissed under Section 2680, the resulting judgment of dismissal triggers the judgment bar for two basic reasons."
2015.15-109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,42.08,55.085,"Can I ask you a question? And that is -- meaning -- the only claims that are exempted under the Act are Bivens claims, which are constitutional violations."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,72.385,82.82,"Your Honor, the core purpose of the judgment bar, as this Court recognized in Will v. Hallock, is to protect the government from having to litigate multiple times over the same claim."
2015.15-109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,83.36,87.21,"I don't blame you for that, but you didn't litigate multiple times here."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,91.14,93.73,"Oh, with respect, Your Honor, we did litigate multiple times."
2015.15-109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,99.435,102.57,The Bivens claim was brought shortly thereafter.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,105.655,105.92,Right.
2015.15-109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,105.92,112.53,"So if the court had elected to address the Bivens claim first, the bar would have been avoided."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,112.53,115.88,"Well, I think the two cases were brought in two different actions."
2015.15-109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,131.085,140.6,"That still doesn't answer my point, which is, if the district court had chosen to answer the Bivens claim first, there would be no bar in place."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,140.6,147.285,"Your Honor, I think that in -- in that case, it's true that the -- if the Bivens claim, in theory, that the court could have addressed that."
2015.15-109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,160.33,169.19,"That just means that we're -- we're giving district courts the option to foreclose or close the courtroom door, because the work is too hard to get to?"
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,169.19,176.35,"No, not at all, Your Honor. The -- the -- the courtroom door is never closed to the Bivens claim, and the plaintiff could have brought his Bivens claim at the outset."
2015.15-109,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,211.025,226.57,"And a claim that could not be brought against the government. I mean, the Bivens claim was specifically saved out of the Westfall Act, so that the employee would have a Bivens claim."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,259.345,269.45,"Your Honor, I think that the judgment bar doesn't merely embrace a rule of res judicata, it embraces a different rule that turns on the application of a judgment."
2015.15-109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,337.3,345.86,"You would have a nice, clean textual argument if you were willing to argue that ""judgment"" means ""judgment""; it means any judgment."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,358.28,365.43,"So I think, first of all, I think our primary position is that judgment does mean judgment in the sense that it's defined."
2015.15-109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,417.61,423.515,Why wouldn't a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction be a procedural judgment?
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,423.515,439.325,"I think in -- in many cases a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction could well be a procedural judgment, but not in this case, because 2680 dismissals are special and unique insofar as they are jurisdictional, as both parties agree."
2015.15-109,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,480.28,494.76,"No liability on the part of the Federal government under the FTCA, but it's -- it's no judgment at all with respect to the Bivens claim which depends on the employee's conduct."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,501.435,502.155,Right.
2015.15-109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,534.86,535.04,But what --
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,535.04,535.725,Mr. Martinez --
2015.15-109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,535.725,536.91,Go ahead.
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,536.91,549.59,"If I could ask you about the -- what I take to be the Respondent's primary argument in the case now, which is the meaning of this phrase ""the provisions of this chapter in Section 1346(b) shall not apply"" --"
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,549.59,549.83,Yes.
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,549.83,552.975,"-- and of course, that would include the judgment bar."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,562.82,565.2,"Well, I think we have two -- two responses."
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,609.27,613.1,That really does make the -- the language something it's not.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,629.63,632.43,"Well, I think I would say two things to that, Your Honor."
2015.15-109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,654.465,659.735,"Could you point out where, in that case, we explicitly addressed that language and rejected it?"
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,659.735,671.28,"You didn't explicitly discuss that language, but the holding of the case was that one of the provisions of this Chapter 2679(b) did apply to a 2680 claim."
2015.15-109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,678.97,679.32,Let me just --
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,679.32,679.46,-- apply.
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,679.46,680.125,That's a --
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,680.125,685.22,"And if I could -- if I could just -- sorry, Justice Kagan."
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,685.22,685.92,"No, no, no."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,685.92,687.22,I just wanted to emphasize.
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,687.22,689.02,We're all being so polite today.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,689.02,704.53,"In response to Justice Sotomayor's point, Justice Sotomayor suggested that maybe the Court didn't address it explicitly, and that's true, but I want to emphasize that the parties did raise this argument, and we briefed this argument at some length in our merits brief, so --"
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,704.53,713.24,"2679 is different, though, right? Because 2679, the text of it, says that the exceptions shall be applicable to FTCA actions."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,734.46,757.46,"I think -- I -- I think that that would not be the best reading of Smith, because I think that would suggest that the Court saw some sort of conflict between the umbrella language, the introductory clause, and Section 2679(d)(4), which is what you're talking about. I actually think 2679(b)(4) helps us, because what it shows is that Congress shared our understanding of what the ""shall not apply"" language means."
2015.15-109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,765.295,768.07,You -- you mentioned -- I'm sorry.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,768.07,769.025,Sorry.
2015.15-109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,769.945,775.515,You mentioned a moment ago that you extensively briefed this question. Did you mean in Smith?
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,775.515,777.125,"We briefed it in Smith, Your Honor."
2015.15-109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,777.96,781.81,"So you briefed it extensively in Smith, and the Court said nothing about it."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,781.81,784.86,"No, the -- the Court -- the Court's holding was --"
2015.15-109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,784.86,784.99,"Oh, no."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,791.075,791.38,Right.
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,829.54,833.245,Why? I thought -- I don't understand that.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,838.5,839.005,Yes.
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,839.005,839.66,All right.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,845.9,847.75,That's right.
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,850.52,852.785,The employee could not bring the suit.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,867.0,869.64,"As I recall, Your Honor, the -- the --"
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,869.64,883.935,"Why would it have had to come out the other way? If the Act didn't apply, if the whole thing didn't apply, if the Chapter didn't apply, if the FTCA didn't apply, including the exceptions from the FTCA, then how could the employee have -- why would it have come out the other way?"
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,883.935,887.67,I -- I don't recall exactly whether it was a Bivens claim.
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,911.7,914.32,What I'll do is I'll read that five times.
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,918.655,921.24,-- but by the time you get through these statutes -- okay.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,944.955,945.36,Yes.
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,945.36,946.915,"-- is the case over, and they win?"
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,946.915,947.475,No.
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,947.475,948.3,Because?
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,948.3,949.2,No.
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,960.45,971.36,"I understand you think Smith is the end of it, and all I am saying is one of the things I'm paid to do it is read those cases, and then I have to reach a conclusion of whether Smith is the end of it."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,973.045,973.385,Right.
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,973.385,976.18,"Now, if it's not the end of it, do you lose?"
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,976.18,976.65,No.
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1010.27,1013.1,This is the language that's sort of hanging me up.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1040.975,1042.91,I think it says the chapter doesn't apply --
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1042.91,1043.87,That's in the chapter.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1043.87,1045.96,"A couple of responses, Your Honor."
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1072.45,1076.49,That's slicing the bologna pretty thin. (Laughter.)
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1076.49,1090.785,"I mean, you know, they're trying to set up language that applies to a whole bunch of different provisions and saying, you know, all of these provisions don't apply in the context of lawsuits, basically."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1090.785,1143.915,"I think that -- I think that if -- even if you think that that's slicing the bologna too thin, I don't think you need to resolve the case on the basis of that argument because I think there are two additional very strong reasons to reject their reading of the introductory clause in addition to Smith, which we've already talked about. The -- the next reason is that it's -- that that reading of Smith is inconsistent with numerous other provisions of the original FTCA. Justice Kagan, you just said that, you know, the plain text seems to say that they wanted to exempt 2680 claims from all of the provisions of the FTCA, and arguably, that's what the literal language seems to say. But if you look at the original FTCA, that -- that cannot possibly be what -- what that language means. And so let me point you just to four different provisions of the original FTCA that don't seem to make sense under that reading. The first of those provisions is Section 402 of the original FTCA, and we've reproduced that at page 10a of the appendix to our brief."
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1166.83,1170.75,Now that's where the Respondents use an argument very much like the one you just used.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1173.615,1177.75,"Well, I -- I think if it's slicing the bologna thin for us, it's slicing the bologna thin for them."
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1178.1,1179.11,It's a wash.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1179.11,1183.89,The good news for us is that we have three other provisions that I think also don't make any sense based on their reading.
2015.15-109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1208.24,1210.56,Wouldn't they apply anyway? Do you need a provision?
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1210.56,1211.38,Congress --
2015.15-109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1211.38,1213.19,Specifically saying that they would apply?
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1213.19,1216.25,"I think you probably didn't, but Congress seemed to think that you did."
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1242.46,1261.7,"Why is that bad? So -- I mean, look, as I read it simply, if I can, you look at the top of 2680, ""The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to."" And then we have a long list."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1280.495,1281.11,But if you would --
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1281.11,1283.47,And if I say -- you say the Rules of Civil Procedure don't apply.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1285.84,1286.02,Right.
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1286.02,1287.07,You don't have an action.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1287.07,1313.165,"But if you file the action anyway, and then the Court is adjudicating the action, and at issue in the action is whether, for example, the -- the action involves a Federal agency, which is a defined term, or an employee of the government, which is a defined term, then you would have to -- ordinarily you would -- you would think that the definitional provisions would shed light on that question. And so if you are correct, though, that -- that the definitional provision doesn't apply, then you wouldn't know where to look for the definitions."
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1350.24,1353.27,But presumably just then the normal appeals provisions would apply.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1358.39,1359.22,Right.
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1441.665,1443.85,Can you say the other two before you -- I'm sorry.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1443.85,1444.04,Yes.
2015.15-109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1444.09,1445.42,Because I broke into what you were saying before.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1445.42,1480.24,"So -- so just to -- just to recap: The definitional provision, Section 402, the Rules of Civil Procedure provision, Section 411, the appellate review provision, Section 412(a), and then the final one -- and this is the one that is both true -- a problem as of the original FTCA, and it creates massively disruptive consequences with respect to, in practical terms today, that Section 423 of the original FTCA, and it's the provision that's now codified at Section 2679(a) of the current FTCA. So let me say a word about this provision."
2015.15-109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1480.24,1481.95,That's the one on 16a of your --
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1481.95,1483.84,That's -- that's the one on 16a.
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1498.18,1500.125,Before -- if I could just interrupt very quickly.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1500.125,1500.405,Yes.
2015.15-109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1500.405,1504.5,"Of the other three, which ones are still current today?"
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1504.5,1507.835,So the definitional provision is still there.
2015.15-109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1601.975,1602.66,I'm sorry.
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1621.91,1622.27,Right.
2015.15-109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1622.27,1626.885,"-- either under a Bivens claim or under the Administrative Act, et cetera."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1626.885,1627.17,Yeah.
2015.15-109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1627.17,1632.71,"What you're saying is, you have the opportunity, as the United States, to step in if you choose."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1633.25,1637.53,"If -- if -- if a Bivens claim is brought, then the judgment bar would have no operation."
2015.15-109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1644.19,1656.585,"Putting that aside, how does your reading save you from all of this definitional discussion we've had for the last five minutes? It's still going to happen, or can happen."
2015.15-109,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1662.125,1677.685,"Well, I think if the Bivens claim can be brought, then the Bivens claim is brought against the individual employee, so the United States government is not liable for -- you know, to take the example we said, for the negligent transmission of mail. And if the Court's -- unless the Court has questions, I'll reserve my time for rebuttal."
2015.15-109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1677.685,1683.24,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Vergonis."
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,1683.24,1708.57,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Through Section 2680 and the judgment bar, Congress has established a fair and sensible statutory scheme where the government accepts derivative superior liability for the torts of its employees, a plaintiff who tries his claim against the government may not seek a second bite at the apple or duplicative recovery by suing the employee personally."
2015.15-109,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1755.0,1761.71,It can't be read in a strictly literal sense because then 2680 itself wouldn't apply.
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,1761.71,1764.65,"Well, that's somewhat circular, Justice Alito."
2015.15-109,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1764.65,1765.3,All right.
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,1769.31,1773.04,I think it says the FTCA shall not apply to these provisions.
2015.15-109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1805.825,1806.29,What about --
2015.15-109,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1806.29,1811.555,"Smith -- Smith could be explained on the absurdity rule, could it not?"
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,1811.555,1816.03,Smith -- Smith doesn't need to be explained on the absurdity rule.
2015.15-109,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1821.045,1829.31,"Well, the whole point of the Westfall Act was to allow substitution, so if that didn't apply, then there wouldn't be substitution and there would be no point in having the Westfall Act. Correct?"
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,1829.31,1840.73,"Well, certainly you could look at it that way, so yes. I mean, for a provision to overcome the literal language of the ""shall not apply"" directive, you would need an absurd result from following it to -- to overcome the language."
2015.15-109,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1850.53,1864.06,"What if you look at the definitional provisions? Okay, 2680 has a lot of terms that would be subject to some litigation or confusing -- who's -- who's -- confusion."
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,1889.47,1894.82,"No, we think the definitions are included, because definitions govern statutory terms, they don't govern claims."
2015.15-109,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1902.52,1903.28,"Well, it's a --"
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,1903.28,1904.7,-- excepts claims.
2015.15-109,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1904.7,1906.92,It's a provision of the chapter --
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,1906.92,1907.87,And it doesn't --
2015.15-109,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1907.87,1910.91,"-- under your reading, which is a strict literal one, that it shall not apply."
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,1926.995,1930.71,"Well, you can look to the definitions to understand what 2680 says."
2015.15-109,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1976.75,1982.71,What about the review provisions? Those seem to be a particular -- particularly problematic aspect.
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,1985.12,1985.74,They don't.
2015.15-109,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1987.67,1989.815,"13(a), Section 412."
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,1989.815,1991.95,"Yeah, 412 is the appellate review provisions."
2015.15-109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2025.57,2036.285,"I can see that, but -- that is, imagine a plaintiff and the plaintiff brings a lawsuit against the Post Office for negligence."
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,2086.65,2104.93,"And the Post Office is a great example, Your Honor, because when Congress enacted the sue-and-be-sued clause for the Post Office, they inserted another provision now at 39 U.S.C., Section 409, which said that tort claims against the Post Office shall be subject to the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act."
2015.15-109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2104.93,2108.01,"So we don't have to worry about the Post Office, the example that he gave."
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,2131.57,2132.93,Two answers to that.
2015.15-109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2190.07,2226.84,"So -- so you're -- can I -- are you saying this, in essence? Even if there are other provisions that aren't erased, even if there aren't, this particular erasure means that in an action that is dismissed -- an action against the government -- for the reasons listed in those exceptions -- for example, a foreign country, a discretionary exception -- in such an action, you can sue the employee where ordinary principals of res judicata wouldn't bar you from suing the employee after all."
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,2227.825,2233.89,"That's our position, and -- and you can only sue the employee today on constitutional tort claims under Bivens."
2015.15-109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2233.89,2244.815,"But you're saying any claim, if it falls within -- if the reason for the bar, if the reason for the dismissal falls within the exception, and if they wanted to change that, they should have said so."
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,2244.815,2246.37,"That's -- that's exactly right, Your Honor."
2015.15-109,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2247.05,2254.08,"Is -- is that another way of saying that the judgment bar applies just to judgments of the merits, or is that somewhat different from your argument?"
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,2254.08,2255.27,"That's one of our arguments, Your Honor."
2015.15-109,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2256.33,2276.88,"Isn't that the same as the argument you just made? Because I'm curious to know, if -- if we think Smith was an interpretation of -- of 2680, and you had to get around Smith and it's awkward to do it, what's your second argument? Is that the argument you're now making to Justice Breyer, or is it different from saying that what we're talking about is judgment on the merits?"
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,2276.88,2283.38,"Well, as I -- as I understood, Justice Breyer's question was the consequences of our argument, and our three arguments lead to the same consequences."
2015.15-109,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2319.25,2357.585,"What of the government's argument that once you get wind that a 2680 exception is going to get the government off the hook, before a judgment is entered, which might raise the judgment bar, you can voluntarily -- voluntarily dismiss your case against the government so you won't face a judgment? You can amend your complaint, if -- if you sued them both originally, to drop the government, or you can take a voluntary dismissal. What -- how do you answer that?"
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,2357.585,2369.12,"I think once you've -- once they've answered the complaint, Your Honor, I don't think the plaintiff can just dismiss or amend the complaint without seeking leave from the Court, which may result in a judgment of dismissal."
2015.15-109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2420.88,2437.57,"Could I take you back to the ""shall not apply"" language for a second? When -- when you were speaking to the Chief Justice, you said, well, the definitional section will continue to apply because definitions apply to terms and not to claims. But then Mr. Martinez said something very similar to that."
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,2457.395,2460.55,The judgment bar actually uses the language of claims.
2015.15-109,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2533.675,2544.535,"To go back to the point you were making before, under your interpretation, does the judgment bar add anything to principles of claim preclusion?"
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,2544.535,2545.69,"We think so, Your Honor."
2015.15-109,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2551.56,2556.955,"It was in existence in 1946, but today would -- it would be superfluous."
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,2556.955,2568.58,"Today it may be superfluous with modern principles of res judicata, where we've developed nonmutality and defendants are able to assert defense uses of res judicata."
2015.15-109,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2621.3,2633.405,But it is obsolete in the sense that modern res judicata law would take care of the -- it wouldn't matter whether you sued the government first or the employee case first.
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,2639.785,2640.45,That's right.
2015.15-109,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2677.7,2686.245,So you want us to decide this case based on a literal reading of 2680.
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,2721.725,2725.76,"Two points, Your Honor: First, I don't think the argument was waived."
2015.15-109,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2729.29,2737.84,"It's a separate -- it's -- it's another ground for affirmance, correct? It's an alternative grounds for affirmance, which we have discretion to decide whether we want to reach or not."
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,2737.84,2741.25,I think it's an alternative argument for the same ground for affirmance.
2015.15-109,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2811.925,2813.02,"Thank you, counsel."
2015.15-109,1,62678,christian_vergonis,,2813.02,2813.605,Thank you.
2015.15-109,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2813.605,2818.744,"Mr. Martinez, you have two minutes remaining."
2015.15-109,2,56052,roman_martinez,,2818.744,2834.62,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I have two main points that I'd like to make. First, with respect to the Postal Service, it's true that the Postal Reorganization Act says that the FTCA applies to torts that involve the Postal Service."
2015.15-109,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2914.005,2915.57,That's the government's choice.
2015.15-109,2,56052,roman_martinez,,2918.51,2919.41,That's true.
2015.15-109,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2940.205,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
