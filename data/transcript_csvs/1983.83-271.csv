1983.83-271,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.272,We will hear arguments first this morning in National Collegiate Athletic Association against the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma.
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,15.426,18.378,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,248.045,253.097,"Mr. Easterbrook, is the NCAA a for-profit association or a non-profit?"
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,253.097,254.949,"It is a non-profit association, Your Honor."
1983.83-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,254.949,257.484,And are the universities that are members of it non-profit?
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,257.484,258.284,They are.
1983.83-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,493.388,503.66,"Well, but the contracts between the TV networks and the colleges are not dependent on receipt of revenue by the TV stations."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,505.529,507.912,"They are flat commitments, Your Honor."
1983.83-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,650.885,664.211,"Mr. Easterbrook, as a judge who is an expert neither in antitrust nor football, I get the impression occasionally that this market definition thing is a game that many people can play at."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,685.209,688.26,"I think that's right, Your Honor."
1983.83-271,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,747.782,753.952,"Could you spell out just what you mean by manipulate in the sense you used it there, Mr. Easterbrook?"
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,753.952,766.577,"Well, by manipulate, Mr. Chief Justice, I mean that the market definition, the definitional exercise, is as inevitably arbitrary as any exercise in definition."
1983.83-271,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,779.467,785.038,"Are you using that in the same sense that the networks can manipulate the soap opera market, for example?"
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,785.038,785.755,"No, no."
1983.83-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,841.542,843.577,"Mr. Easterbrook, may I ask you a question."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,865.507,876.065,"That's correct, they pay a much higher rate per thousand viewers per 30-minute spot than they do for pro baseball."
1983.83-271,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,961.487,966.808,You're saying that the networks want a higher intelligence group of people?
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,966.808,969.658,I don't know whether they want a higher intelligence person--
1983.83-271,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,969.658,970.676,If they do they ought to change their commercials.
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,973.044,978.615,"--Justice Marshall, I'm not sure whether intelligence is the criterion at all, rather than say income."
1983.83-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1004.23,1015.086,"I think maybe more precisely, Mr. Easterbrook, what I'm asking is, if the district court took the view that I just indicated, do you have to convince us that it was clearly erroneous in doing so?"
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1023.541,1034.916,"--Well, Your Honor, I agree that we can't start from scratch in this case, and in fact we're not asking you to declare the district court's findings clearly erroneous."
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.621,1174.406,"Well, what if it just has power to raise the price?"
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1174.406,1178.108,"--I'm sorry, Justice White, I didn't hear the full question."
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.108,1180.393,"Well, what if it just has power to raise the price?"
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1180.393,1188.631,Then it seems to me that there is no demonstration of market power.
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1226.456,1240.432,"So what if the NCAA says to the television, when they put it out for bids, they say, just remember, this year if the bids are only so and so... or you're going to have to do better than a certain price this year, which is considerably more than last year."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1243.634,1253.256,"--Every time the NCAA has renegotiated a contract, the price per exposure has indeed gone up, although--"
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1253.256,1258.727,"And you say that's part of the market, that's some evidence of market power, I suppose."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1258.727,1259.929,--No.
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.929,1260.745,But not enough?
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1260.745,1265.833,"In fact, Justice White, we think, quite the contrary, we think it's evidence of lack of market power."
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1281.176,1286.83,"Well, they've been raising the price and increasing output, so-called, every year, too."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1286.83,1287.38,That's right.
1983.83-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1302.256,1308.326,"Mr. Easterbrook, am I not correct in believing that these contracts limit the number of games that can be televised?"
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1308.326,1311.778,"Yes, Your Honor, they do."
1983.83-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1311.778,1319.968,Isn't it true that in consequence of that you get a total greater aggregate revenue than if you had unrestricted individual televising of games?
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1324.436,1333.692,"No, Your Honor, and it is not a classic example of doing that for essentially two reasons."
1983.83-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1371.584,1372.651,Price of what?
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1384.91,1388.612,"--No, Your Honor, we would not agree to that."
1983.83-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1696.26,1707.001,"But you're suggestion, Mr. Easterbrook, suggests that the NCAA is in the business of manufacturing widgets and that its only motive is to maximize profits."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1712.471,1714.923,"It might well, Your Honor."
1983.83-271,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1731.45,1733.052,Why haven't you argued that?
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1733.052,1747.228,"We haven't argued that because as we read this Court's cases, including Engineers and others, the goals other than economic are not reasons for monopolistic practices."
1983.83-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1747.228,1753.132,"Well, Engineers was an association that represented people who were in business for profit only."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1753.132,1754.598,"Indeed, Your Honor."
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1838.118,1848.574,"You've been talking about now, almost exclusively about the contracts between the NCAA and the networks."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1855.997,1860.032,The TV plan among the members of the NCAA?
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1860.032,1861.066,Yes.
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1861.066,1868.888,"As we view it, the TV plan establishes the contents of what the network contracts will be."
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1876.91,1878.51,"Well, it is an agreement among the schools--"
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1878.51,1879.029,"--Oh, yes."
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1879.029,1879.845,--not to compete with each other.
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1879.845,1887.885,"It is an agreement among the schools to engage in competition in a particular way, as we've said."
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1887.885,1898.907,"Well, the way it operates on a particular Saturday, everybody except the school who's on television in a certain area has agreed to stay off the air."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1898.907,1900.359,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.359,1903.311,Do you have to talk about that at all?
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1903.311,1910.298,"Well, we talk about it at great length in our brief, and the Solicitor General also talks about it."
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1910.298,1911.315,I notice it's quite long in your brief.
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1911.315,1911.865,Pardon?
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.865,1913.433,It is quite long in your brief.
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1913.433,1914.067,Indeed.
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.246,1936.032,It increases its output of what?
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1936.032,1939.317,--Its output of games and viewers.
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.519,1949.856,"Well, you really are... if there weren't this system there might be more games, but there might not be--"
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1949.856,1951.892,"--There might be fewer viewers, Your Honor."
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1951.892,1952.858,--There might be fewer viewers.
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1952.858,1954.494,And therefore reduced output.
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.494,1955.16,That's what we're really talking about.
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1955.16,1958.946,"That's what we're really talking about, that an increase, short-term increase in the number of games--"
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1958.946,1965.801,"Well, an agreement among potential competitors is always valid if the result is to increase their gross?"
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1965.801,1967.184,--No.
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.184,1969.419,That doesn't sound quite right.
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1969.419,1969.953,No.
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.392,1982.427,"Well, that's all you've told me yet is the justification for this agreement."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1982.427,1983.777,I'm sorry.
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.303,2052.94,"You always arrive at the same bottom line, that this arrangement will increase the gross."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2058.761,2070.568,"The distinction we're trying to draw is between increasing the gross by cutting back your output and monopolizing, and increasing the gross by improving the quality of your product and getting more people to watch."
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.77,2090.38,"--Well, would you... there are findings, I suppose, in the record that, except for this arrangement, there would be more games on television."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2093.415,2094.934,We do not disagree with that finding.
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.934,2099.136,"So let's say there were twice as many games on television, but there was only half the take."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2114.93,2122.351,The monopoly question is whether the NCAA can increase--
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.351,2128.505,"Well, it isn't only... you talk as though this were 100 percent a monopoly case."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2128.505,2133.309,"--Well, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2137.361,2140.646,"Well, how about just an agreement among competitors?"
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2140.646,2146.467,I view that as stating a claim under Section 1 of Sherman for cartel behavior.
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.226,2165.361,"I don't know why you keep putting this word ""cartel"" in it."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2187.544,2188.544,--I understand that.
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2204.386,2216.627,"Well, here are two... here are two supermarkets in a large city, two chains."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2244.178,2245.245,If all they do is agree not--
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2245.245,2246.314,"It isn't monopolization, is it?"
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2246.314,2248.48,--It's clearly a violation of the antitrust laws.
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.085,2255.969,"But it's doing that much, isn't it?"
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2255.969,2260.973,The NCAA--
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2260.973,2263.925,"Maybe it's doing more, but it's doing that much."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2270.995,2275.316,"--Exactly, as we've been trying to say, as in Broadcast Music."
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2275.316,2276.366,"--Well, I know."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2283.137,2283.97,"No, no."
1983.83-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.909,2292.042,"All right, all right."
1983.83-271,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2293.11,2294.394,--Thank you.
1983.83-271,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2298.062,2301.514,Mr. Coats.
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2301.514,2304.752,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.83-271,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2397.826,2400.278,So long as Oklahoma's on every Saturday.
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2400.278,2403.896,"Well, it would be hoped, Your Honor, that the networks would want us."
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.208,2424.891,How do you get away with that?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2424.891,2425.743,--I beg your pardon?
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.743,2426.376,How do you get away with that?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2426.376,2428.195,"Well, we think that that's perfectly legitimate, Your Honor, for us to--"
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.195,2429.678,Under your theory of this case it is?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2429.678,2431.646,"--Yes, sir, for us to--"
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2431.646,2433.78,"Well, we'll probably see if you win this case."
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2433.78,2434.698,--Right.
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2449.941,2453.643,"You also have a conference basketball game of the week, don't you?"
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2453.643,2456.429,"--Yes, sir, but it's not exclusive in the sense that the other teams can still be on."
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.249,2469.253,But the conference... but you negotiate with the TV people together for a game of the week?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2469.253,2470.355,--There is a game of the week.
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.355,2471.755,"And it's an agreed upon price, right?"
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2471.755,2473.973,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.12,2496.589,I understand that.
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2498.456,2499.374,"--Yes, sir."
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.16,2505.362,"Well, we'll probably see about that, too."
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2505.362,2506.328,"I'm sorry, I missed that."
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2506.328,2510.414,"I would suppose we would probably see about that, too, one of these days."
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2511.932,2527.375,"Well, quite honestly, Your Honor, if this case was allowed, if football was allowed to be governed in the way that basketball has been, I think everybody would leave here with a good deal of satisfaction, because the truth is that basketball has been unregulated."
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.375,2534.381,"Well, if you had a conference football game of the week in the big eight, I'd almost guarantee you that Oklahoma would not be on every week."
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2534.381,2536.014,"I don't expect it would be, Your Honor."
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2536.014,2536.697,No.
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2539.583,2547.689,But the saving grace would be that we would be able and all the schools would be able to market that game through other regional and local television stations.
1983.83-271,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2551.907,2556.127,Do you have to make the case that Justice White postulated to you to prevail here?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2556.127,2557.996,"No, I think not, Your Honor."
1983.83-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2630.157,2645.266,"Mr. Coats, if you prevail what would happen to the revenues that the colleges might receive thereafter from the television broadcasting?"
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2645.266,2653.872,"In two respects, Your Honor: We think that, first of all, the amount of revenues would be substantially greater for lots of schools."
1983.83-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2653.872,2655.374,"Well, who gets the revenues?"
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2655.374,2662.544,"The revenues would go to the colleges that were on television, except in those cases where there's a conference situation, where they go into the conferences and then are redistributed."
1983.83-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2662.544,2669.817,"What would prevent NCAA from saying, fine, you sell to whoever you want to, but we get the revenues if you're going to belong?"
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2669.817,2676.738,"I think that there's nothing in an antitrust sense, there's nothing wrong with them doing that, as long as we still have the right to market our product and decide."
1983.83-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2682.407,2684.159,So they might well do that if you prevail--
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2684.159,2685.043,"They might, Your Honor, exactly."
1983.83-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2685.043,2686.861,"--and say, fine, you win, but we'll take the money?"
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2686.861,2688.361,They might indeed do that.
1983.83-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2700.503,2709.942,"Well, I take it you don't want to just opt out of NCAA because you think that it offers other benefits for other sports, is that right?"
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2709.942,2711.477,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2756.923,2775.503,"Well, if you win in this case is there some chance that you 60 or 80 so-called first class schools will sort of have your own arrangements, one among the other, something like the NCAA, or what?"
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2775.503,2781.74,"Your Honor, there is a possibility, I suppose, that there will be some additional national packages, but they would be on a voluntary basis."
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2799.701,2820.965,"Do you think the networks would... if there are 60 of you, you had your own organization and were trying to negotiate with the television people, do you think the television people are going to pay you the price you would want if some other school 200 miles away says, sorry, but we're going to go on television, too?"
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2820.965,2828.552,"We think that the prices, that the total dollars will be increased, but the national package would probably be decreased to some extent."
1983.83-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2843.144,2846.163,"Of course, they're on at 12:00 o'clock at night, too, with basketball."
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2846.163,2847.948,"--Yes, sir, they're on just nearly any time of day."
1983.83-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2847.948,2855.536,"You don't find nearly as much prime time coverage of basketball, I think, as you do of football."
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2855.536,2857.904,"Well, we do in our part of the country, Your Honor."
1983.83-271,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2973.613,2979.667,"Well, Mr. Coats, did the district court make any findings about NCAA market power?"
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,2979.667,2982.535,"Yes, they did."
1983.83-271,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3007.852,3011.471,But you don't think those findings are necessary to support you?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3011.471,3013.673,"No, Your Honor, we think they are necessary."
1983.83-271,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3016.125,3017.808,You say you do think they are necessary?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3017.808,3018.525,"--Yes, sir."
1983.83-271,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3018.525,3019.26,For your position?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3019.26,3020.31,"Yes, sir, we do."
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3023.362,3025.664,It isn't necessary for your Section 1 case?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3025.664,3026.481,"No, sir, it is not."
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3041.574,3045.644,"What if we reject your per se case, though?"
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3048.779,3049.329,All right.
1983.83-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3060.071,3060.587,How about then?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3063.023,3075.831,"We think that the... well, if you take the traditional look under rule of reason, it seems to us that you probably would have to have market power in a relevant market."
1983.83-271,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3075.831,3078.699,Wouldn't you go to Broadcast Music?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3078.699,3079.933,"I beg your pardon, sir."
1983.83-271,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3079.933,3081.901,Wouldn't you go to Broadcast Music?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3081.901,3088.971,"Yes, and we certainly can in this case go to Broadcast Music, because Broadcast Music we think supports our view."
1983.83-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3116.241,3117.891,Limited output of what?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3117.891,3121.026,"The games, the games that are on television."
1983.83-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3121.026,3122.312,The number of games on television?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3122.312,3123.312,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3123.312,3128.548,You disagree with your opponent's view that output is to be measured by number of viewers who look at the games?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3128.548,3129.381,We absolutely do.
1983.83-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3146.51,3150.295,"Well, he says the number of riders goes up and that's the best test of a competitive market."
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3150.295,3153.497,"Well, viewership has gone up."
1983.83-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3172.494,3175.462,"Well, he says the price has gone down per viewer, as I understand it."
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3183.2,3193.741,"We think, Your Honor, that the evidence in court showed that it was the contrary, that the cost per viewer is higher, two and a half times as high is it has been."
1983.83-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3210.017,3214.821,"Well, the cost per minute, but is it also the cost per minute per viewer gone up?"
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3214.821,3216.221,"Well, they generally figure--"
1983.83-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3216.221,3219.975,The reason the cost per minute's gone up I assume is because so many more people are watching the programs.
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3219.975,3220.941,--That's right.
1983.83-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3295.606,3301.51,"In other words, you say the relevant market is the market for the raw materials, and he says the relevant market is the market for the finished product."
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3301.51,3302.629,"--Yes, sir, he does."
1983.83-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3302.629,3306.581,And you say that they have monopolized the market for the raw material.
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3306.581,3307.914,"Yes, sir, exactly."
1983.83-271,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3416.802,3419.069,You don't think the broadcasting helps that attendance?
1983.83-271,1,15691,andy_coats,,3419.069,3420.17,"--I think it helps it, yes, sir."
1983.83-271,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3464.199,3468.984,Mr. Solicitor General.
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3468.984,3473.388,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Courts:"
1983.83-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3701.418,3713.308,"Mr. Solicitor General, do you have to disavow any so-called findings of the lower courts to say that the per se rule does not apply here?"
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3713.308,3716.11,Do I have to disavow any findings to say?
1983.83-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3718.895,3725.985,"Well, you differ with both lower courts on the framework in which you analyze this case."
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3725.985,3726.635,--Yes.
1983.83-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3726.635,3727.685,And why do you?
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3728.853,3731.389,Because of our interest in enforcing the antitrust laws.
1983.83-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3731.389,3733.805,"Well, that's a nice thought."
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3733.805,3768.228,"Because our experience has taught that the application of the per se rules in an area where there are legitimate areas of cooperative endeavor has the effect of... has the opposite, precisely the opposite of the effect that was intended by the per se rule, which is that the courts shy away from using shortcuts and presumptions in those areas where shortcuts and presumptions are in order."
1983.83-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3768.228,3783.488,"If the product is called football and the effect of the agreement is to limit output and drive up prices, I don't understand why you then say the lower courts were wrong in just stopping there."
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3783.488,3787.024,We say the lower courts were not wrong in stopping there.
1983.83-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3789.308,3798.247,"Well, they could have... they apparently independently thought the NCAA plan was illegal because it was a per se violation of the antitrust laws."
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3800.366,3808.389,--We say that the point at which they should have stopped... this is simply a demonstration of our view that it does occupy the entire spectrum.
1983.83-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3872.379,3882.27,"Well, do you think there was an agreement on prices at which to sell this product that you say was involved?"
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3882.27,3885.389,--There is no evidence to that in the record and I think there probably was not.
1983.83-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3887.222,3889.174,"Well, there was a finding that this is a price fix."
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3889.174,3890.457,--That is correct.
1983.83-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3890.457,3891.459,Do you disagree with that?
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3891.459,3894.745,I don't agree with it or disagree with it.
1983.83-271,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4010.37,4016.524,"Well, do you think the Court of Appeals followed the same analysis in its opinion that the district court did?"
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4016.524,4017.809,--Not precisely.
1983.83-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4033.485,4036.853,Except we ignore their conclusions about per se.
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4036.853,4040.072,"--No, Justice White, you... well--"
1983.83-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4040.072,4041.591,"Well, I read your brief."
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4044.293,4045.526,"--Well, the conclusions, yes."
1983.83-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4051.03,4053.482,"--I thought they found there was a price fix, illegal price fix."
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4053.482,4055.382,"--That is correct, that is correct."
1983.83-271,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4079.047,4103.98,"Mr. Solicitor General, do I correctly understand your view to be that there's one broad rule of reason, one might say, at one end of which and a species of a rule of reason violation is what we've often called per se; at the other end is a very thorough market analysis; and there are a lot of cases where you don't get there in ten minutes, but you don't have to go all the way; and they're still all one variety of the rule of reason?"
1983.83-271,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4103.98,4104.765,"Precisely, precisely."
1983.83-271,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4148.259,4149.961,"Thank you, gentlemen."
