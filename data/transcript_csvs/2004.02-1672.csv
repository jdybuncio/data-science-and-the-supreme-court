2004.02-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,7.968,We'll hear argument in Jackson against the Birmingham Board of Education.
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,43.839,46.894,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.02-1672,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,81.734,86.73,"Of course, the question is whether... that... that may be true, but there would be an administrative remedy."
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,89.248,91.356,"That is true, Justice Kennedy."
2004.02-1672,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,91.356,95.73,"Even... even assuming the... the validity of your premise, you still have another step."
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,95.73,117.483,"I understand that other step, and I think that was largely resolved in Cannon v. the City of Chicago, a decision which this Court upheld a right of action to enforce title IX, even though there was also administrative remedies available and which was validated by Congress, as this Court... every member of this Court recognized in... in Sandoval."
2004.02-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,117.483,131.989,"Yes, but I thought... I thought that Cannon... we've... we've allowed Cannon to stay on the books, but I thought we have sworn off the kind of creation of... of implied remedies that Cannon exemplifies."
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,131.989,141.898,"In this case, there is no doubt that the two established principles together that are settled support this cause of action."
2004.02-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,193.356,198.269,"It's very... it's very useful, I'm sure, but it... it could be very disruptive also, I am sure."
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,223.782,230.265,"Justice Scalia, the burden, of course, is on the plaintiff to demonstrate causation."
2004.02-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.687,247.848,"Some of them specifically provide for retaliation, don't they?"
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,247.848,248.674,--That is correct.
2004.02-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,248.674,254.164,"Why do they do that if, as you assert, the mere word discrimination embraces it?"
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,254.164,255.983,"Well, Congress has taken a different approach."
2004.02-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.494,384.816,"Do you think that it... it is a reasonable description of what happened... he was fired for complaining about his girls' team not getting enough facilities... that he was, on the basis of sex, excluded from participation in, denied benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under an education program?"
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,384.816,385.438,Absolutely.
2004.02-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.438,388.0,Do you think that... that remotely describes what happened to this coach?
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,388.0,388.372,Absolutely.
2004.02-1672,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,469.608,483.087,"But... but that's again the question of the substantive scope of the provision, and that's different from whether there was a congressional intent to create a private cause of action for this sort of violation."
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,495.969,498.281,--I think the Court--
2004.02-1672,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,498.281,499.024,And that's... that's quite separate from--
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,499.024,499.767,--Yes.
2004.02-1672,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,501.132,502.413,--from this... from the question of substantive liability.
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,502.413,503.983,--I understand that.
2004.02-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,590.834,606.438,"Yes, but it's separate enough from discrimination that in other statutes, although Congress does create a cause of action for discrimination, it goes out of its way to create a separate cause of action for retaliation."
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,640.413,653.211,"Justice Scalia, with... with all due respect, I don't think there's any way, when the district accepted these funds, that they could have reasonably relied on the assumption that they would be free to retaliate against people who tried to comply--"
2004.02-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,653.211,662.499,"Well, but there was... there was... let's go back to this for just a moment... an administrative remedy available for retaliation expressly under the regs?"
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,662.499,663.902,--That is correct.
2004.02-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,663.902,669.641,And did this petitioner seek an administrative remedy at all?
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,669.641,672.242,He did not seek an administrative remedy.
2004.02-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,678.186,681.696,What would the administrative remedy have allowed here--
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,681.696,682.522,Well--
2004.02-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,682.522,683.265,--had it been sought?
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,683.265,702.296,"--Here, as in Franklin, as in Davis, as in Cannon v. the University of Chicago, as in every one of this Court's title IX cases, indeed, as in all of its title VI cases involving Federal funds with race, you can call this to attention of the office of civil rights of the relevant agency and they can begin an inquiry."
2004.02-1672,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,707.785,709.437,Do they have any other sanction?
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,730.159,732.017,--That is correct.
2004.02-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,732.017,732.472,So that's it.
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,738.871,739.326,That is correct.
2004.02-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,739.326,740.235,--petitioner.
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,740.235,752.124,"That is not part of the... the administrative process is only about institutional funding, which is why the Court has consistently upheld the right to bring these actions for what are violations of the statute itself."
2004.02-1672,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,752.124,762.526,"Well, if we don't accept... let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that... that we're having trouble accepting the... the analysis that it is a violation of the statute in the statute's own terms."
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,784.446,785.932,That is--
2004.02-1672,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,785.932,789.813,So... so the... the argument is you... you should recognize this as a necessity.
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,831.34,832.992,--That... that is absolutely right.
2004.02-1672,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,832.992,834.107,What's... what are the facts?
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,835.964,836.42,Well--
2004.02-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,836.42,843.395,Do you know if administrative sanctions have been imposed under title IX against schools?
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,843.395,848.801,"--Well, I'm sure there have been some instances in which there have been administrative sanctions under title IX."
2004.02-1672,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,852.85,853.472,Have funds--
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,853.472,853.965,--let me suggest--
2004.02-1672,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,853.965,859.332,"--have funds... Mr. Dellinger, have funds ever been withdrawn from any school because of a violation of--"
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,859.332,860.325,--Not to my knowledge.
2004.02-1672,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,860.325,860.901,--title IX?
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,860.901,861.356,But I think--
2004.02-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,861.356,862.471,That could be because--
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,862.471,863.464,--I actually have--
2004.02-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,863.464,867.179,--the sanction is so draconian that nobody in his right mind is not going to rehire the coach.
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,872.552,873.461,"--Well, if it's never... I... I--"
2004.02-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.461,876.062,It seems to me it's... it's overwhelmingly effective.
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,879.694,880.77,--Justice--
2004.02-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,880.77,882.378,Is it hard to decide what they're going to do?
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,882.378,887.124,"--I do have an answer, first, for Justice Ginsburg's question from Ms. Greenberger."
2004.02-1672,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,891.378,894.6,And I can't imagine anyone who would want such a sanction.
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,896.169,896.912,--That is certainly not what--
2004.02-1672,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,896.912,897.534,--the girls on the team.
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,897.534,914.828,"--Coach... Coach Jackson would have sought, and... and because that process is not one that's responsive to the individual case... if you're down in Birmingham, Alabama, the idea that there is some office that has control over Federal funds that's never imposed a sanction, the fact of the matter is... and it's the reason--"
2004.02-1672,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,914.828,917.429,"Well, you're saying the coach cares more about it than the Government does?"
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,917.429,921.144,"--That may well be the case, absolutely."
2004.02-1672,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,921.887,930.598,"Well, if... if the Government is charged with... with just spending the funds and doesn't think that this is worth its time, why should there be a private cause of action--"
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,930.598,931.341,--Because--
2004.02-1672,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,931.341,937.285,--when... when a private cause of action is harder for us to imply than it... than it is to an administrative remedy?
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,937.285,943.435,--Because in this case people like Coach Jackson... it's hard enough for Coach Jackson to come forward.
2004.02-1672,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1024.925,1025.502,Mr.--
2004.02-1672,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1025.502,1026.867,I'll reserve the balance of my time.
2004.02-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1026.867,1045.935,"Mr. Gornstein, do you have any light to shed on the extent to which administrative sanctions have ever been imposed against schools and... and the feasibility of going that route?"
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1045.935,1050.105,Administrative sanction has never been imposed under title IX.
2004.02-1672,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1050.105,1051.674,They have been under title VI?
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1051.674,1057.453,"There has been one case in which an administrative sanction was imposed under title VI, Justice Kennedy."
2004.02-1672,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1070.993,1081.48,Do you take the position that what occurred here can amount to a direct violation of the statute as discrimination?
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1081.48,1084.081,"--We do, Justice... Justice O'Connor."
2004.02-1672,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1136.093,1141.788,Why would Congress then in some statutes expressly cover retaliation and in others not?
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1143.607,1166.763,"--It is, Justice O'Connor, but the explanation for that for... in title VII, for example, is that the core prohibitions in title VII refer to discrimination based on such individual's race, sex, or national origin, and that such individual's language rules out the kind of retaliation claim we are talking about here."
2004.02-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1166.763,1172.336,"Oh, it rules out this one, but it doesn't rule out the main... look it, this is a weird kind of retaliation claim."
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1194.051,1207.813,"If... if it's based on the fact that the... that the person is complaining about sex discrimination and not on the sex of the complainer, it's exactly the same theory of discrimination that we have here, Justice Scalia."
2004.02-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.429,1222.286,What was the date of the Sullivan case?
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1222.286,1227.449,It was 3 years before Congress enacted section... I think it was '68... '69.
2004.02-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1228.973,1229.428,'69.
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1229.428,1231.164,"It was '69, Justice Scalia."
2004.02-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.164,1238.427,And... and you think that we take the same approach to implied causes of action today that we took in 1969?
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1238.427,1242.697,"You do not, Justice Scalia, when you are starting afresh, but--"
2004.02-1672,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1242.697,1244.454,And we certainly did not with a Spending Clause case.
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1244.454,1246.19,"--That's true, Justice Kennedy."
2004.02-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1270.505,1292.88,"I don't know what case it is, but one of our cases, the argument was precisely made that the statute before us had been enacted by Congress before we had set our face against implied causes of action, and therefore, we should interpret that statute the way we used to in 1969, and we rejected that argument."
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1309.143,1309.393,Justice--
2004.02-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1309.393,1323.882,"Just because Congress in... in the... at the time this statute was enacted believed in the existence of a Supreme Court that would readily find implied causes of action, we... we have to do that for all these old statutes."
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1323.882,1328.135,--Let... let me talk about the cases that I think the principle that you're talking about emerges from.
2004.02-1672,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1341.881,1342.503,But what about Virginia--
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1342.503,1343.579,--in light of the relevant context.
2004.02-1672,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1343.579,1344.155,--What about Virginia Bankshares?
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1344.155,1350.388,"I'm... I'm not sure about Virginia Bankshares, but I don't think it... it states a principle."
2004.02-1672,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1371.897,1380.692,"Well, it... it's arguable except that Mr. Jackson was not discriminated against because of his gender."
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1380.692,1381.928,--That's correct.
2004.02-1672,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1390.062,1392.17,"--exactly like title VII, but--"
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1392.17,1405.089,"--It's... it's written exactly not like title VII, Justice O'Connor, and it's written far more like section 1982, which was at issue at Sullivan, which doesn't have a such individual's limitation."
2004.02-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1436.956,1437.782,And that's where you hang.
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1469.444,1475.305,"But this is... it opens it up to this interpretation, and then you have to look at all the relevant considerations."
2004.02-1672,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1514.315,1522.117,"Mr. Gornstein, what implication would there be, if we took the view of the circuit here, for Federal employment?"
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1530.457,1531.776,That's correct.
2004.02-1672,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1626.968,1629.403,Are punitive damages available under title IX?
2004.02-1672,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1629.403,1631.427,I'm sorry.
2004.02-1672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1642.151,1643.892,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,1646.493,1650.291,"Justice Stevens, may it please the Court:"
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1695.207,1701.439,How often has OCR come to the school district in question under title IX?
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,1702.675,1704.494,--And I would want to suggest--
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1704.494,1704.987,--OCR administers.
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,1704.987,1719.559,"--In 1996, we had a conclusion of an OCR title IX investigation because it dealt with boys' football as it related to related sports offered for girls."
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1755.22,1768.577,How does he differ... how does he differ from the renter in Sullivan who was complaining about the refusal to sell or lease property to African Americans?
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,1779.352,1783.15,"Justice Ginsburg, I offer this one observation."
2004.02-1672,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1851.965,1860.881,"Well, what... what do you make of the... the point that Mr. Dellinger stressed and others have stressed that, in fact, there is no administrative remedy in the real world?"
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,1867.773,1875.286,"Well, again, Justice Souter, no, the funds have not been terminated."
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1880.283,1894.605,"May I ask you with respect to that, is OCR so different from other agencies that have to pick and choose because they simply don't have the resources to enforce?"
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,1912.438,1920.817,"Justice Ginsburg, the only thing that I can say is that on my watch, the number one priority is to keep OCR out."
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1922.841,1923.751,But that wasn't my question.
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,1941.145,1944.76,"--Well, Your Honor, that was something that was recognized in Cannon."
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1947.528,1960.281,"And that was the very reason for recognizing a private right of action because the... the requirement, the anti-discrimination requirement, would be a dead letter if you didn't have people who could enforce it."
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,1960.281,1961.563,"But... but again, stay mindful."
2004.02-1672,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1975.513,2010.436,"Yes, but the... the argument that's being raised is whether we're talking about the person who is listed in the statute as the primary beneficiary of the anti-discrimination statute or whether we're talking about the teacher who blows the whistle and so on... the... the argument is unless you allow this teacher or this whistle blower to... to bring the private action, your statute is a dead letter, that the... that if... if... once you recognize a private action, you've either got to recognize this kind of private action or you can forget the whole thing."
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2019.148,2022.985,"--Justice Souter, let me offer this in two ways."
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2059.188,2063.646,"Well, that's... to say trust me is... is not an answer."
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2085.112,2097.167,"But, Justice Ginsburg, we get back to the point who really benefits because... and especially in this scenario, if the advocate sues and receives the monetary damages, that goes to the advocate."
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2097.167,2114.545,"The... the point is if you say to the school, you cannot retaliate against someone because a complaint has been made, that's a powerful incentive for the school not to retaliate against someone and to do something about the discrimination."
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2114.545,2136.715,"Well, but again, though, Justice Ginsburg, the other side of that would be when under the spending legislation, the school board had a right to know what the terms and conditions of the financial assistance would be, and I respectfully submit to you that there was nowhere on the landscape that--"
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2136.715,2150.954,"Why wasn't it in the regulations of the agency spelled out rather clearly... the... the agency that says, Congress has told us to implement this statute, here are our regulations and our regulations are you don't retaliate?"
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2150.954,2155.002,--But that's a part of the complaint and investigatory process.
2004.02-1672,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.367,2158.679,"The regulations didn't say anything about a private cause of action, did it?"
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2158.679,2159.0,"--No, it did not."
2004.02-1672,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2159.0,2161.562,And the statute didn't say anything about a private cause of action.
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2161.562,2162.344,It's not on the face.
2004.02-1672,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2162.344,2167.545,But the regulation did tell the school not to retaliate in effect.
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2178.774,2179.85,"No, it does not, Justice O'Connor."
2004.02-1672,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2185.916,2189.26,Does it tell us that he was removed as coach?
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2189.26,2189.632,--Yes.
2004.02-1672,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2189.632,2190.458,Does the record tell us that?
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2190.458,2191.573,It... it does say that he was relieved.
2004.02-1672,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2191.573,2195.826,"Can I ask you a legal question, nothing to do with, you know, practicalities?"
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2195.826,2196.319,Yes.
2004.02-1672,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2196.319,2201.975,"But suppose you go back to the very old, bad days of the 1950's in the South, the '60's."
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2246.846,2250.727,"Justice Breyer, in that context--"
2004.02-1672,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2250.727,2251.016,Yes.
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2251.016,2251.759,--I... I would say yes.
2004.02-1672,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2251.759,2252.297,"Yes, of course."
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2252.297,2252.669,But again--
2004.02-1672,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2252.669,2253.206,So therefore--
2004.02-1672,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2253.206,2256.261,Is this a civil rights statute that provides for a private cause of action?
2004.02-1672,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.285,2267.74,--I'd... I'd like to... I'm thinking of various civil rights statutes which make it unlawful to describe... to... to discriminate.
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2331.102,2331.762,--Yes.
2004.02-1672,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2331.762,2341.421,"Once we include this in 1681(a), that's the end of this case because Sandoval then supports the other side."
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2345.303,2352.65,"Justice Breyer, don't we have to consider at some point in time what the congressional intent was?"
2004.02-1672,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2352.65,2354.136,"Well, yes."
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2354.136,2355.251,And again... and I submit to you--
2004.02-1672,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2355.251,2356.077,So you... you go ahead.
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2380.142,2386.048,--And I would want to submit to you interveningly you have had the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
2004.02-1672,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.867,2435.544,"Of course, you say it's not there, but the agencies interpreting the statute thought it was there."
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2437.523,2441.693,--But... but that's an... an investigatory... the administrative enforcement scenario.
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2441.693,2442.519,But it's the--
2004.02-1672,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2442.519,2447.97,"No, but their reading of the statute was that the word discrimination included a retaliation claim."
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2457.608,2460.48,"But don't we go... Justice Stevens, don't we go back to Sandoval?"
2004.02-1672,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.824,2466.674,You cannot use the regulation that goes beyond the meaning of the statute.
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2480.421,2487.479,"But... but again, that's retaliation after someone has filed a complaint with the appropriate office."
2004.02-1672,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2487.479,2490.823,"Well... I mean, Sandoval is very clear."
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2575.49,2581.656,"Well, Justice Breyer, on the face of the statute, I just can't get there."
2004.02-1672,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2625.728,2632.415,We... we can't... you don't base your argument on giving some legal effect to denial of certiorari--
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2632.415,2634.067,"--No, no, I don't, Justice O'Connor."
2004.02-1672,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2634.067,2634.605,--Thank you.
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2634.605,2642.285,But... but to say... I was trying to emphasize was the notice and the mind set of the board when it accepted these Federal funds.
2004.02-1672,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2645.507,2650.996,"It had never anticipated a private right of action, even though it read the Cannon opinion, which was written some 20 years ago?"
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2653.059,2658.798,"--Justice Cannon, your opinion there is going to be around for a long time."
2004.02-1672,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2661.111,2667.427,There were some later cases that cast a good deal of doubt on whether we would apply Cannon anymore.
2004.02-1672,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2667.427,2670.937,But Congress itself has adopted the rule set forth in Cannon.
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2670.937,2686.912,"But... but if I may, but then Justice Rehnquist cautioned very clearly that the Court... in his concurring opinion, that the Court in the future should be extremely reluctant to imply a cause of action absent such specificity on the part of the legislative branch."
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2689.43,2699.09,"--It said in this statute we do, having in mind that title VI would be interpreted in the identical way--"
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2699.09,2699.628,"Yes, ma'am."
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2699.628,2705.943,--title VII... VI proscribing race discrimination in all Federal programs.
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2717.749,2718.575,"Yes, ma'am."
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2726.582,2739.957,"Well, it seems to me that if you're talking about the sixth grade soccer team, realistically the only one who is going to know anything... enough and be brave enough to complain will be the teacher."
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2745.258,2752.754,"--But, Justice Ginsburg, that teacher could easily, if they don't get a positive response from the administration, they can call OCR."
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2752.754,2756.364,"And OCR says, as it usually does, we're too busy."
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2756.819,2757.107,No.
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2757.645,2759.874,Congress didn't give us enough money to do the job.
2004.02-1672,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2759.874,2762.641,Do we know that?
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2769.7,2769.7,--I... I--
2004.02-1672,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2769.7,2775.644,--they may well not have cut off funds because anybody who gets a directive from them will hop to it.
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2775.644,2778.411,"--Justice Scalia, that's exactly it."
2004.02-1672,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2784.522,2789.557,And do they call more than infrequently?
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2789.557,2790.877,All the time.
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2793.728,2795.13,This is your personal testimony.
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2795.13,2795.79,"--Yes, ma'am."
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2797.73,2804.146,There is... there is much testimony on the other side that says we call and call and they don't come.
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2804.146,2809.414,"--Well, I've been in educational law now almost 27 years, representing both teachers and school boards."
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2818.619,2822.789,How many title IX complaints in your... in your experience?
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2824.98,2825.351,Two.
2004.02-1672,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2825.351,2825.889,Two?
2004.02-1672,2,34012,kenneth_l_thomas,,2826.716,2828.535,In 26.

2004.02-1672,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2945.69,2953.947,You... you don't concede the point that it is the role of this Court to determine whether agencies are inefficient or not--
2004.02-1672,3,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2953.947,2954.669,Of course not.
2004.02-1672,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2954.669,2963.235,--and if they are inefficient to... to raise up private attorneys general to... to fill the void?
2004.02-1672,3,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2963.235,2975.867,"Of course not, Justice Scalia, and... and the Court knows very well from my brief that our position is that when you're talking about implied rights of action, this Court has made clear, in the cases leading up to Sandoval, culminating in Sandoval, that these sorts of policy considerations really are not relevant."
2004.02-1672,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2975.867,2976.133,All right.
2004.02-1672,3,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2982.433,2985.505,We do not contest the validity of the regulation.
2004.02-1672,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2985.505,2985.777,Okay.
2004.02-1672,3,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,2992.919,2993.828,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2004.02-1672,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2993.828,2994.571,What... what is it doing?

2004.02-1672,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3078.33,3086.625,"Is it because no remedy is available, or is it because there are just very few instances giving rise to such?"
