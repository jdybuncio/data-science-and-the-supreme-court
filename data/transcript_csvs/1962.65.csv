1962.65,0,27912,henry_r_rolph,,14.777,16.54,May it please the Court.
1962.65,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,390.197,390.891,Mr. Rolph --
1962.65,0,27912,henry_r_rolph,,390.891,391.253,Yes.
1962.65,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,391.253,405.728,"How about -- if we have to draw this connection, when the -- we haven't (Inaudible)"
1962.65,0,27912,henry_r_rolph,,405.728,406.218,No.
1962.65,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,406.218,410.02,"You would assume that you will reach that, is that right?"
1962.65,0,27912,henry_r_rolph,,410.02,413.427,"Thank you for raising that point, Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1962.65,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,500.621,500.833,Mr. --
1962.65,0,27912,henry_r_rolph,,500.833,500.966,Now --
1962.65,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,500.966,514.148,"-- Rolph, I know you've said that -- and it isn't before us, no question here, the situation of apportioned damages, but on -- if the lower court was right, will it be different -- would it be a different problem if --"
1962.65,0,27912,henry_r_rolph,,514.148,514.467,Yes.
1962.65,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,514.467,516.48,-- for apportionment?
1962.65,0,27912,henry_r_rolph,,516.48,531.118,"Well, the -- it's accepted Mr. Justice Brennan that issue was determined in the lower court that both vessels were equally at fault, so then the mutual fault damage rule comes into play."
1962.65,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,564.943,576.538,"Well, but my question though is, would -- there was -- wouldn't it probably any difference that it were not the case of mutual fault or where there have been a propionate allocation of fault greater to one than to the other?"
1962.65,0,27912,henry_r_rolph,,576.538,602.11,"Well, of course, under the mutual fault collisions historically in this country, Mr. Justice Brennan, as contrasted with the law of England, if both vessels are found to be at fault, there's only one rule that can be applied under the historic decisions of this Court including the Chattahoochee and the Atlas, and the Juanita, and these many other decisions at -- the (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.65,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,602.11,602.838,I know -- I know that.
1962.65,0,27912,henry_r_rolph,,602.838,603.317,Yes.
1962.65,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,603.317,608.541,"What I'm trying -- I'm not making myself clear, and I shouldn't be wasting your time that the issue wasn't here."
1962.65,0,27912,henry_r_rolph,,634.451,634.791,The (Inaudible) --
1962.65,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,634.791,637.292,"Whatever it assigned to the Federal Government, couldn't it?"
1962.65,0,27912,henry_r_rolph,,637.292,637.62,Yes.
1962.65,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,640.546,640.822,I know.
1962.65,0,27912,henry_r_rolph,,640.822,642.521,-- Mr. Justice Brennan.
1962.65,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,646.122,647.023,"I know, okay."
1962.65,0,27912,henry_r_rolph,,647.023,673.264,"Now, significantly the Government in its brief before this Court in stating the question prefers to ignore now the mutual fault collision divided damage rule and states the question this way, whether Section 7 (b) of the Federal Employer's Compensation Act which states the liability of the United States under the Act for injuries to its employees shall be exclusive."
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3290.386,3295.452,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3344.516,3351.984,"That sounds strikingly familiar to me here, as though I have written it in a dissent in Ryan."
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3351.984,3355.896,"The thrust of our argument, Your Honor, is precisely that."
1962.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3505.641,3507.978,May I -- I don't want to interrupt you.
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3512.206,3512.483,Yes.
1962.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3512.483,3517.953,-- precisely the number one argument that was made in Ryan?
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3522.557,3522.885,Increase.
1962.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3522.885,3529.057,-- liability because the statute had said that was all.
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3529.057,3534.597,"I think that's so, Your Honor, yes."
1962.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3752.685,3753.121,"Yes, but they have also --"
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3753.121,3753.937,Now --
1962.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3753.937,3760.48,-- what the United States (Inaudible)
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3760.48,3762.105,"Well, that's a different part of the --"
1962.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3762.105,3763.766,If he recovers.
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3763.766,3764.277,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3765.83,3770.469,"So, they'll consider no (Inaudible) in the case, in this particular case."
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3770.469,3783.266,"Well, I'd like to get to the next set of provisions in the statute which Congress put there too at the same time it was doing this back in 1916 which has bearing on that."
1962.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3837.402,3841.431,Was that true in the Harbor Workers' Act?
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3841.431,3848.239,"Section 33 is a companion provision, I think it is true there also, Your Honor."
1962.65,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3890.535,3901.489,"But Mr. Mondello, is there an excerpt over the amount of payment that's gotten into -- that the worker gets from it?"
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3901.489,3919.293,"The provisions of the reimbursement sections are that while he can get the recovery, yes, the amount of the recovery less the expenses it cost him to get it are applied for the benefit of the United States as a credit against any payments that may have to make in the future."
1962.65,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3919.293,3923.34,"But the surplus had prevented him, the worker itself."
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3923.34,3923.876,"Well, there can't be any --"
1962.65,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3923.876,3925.142,(Inaudible)
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3925.142,3929.225,"I'm sorry, Your Honor I don't -- there can be no surplus after that."
1962.65,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3929.225,3932.801,If it's a third party?
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3932.801,3945.977,"The typical situation covered by the reimbursement provision is that the employee recovers from the third party, makes reimbursements of United States precisely as was under this case."
1962.65,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3958.786,3961.487,(Inaudible)
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3961.487,3969.974,"Yes, because the Government's liability for compensation persists along as the disability does and he may well take it up in the future years since."
1962.65,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3969.974,3981.349,But the Government -- they were not entitled to (Inaudible)
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,3981.349,3989.358,"Well, we start with the ideas that he gets the surplus and he gets it immediately, yes."
1962.65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4093.985,4097.908,Does the Longshoremen's Act have a similar provision for a credit (Voice Overlap)?
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,4097.908,4100.154,"Yes, it does Your Honor."
1962.65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4115.196,4137.18,"I can make just as good an argument for the purpose of the provision was to start United States off a plea that the consequences, the factions that the act made for the United States, namely the waiver of the institutions, things like that -- they're getting back to this and say, â€œYou cannot be liable to the employee in this situation if we didn't see what their part is."
1962.65,1,16607,anthony_l_mondello,,4170.573,4181.801,"My difficulty with that Your Honor is that what Congress did, it put in to the reimbursement provisions and it didn't seem to have this design in doing so."
1962.65,2,27912,henry_r_rolph,,5683.365,5687.296,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'll be very brief."
1962.65,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5802.489,5812.147,"Mr. Rolph, what was the argument in the -- in the -- the accruing of the damages in the rule?"
1962.65,2,27912,henry_r_rolph,,5812.147,5827.986,"Well, it's historic doctrine, it goes way back and the purpose of it was to prevent the injustices that would accrue if the straight rule of contributory negligence were applied."
1962.65,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5892.322,5895.803,Wouldn't the -- when did we -- when did this Court have --
1962.65,2,27912,henry_r_rolph,,5895.803,5896.567,This Court first --
1962.65,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5896.567,5896.719,-- the doctrine though?
1962.65,2,27912,henry_r_rolph,,5896.719,5909.0,-- recognized it formally in the -- where it was defined in the case of the Catharine in 1854 and it was further recognized by the Court in the North --
1962.65,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5909.0,5914.288,When was it that the -- that the English rule was rejected?
1962.65,2,27912,henry_r_rolph,,5914.288,5935.422,"Well, subsequently after the adoption by this Court of the mutual fault doctrine of divided damages and later on in history, the British courts evolved a system of apportionment of damages based on degrees of fault."
1962.65,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5945.926,5948.0,What year was the Chattahoochee?
1962.65,2,27912,henry_r_rolph,,5950.579,5963.17,"Well, Chattahoochee Mr. Justice Brennan was decided in connection with construction of the Harter Act and I should have it here --"
1962.65,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5963.17,5963.659,Don't bother.
1962.65,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5964.208,5968.291,What does that review -- what should that point?
1962.65,2,27912,henry_r_rolph,,5968.291,5977.89,"Well, what I was looking for Mr. Justice Goldberg is to see if we had here the date when the decision was handed down."
1962.65,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5988.459,5989.063,Wouldn't --
1962.65,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5989.063,5991.441,1899 was the date of the Chattahoochee.
1962.65,2,27912,henry_r_rolph,,5991.441,5991.477,(Inaudible)
1962.65,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5991.477,5997.042,What was it -- did employees' injuries were included in the hearing?
1962.65,2,27912,henry_r_rolph,,5997.042,5997.282,They were --
1962.65,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5997.282,5998.932,-- or they were just damaged because --
1962.65,2,27912,henry_r_rolph,,5998.932,6013.903,They've always been considered -- employee -- any personal injury or loss of life has always been considered to be a proper item of damages in a mutual fault collision to be added into the total damages resulting from the collision.
