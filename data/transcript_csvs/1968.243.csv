1968.243,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1768.636,1770.204,At page 422?
1968.243,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1770.204,1772.952,421 Mr. Justice.
1968.243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1799.647,1800.59,At pages what?
1968.243,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1800.59,1802.793,424 Mr. Justice.
1968.243,2,39980,richard_j_maclaury,,3702.001,3709.428,"If the Court please, we do not ask here for a special rule for newspapers."
1968.243,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3739.085,3740.878,Competition in what?
1968.243,2,39980,richard_j_maclaury,,3740.878,3749.455,Competition Mr. Justice between the news and editorial composition between the two newspapers.
1968.243,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3749.455,3753.943,What about the competition in seeking advertisements -- in selling advertisements?
1968.243,2,39980,richard_j_maclaury,,3753.943,3754.856,The competition --
1968.243,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3754.856,3756.574,And circulation?
1968.243,2,39980,richard_j_maclaury,,3756.574,3764.457,"Yes sir, the competition is seeking advertising, circulation and pricing that has -- there is no competition under this --"
1968.243,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3764.457,3766.359,There is none.
1968.243,2,39980,richard_j_maclaury,,3766.359,3771.99,-- under this arrangement just as there would be under any merger.
1968.243,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3794.104,3807.739,"That in each one, say what they want to but each one agree with one another, there will be no competition between them in the circulation and the other department?"
1968.243,2,39980,richard_j_maclaury,,3807.739,3807.888,That is --
1968.243,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3807.888,3809.185,That's suppressed?
1968.243,2,39980,richard_j_maclaury,,3809.185,3830.983,"That -- that as the situation is today but Mr. Justice I would not agree that it has been suppressed because in 1940, although these witnesses testified as laymen, the owners of Star and Citizen that they intended to eliminate competition as they say that was the testimony of laymen."
1968.243,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3851.755,3867.546,"Well, why can you say it -- I'm asking -- I want to get the argument, how can you say it's not suppressed by its advertising; distribution is when they are as one?"
1968.243,2,39980,richard_j_maclaury,,3867.546,3873.718,I would like to answer that by first going to 1940 and then 1965 if I may Mr. Justice.
1968.243,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3873.718,3877.68,It's alright but you'd till get to the question whether he made this finding.
1968.243,2,39980,richard_j_maclaury,,3889.167,3889.665,There is no question --
1968.243,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3889.665,3892.898,Which where their money coming in and going out the --
1968.243,2,39980,richard_j_maclaury,,3892.898,3903.515,"There is absolutely no question Mr. Justice Black that they're after this agreement, there was no competition whatsoever on the circulation or advertising level."
1968.243,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3931.355,3934.318,But then when all of it -- they were getting some advertising money.
1968.243,2,39980,richard_j_maclaury,,3934.318,3935.094,They were getting some.
1968.243,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3935.094,3936.234,And some circulation.
1968.243,2,39980,richard_j_maclaury,,3936.234,3939.18,They were getting some but not sufficient to keep that company liable.
1968.243,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3939.18,3949.515,"Oh, but even if they were not they didn't -- then they didn't have the fact of the other freedom to control themselves with reference that have been part of their business."
1968.243,2,39980,richard_j_maclaury,,3949.515,3953.345,"After this operating agreement, that is correct Your Honor."
1968.243,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3991.055,3995.22,"Well, is that (Inaudible) -- was there a finding of Section 7?"
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3995.22,3997.195,There was a finding on Section 7 at --
1968.243,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3997.195,4003.721,"Well, could there have been an (Inaudible) failing company indication?"
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4003.721,4008.815,Section 7 issue Mr. Justice White its related only to the year 1965.
1968.243,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4020.176,4024.613,"So, your claim was in effect that there was a merger in 1940?"
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4024.613,4025.571,Yes.
1968.243,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4025.571,4028.914,That merger would've been subject to Section 7?
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4028.914,4031.497,"Sect -- yes, but it was not challenged under Section 7."
1968.243,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4036.087,4047.059,"Well, do you have to get by the failing company -- you would have to -- to get by -- it's quite clear there was a merger in 1940, you would have to get by Section 7?"
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4047.059,4060.089,"If they had challenged it under Section 7, yes but actually the burden on the Government in bringing this case under Section 1 was far greater it would've been had they challenged it under Section 7."
1968.243,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4157.537,4175.703,"Do you think that the -- that there was a necessity for the Court to conclude that in 1965, neither paper was failing in order to find that there was a violation of Section 7?"
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4175.703,4177.493,"No, I do not Your Honor."
1968.243,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4193.089,4196.178,"Yes, but there was a finding of a Section 7 violation."
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4196.178,4196.412,Yes.
1968.243,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4207.281,4209.247,I understand that.
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4209.247,4212.033,And we make -- we do not contest that finding.
1968.243,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4212.136,4214.218,So that neither company was failing at that time.
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4214.218,4216.677,"No, neither company was failing at that time."
1968.243,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4217.53,4223.399,"And if it's taken apart, if the companies were separated it -- right now they wouldn't be a failing company right now."
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4223.399,4224.46,No.
1968.243,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4357.427,4365.517,Mr. MacLaury what stage of the game where these findings made after all the evidence was in on the Section 2?
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4365.517,4366.212,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.243,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4383.792,4387.441,And this was -- what have been litigated was the Section 2 claim.
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4387.441,4390.391,Just the Section 2 issue and the Section 7 issue.
1968.243,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4390.391,4393.075,"Because there have been a summary judgment on the Section 1, is that correct?"
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4393.075,4394.462,That's correct Your Honor.
1968.243,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4394.462,4419.659,"Mr. MacLaury, may I ask one question, I didn't quite understand what you said if the court should sustain the District Court in abrogating those provisions of the operating agreement that then this should be a new ball game and there ought to be the opportunity before the due, either to dispose of Citizen or dispose of Star?"
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4419.659,4420.034,That's correct.
1968.243,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4420.034,4421.086,I -- that's right?
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4421.086,4421.77,That's right.
1968.243,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4421.77,4434.498,"Now what is it that -- if we sustain the District Court as to the provisions of the operating agreement, what now precludes you having that option, the divestiture?"
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4434.498,4444.488,"Well, because the District Court's order orders the owner of Citizen to dispose of Star and does not give them that choice that they must dispose of Star."
1968.243,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4444.488,4445.492,"Oh, I see."
1968.243,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4453.292,4453.882,That's right.
1968.243,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4453.882,4454.26,Or of Star.
1968.243,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4454.26,4455.134,Or of Star.
1968.243,4,39980,richard_j_maclaury,,4455.134,4455.881,That is correct Your Honor.
1968.243,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4455.881,4461.675,"I see, alright."
