2014.13-6827,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.138,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-6827, Holt versus Hobbs."
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,8.279,12.247,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-6827,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,42.108,57.54,"If this prisoner wanted to have a full beard, would RLUIPA require that the prison administration allow him to do that?"
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,57.54,60.024,"Well, some courts have said yes."
2014.13-6827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,72.877,86.84,"Mr. Laycock, the problem I have with -- with your client's claim of -- of religious requirement is the religious requirement is to grow a full beard, isn't it?"
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,108.331,111.174,"Well, the religious teaching is a full beard."
2014.13-6827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.448,130.089,"Well, religious beliefs aren't reasonable."
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,140.678,145.878,"--He's -- he's supposed to have a full beard, but a partial beard is better than none."
2014.13-6827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.487,151.236,Okay.
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,156.734,157.515,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-6827,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,157.515,160.623,"But I -- I mean, you're really just making your case too easy."
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,179.319,183.256,"Well, most of the cases seek a full beard or full hair."
2014.13-6827,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,196.625,204.075,"Well, but we have to decide this case pursuant to a generally applicable legal principle, and that legal principle is one, it seems to me, that demands some sort of a limit."
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,222.411,229.298,"Well, I think, you know, the limit has to be determined on a record in a case that is seeking a -- a longer beard."
2014.13-6827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.183,244.605,Yes.
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,262.114,264.208,They're not going to come in that order.
2014.13-6827,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,285.025,289.587,And then what has this Court said about the standard under RLUIPA with reference to prisons?
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,303.863,308.437,"Well, your only prison RLUIPA case is Cutter and that was a constitutional challenge."
2014.13-6827,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,308.437,308.812,Yes.
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,313.748,316.871,It was clearly intended to replace Turner.
2014.13-6827,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,318.746,320.808,And what is the test insofar as you're concerned?
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,320.808,330.758,"The test is compelling interests and least restrictive means and deference must be administered in the context of that standard, not instead of that standard."
2014.13-6827,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,356.997,359.997,Could you put your answer in practical terms.
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,384.689,388.514,"Well, maybe Judge Gorsuch's opinion in the -- in the Tenth Circuit."
2014.13-6827,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,421.081,423.188,And the standard is other similar risks.
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,433.809,437.87,They allow -- they allow a quarter inch for medical beards.
2014.13-6827,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,467.391,483.835,There are -- there are some religious practices -- I think that the Sikh practice of not cutting hair ranks as a religious practice.
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,497.768,499.518,"Yeah, that may be."
2014.13-6827,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,520.274,531.535,"Mr. Laycock, you're relying on this case really on -- on felt intuitions that this couldn't possibly advance the State's interest."
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,569.223,578.516,"I think they have to show material -- this is a phrase in the government's brief, and I think it's helpful -- a material effect on their security situation."
2014.13-6827,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,595.274,596.727,Teeny tiny isn't enough.
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,607.567,614.236,"--Well, I think material or significant may be the best we can do."
2014.13-6827,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,679.71,696.015,"Well, the -- the problem with deference, I think, is that if you accept the fact that there is a point at which it does become a problem, the full beard, Sikh with the -- the turban, then you -- then there's the question of how you draw the line."
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,709.416,727.534,"Well, we haven't taken deference out of the equation, but when we only ask for half an inch and when they offer so little evidence and no -- no examples and no consideration of solutions elsewhere, they haven't done anything to deserve deference."
2014.13-6827,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,738.185,742.357,"Could you -- you know, we seem to be arguing rules."
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,776.327,777.576,No.
2014.13-6827,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,791.618,804.252,So what happens -- I know the magistrate judge or the judge below here said that it was preposterous to think that this prisoner could hide anything in his 1/2-inch beard.
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,822.37,827.854,"Well, the State might be able to show that's a different set of facts, you know."
2014.13-6827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,844.658,847.157,"You're arguing for all 1/2-inch beards, right?"
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,847.609,848.046,--Yes.
2014.13-6827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,848.046,856.889,"--We've got to assume all 1/2-inch beards are -- are okay if -- if God tells you to grow them, right?"
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,856.889,858.262,"Well, you know, I think that's right."
2014.13-6827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,863.182,871.383,"Well, really subject -- I mean, whose -- whose burden is that?"
2014.13-6827,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,871.522,875.052,It is the State's burden that is explicit in the statute.
2014.13-6827,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,923.454,924.157,"Thank you, Professor."
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,932.124,934.607,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-6827,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,954.068,970.702,"Is it your position that if, what, 90 percent of other -- of other institutions similar to the one at issue in the case permit the practice that is challenged, it cannot be a compelling interest?"
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,971.964,972.529,No.
2014.13-6827,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.253,1001.594,I understand that.
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1005.391,1006.312,"--Well, the relevance is that--"
2014.13-6827,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1006.312,1018.245,"--Are we going to say whenever an institution comes up here that has a restriction which other institutions of the same type do not have, or at least a large majority of them, it's ipso facto bad?"
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1018.245,1019.15,--No.
2014.13-6827,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1044.234,1045.699,"Well, why does it have to show a distinction?"
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1051.81,1057.08,--I think a little more will be required under the compelling interest test.
2014.13-6827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1059.478,1064.273,"Well, suppose a State just simply says this: You know, actually, there's nothing special about our prison."
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1091.168,1091.293,--No.
2014.13-6827,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1111.161,1113.379,Where are you -- how do you--
2014.13-6827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1113.379,1114.269,Go ahead.
2014.13-6827,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1114.269,1119.564,--How do you reconcile deference with the strict scrutiny that the statute requires?
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1119.564,1131.808,"Well, this Court in Cutter, for instance, explained that the strict scrutiny -- when deciding what was required by strict scrutiny, context matters."
2014.13-6827,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1131.808,1133.074,"Well, there are -- there are two questions there."
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1147.458,1165.687,"I don't think there's any dissonance between the idea of strict scrutiny, which is not a degree of proof required, it is a question about whether you've identified a compelling interest and shown that what the -- the burden is the least restrictive means, that can be shown by preponderance of the evidence."
2014.13-6827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1192.831,1201.126,"But I do share Justice Alito's confusion on this point, because all the things that you're talking about are things that we would never allow in the typical strict scrutiny context."
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1213.401,1216.695,"--Well, in this context, remember, the statute doesn't say strict scrutiny."
2014.13-6827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1224.71,1225.689,Didn't this Court establish--
2014.13-6827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1225.689,1226.067,It sounds like statute.
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1226.067,1227.532,It's -- it's similar.
2014.13-6827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1247.541,1249.836,Do you think it's the same standard in both of those statutes?
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1249.836,1252.662,"For the large part, yes."
2014.13-6827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1254.881,1257.018,The language is completely the same.
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1257.018,1257.341,--Yes.
2014.13-6827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1271.828,1277.276,But I thought we actually used that in the recent RFRA case to suggest something about RFRA as well.
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1277.81,1282.557,That's because RFRA's definition of religious exercise incorporates the RLUIPA definition.
2014.13-6827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1290.006,1300.676,"--Mr. Yang, before you sit down, your brief lists a whole series of cases on page 14 that were decided before RLUIPA."
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1319.463,1325.758,I think the analysis is different now.
2014.13-6827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1336.176,1345.641,"So they would -- all those that we approved, correspondence limitations, all those would have to be looked at anew under the RLUIPA standard."
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1345.641,1360.35,"--I think that's right, because if you were to go back to pre-RLUIPA case law, no one would doubt that a State could, in fact, prohibit a 1/2-inch beard under the prior constitutional standards."
2014.13-6827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1367.122,1369.678,Where -- where are you on the full beard?
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1369.678,1372.177,"--On the full beard, I think there might well be a difference."
2014.13-6827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1388.287,1396.038,"Well, assuming that's the case, assuming they have some evidence of concealment or whatever in -- in a full beard, what do we do?"
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1402.352,1403.305,"Well, I think--"
2014.13-6827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1403.305,1406.417,"What I'm doing, it's the same question I asked your friend--"
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1406.417,1406.428,--Yes.
2014.13-6827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1406.778,1408.056,--which is what's the legal principle?
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1415.718,1428.811,"--I think that's exactly right, that there is going to be a bound, a range of reasonableness that courts will find appropriate to defer to predictive judgments by expert officials in various contexts."
2014.13-6827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1429.169,1430.547,Can I ask a similar question?
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1467.748,1470.394,"--Well, maybe not necessarily always the second."
2014.13-6827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1475.915,1478.143,"But I'm suggesting the costs are going -- you know, they come out of someplace."
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1478.143,1479.806,"At some limit, that -- that's true."
2014.13-6827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1486.809,1486.855,So how do we do that?
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1486.855,1487.674,--Excuse me?
2014.13-6827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1487.674,1488.56,So how do we do that?
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1488.56,1490.413,"Well, I think, again, it's going to depend."
2014.13-6827,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1501.47,1502.108,"Well, wait a minute."
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1525.038,1525.505,"--It's not me, Your Honor."
2014.13-6827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1543.373,1544.435,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-6827,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1544.435,1545.091,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2014.13-6827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1545.091,1558.335,Mr. Curran.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1558.335,1559.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-6827,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1574.204,1585.45,"On altered appearance, I thought it was conceded that at intake, the prison could take a photograph clean -- clean shaven?"
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1585.45,1588.573,"Your Honor, that -- that is not on the record."
2014.13-6827,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1600.71,1601.022,I don't understand what you just said.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1601.022,1606.208,"--Well, there -- there is two points in altered appearance."
2014.13-6827,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1614.157,1614.579,"Right, right."
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1614.579,1618.547,Our testimony on that was -- was not engaging in the question.
2014.13-6827,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1622.482,1628.604,Why do you need record testimony on -- on a question such as that?
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1661.857,1663.652,"--You know, I agree, Your Honor."
2014.13-6827,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1665.293,1666.307,This is not an evidentiary matter at all.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1666.307,1679.396,"--The -- the point of identification within the prison, though, is an evidentiary matter on this record, and let me get to that, because it's very important to understand this in our prison's unique environment."
2014.13-6827,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1772.827,1775.263,But you have no example of that ever happening.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1775.263,1780.76,"I have no example of a -- well, let me say this."
2014.13-6827,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1790.913,1792.302,Examples -- examples of what?
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1792.302,1799.222,"Of interprison identification problems, of -- of -- with an escape type; you know, in the prison, a beard being used to thwart identification."
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1801.143,1807.454,Do you have that same concern with the prisoners who have a very short beard for medical reasons?
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1807.454,1809.438,--No.
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1860.557,1864.057,How long is -- how long are the whiskers when that is done?
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1864.057,1868.194,--So -- so they may take barber call maybe twice a week.
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1874.958,1875.973,You're saying that they're completely clean-shaven?
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1875.973,1880.049,"I'm saying that they are clean -- I mean, what is clean-shaven?"
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1883.969,1886.172,"Clean-shaven is somebody like you, all right?"
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1886.172,1886.436,--Right.
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1892.622,1895.964,And that's how they -- and that would satisfy the medical problem?
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1895.964,1897.167,--That's correct.

2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1898.152,1898.261,That's right.
2014.13-6827,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1928.218,1930.06,So are you telling us that the quarter inch is wrong?
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1939.307,1941.275,"--The policy states that, Your Honor, and it's confusing."
2014.13-6827,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1957.845,1983.586,"What about the argument that it's -- never mind the least restrictive means, you have no comparable rule about hair on one's head, where it seems more could be hidden than in the beard, where hide something in a beard and it might drop out."
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,1983.586,1985.179,"Yes, Justice Ginsberg."
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2017.071,2017.837,Why is that?
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2030.05,2032.502,"In our professional judgment, it is, yes, that's correct."
2014.13-6827,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2054.776,2061.913,Mr. Laycock characterizes your position as being essentially all deference all the time.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2066.584,2081.467,Deference would be inappropriate when the explanation offered on the witness stand in the record of compelling interest and the least restrictive means is -- neither comports with logic or common sense.
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2120.623,2132.203,"Can I go back to -- just so I'm clear in my head -- to two compelling, two compelling interests, one in identification, one in contraband."
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2132.203,2133.281,"That's right, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2133.281,2135.665,Is there a third or a fourth or are those the only two?
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2135.665,2137.211,Those are the only two we are talking about here.
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2137.211,2143.609,"And in this case, the magistrate judge has said it's preposterous to think that you could hide something."
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2146.764,2149.707,"Let me take on the ""preposterous"", if I might."
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2203.761,2222.567,"--It is somewhat hard for me, given what you just said, to figure this out, because there may be in my mind some situations with some prisoners where a half inch beard won't hide anything, and with others that it will."
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2230.891,2230.991,--I think--
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2230.991,2249.056,"So let's assume that what the magistrate judge meant -- which is what I assumed; you have a different read -- that it's preposterous to think this prisoner could hide something in his beard, but not preposterous to think that others might not be able to do so."
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2249.056,2251.634,--The--
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2251.634,2253.352,Assume my hypothetical.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2253.352,2254.585,--Right.
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2265.046,2265.343,No.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2269.002,2269.283,--Right.
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2269.283,2282.982,--to look at the request of the individual and assume that the application of whatever rule you create can't have an exception as to that individual.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2282.982,2288.339,"On this testimony, Your Honor, you pointed out that the testimony was a half inch beard, you can't see the skin."
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2297.6,2299.147,Yes.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2316.596,2316.813,--Yes.
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2325.825,2327.028,In this case.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2327.028,2327.339,"In this case, yes."
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2356.735,2358.359,"Now, on the change of looks, I'm still not sure."
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2366.48,2367.262,Sure.
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2367.262,2368.449,They leave the compound.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2370.416,2379.039,"So they're in a barracks situation, they've got 30 to 50 or so in a room, and there are four barracks on each side of a common roof."
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2394.235,2396.203,Are these unprotected fields?
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2396.203,2397.983,--There is guards there watching them.
2014.13-6827,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2434.625,2444.481,"Did you establish that Arkansas is unlike all these other States, that the other States don't have barracks, they don't have people going out to work in the field?"
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2457.99,2459.363,"Two things in response to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-6827,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2499.129,2502.112,What about the Federal prison system?
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2505.128,2511.812,Both the Government and the Petitioner cite a link to the regulation in their briefs and that is to minimum security status inmates.
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2511.812,2518.81,"When a prisoner goes out in the field and then wants to come back to the barracks, are the prisoners wearing an ID; is that correct."
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2518.81,2518.918,That's correct.
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2518.918,2521.606,And does it say which barracks that prisoner is supposed to go to?
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2521.606,2522.245,Yes.
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2529.539,2531.709,Does the ID have a picture on it?
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2531.709,2532.491,Yes.
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2547.876,2553.342,I'm just trying -- I'm having difficulty envisioning what you're -- the scenario that you're -- you're suggesting.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2564.697,2565.307,--Shaves--
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2565.307,2568.462,"While he's out there, he shaves, then he wants to come back and go into barracks B."
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2581.893,2582.658,--No.
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2605.852,2610.32,So he has to find somebody who also looks like him from barracks B.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2610.32,2613.616,"--I would think that's how that scenario would work, but that's -- that happens."
2014.13-6827,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2624.174,2624.439,One of the hazards is razors.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2635.683,2647.82,"The -- we have tamper-resistant safety razors that are issued and they keep them in their personal possession, and then they -- when they're through with them, they can turn them back in on a one-to-one basis and get a new one if they exchange an old one."
2014.13-6827,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2647.82,2661.486,"Does your standard -- how, if at all, does your standard differ from what it would be if we had no RLUIPA?"
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2672.342,2676.433,"Well, I have to kind of get to the different elements."
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2750.559,2760.227,"What about this whole issue about cost in the statute 2000-cc-3(c) that says,"
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2772.395,2773.629,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2773.629,2776.316,So isn't -- it's anticipating--
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2776.316,2776.649,It is.
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2776.649,2777.674,--that there might be expense.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2777.674,2778.347,That's exactly right.
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2796.587,2797.681,Cost.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2797.681,2798.9,"--much of a cost issue, right."
2014.13-6827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2798.9,2800.101,It -- it doesn't implicate the cost issue.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2800.101,2801.351,Right.
2014.13-6827,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2801.351,2803.991,"Mr. Curran, I'm not sure what your position is."
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2818.048,2819.639,No.
2014.13-6827,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2825.794,2828.794,You think something can be concealed within a 1/2-inch beard.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2828.794,2834.587,"--I think that on this record that something as small as a SIM card, which the Court found compelling, could."
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2837.258,2847.754,"As far as concealment is concerned, what -- what is the difference between a 1/2-inch beard and hair on the head that's much longer?"
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2847.754,2860.404,"Well, the testimony on the record was that your common sense view that longer hair is a better way to conceal contraband, I think, is a right one."
2014.13-6827,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2876.634,2882.724,"I take it there's no example, not a single example in any State, that allows beard policies where somebody did hide something in his beard."
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2882.724,2887.878,"I think that's mostly right, Your Honor."
2014.13-6827,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2888.972,2889.816,So we have no example.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2889.816,2890.362,--There is no example.
2014.13-6827,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2890.362,2891.424,So there is no such examples.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2938.735,2939.346,As far as--
2014.13-6827,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2939.346,2940.449,Do I have that right?
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2940.449,2941.415,--As far as I can tell.
2014.13-6827,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2949.29,2949.599,No.
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,2959.025,2966.231,"--The problem, Your Honor -- Justice Breyer, with -- with this scenario is these kind of things are buried in incident reports among thousands of other things."
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2998.005,3011.969,"Well, as far as searching a beard is concerned, why can't the prison just give the inmate a comb, you could develop whatever kind of comb you want, and say comb your beard, and if there's anything in there, if there's a SIM card in there or a revolver or anything else you think--"
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,3018.7,3024.932,"You know, I suppose that's a possible alternative."
2014.13-6827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3031.85,3036.943,"Do you really think that would be difficult, to say here's a comb, comb your beard?"
2014.13-6827,2,56104,david_curran,,3036.943,3040.396,--I don't think it would be that difficult.
