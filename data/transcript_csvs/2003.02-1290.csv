2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,9.91,13.375,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1290,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,88.753,98.662,"Mr. Kneedler, in your view, are there any instrumentalities of the United States that you think could be considered a person under the Sherman Act?"
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,98.662,107.783,"Well, I...  I think that there are no instrumentalities that are constituent parts of the United States Government itself that could...  that could be held liable."
2003.02-1290,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,121.075,133.147,"Of course, I guess the court whose judgment we're reviewing thought that the change in the structure of the Postal Service affected the nature of that instrumentality."
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,133.147,137.877,"It...  it...  it did, but the...  the court of appeals was wrong on that."
2003.02-1290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,160.501,173.876,"Mr. Kneedler...  Mr. Kneedler, but I don't think in that case there was...  the question was raised whether the Alaska Railroad was an agent of the United States that would...  would carry the immunity of the United States."
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,173.876,196.288,"Well, the...  the...  it was...  the Court regarded it as an...  as an instrumentality, and in fact the...  the Court there recognized that the railroad and the officials of the Government responsible for supervising the railroad could be sued under the APA, and that, therefore, there had been a waiver of sovereign immunity to that extent, and to the extent of allowing injunctive relief."
2003.02-1290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,205.659,209.58,I didn't think it was a contested issue in...  in that case.
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,209.58,223.326,"It may not have been contested, but it...  but it...  the Court certainly addressed that question and then went on to hold that as an instrumentality of the United States, the...  the railroad was not subject to suit under the antitrust law."
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,223.326,226.01,Is the Postal Service subject to the Administrative Procedure Act?
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,226.01,226.836,It is not.
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,279.963,284.338,So you say it carried forward the...  the essential governmental character.
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,303.841,306.63,In...  in a...  in a limited sense.
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,308.449,309.73,"Well, I'll...  I'll qualify it."
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,312.414,313.49,"No, I...  I..."
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,313.49,315.098,"which has...  which has certain obligations, yes."
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,325.583,344.365,"In the...  in the description of...  of how the Postal Service was to be operated carrying forward, the...  the Congress repeatedly referred to the Postal Service as...  as a governmental function, a public service to be operated in a business-like way."
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.732,359.847,Insulated from the Government.
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,359.847,361.516,Not...  but by...
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.516,366.967,"You're...  you're saying on the one hand it's part of the Government, but on the other hand, what Congress wanted to do was to insulate it from the Government."
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,366.967,367.46,No.
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.175,381.661,Are they...  are they removable by the President?
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,381.661,383.436,They're removable for cause.
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.436,383.973,For cause.
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.973,386.202,Just like the heads of independent agencies.
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,386.202,395.779,"Yes, but...  but certainly the other independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and agencies like that are part of the United States Government performing a governmental function."
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.779,400.404,"Congress never said that they were supposed to operate like a business, which was the purpose of the Reorganization Act."
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,400.404,411.466,"Actually, in the...  in the text of the act itself, there...  there is...  there is not an express directive that the Postal Service will be operated like a commercial entity."
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,432.976,445.691,"It...  it did...  it did retain that monopoly and...  and the Government's position here is that the Postal Service has the power to extend that monopoly into fields that the Government did not specifically confer upon it, right?"
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,455.6,457.624,It is not a person within the meaning of the antitrust laws.
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.624,464.577,So it can...  it can go ahead and extend the monopoly conferred by statute beyond the...  the narrow context granted by Congress.
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,464.577,468.277,That is not a...  that is not a new feature of the...  of the Postal Service.
2003.02-1290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,492.387,505.429,"Suppose there...  suppose there were an actionable violation of the antitrust laws and there was a conspiracy between two private suppliers, and the Postal Service, through some of its high officers, joined that conspiracy."
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,511.456,513.602,I...  I'm not sure about that.
2003.02-1290,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,550.427,552.778,Is the private express statute still in effect?
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,552.778,564.089,"It is, it is, and that has...  that has not been changed, and the Court discussed that in the California Board of Regents case and other...  and other decisions of this Court."
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.799,672.618,"What happens...  I'm sorry, go on."
2003.02-1290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,672.618,682.938,"Mr. Kneedler, is this...  section 201 of Title 39 says, there is established as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States the United States Post Office."
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,688.055,689.086,That's part of the reorganization.
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,759.925,767.727,"If I get into a car accident with a...  with a postal delivery truck, do I sue the United States under the Federal tort claims?"
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,767.727,768.486,"Yes, yes, you do."
2003.02-1290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,785.188,788.326,"Mr. Kneedler, where does the money come to pay the judgment?"
2003.02-1290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,788.326,788.903,Is it...
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,788.903,792.125,"Out of the...  out of the Postal Service fund, but that is a fund in the Treasury."
2003.02-1290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,793.406,795.469,But it isn't the general judgment fund?
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,795.469,812.809,"No...  no, it's...  no, it's not, but...  but there are other...  other situations in which appropriated funds from a particular agency are used to reimburse the judgment fund if there's a particular appropriation set aside for that purpose, so this is not a unique feature of...  of the...  of the Postal Act."
2003.02-1290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,852.933,860.075,Could the United States sue...  bring an antitrust suit as plaintiff on behalf of the Postal Service?
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,860.075,861.599,We...  we believe it could.
2003.02-1290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,892.601,907.546,"Under this sue-and-be-sued clause, is it your position that there must always be a Federal statute authorizing the suit before the post office has any substantive liability?"
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,907.546,910.163,"As a general rule, yes."
2003.02-1290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,930.663,936.274,So the sue-and-be-sued clause does have some substantive force in some other cases?
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,936.274,953.53,"It's...  it's been...  it's unclear because back when they were first put in the...  in the statutes, the...  the separation of a...  the existence of a waiver of sovereign immunity and the existence of a cause of action were...  were not separated the way they are today."
2003.02-1290,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,972.728,975.7,Does the Post Office have the power of eminent domain?
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,975.7,987.217,"It does, it does, and it has...  it...  it carries forward the power to investigate postal offenses, to...  to...  with appropriate authorization, to search the mails."
2003.02-1290,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,987.217,988.703,There's a lot of...
2003.02-1290,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,988.703,990.644,What about...  what about inverse condemnation?
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,995.39,1005.383,"I don't know that the question has arisen, but I...  I would assume that a...  a suit could be brought against the United States under the Tucker Act on the same theory that I mentioned with respect to a breach of contract by the Postal Service."
2003.02-1290,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1005.383,1006.043,Mr. Kneedler...
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1006.043,1014.792,"Don't...  before we get off of eminent domain, don't...  don't a lot of state public utility entities have the power of eminent domain?"

2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1016.195,1017.848,So that really doesn't determine what...
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1017.848,1020.448,"Well, I...  I think it's part of an overall pattern."
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.448,1022.556,"And they're subject to the Sherman Act, of course."
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1022.556,1022.793,Right.
2003.02-1290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1079.109,1095.251,"It seems to me, Mr. Kneedler, this is an argument that you don't have an antitrust violation here, but we're concerned with the problem of whether you had a classic violation, say they agreed with somebody else on the prices they would charge for advertising the Olympics or something like that, where you had a clear...  here you don't have it clear."
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1099.049,1102.764,"Well, except...  except to this extent."
2003.02-1290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1116.056,1119.111,"But what about a breach of...  infringement of patents, for example?"
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1119.111,1123.569,There's...  there's express authorization for suing the United States for...
2003.02-1290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1123.569,1125.305,And infringement of copyrights and so forth?
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1125.305,1125.964,Same...  same thing.
2003.02-1290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.072,1137.481,"Supposing there was a...  one of these antitrust violations that involved abuses of patents in order to extend a monopoly or something like that, that could be a classic antitrust violation."
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1140.082,1146.648,There...  there might be...  there might be remedies under some of the statutes mentioned here.
2003.02-1290,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1179.091,1184.171,What if...  what if the Post Office buys a lot of paper from somebody and doesn't pay for it?
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1187.636,1191.434,There would be an alternative remedies.
2003.02-1290,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1210.482,1214.447,And that could be...  that sort of an action could be brought under the Contract Disputes Act?
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1214.447,1214.735,Yes.
2003.02-1290,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1223.28,1241.568,Would there be an...  some alternative remedy to the antitrust law if the Postal Service decided to use its profits from the monopoly business in effect to subsidize predatory rates in the package delivery business in order to put UPS out of business?
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1241.568,1251.061,"The way...  the way Congress addressed that was to subject the Postal Service to the jurisdiction of the Postal Rate Commission, and all..."
2003.02-1290,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1251.061,1252.63,"Well, let's assume they go along with it."
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1262.745,1274.633,"Well, I would...  I would...  if the...  a decision...  it's a complicated mechanism the way the Postal Rate Commission interacts with the Postal Service, but there is a provision for judicial review."
2003.02-1290,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1285.119,1285.285,What would be the...
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1285.285,1286.234,rates and classifications.
2003.02-1290,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1286.234,1288.713,What would be the substantive basis for the review?
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1288.713,1302.459,"Under...  under the Postal Reorganization Act, the provisions beginning in...  in section 3601 of the act address rate-making and classification, and there are specific standards there that the Postal Rate Commission and the Postal Service must adhere to."
2003.02-1290,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1302.459,1308.525,And...  and would it eliminate this possibility of predatory lowing...  lowering rates for...
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1308.525,1309.89,They...  they are designed to.
2003.02-1290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.326,1350.59,"Of course, this only becomes a real problem when the Postal Service turns a profit on its monopoly business, which it has not yet succeeded in doing, has it?"
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1350.59,1362.767,"Well, and...  and it's not...  over the long term, over the long term since the Postal Reorganization Act, I believe that the Postal Service is within about a billion dollars of breaking even."
2003.02-1290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.655,1392.366,"Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a basic question I just kind of forgotten that I thought I knew about, but I thought the Postal Service had a monopoly of the business of delivering letters and packages, and that these competing services are only allowed to exist by some special privilege granted by the Postal Service."
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1392.366,1392.771,Yes.
2003.02-1290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1395.083,1395.909,"But not for parcel, I see."
2003.02-1290,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1395.909,1396.381,Yes.
2003.02-1290,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1471.533,1472.748,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1474.588,1481.193,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1530.234,1540.719,"You're saying then that the Cooper decision doesn't affect your argument, because the...  the Congress has separated the Post Office Department from the...  from the executive?"
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1540.719,1541.545,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1551.41,1552.896,"Well, neither of those are quite in point."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1552.896,1561.524,"Neither are involved in separate cause of action, but both involve this Court's recognition that the Postal Service is not the same as United States and should be treated differently."
2003.02-1290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1561.524,1568.129,But what do you do with the statutory language that it's an establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States?
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1568.129,1581.382,"Well, I think it is an establishment of the executive branch, and it keeps some kind of connection to the United States, and so, for instance, Congress evidently cared about the fact that, given the monopoly given over letter mail, that there would be some tie."
2003.02-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1592.732,1595.333,"There isn't any Postmaster General anymore, is there?"
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1595.333,1613.166,"Well, there...  there is, Your Honor, in terms of the individual who's so-called under the statute the executive official of the...  of the United States, and that individual is to...  is also a member of the Board of Governors of the Postal Service and is to direct and execute the business operations of the Postal Service."
2003.02-1290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1613.166,1613.332,How is he selected?
2003.02-1290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1613.332,1614.159,By the Board of Governors?
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1614.159,1616.51,"Chosen by the Board of...  yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1655.164,1658.453,It doesn't differentiate though from the Meyer case?
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1658.453,1673.974,"No, Your Honor, and indeed, we think though that the...  these four factors together amply demonstrate that this is a...  there is a congressional intent that the Postal Service be considered a separate, distinct entity that can qualify under the term, person, in antitrust laws."
2003.02-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.205,1707.037,"But Meyer says you have to have something more than a sue-and-be-sued clause, that you have to show that there's a cause of action available."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1713.066,1724.212,"I agree, Your Honor, and indeed it's the fact that the antitrust laws say that every person should be subject to the anti-competitive measures, or pro-competitive measures, in...  in the statutes."
2003.02-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1724.212,1733.378,"Well, yes, but the...  that was true...  they said that in the Cooper case too, that person, and the Cooper Court said, no, the United States is not a person."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1733.378,1741.923,"That's right, Your Honor, but I think the Cooper case must be looked at in the structure of the decision itself, because the Cooper Court was very clear to limit its decision."
2003.02-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1749.558,1757.071,"But certainly after the Cooper decision, it was clear that the United States could not be a defendant either, was it not, as well as not be a plaintiff..."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1757.071,1758.929,"Well, it didn't matter Your Honor, because there was no waiver of immunity."
2003.02-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1758.929,1759.55,"Well, answer my question, will you?"
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1759.55,1768.095,"I believe that it was clear, because...  but, again, I think that nobody tried to avail themselves of that remedy because the United States had not waived its immunity."
2003.02-1290,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1780.643,1797.567,"Didn't the Court say in Cooper, the reason why we're not letting the United States be a person as plaintiff, because if we did that it would follow like the night day that they would be a person as a defendant, and we certainly don't want them to be a person as a defendant?"
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1797.567,1798.682,So that's right in the...
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1798.682,1798.982,"Well, we have no quarrel..."
2003.02-1290,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1798.982,1800.168,That's right in the opinion.
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1814.657,1845.121,"I agree that it's in the opinion, Your Honor, but this Court, in Georgia v. Evans, and this Court in Pfizer, made clear to cast the Cooper decision in the light of the fact that it was a narrow decision, predicated not specifically on that point, Your Honor, but rather on the notion that there was an election of remedies, the fact that the United States could sue to seize property under the act, the United States could pursue criminal penalties under the act, and that linguistically, the United States doesn't seem to fit in within the terms, an organization or association existing under the law as the United States."
2003.02-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1845.121,1849.374,"Well, the...  what, the Postal Reorganization Act was 1970?"
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1856.267,1859.034,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
2003.02-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1869.52,1871.544,"That's no longer the position of the department, is it?"
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1871.544,1871.832,That's correct.
2003.02-1290,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1912.949,1913.321,"Well, it's an..."
2003.02-1290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1913.321,1917.119,It didn't...  excuse me...  I didn't think it had a mandate to make money.
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1918.893,1921.494,"Well, it has a statute...  it...  it's...  it's a rough balance."
2003.02-1290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1924.345,1930.039,But it...  but it's unlike most profit-making institutions that are primarily engaged in trying to make as much money as they can.
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1930.039,1935.035,"That is correct, Your Honor, but in the non-postal activities, the only objective is to make money."
2003.02-1290,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1963.809,1981.103,"But even...  even when it is, I take it the object of the money that it makes is essentially to break even, maybe break even and a little bit more, on...  on the mail delivery operation, which the statute itself recites as being a sovereign responsibility of the United States."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1981.103,1982.096,"Well, I think that's..."
2003.02-1290,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1982.096,1985.068,"So, I mean, that's...  that's a long way from General Motors."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,1985.068,1996.79,"I think it...  it's...  there is no shareholders, for instance, looking for a profit, but the goal of the Postal Service in these other areas of business, whether it's the package business or the greeting card business, is to make money."
2003.02-1290,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1996.79,2015.449,"Well, it is to make money, but it is to make money in order to subsidize a particular activity, and I don't think...  maybe I'm missing something...  but I don't think there's an indication that there's a mandate there to maximize profits to in...  in effect subsidize the rest of the Government."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2015.449,2018.959,"Not...  not the rest of the Government at all, because there is a segregated fund."
2003.02-1290,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2029.279,2038.278,"And that monopoly business is described in the statute as being the discharge of a sovereign obligation of the United States, isn't it?"
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2038.278,2039.143,Absolutely.
2003.02-1290,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2061.313,2064.572,What is...  what is the...  what is the organizational form of this business?
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2065.891,2068.205,"It's a corporation-like form, Your Honor, and indeed..."
2003.02-1290,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2068.205,2069.608,"Well, but it's not a separate corporation."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2069.608,2070.601,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1290,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2073.489,2074.809,Is it...  is it a partnership?
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2074.809,2093.362,"It's...  it's a board of directors-type organization with the Board of Governors serving as a type of Board of Governors...  as a board of directors...  and the Board of Governors, as mentioned earlier, chooses the head or the chief executive officer of, or the Postmaster General, of the Postal Service itself."
2003.02-1290,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2093.362,2101.437,"But the structure, I take it, is unlike anything that one would find in...  in a...  in a private profit-making organization."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2101.437,2101.93,That's correct.
2003.02-1290,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2101.93,2103.294,"It's not a corporation, not a partnership."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2103.294,2104.37,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2104.37,2127.897,"I mean, it is...  has a distinct structure, but I think that the Congress that launched the Postal Service in the business and suggested that the Postal Rate Commission, the APA, and the Federal acquisition regulations wouldn't apply, would not have wanted then the Postal Service to use any kind of monopoly powers to have a tying arrangement with an entity such as, you know, Emery Air Freight or Federal Express, it wouldn't wanted to have..."
2003.02-1290,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2127.897,2135.039,"Well, why isn't this the kind of policy judgment that we ought to leave to Congress to make explicitly?"
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2153.328,2161.38,"I think, Your Honor, that the Congress has already made that judgment by suggesting that the Postal Service have the right to be sue and be sued, suggesting the Postal Service..."
2003.02-1290,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2161.38,2163.731,"Well, I thought we had already discussed that."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2173.102,2173.762,Sure.
2003.02-1290,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2173.762,2175.043,take another step...
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2175.043,2175.665,Right.
2003.02-1290,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2175.831,2176.408,beyond that.
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2176.408,2177.151,"Sure, Your Honor."
2003.02-1290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2206.667,2214.636,"But you...  you...  you concede that before the Postal Reorganization Act, the answer to the question would be no?"
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2214.636,2215.296,Absolutely.
2003.02-1290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.296,2221.323,"So you...  you have to...  I mean, you're...  you're not writing on a blank slate."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2230.157,2231.187,"I...  I agree, Your Honor."
2003.02-1290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2231.187,2245.965,"Given that the Postal Service was not subject to the antitrust laws before, something so fundamental happened in 1970 that it is now a person under the antitrust law."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2246.808,2247.717,I fully agree with that.
2003.02-1290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2247.717,2248.089,your burden.
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2248.089,2261.38,"I full agree with that, and I think we can discharge that burden if you look at the fact that the Postal Service is financially independent, it's administratively independent, it doesn't have to comply with the pro-competitive measures and the Federal acquisitions regulations, it has a sue-and-be-sued clause."
2003.02-1290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.38,2267.242,"But its employees, are its employees subject to the Taft-Hartley law, or...  or...  or are they like...  like Federal workers?"
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2267.242,2285.036,"They are the only employees in the entire government to my knowledge that must comply with the Taft-Hartley law, and indeed, Congress specified that it must comply within the law, because it wanted them to act more like a business and not have this restrictures of other organizations within the United States as they...  following the fellow labor relations authority, Your Honor."
2003.02-1290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.036,2292.505,So...  so...  would...  would their employees be members of the American Federation of Governmental Employees or other unions?
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2292.505,2294.628,"I believe it's the American Postal Workers Union, Your Honor."
2003.02-1290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2294.628,2295.189,Postal workers union?
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2295.189,2295.743,Yes.
2003.02-1290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2310.466,2318.306,"But of course, the Reorganization Act itself specified that they'd be subject to Taft-Hartley, did it not?"
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2318.306,2318.76,That's correct.
2003.02-1290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2320.497,2324.416,So why didn't it specify that they would be subject to the Sherman Act?
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2324.416,2325.985,Because...
2003.02-1290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.985,2327.76,"You see, I...  I don't think that helps you, I think it hurts you."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2327.76,2328.836,I don't...
2003.02-1290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2328.836,2338.906,"It...  it is a significant feature that...  that the...  their employees are subject to Taft-Hartley, but that...  that is more than answered by the fact that it says so in the Reorganization Act."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2342.415,2345.676,"Well, I think it's important to think about what the Postal Reorganization Act does say."
2003.02-1290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2371.682,2374.45,"Yeah, but there's one...  one sticking point that...  running through my mind."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2379.401,2381.796,"We agree that they're part of government, Your Honor."
2003.02-1290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2386.254,2387.164,And is a sovereign.
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2387.164,2389.311,"And...  yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.623,2403.429,"Of course, if you're right, they're subject to criminal liability under the Sherman Act too."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2403.429,2406.029,"Well, so are states theoretically, as well as cities."
2003.02-1290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2414.74,2417.341,A criminal case with the United States against the United States Postal Service.
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2417.341,2424.605,"Well, I don't think that's likely to happen, Your Honor, but I think it's important that this...  this waiver allows the Postal Service also to vindicate its own interests, right."
2003.02-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.004,2438.23,But Congress could have said the Postal Service is authorized to sue and omitted the be-sued clause.
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2439.261,2440.004,That...
2003.02-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.004,2441.324,in which there would have been no waiver.
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2441.324,2442.522,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2457.465,2464.07,"Well, to say launch into the commercial marketplace, they're basically selling stamps and nobody else is selling stamps."
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2465.927,2486.649,"Well, I think it's now for the monopoly business, Your Honor, but the launching with...  with respect to the package delivery business, the greeting card business, the fact that they are sponsoring Lance Armstrong's bicycling team, these are all the areas in which the Postal Service has decided to venture outside of its mandate, and it's...  the danger is allowing the Postal Service to extend its monopoly power into these new fields."
2003.02-1290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2486.649,2486.899,Mr. Krent...
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2498.538,2500.396,No...  no...  if I understand your...
2003.02-1290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2500.396,2500.767,Isn't that right?
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2500.767,2501.51,"That's not right, Your Honor."
2003.02-1290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2505.308,2507.72,It has no...  in greeting cards and so forth?
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2507.72,2508.463,No jurisdiction.
2003.02-1290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2509.085,2510.571,So is it...  it...  and it's free?
2003.02-1290,1,27418,harold_j_krent,,2518.577,2528.775,"Oh, overall, Your Honor, but the Postal Rate Commission has no jurisdiction whatsoever on the Postal Service's actions with respect to greeting cards, bicycling gear, and the package delivery business."
2003.02-1290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2534.309,2550.489,"So if in...  in the greeting card business, they decided to go into an agreement with three other companies, Hallmark and Smith's greeting cards, and they were to fix their prices at $14 a greeting card, which seems about right nowadays..."
2003.02-1290,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3157.667,3161.875,"Several points, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1290,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3304.333,3304.705,So greeting cards?
2003.02-1290,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3304.705,3312.318,"It does not over greeting cards, but the non-postal functions of the Postal Service constitute less than 1 percent of the revenues of the...  of the Postal Service."
2003.02-1290,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3329.574,3334.942,But the fact that it's only...  the fact that it's only 1 percent means they're only liable under the antitrust laws for 1 percent of their business.
2003.02-1290,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3334.942,3352.775,"No, I think...  I think it shows that...  that...  that the predominant character of the Postal Service is as it always has been, and these...  these other services are really in most ways incidental to...  to postal services like greeting cards and...  and that sort of thing."
2003.02-1290,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3352.775,3355.126,But they're the services that they want to bring suits under.
2003.02-1290,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3355.126,3355.58,That's...
2003.02-1290,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3355.58,3358.402,This...  this is...  this is not...  this is not that.
2003.02-1290,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3365.324,3366.643,That's the curious thing about this suit.
2003.02-1290,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3375.642,3390.214,"And in procurement, and in procurement in particular, Congress has treated the Postal Service like all other...  all other Federal agencies under the Contract Disputes Act, particularly with respect to the disputes at issue here."
2003.02-1290,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3447.323,3449.263,Do they really sell biking gear?
2003.02-1290,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3451.698,3456.528,I...  I'm not sure whether they...  I...  I don't know whether they sell biking gear.
