1973.73-482,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.522,"We’ll hear arguments next in 73-482, Michigan against Tucker."
1973.73-482,0,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,16.46,19.422,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-482,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,146.324,150.355,Was he told -- was he told that he had a right to have a lawyer then and there?
1973.73-482,0,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,150.355,154.059,"No, he had a right to an attorney but not at -- in no specific words then and there."
1973.73-482,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,154.059,155.603,Oh.
1973.73-482,0,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,155.603,165.347,"During the interrogation that followed, the defendant told the police that he had obtained the noticeable scratches on his face from the flarings of a goose that he had killed."
1973.73-482,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,222.537,224.34,This was city of Pontiac?
1973.73-482,0,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,224.34,230.103,"This was a sheriff’s department case in Pontiac Township, just outside the city of Pontiac."
1973.73-482,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,384.261,400.91,"The Court had decide, however, that the exclusionary aspect does not apply to live human beings who are ready and able and willing to come in and testify then, we don’t need to render these problems about retroactivity, do we?"
1973.73-482,0,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,400.91,405.842,"No, we do not Mr. Chief Justice and that takes me immediately to the second issue which I think is --"
1973.73-482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,405.842,412.616,"Before you get to that Mr. Patterson, you -- really your first one is that Johnson versus New Jersey be overruled, isn’t it?"
1973.73-482,0,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,425.827,426.197,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,429.647,432.501,In which you have Miranda would be retroactive?
1973.73-482,0,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,432.501,438.66,"No, Your Honor, I think the -- when I said overrule, I should have use a activity date as opposed to a trial date."
1973.73-482,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1471.301,1475.371,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-482,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1853.389,1858.142,"Can you cite me any case, a kidnapping where this happened?"
1973.73-482,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1858.142,1859.538,"No, I just --"
1973.73-482,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1859.538,1861.5,There never has been such a case?
1973.73-482,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1861.5,1864.202,I don’t know whether there has or has not Mr. Justice Marshall.
1973.73-482,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1865.956,1866.934,Possibility then.
1973.73-482,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1866.934,1883.592,"Well, it would clearly come within the import of a holding of the Court’s below and one could only evoke the words of Mr. Justice Marshall in Miranda -- in his Miranda dissent when he suggested that one is entitled to feel astonished that the Constitution --"
1973.73-482,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1883.592,1886.016,Miranda case I didn’t decide it --
1973.73-482,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1886.016,1891.231,"I’m sorry, I mean Mr. Justice Powell.[Laughter]"
1973.73-482,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1936.19,1940.385,What is the first aspect?
1973.73-482,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1959.907,1971.913,"I think the Court, the case of the coerced confession would be more difficult because there we would be dealing with police conduct that would be offensive in and off itself regardless of what use is made of statements."
1973.73-482,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1990.676,2005.005,"Was it in fact applied to its fullest extent to use your words, back in the pre-Miranda days when the Court thought that what was applicable here was the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1973.73-482,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2005.005,2009.29,"I believe that it was, but I have not been able to find cases to that effect."
1973.73-482,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2032.377,2033.859,"Well, that is the rule in England, I know."
1973.73-482,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2033.859,2035.904,"Yes, it is."
1973.73-482,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2036.202,2039.02,Of course England doesn’t have our Constitution?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2458.551,2461.698,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2524.218,2525.706,In what page is that you are talking on?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2525.706,2529.638,In the Wong Sun case where this Court –
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2529.638,2532.181,"Who the, a witness?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2532.181,2544.48,The sole distinction between this case and Wong Sun is that the verbal evidence which was rejected in Wong Sun was that of the appellant rather than the witness.
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2545.438,2548.395,"It isn’t completely at parallel, is it?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2548.395,2549.926,"Not completely, that’s correct."
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2706.632,2714.269,"Would you then make a distinction between witnesses who appeared voluntarily and those who appeared under subpoena, under the compulsion of a subpoena?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2714.269,2723.598,Such a distinction would have no bearing on the purposes of the exclusionary rule because it is has no bearing under relationship between the primary legality and the discovery of the evidence.
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2723.598,2731.456,"Well, I wondered then why -- what -- I was waiting for the point that you were going to make as to the distinction between the two."
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2731.456,2746.68,My point was that the distinction which is proposed by petitioner is not appropriate because the voluntariness of the witness is irrelevant given this Court subpoena power.
1973.73-482,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2746.68,2751.865,You have drawn a lot subpoena witness and voluntary witness as significant.
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2758.734,2759.954,"No, certainly not, certainly not."
1973.73-482,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2781.523,2782.927,Subpoenaed or are not?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2782.927,2783.451,I am sorry?
1973.73-482,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2783.451,2785.429,Was this witness subpoenaed?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2785.429,2798.184,"I have -- at present I do not know although I would assume that he was as matter of practice in State Courts, subpoenas are sent out prior to trial."
1973.73-482,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2812.838,2818.146,Well if I understand the State and the Government they say this witness might have volunteered?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2818.146,2820.638,There’s no basis whatever in the record of this case.
1973.73-482,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2820.638,2826.917,"I did not say in the record but I said he might have and of course that’s true, is it not?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2826.917,2827.821,It is possible.
1973.73-482,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2827.821,2828.851,Alright.
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2828.851,2833.107,It was stipulated however that there was no independence source.
1973.73-482,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2833.107,2850.068,The stipulation as I understand it is that they probably -- the state learned of this witness only through the statement made by Mr. Tucker which statement was made in violation of his Miranda rights.
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2850.068,2851.323,That’s correct.
1973.73-482,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2851.323,2852.507,That’s a given in this case.
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2852.507,2858.412,That’s correct and the petitioner has never alleged that there was an independent source for the discovery of the witness' identity.
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2858.412,2867.867,Do you think that includes entirely the possibility that it as with -- as happens in many cases that witnesses volunteer?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2867.867,2874.352,"It fully does not preclude entirely, but because of the primary illegality the burden necessarily shifts to the prosecution."
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2874.352,2876.54,Your point is the defense is purely speculative?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2876.54,2879.393,That’s correct.
1973.73-482,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2985.107,3002.414,I suppose if the question were made to turn solely on the reliability of the type of evidence you can make a pretty good argument that physical or demands to that evidence tends to be more reliable in many respects than eyewitness evidence or at least testimonial evidence.
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3002.414,3007.431,"In certain circumstances, I am not sure I follow your call Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1973.73-482,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3007.431,3032.822,"Well, if you are addressing yourself and I do not think perhaps you are, but you at least comment and said yes, if we are talking about how reliable is the evidence being excluded, I should think a case could be made for the fact that the gun on which fingerprints were might be a good deal more reliable than a witness who recalls a particular encounter with the defendant."
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3032.822,3046.122,I am not relying on such a distinction and in fact this Court’s exclusionary rule cases do not consider the reliability of the evidence as a factor and assessing whether or not to apply the exclusionary rule.
1973.73-482,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3117.582,3125.923,Or should you got a plain violation of the Fifth Amendment the man being compelled to testify against himself.
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3127.833,3130.163,"Well, in this case there is admitted violation of Miranda."
1973.73-482,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3130.163,3135.928,"Yes, but not of the compulsory Self-incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3135.928,3151.242,"This Court's holding in Miranda was that in the absence of all the warnings required therein the compulsion inherit in interrogation process could not be met, so that any statement given was for constitutional purposes compelled."
1973.73-482,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3151.242,3158.299,How do you define a holding?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3158.299,3170.426,"I do not think that I am a position to argue Holding versus the victim, and I do not think it is appropriate because even if Miranda was not decided on constitutional grounds, this Court has never required a violation to be constitutional."
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.426,3194.638,If the -- what do you use against him is on his words or his submission but some non testimonial objects then the question is how far you going to extend the fruits doctrine as a rule to implement the basic purpose.
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3194.638,3197.902,That’s correct and it is my position that --
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3197.902,3199.813,So what is the argument?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3213.552,3215.343,If there was independent source for the discovery of the gun.
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.343,3227.423,"No, no, No, no there is not independence source, coincidently it came from the defendant but the gun is found and offered in evidence and it is connected to him by evidence independent of any question."
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3227.423,3229.385,Such as a finger print I would --
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3229.385,3231.127,A finger print or --?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3231.127,3237.682,"Or ballistics, that would still be a direct and immediate result of a constitutional violation over his rights."
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3237.682,3240.566,But it is not offering his words?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3240.566,3241.28,That’s correct.
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3257.506,3261.0,(Voice Overlap) itself is prophylactic rule?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3261.0,3262.268,Similarly in a prophylactic rule.
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3262.268,3274.831,And so now you want to put -- so you are suggesting you should have a prophylactic rule on a prophylactic rule to be sure and get all the fruits in order to make the prophylactic rule more prophylactic?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3274.831,3287.989,"In order for Miranda to be affective, there must be remove any incentive to violate it and if a police officers is able to use in Court, verbal evidence which is directly derived from a violation --"
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3287.989,3289.602,Isn’t he does using the verbal evidence?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3289.602,3293.071,"Certainly, the testimony of the witness."
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3293.071,3294.838,But that's not his witness.
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3298.266,3308.515,His testimony which was obtained -- it is testimony which was obtained solely and directly as a result of a statement elicited from the defendant in violation of Miranda.
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3308.515,3313.178,The question is still though how far do you carry the fruits doctrine?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3313.178,3324.95,Certainly and I think that this Court has consistency limited the application of the fruits doctrine to those situations where the deterrence aspect would be met.
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3348.702,3350.907,You’ve got into some hypothetical analogy.
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3402.731,3406.061,On the basis of the hypothetical as you pose it Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3415.953,3418.846,You say that the cross examination could come in?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3418.846,3421.559,In that case there will be no relationship.
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3431.238,3466.619,"Let me make another variation in the hypothetical and the question I'll put you on this hypothetical is, would you extend the rule that you are not contending forward to this situations, suppose a kidnapping case, a kind that has been mentioned before occurs and the police have some word that the kidnapped victim maybe in a particular house, group of buildings, and they go to the house without a warrant."
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3494.829,3505.471,"On the basis of the facts that you have hypothesized, the question I feel incapable of giving a definitive answer."
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3509.539,3516.52,"Well, I am assuming and I think that my hypothesis that the police conduct was illegal, but they finally got --"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3516.52,3523.735,"If there was independent source for the discovery of that victim then of course, witness testimony would be admissible."
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3523.735,3525.504,How admissible?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3525.504,3526.275,"Yes, however --"
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3526.275,3532.298,"She would not be able, she or he would not be able to testify that just this man and this man are the --"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3532.298,3539.846,"However, I do not think that that would be result in your case because since kidnaps are normally for the purpose of ransom."
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3561.124,3566.682,Not withstanding the illegal manner in which the witness was found?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3566.682,3572.8,Because that did not lead the police to the existence and identity of the witness.
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3777.224,3785.549,"Are those things are traditionally reached by cross examination, in motion by us additives?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3785.549,3794.775,"Certainly but how the police came to find the witness is not something which maybe reached by cross examination, so that the statement that --"
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3794.775,3804.949,I thought you were linking up the attitudnal factor with the ultimate risk of letting this person testify?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3804.949,3818.18,Those factors go to the weight of the admissi -- to the weight of evidence but not to its inadmissibility because they have no bearing on the constitutional principles at stake.
1973.73-482,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3841.516,3847.706,You referred several times to Smith and Bowden test is -- I haven’t reread that.
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3862.39,3863.136,That’s correct.
1973.73-482,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3863.136,3876.453,"And secondly, it was emphasized that this was unlike gun or the county eleven this was human being and that the elements of the violation and so on were came into admit in different case."
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3876.453,3877.482,That’s correct.
1973.73-482,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3877.482,3882.314,"Now, when you were talking about the Smith and Bowden test, what are you talking about?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3882.314,3888.311,I think that one of the problems which the courts that have attempt to apply the test have found themselves in is that they have not --
1973.73-482,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3888.311,3894.722,What do you mean by the test by the Smith and Bowden test?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3894.722,3900.896,Distinguishing live physical fruits on the basis of voluntariness of the witness' decision to testify.
1973.73-482,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3919.437,3931.361,"Well it is not per se rule and since it is not, they are will be always be difficulties in its application, isn’t that right, to varying factual situations?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3931.361,3956.75,"I think the difficulties here have shown themselves however to be of such magnitude that the test has been unworkable and I think that for this court who adopt it would besides undercutting the established principles of exclusionary rule, would -- the court would adopt a test which this Court concede today on the basis of the test or the cases which apply the test is an unworkable test."
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3956.75,3963.877,"Now, you try the cases that have held that it was unworkable or it is that, are you expressing your own analysis of it?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,3963.877,3969.466,"I believe that the – no, I have said to my brief, I have not talk about it here."
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3999.52,4001.885,And the excluder admits?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4001.885,4007.535,The evidence in that case was suppressed.
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4007.535,4018.25,How do you distinguish the testimony that was admitted in Wong Sun that was obtained from Wong Sun himself?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4018.25,4028.421,"Well, in that situation Mr. Wong Sun had been arraigned by a magistrate and had come back voluntarily several days later after having had --"
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4028.421,4041.435,"Yes, but they didn't -- they had no idea that he was connected with this crime until they exploited the information they got from Blacky Toy in an illegal search?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4041.435,4041.944,That is correct.
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4041.944,4045.692,"In order to find Wong -- to know about Wong Sun, they did it right then and there."
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4058.005,4076.877,"That goes to a distinction I think between the position of a witness, who has no alternative of not coming into court and testify, and a person who has a potential dependence, such as Wong Sun who after being arraigned then came in and this Court held that his decision to testify was sufficiently remote --"
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4076.877,4080.908,I do not think it will run the other way?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4080.908,4083.691,A witness has no choice not to testify.
1973.73-482,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4089.885,4094.945,"Against self-incrimination, the same way a defendant can?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4094.945,4104.96,"Yes, but I am distinguishing between the situation of an accomplice witness who has a privilege and a witness who is not an accomplice, who does not have the privilege."
1973.73-482,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4104.96,4114.283,"Well, but the reason bu -- the reason for which both the defendant and the witness have a privilege is the same, it's a privilege against self-incrimination, isn’t it?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4114.283,4119.267,But in situation of a witness to a crime who is not himself a suspect.
1973.73-482,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4125.31,4131.112,"Well, but in either case it is based on a notion of self-incrimination."
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4139.488,4148.152,I don’t believe at all your point.
1973.73-482,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4189.551,4203.505,"Do you think the decision of a Court of Appeals here isn’t some harm to law enforcement suppressing this particular evidence and not just going back to a new trial situation, but in fact letting this guy go scoot free?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4203.505,4211.612,I see no harm the law enforcement and requiring the police to gain -- in permitting the police to gain no evidentiary advantage as a result with their own illegality.
1973.73-482,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4211.612,4215.885,"So, you say the decision of the Court of Appeals here doesn’t represent any harm to law enforcement?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4215.885,4218.165,Certainly.
1973.73-482,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4218.165,4224.192,This so even though the illegality was not established until after?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4224.192,4232.224,"Well, unless this Court overrules Johnson, then this case must be due in the context of a Miranda violation which took place after Miranda."
1973.73-482,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4232.224,4237.794,Do you regard Johnson is out of line with the Linkletter and some of the other retrospectivity cases?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4237.794,4242.628,"I think that – well, I would urge this Court not to reconsider Johnson."
1973.73-482,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4242.628,4245.317,But you'd have to.[laughter]
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4248.258,4248.547,Yes.
1973.73-482,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4298.847,4302.363,Let me follow through with one more question.
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4322.433,4343.454,"What this Court found in Miranda, I submit is that application of the old due process test had shown itself to be so incapable of protecting the privilege that the integrity of the trial process was in jeopardy."
1973.73-482,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4467.864,4472.057,"Well, that -- so the issue there was whether or not there had been a waiver?"
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4472.057,4472.539,That’s correct.
1973.73-482,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4474.982,4495.483,"My question was, and I asked your colleague on the other side that he know of any case, anywhere really, where Miranda had been fully complied with in every respect and there was a finding that the statement was coerced."
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4522.86,4531.696,"Unless one can imagine the situation of a police officer utilizing a suspect and at the same time, reciting the warnings."
1973.73-482,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4531.696,4533.274,Yes.
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4533.274,4534.038,While doing that.
1973.73-482,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4534.038,4541.952,(Inaudible) after giving him the warnings?
1973.73-482,2,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,4541.952,4547.169,I’ve thought of that.
1973.73-482,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4653.608,4657.284,Mr. Gribbs.
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,4657.284,4660.1,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-482,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4755.165,4759.1,"I’m not quite sure, which one do you say is the only addition of Miranda?"
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,4759.1,4759.569,The last one.
1973.73-482,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4759.569,4760.373,The fourth one?
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,4760.373,4761.432,"Yes, the Attorney is Court."
1973.73-482,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4900.23,4914.9,"Apparently, what you’re talking about, Mr. Gribbs, affects this defendant's giving the name of the alibi witness."
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,4917.869,4920.334,I’m here speaking solely -- Excuse me?
1973.73-482,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4920.334,4923.049,"Are you speaking of the generality of cases, not this case?"
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,4923.049,4931.54,"No, I’m speaking solely to the rationale and the basis in the continuation of Miranda itself which is the second issue presented to the Court and not the “fruits” doctrine."
1973.73-482,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4931.54,4937.504,"And then you will bring those backgrounds into this case, in the facts of this case?"
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,4937.504,4939.042,"I can, if it please the Court [Voice Overlap] --"
1973.73-482,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4939.042,4940.105,"But that is not vital, don’t you think so?"
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,4940.105,4949.198,-- [Voice Overlap] and our brief is limited only to the Miranda itself as being directly attacked as being too restrictive and that bit and that rule should be modified.
1973.73-482,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4949.198,4954.39,"In other words, you’re not necessarily arguing for affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals?"
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,4954.39,4964.259,We join in his general request with the Bar Association as such did not brief it and do not speak to it and we’re speaking to Miranda only.
1973.73-482,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4965.516,4970.352,"Well then, if you’re speaking on that level and perhaps you will help me out."
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,4972.271,4974.853,And that’s sir what I was about to speak to.
1973.73-482,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4974.853,4976.281,"Well, do you think it’s a --"
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,4976.281,4977.986,"First, -- yes."
1973.73-482,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4977.986,4985.483,Do you think it’s deterred admissions and confessions or not?
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,4985.483,4988.713,"Ever so slightly, in a very insignificant fashion."
1973.73-482,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4988.713,4992.012,"And so, it really wouldn’t make very much difference whether it was overruled or not?"
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,4992.012,4999.152,"No, I think, it would make a great difference because there are individual cases I’ve known where the warnings protect the innocent."
1973.73-482,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4999.152,4999.71,Sure.
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,4999.71,5005.723,And that’s the objective of the law and that’s the reason for the protective provisions in the Constitution.
1973.73-482,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5005.723,5008.517,But you’re saying -- you say the impact has been ever so slight?
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,5008.517,5011.615,Insofar as we do see the confessions or admissions.
1973.73-482,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5011.615,5017.062,"And it is -- I mean, if it’s so, do you think if it’s been very -- it had a very strong impact --"
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,5017.062,5020.853,"Impact as to number of confessions that are introduced, may it please the Court."
1973.73-482,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5025.525,5027.071,What other impact does it have?
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,5027.071,5032.395,It has the impact of professionalizing the operations of the police department.
1973.73-482,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5044.95,5050.526,"Well, it hasn’t had the impact of preventing some admissions that otherwise might have been made?"
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,5050.526,5051.536,Yes.
1973.73-482,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5051.536,5053.879,A substantial as was stated --
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,5053.879,5066.886,"Well, in counting the numbers, we can only start what the surveys indicate and the numbers indicate in one study in Pittsburgh where there was a reduction of about a third in the number of confessions introduced."
1973.73-482,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5072.272,5074.325,"Well, it is not what I’m asking."
1973.73-482,3,39367,roman_s_gribbs,,5084.82,5098.696,"Only the individual cases where they’ve been excluded, but as to a study of the total exclusions or not, we have just a few that are cited in general terms in the briefs."
1973.73-482,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5282.882,5285.822,Very well.
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5289.201,5291.886,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1973.73-482,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5331.961,5335.233,But it is to say that the police had no independent source?
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5335.233,5338.756,"At that particular time, that’s right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1973.73-482,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5467.658,5482.338,Then I’d still assume that the purpose of the provisions we’re discussing was to make it very difficult for Government to do things to the citizens and you barely want it very easy for Government to do things?
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5482.338,5492.653,"No, Your Honor, I have no intention of ever violating or whatever foreclose to come before this Court and suggest that we would want to compel somebody to be a witness against himself in a criminal trial."
1973.73-482,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5520.063,5521.817,And which is not in this case?
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5521.817,5523.675,"No, it is not."
1973.73-482,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5552.526,5574.181,"Miranda was a prophylactic one to perhaps act as a deterrent to the kind of interrogations that shouldn’t take place and to stop the interrogation if the witness, if the defendant who’s in custody doesn’t want to talk, that’s the purpose of Miranda."
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5611.558,5618.051,"It would all depend on, I believe, Mr. Justice White, this Court’s ruling on the question of how Miranda is going to be continued."
1973.73-482,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5620.341,5636.228,"But if you win this case, I take it the one way of putting it is that there’s nothing wrong with continuing to interrogate to attempt get leads to other evidence."
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5636.228,5647.173,"No, I was starting to say that as long as that provision of the Miranda case which is now something that guides the performance of police still in force namely, when he says, he does not want to be interrogated."
1973.73-482,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5648.715,5661.508,"Yes, but the Court because they go ahead that the police continued to interrogate and they say, “Where’s the gun” or “Where were you at a certain time” and he finally gives an answer and says, “Well, I was with Henderson.”"
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5661.508,5662.603,"And Mr. Justice White, I’m saying that --"
1973.73-482,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5662.603,5664.942,And then you would say that was admissible?
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5664.942,5680.738,"No, I’m saying that the police do not do that now and they would not do that as long as that particular provision of the Miranda majority is still in force, namely, that when he says, “I don’t want to talk,” the police are instructed to stop their interrogation at that point and allow him to exercise his right."
1973.73-482,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5680.738,5683.762,"Well, just from the point of view, the police has own interest."
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5692.316,5694.553,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist and that the point I was making."
1973.73-482,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5703.59,5705.594,"You know, they won’t be able to use a confession anyway?"
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5705.594,5706.059,That’s right.
1973.73-482,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5706.059,5713.248,"Of the -- and as they quit interrogating, he certainly isn’t going to give one."
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5717.818,5730.778,"Yes, Mr. Justice but in fact they do stop and they do obey in great majority of the time as many times as we have an influence on them, they'd be prescriptions that have been delineated in the Miranda decision."
1973.73-482,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5730.778,5744.884,"Thus, you’re still making the distinction I take it between the interrogation that produces a pistol as Justice White suggested and the interrogation that leads to finding a witness who then comes into the Courtroom to testify under oath?"
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5744.884,5746.269,"Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.73-482,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5749.519,5764.054,"But they could still question that could keep on regardless of the man saying, he didn’t want to talk anymore and on the theory that if he got enough and the man made a mistake of taking the witness stand he can use it."
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5764.054,5764.665,Mr. Justice Marshall --
1973.73-482,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5764.665,5767.352,Wouldn't be an incentive for him to continue?
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5767.352,5778.111,"No, Mr. Justice Marshall, because as we indicated also in our opening argument that, we feel that a totality of circumstances approach to evaluating the interrogation would cover that type of situation."
1973.73-482,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5778.111,5782.139,"And you say that when he says, “I don’t want to talk anymore,” you cut it off."
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5782.139,5782.72,Right and I think --
1973.73-482,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5782.72,5793.953,"Well didn’t he say that when you first start questioning, do you -- I mean, he’s not talking voluntarily from the beginning, right?"
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5793.953,5795.517,"Well, I respectfully disagree."
1973.73-482,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5799.746,5804.004,"Well, I mean, before you advised -- he doesn’t want to be advisers right."
1973.73-482,4,34930,l_brooks_patterson,,5806.431,5807.661,"Well, he better not be arrested, I would suppose."
