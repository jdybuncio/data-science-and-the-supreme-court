1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.618,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-6556, Johnny Lynn Old Chief v. United States."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,29.07,32.531,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,48.904,53.385,"Well, when we're talking about... we're talking about admissibility of evidence, here, I take it."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,53.385,53.976,Yes.
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,53.976,61.293,"Ordinarily you don't start talking about the relevance of a... you look at the piece of evidence and you say, is it relevant, don't you?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,61.293,66.624,"Yes, and in this particular case there were pieces of evidence that we contended weren't relevant."
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,66.624,69.957,"Well, what was it, a certificate of prior conviction?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,69.957,71.389,"Well, also the indictment itself."
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,86.369,89.291,But that's not raised in your petition for certiorari.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,105.382,108.385,"--Well, yes, but we did do three things."
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,121.492,126.946,But your... the question you raise with us is whether the Government should have been required to accept the stipulation.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,126.946,127.957,That's correct.
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,127.957,135.509,"And so we're talking now about a piece... what, a certificate of conviction of some sort was offered?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,135.509,138.181,"Well, we only made a verbal offer."
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.967,149.06,So what was it that the Government offered?
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,149.06,158.287,"--They offered a... well, aside from reading the indictment and mentioning it during the trial, they offered the judgment and conviction document."
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.287,168.503,"Okay, so the question, it seems to me, if you're talking about normal application of the rules of evidence, is, is this judgment of conviction relevant, and it seems to me you have to answer yes, don't you?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,168.503,179.468,"Well, it may be relevant in general, but what I was saying was, parts of it were not relevant, and I tried to solve that problem pretrial, and the judge basically said no."
1996.95-6556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,179.468,189.396,"Mr. Donovan, when the judge had said no, did you then offer the statement as a signed admission, even though the Government had not stipulated to its correctness?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,189.396,189.757,No.
1996.95-6556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,198.232,207.058,"Well, do you agree that the Government... I mean the stipulation is by... I think is by definition a statement in which each party concurs."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,207.058,207.769,That's correct.
1996.95-6556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,207.769,214.203,And I presume there isn't any power in a court to make the Government concur in something it doesn't want to concur in.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,214.203,216.034,That's true.
1996.95-6556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,221.766,239.038,"No, but the problem doesn't arise under the rule until there is at least some alternative evidence under the rule, and if you're saying the evidence is the stipulation, and the Government hasn't signed it, you haven't got a stipulation, and you don't have that kind of evidence."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,264.045,280.636,"--What I did, though, I did offer a proposed jury instruction whereby the jury would instruct the... or the judge would instruct the jury that you are hereby instructed that the defendant, Johnny Lynn Old Chief, has been convicted of an offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding 1 year, and I think that's--"
1996.95-6556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,280.636,283.658,"That was in the nature of an admission, you're saying?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,283.658,283.908,--Right.
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,283.908,295.846,"Yes, but you did that on the assumption, or in order to build a case that the evidence of the nature of the crime must have been... must be excluded based on your instruction."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,295.846,298.447,"Yes, that's true."
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,298.447,298.908,Well--
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,313.667,337.663,"I think the problem is the Ninth Circuit case, the Breitkreutz case, which the Government... the prosecutor and the trial judge relied on I think is decided wrong, because it says if there is an offer to stipulate in this kind of a case you don't apply 403, but I think clearly the Government's admitted here, and they admitted I think in 1992 in a case that was argued called Hadley, that an offer to trigger, or offer to stipulate--"
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,337.663,337.903,Well--
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,337.903,339.984,--does trigger a 403 balancing analysis--
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,339.984,340.405,--Well--
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,340.405,341.544,--and we never had such an analysis here.
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,342.565,344.248,--I don't... excuse me.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,360.548,364.001,--I don't... I don't think the Government's required to do that.
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,364.001,372.126,"Well, why... if you're right on the felony point, why isn't the Government required to accept a stipulation on some other element of the crime?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,372.126,383.492,"I think this... I'm asking the Court just to focus on this one statute, and I'm saying in addition to the stipulation issue that the nature of the prior conviction is not relevant, and--"
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.492,394.829,"Well, maybe... can't the defendant in my hypothesis argue that this... the evidence as to how he killed the defendant could be very prejudicial, and it really doesn't make any difference in the eyes of the law so long as he killed him."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,394.829,400.064,"--I think that's true, but you start with a proposition that that evidence is relevant, and then of course you could argue 403."
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,400.064,403.377,But you start with the proposition that this evidence is relevant.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,403.377,420.948,"Well, if you combine the total... if you're calling the total judgment and conviction document itself relevant, yes, but what I'm saying is part of that judgment includes the nature and name of the prior felony, which isn't relevant, as well as the fact that Old Chief got 60 months, obviously, which is more than--"
1996.95-6556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,420.948,432.455,"But why doesn't that just raise a section 403 balance question, rather than some question of whether the Government has to accept a stipulation?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,432.455,436.697,"--Well, I did raise that at the trial level, and the problem with the Ninth--"
1996.95-6556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,436.697,437.368,But not here.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,437.368,439.759,--I argued 403 balance here.
1996.95-6556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,441.91,453.59,"But the question, as the Chief Justice pointed out, just asks whether we have to accept the offer of the defendant to stipulate."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,453.59,455.059,"--Yes, and--"
1996.95-6556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,455.059,457.811,And surely the answer to that is no.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,457.811,476.965,"--Well, that's true, Justice O'Connor, but what I'm trying to get the Court to look at are some of the circuit cases, Tavares in the First Circuit, and what... basically what that says is the offer to stipulate triggers a process and then the Government has to come in and prove under 403 that there is probative value which--"
1996.95-6556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,476.965,483.95,I don't see what relevance the offer to stipulate has.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,492.196,492.626,--Well--
1996.95-6556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,492.626,503.184,"You'd have to raise the 403 issue, and ask whether what is offered by the Government is unduly prejudicial and unfair."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,503.184,516.091,"--And I think I did that, but I got ignored, and again, I feel because of the law in the Ninth Circuit, the case... Breitkreutz says if you object, if you offer to stipulate, you don't apply the 403 balancing test."
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,516.091,516.371,But--
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,534.825,538.758,"Yes, and Ninth Circuit law says you don't trigger it."
1996.95-6556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,538.758,542.127,"But the... Tavares was a pure 403 case, wasn't it?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,544.27,545.011,Yes.
1996.95-6556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,545.011,545.78,Pure 403.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,560.51,570.648,"And the Tavares test in the first Circuit stands for the proposition if the Government refuses to stipulate, you still exclude that evidence by some other means, and the First--"
1996.95-6556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.648,571.139,I thought--
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,600.418,600.898,"--No, I--"
1996.95-6556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.898,602.989,--on the grounds of what difference does it make who it was?
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,617.128,624.632,--I think in comparison you start with the proposition that the victim of the... the evidence of the victim of the crime is a relevant question.
1996.95-6556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,624.632,625.132,No.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,634.468,634.989,Well--
1996.95-6556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,634.989,649.909,"So if I come in with a stipulation, I stipulate there was a dead human being, whereupon you think the State could be precluded from introducing who the human being was, placing this event in its real life context, simply because that would be harmful to the defendant?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,650.33,660.144,"--I think that does place it in the real life context and get into evidence of the act and intent of the crime, and one thing I'm saying here, the status of the felon is not part of the act and intent of the crime."
1996.95-6556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,662.167,670.342,Are you saying that because of the state of the law in the Ninth Circuit there was no way you could have gotten a 403 balance?
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,692.546,697.291,"That's how I read the Ninth Circuit Breitkreutz case, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.95-6556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,697.291,715.212,"So what you're challenging is circuit law that says that the character, the crime, the actual crime, the name of that crime is not something that the judge should weigh in a 403 balance, it just comes in automatically."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,717.684,723.216,I think the Ninth Circuit says that automatically comes in regardless of defense objection or defense offer to stipulate.
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.619,728.48,But that certainly isn't the question you present us with.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,731.141,737.426,"No, I... I mean, it's an aspect of the question, yes."
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,737.426,767.906,"Well, what if a criminal defendant and his lawyer figure that our only chance is to raise a defense of justifiable homicide, that you killed in self-defense, can that defendant come in and say, I stipulate to all the elements of the crime of murder, that it was... I killed him unlawfully, et cetera, et cetera, and can the Government be required to accept that sort of stipulation, and only argue about... the only evidence you really hear is about whether there was justification or not?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,767.906,768.728,I don't think so.
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.512,778.953,"Well, why can't it present a full picture of the felony that the person was convicted of?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,778.953,782.997,"Well, my first argument is, it's not relevant."
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,782.997,787.348,"Well, if it's not relevant, then you don't ever get to a 403 balancing."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,787.348,787.618,That's right.
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,787.618,790.57,You simply would exclude it automatically.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,790.57,795.773,"And I think that's the rule of the First Circuit, is just that, but--"
1996.95-6556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,795.773,802.569,It is a relevant part.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,805.049,806.141,--That's--
1996.95-6556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,806.141,829.055,"The question is, how do you... I mean, the question is, how do you get in that relevant part without going into all the details, and the difference between doing that with an ancient felony and doing it with the details of the accused felony, i.e. the present crime, the difference, because you don't allow it with the present crime, I thought the Chief Justice's question is, why do you allow it with the past crime, and the answer to that is?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,829.055,842.836,"--Well, the... I believe the answer is whether or not it's a qualifying crime is a question of law for the Court to determine, and whether or not the defendant in fact committed that crime, or was convicted of that crime, is a question of fact--"
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,842.836,844.035,"Well, perhaps--"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,844.035,845.157,--A question of fact for the jury.
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,845.157,862.308,"--on a somewhat broader picture, can the criminal defense in a sense require the Government to accept a lot of stipulations so that a very abstract picture is presented to the jury simply almost in terms of judges, rather than having live evidence describe what happened?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,862.308,863.08,No.
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,872.844,884.341,It seems to me what you have to say in order to avoid some of these very difficult problems is that evidence of the prior crime for the felon in possession statute is somehow sui generis and we should have a special rule for that.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,885.623,886.354,That's essentially--
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,886.354,892.788,"--I think that's a difficult principle to explain if I have to write the opinion, but it seems to me that that's where you're going."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,892.788,928.372,"--Well, I think I am going there, and I'm asking the Court to consider the Tavares rule, and I think the Tavares rule is better summarized in the case of Melvin, which is cited in the amicus brief, and that basically Melvin states that in a felony possession of a firearm case, evidence of the nature of a prior... of the nature of the prior conviction is not admissible unless the Government establishes probative value in the 403 balancing process, and I think that is a simple rule to apply."
1996.95-6556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,928.372,931.812,Could I go back to your answer to the Chief Justice's question?
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,955.307,955.598,Well--
1996.95-6556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.598,956.75,"You said no, but the--"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,956.75,956.96,--I think that--
1996.95-6556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,956.96,967.146,"--but the defendant could offer the Government a stipulation, and if the Government refused the trial court could exclude that information, which I think is the opposite of your first answer."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,967.146,982.966,"--Well, I think what I'm trying to say is that the defendant can't preclude... cannot on his own preclude, but he could offer to stipulate it, otherwise object and ask the judge to preclude, and of course the Government would... would not--"
1996.95-6556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.966,986.279,Are you saying the Government... and what must the judge do?
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,987.43,996.205,"--No, the Gov... the judge... well, I would argue in certain cases, in certain situations the judge should apply 403 and exclude the evidence, but the Government would argue, and--"
1996.95-6556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,996.205,997.906,What cases are they?
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1020.773,1041.476,"--Well, I think... if I may give an example, I think the trial court's rule on photographs, for example, every day, and the defense may say, this photograph is too gory, but this one isn't, and the prosecution may say, we want to use a real gory photograph, and the judge applies 403 and decides that gory photograph is so highly prejudicial I'm going to keep it out, even though the Government wants to introduce it."
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.476,1056.587,"What if we were to rule in your favor in this case and then a year from now you get a defendant, maybe, and the felony... a similar charge, the felony of which he's convicted is having trafficked in counterfeit Louis Vuitton bags."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1071.904,1080.71,"The First Circuit addressed that, and in me advocating the First Circuit rule, the First Circuit basically says, that would also be irrelevant, so that doesn't come in."
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1080.71,1082.743,So the defendant couldn't make that point.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1082.743,1082.954,Right.
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1085.054,1092.669,Under your view I take it the certified copy of previous conviction cannot be shown to the jury.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1096.352,1097.463,Unless it's--
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1097.463,1098.742,Redacted.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1098.742,1099.203,--Redacted.
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1099.203,1100.996,And then the jury has to read something that's redacted.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1103.887,1131.113,"I think... and that's one of my arguments to advocate a stipulation is better than a redacted judgment and conviction, because if you redact the judgment and conviction by crossing out lines and such, I think that invites jury speculations of what was crossed out, whereas if you have a clean stipulation, it is hereby stipulated, the jury either hears that or reads that, and there's less likelihood for speculation to come up."
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1131.113,1137.678,"Well, but if there's so much trouble in enforcing the rule you propose, maybe that indicates that we shouldn't try to make the effort."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1143.271,1158.992,"Well, but I think the reason this Court has to do something is, there's a different rule in some of the circuits, and my circuit, obviously the Ninth Circuit happens to be against the defendant, and the other circuits, most of the other circuits now would rule in my favor."
1996.95-6556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1158.992,1170.44,"Well, I guess the first question is whether the evidence of the nature of the felony offense, the prior offense is relevant."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1170.44,1171.882,And that's--
1996.95-6556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1171.882,1174.283,"That would be the starting point, I would guess."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1174.283,1174.764,--That's my first points.
1996.95-6556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1178.047,1190.402,"If it is relevant, then the section 403 balance would exclude it if it unfairly prejudices the defendant."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1190.402,1191.955,Unless the Government had some other legitimate reason for--
1996.95-6556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1191.955,1201.613,And I think it's pretty hard to say that disclosing the name of the offense is an unfair prejudice.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1203.746,1204.063,--Well--
1996.95-6556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1204.063,1211.029,"And he was convicted of it, and it's hard for me at least to say it's unfair to have it known."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1217.042,1228.239,"--It's unfair in the sense of this case is a prior conviction, and was assault resulting in serious bodily injury which first brands Old Chief as a violent felon."
1996.95-6556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1236.294,1237.285,"Well, but what's unfair about it?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1255.047,1256.158,--Okay.
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1270.798,1274.759,"But as a practical matter, the Government doesn't have to stipulate, you agree."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1282.787,1293.602,"Aside from the redacted and... the redacted judgment and conviction they could bring in the Clerk of the Court to testify, a probation officer to testify--"
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1293.602,1296.474,These are superior to the certificate?
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1301.756,1303.108,"--That would be my position, yes."
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1303.108,1305.189,How would you know it was felony?
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1307.831,1313.925,"Well, the judge would... the judge I think would instruct the jury that this offense that the Government has introduced, this prior case--"
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1313.925,1316.196,This offense which shall remain nameless was a felony?
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1316.196,1317.378,--Yes.
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1317.378,1323.062,Is this only if the defendant stipulates that he's not going to contest the prior conviction?
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1326.114,1346.266,"I think if he contests the prior conviction the whole thing's open for evidence, but if he says, I'm going to contest whether or not I was convicted of it, but I admit that it was an offense for which the term of imprisonment could exceed 1 year, then I think the judge could instruct the jury that that part of the element's proven as a matter of law."
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1346.266,1357.115,So you have a rule in advance based on what the defendant's tactical decision is and how that tactical decision is communicated to the prosecution and to the court.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1400.532,1403.635,The judge accept it as an admission of fact?
1996.95-6556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1403.635,1404.015,Sure.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1404.015,1405.456,I think the judge could.
1996.95-6556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.456,1408.427,I don't understand why there's all this complication about this.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1425.259,1435.625,"I believe... I don't know if there's a difference, but there's a jury instruction that as I understand it would say if the parties have... or a party has admitted this fact."
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1437.486,1440.638,And the other party can be required to accept that?
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1440.638,1446.302,I don't think so.
1996.95-6556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1446.302,1446.873,Mr.--
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1489.381,1499.786,And I think I tried to say to that previously was that that doesn't relate to the act and the intent of the offense or the picture of the offense.
1996.95-6556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1502.538,1513.775,"In the case of your client, were there other prior felony convictions that could have been used to establish this that were less close to the current charge?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1513.775,1518.71,"There actually was one that the Government considered more prejudicial, was a robbery."
1996.95-6556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1520.04,1521.412,Did he have any that was less?
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1521.412,1522.711,"--No, none less."
1996.95-6556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1525.816,1539.273,"Mr. Donovan, I want to get clear on what happened in this case, because in responding to Justice Stevens' question about the general rule, I think you're talking about a case which as you described it was different from what you described to me earlier."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1561.546,1563.079,"See, it was all--"
1996.95-6556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1563.079,1564.028,Is that what happened?
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1564.028,1565.66,--It was all part of a written motion.
1996.95-6556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1565.66,1566.611,"No, but is that what happened?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1586.654,1591.596,"No, but in the process of... what I did in writing was... I tried to say this."
1996.95-6556,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1606.817,1609.709,"Well, that's... that probably moves things right along."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1609.9,1626.459,"And another thing that happened here is the judge read the jury instructions to the jury before we had a settlement conference, so I didn't have an opportunity to object or resubmit or have any discussions with the court until after the instructions were read."
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1626.459,1628.282,So all you can do then is object.
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1629.601,1629.791,Right.
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1634.116,1636.427,"Well, could you raise a 403 objection?"
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1636.427,1645.323,"I just... I renewed the motion in limine when the judgment and conviction was admitted into the evidence, and I also renewed it as a basis of the objection to--"
1996.95-6556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1645.323,1648.796,Did you base your objection on 403?
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1648.796,1653.617,"--I didn't use the words 403 except pretrial, Mr. Justice Kennedy."
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1656.719,1657.13,"Yes, you may."
1996.95-6556,0,20766,daniel_donovan,,1657.13,1657.701,--Thank you.
1996.95-6556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1657.701,1660.131,"We'll hear from you now, Mr. Estrada."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1660.131,1673.479,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-6556,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1705.432,1726.475,"Well, Mr. Estrada, under the particular statute that we're... that says if the defendant has been convicted of a felony punishable by more than a year in prison, is the nature of the prior offense relevant under that statute?"
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1726.475,1728.808,"Under our view, yes, it is, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-6556,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1728.808,1729.296,Why?
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1729.296,1753.512,"Because the definitional section that lets us know what is a felony, or what is a crime punishable for more than 1 year imprisonment, exclude certain offenses, and in order for the jury to fulfill its factfinding function it would have to be instructed as to what offenses are covered and whether the one that they have heard evidence on is actually one of those offenses."
1996.95-6556,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1806.059,1814.494,Is it true that the Ninth Circuit says that there would never have to be a 403 balancing in these cases?
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1814.494,1815.513,No.
1996.95-6556,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1861.004,1863.034,"Well, what about the best evidence rule?"
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1863.034,1863.625,--I think--
1996.95-6556,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1863.625,1865.017,How does that fit in?
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1865.017,1893.285,"--The best evidence rule I think textually would apply, and I think it is not usually thought to have direct bearing because everybody understands in the more specific factual context here that the relevant unit of what the evidence is is the judgment of conviction itself, as the Chief Justice pointed out, rather than particular information within the judgment or conviction, and--"
1996.95-6556,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1893.285,1908.375,"Well, why is 403 balancing, Mr. Estrada, necessary if your position is that the nature of the offense is relevant for the jury's consideration, or for the jury's determination?"
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1911.167,1912.008,--Maybe we didn't--
1996.95-6556,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1912.008,1919.023,It seems to me that you con... I read it as a concession that 403 analysis can apply in these cases.
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1919.023,1929.989,"--Well, I guess that is literally true, but it does not convey the understanding that maybe we inartfully put into it."
1996.95-6556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1954.254,1970.235,"Mr. Estrada, I have problems with that argument in this context, that we can allow every district judge in the land to have a 403 balance when, say, the conviction is for assault with a deadly weapon, and Judge A will come out this way, and Judge B will come out that way."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1988.358,1988.628,--Well--
1996.95-6556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1988.628,1990.168,That can't be the Government's position.
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1990.168,1992.151,"--that's not what we mean to convey, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.95-6556,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2025.801,2036.99,"Nothing escapes it, so that it really is a question to be considered under 403 whether the identity of the victim as Shirley Temple or Mother Teresa can get to the jury."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2040.233,2044.825,"Well, there are lots of questions, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-6556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2130.872,2139.807,"Mr. Estrada, this situation is a little bit different, in that the defendant isn't contending that any of the part of the story of the crime at issue, the current possession, can be kept out."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2156.197,2164.835,"--We can... generally, yes, but I would like to qualify that in the following respect, Justice Stevens."
1996.95-6556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.169,2173.01,Let me put them the other way.
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2178.963,2189.419,"The answer is, probably it could, and when it did, we likely would have no remedy in most of the cases, but let me--"
1996.95-6556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2189.419,2190.601,And why could he exclude one?
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2191.791,2192.141,--Okay--
1996.95-6556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2192.141,2195.063,Is... would it not be that the second felony is really irrelevant because the condition--
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2195.063,2195.253,--No.
1996.95-6556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.253,2195.874,--had been established?
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2195.874,2196.255,No.
1996.95-6556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2211.843,2216.086,"Yes, but you could certainly put two... you could certainly put two convictions in in 2 minutes."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2226.873,2227.814,"--No, I think all... I'm sorry?"
1996.95-6556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2227.814,2238.541,"You don't think the fact that the second conviction would be prejudicial and would not add to the person's eligibility for the particular offense he's now on trial for, you don't think that the relevance is a factor in that?"
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2238.541,2242.284,I don't think relevance is a factor in that.
1996.95-6556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.859,2252.111,"Well, what else could be the Government's purpose?"
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2252.342,2269.091,"--Well, let me get to that, because I think that is an important issue, and it has gone... and the argument has been that we could have no conceivable purpose to turn down a stipulation."
1996.95-6556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2313.33,2314.9,"--Well, that's not necessarily true."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2324.026,2325.849,"--Well, that wasn't done here, Justice Stevens."
1996.95-6556,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2326.139,2330.001,"Well, what if there was... what if there was the written admission?"
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2333.533,2343.17,"--I think that that is a somewhat different case, but not enough, and let me explain to you why."
1996.95-6556,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2358.891,2359.4,"Well, I'll grant--"
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2359.4,2360.641,--through technical concessions.
1996.95-6556,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2360.641,2376.372,"--I'll grant you that as a general principle, but how does it square with what you said before, because I thought you said before that in the instance in which the written admission is offered so that it's evidence within the meaning of Rule 403, that there would at least have to be a 403 balancing."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2387.598,2390.781,"When the facts are those, yes, that is what I'm saying."
1996.95-6556,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2390.781,2392.371,"Well, then that's not much of a balancing."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2392.371,2392.851,"Well, no--"
1996.95-6556,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2392.851,2394.394,"I mean, you're saying you win as a matter of law."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2397.155,2397.894,--No.
1996.95-6556,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2427.654,2436.77,"Is there such a thing in... is... what has been referred to as a written admission, is there any recognition of that sort of an instrument in the Rules of Criminal Procedure?"
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2436.77,2437.131,No.
1996.95-6556,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2453.882,2455.344,That comes under the Rules of Evidence.

1996.95-6556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2514.091,2528.611,"And the second part was that by and large, with the exception whether it's an antitrust violation or not, you know, by and large it's not relevant except for the fact that it was committed, and the third reason was, by and large it's very prejudicial."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2578.425,2585.791,"--Well, let me start out with the last point, which is the redaction point."
1996.95-6556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.254,2594.814,I'm not... we're trying to get a rule.
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2607.564,2620.013,"I don't want to fight with the formulation of the question, merely to note that if you took the case to answer that question, it doesn't raise the question, because it's not within the question that he brought to the Court."
1996.95-6556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2645.888,2654.504,"Yes, but wasn't... isn't your position that the reason it's wrong is that there some felonies, some business crimes and so forth that don't give rise to this particular liability?"
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2654.504,2655.235,--That is correct.
1996.95-6556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2655.235,2659.318,But isn't that something that the judge will cure by his instructions to the jury?
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2667.723,2682.373,"Yes, but it is an instruction on the law that is no different from every other instruction that the judge gives, and as I said earlier, the instruction that would be the outcome of the First Circuit's case is quite different."
1996.95-6556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.878,2693.26,"Well, he doesn't say you have no factfinding role."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2706.239,2712.323,"Well, that was not even the... that was not the instruction that was tendered in this case."
1996.95-6556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2712.323,2729.403,"Oh, I understand that, but if you're asking us to decide whether the procedure used in this particular case was sufficient, you might win this case, but are you asking for a general rule that no matter how the defendant tries to keep this out the Government always can get the nature of the crime in evidence?"
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2729.403,2730.495,"Yes, because--"
1996.95-6556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2730.495,2733.527,"Well, then you don't have to argue about these other... the procedural difficulties."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2733.527,2738.359,"--Well, yes we do, because they're different arguments that different members of the Court--"
1996.95-6556,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2738.359,2741.291,You can ask for a rule broader than the question raised by the petition--
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2741.291,2745.463,"--Well, that's right, and that seems what the question that Justice Breyer asked--"
1996.95-6556,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2745.463,2753.559,--But that doesn't necessarily change the proposition that we decide only the question... we may do it by invoking a broader rule than necessary.
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2753.559,2754.538,"--Well, that's right."
1996.95-6556,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2754.538,2766.136,"So Mr. Estrada, 403 does not apply unless you determine first that the evidence offered is relevant."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2766.136,2766.797,That's correct.
1996.95-6556,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2766.797,2770.881,You say it is relevant because of the crimes that are excluded.
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2770.881,2771.231,Mm-hmm.
1996.95-6556,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2771.231,2785.242,"If we agree with that, then it can be excluded, may be excluded, if the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger, not of prejudice, but unfair prejudice."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2785.242,2786.262,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-6556,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2786.262,2786.462,Is that not right?
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2786.462,2788.004,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor, and--"
1996.95-6556,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2788.004,2791.644,So what is your position on whether it's unfair or not?
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2791.644,2810.476,"--It is never unfair, because it is inherent in the nature of the crime that Congress necessarily contemplated that we would prove this element in the vast run of cases in which there was a trial with this very evidence, and it may be that the defendant doesn't like it, but it is his judgment of conviction, and it is relevant evidence."
1996.95-6556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2810.476,2832.76,"Mr. Estrada, if you are now taking the position that the Government would win every time assuming a 403 balance, then what in the world did you mean in your brief when you said, consistent with those principles, where a defendant offers an unconditional stipulation coupled with an adequate jury charge, the trial court should consider the availability of the stipulation as one of the factors in the Rule 403 balance?"
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2832.76,2838.614,"Maybe that wasn't clear, and that's our fault, Justice Ginsburg, but the structure of the argument is as follows:"
1996.95-6556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2899.523,2919.806,"I could understand what you were telling me, Mr. Estrada, if the portion I read had been proceeded by, this is the Supreme Court's case law and so because of that case law, we have to make this qualified semi-concession, but what it flows from is the Advisory Committee's note to Rule 403."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2945.385,2946.144,--Mm-hmm.
1996.95-6556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3011.376,3029.229,"Let me go back... can I ask you to answer Justice O'Connor's question for a second, because I had thought that it was... you said on the question of unfair prejudice the reason that I think... and at the heart of Tavares, frankly, I think is that issue, and what we thought was the unfair prejudice was this."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3087.598,3093.271,"Well, the answer, Justice Breyer, is that the irrelevant item of evidence is the judgment of conviction."
1996.95-6556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3150.869,3152.291,I don't think we thought that.
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3179.338,3179.677,Well--
1996.95-6556,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3179.677,3186.862,And I know of no other area... we're talking about the difficulty of having a per se rule in the petitioner's favor.
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3195.026,3197.748,"--Well, the answer is this, Justice Kennedy."
1996.95-6556,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3226.608,3251.985,"But isn't the extreme... Mr. Estrada, isn't the extreme unlikelihood of success in inviting doubt about either a stipulation or an admission what takes the stipulation and the admission about a status out of what might be a general rule in your favor about proving the elements of the... or the case in the sense of the acts of the defendant in this particular instance?"
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3265.224,3272.748,"--No, and you need go no further than this case to realize... and we quote this at page 29 of our brief."
1996.95-6556,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3311.162,3314.405,Your answer is that the evil that men do live after them.
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3314.405,3315.106,That's right.
1996.95-6556,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3345.524,3346.676,"Thank you, Mr. Estrada."
1996.95-6556,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3346.676,3347.637,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-6556,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3347.637,3349.187,"Mr. Donovan, you have 1 minute remaining."
1996.95-6556,2,20766,daniel_donovan,,3349.187,3352.74,"If I may, I'd like to make four quick points."
1996.95-6556,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3363.477,3365.039,They did refuse to stipulate it.
1996.95-6556,2,20766,daniel_donovan,,3365.039,3365.309,Right.
1996.95-6556,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3403.303,3404.905,"Thank you, Mr. Donovan."
1996.95-6556,2,20766,daniel_donovan,,3404.905,3405.106,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1996.95-6556,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3405.106,3406.272,The case is submitted.
