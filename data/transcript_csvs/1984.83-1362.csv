1984.83-1362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.158,We will hear arguments first this morning in Cleveland Board of Education against Loudermill.
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,15.171,41.42,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue presented by the cases at bar today is whether or not the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required the Cleveland Board of Education and the Parma Board of Education to grant respondents a hearing before they were terminated from their employment."
1984.83-1362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,109.904,112.906,How long after his appointment was that discovery made?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,112.906,116.127,"After his appointment it was approximately eleven months, Your Honor."
1984.83-1362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,138.503,143.856,I gather his service was satisfactory during the eleven months before discovery?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,143.856,149.34,There were no known reasons or any incidents that had happened with Mr. Loudermill.
1984.83-1362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,181.12,183.884,How long had he been working before his discharge?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,183.884,185.724,--I am not sure of the actual length of employment.
1984.83-1362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,192.618,195.64,"And his service, too, had been satisfactory?"
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,195.64,198.33,"As far as I know, yes, that is true."
1984.83-1362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,287.279,289.442,So there was as posttermination hearing?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,289.442,290.882,"--Oh, absolutely, Your Honor."
1984.83-1362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,290.882,293.614,And that went on for ten months in the case of Loudermill?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,293.614,294.635,That's correct.
1984.83-1362,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,317.179,321.432,"Well, now, Mr. Donnelly was reinstated, I take it."
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,321.432,322.441,That's correct.
1984.83-1362,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,336.332,347.509,"Mr. Wyman, may I inquire, what are the possible remedies for a wrongfully discharged employee in your jurisdiction?"
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,352.124,352.682,Absolutely.
1984.83-1362,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.2,371.425,"Not the procedural remedies, the substantive remedies available are reinstatement... how about damages?"
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,371.425,378.651,"--They are entitled to reinstatement, and if the discharge was found to be wrong, reinstatement and back pay."
1984.83-1362,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,400.203,428.561,"With regard to the procedural remedies available to such an employee, you rely on this Court's decisions in Arnett and in Matthews, and in those cases the Court upheld postdeprivation hearings for employees where there was an opportunity to respond before the discharge."
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,440.249,445.493,There is no statutorily provided scheme for response.
1984.83-1362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,450.767,453.348,Would you state that again?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,453.348,464.247,There is no statutorily outlined scheme for requiring or allowing some pretermination process.
1984.83-1362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,464.247,464.886,Then you said but?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,464.886,477.906,But the facts in the instant case reflect that there was a time period during which both Mr. Donnelly or Mr. Loudermill may have responded should they have desired to do so.
1984.83-1362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,477.906,481.138,"You mean you told them you were about to fire them, and then there was some time?"
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,481.138,492.073,"There was a letter sent out in the Loudermill case to the employee, and his discharge was not confirmed by the board of education until November 13th, ten days later."
1984.83-1362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,492.073,497.496,But nothing in that letter told him that he could explain or respond or whatever?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,497.496,507.174,"That's correct, and it's the position of the petitioners that there would have been no purpose to any additional pretermination hearing or process."
1984.83-1362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,533.511,550.602,"What do you do, Mr. Wyman, with what we said in Davis and Scherer last time, that decisions of this Court by 1978 had required some kind of hearing prior to discharge of an employee who had a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment?"
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,550.602,553.714,It is the petitioners' position that--
1984.83-1362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,553.714,556.336,But he didn't get any kind of hearing.
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,556.336,567.741,"--He got no kind of hearing, and for the sake of the argument before this Court, because of the status of the pleadings, the way this case has developed up, that has to be taken as true."
1984.83-1362,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,594.33,600.965,"Mr. Wyman, do you think that our cases indicate there has to be an opportunity to respond?"
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,600.965,606.918,There are cases that do in fact indicate that there should be an opportunity to respond.
1984.83-1362,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,626.3,631.796,"He also said he didn't do it at all, and he wasn't there."
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,631.796,632.615,--He could say that.
1984.83-1362,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,632.615,633.787,And he wasn't in court.
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,641.161,648.295,We believe that the reliability of the objective evidence was such that we had a right--
1984.83-1362,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,648.295,651.027,I thought you said all you had was the conviction.
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,651.027,655.34,--We had a court record of the conviction and his application.
1984.83-1362,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,655.34,658.674,How do you know it is the same man?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,658.674,661.324,Because we have an employee number.
1984.83-1362,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,665.526,666.698,Like what?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,666.698,668.448,We have an employee number.
1984.83-1362,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,695.456,698.418,Did you ever ask him if he was the same person?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,698.418,701.39,"I cannot honestly answer that, Your Honor."
1984.83-1362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,701.39,706.323,"Doesn't he admit that he is the same person, and that it was a misdemeanor and not a felony?"
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,706.323,709.094,"Under the facts of this case, certainly."
1984.83-1362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,740.907,746.339,"In Donnelly's case, the ultimate disposition was changed from discharge to suspension."
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,746.339,747.791,That's correct.
1984.83-1362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,747.791,751.624,What was the basis on which the Civil Service Commission made that change?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,751.624,759.939,"I don't know what the basis of the Civil Service Commission's decision was, because the Parma Civil Service Commission is not a party in any of the cases before the Court."
1984.83-1362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,776.649,778.272,And he accepted that.
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,778.272,785.616,"Apparently he accepted that, although he has... he went through a process, a court process to try to win back his back pay."
1984.83-1362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,785.616,788.41,Is Donnelly a party to this litigation?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,788.41,800.008,"Donnelly is, yes, but the post-termination delay issue which is involved in Loudermill is not involved in, I don't believe, the Parma case."
1984.83-1362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,800.008,808.242,"Well, in Donnelly's case it may be that if you had given him an opportunity to respond, he never would have been suspended, or laid off."
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,808.242,814.136,It is the Parma Board of Education's position that they did give him that opportunity.
1984.83-1362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,824.722,830.706,There was a communication back and forth in Donnelly's case?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,830.706,837.131,There was at least a communication to him and an apparent refusal to take that second eye examination.
1984.83-1362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.864,854.843,"Well, I know, but couldn't at that stage the same reason have been... couldn't the same reason have emerged to keep him on that later reemployed him?"
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,854.843,862.198,"--I can't answer that, because I don't know what went on in the minds of those in the Civil Service, other than the fact that--"
1984.83-1362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,862.198,874.337,Is it your position... suppose that it was perfectly plain that there was quite a large risk of error in this case.
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,874.337,874.878,--Okay.
1984.83-1362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,874.878,880.861,Is it the board's position that nevertheless a pretermination hearing need not be given?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,886.123,887.755,You are placing me in your position.
1984.83-1362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,895.7,902.125,"Well, however, you don't suggest that we redo the Arnett case?"
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,902.125,905.438,It would be our position from the board of educations--
1984.83-1362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,905.438,906.389,You would like us to.
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,906.389,907.038,"--that we would like you to, yes."
1984.83-1362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,976.434,978.084,What about this eye examination?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,991.284,994.036,"We... the Parma Board of Education would certainly argue that, yes."
1984.83-1362,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,999.629,1000.621,Mr. Wyman--
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1000.621,1001.79,"Yes, sir?"
1984.83-1362,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1001.79,1005.002,--When was the offer for a second eye examination made?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1008.615,1010.555,"It was before, Your Honor."
1984.83-1362,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1018.162,1022.874,It was at your client's expense?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1022.874,1025.656,I believe so.
1984.83-1362,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1038.806,1041.006,Including the reexamination.
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1041.006,1041.747,Yes.
1984.83-1362,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1041.747,1043.368,You assumed the reexamination?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1043.368,1044.46,Yes.
1984.83-1362,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1044.46,1054.123,"May I just ask, on the notice of the second... the right to take a second exam, he alleges, as I remember, that there was another employee who had failed the exam and was still working there."
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1059.198,1063.331,It is clear that he knew that flunking the eye exam would cause his discharge.
1984.83-1362,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.286,1157.934,"Mr. Wyman, why wouldn't the boards' interest be adequately served by immediate suspension and an opportunity to make a response in 24 hours, or something like that?"
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1159.644,1163.877,--An immediate suspension itself would kick in the same thing.
1984.83-1362,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1188.044,1198.69,But you would agree that there would be no prejudice to the board if there were an immediate suspension followed by an option to respond before the suspension ripened into a discharge.
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1198.69,1207.906,"I would think that that would be a possible resolution, although it may in fact still be burdensome upon the employer, the boards of education."
1984.83-1362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1207.906,1227.698,I suppose it doesn't make a lot of difference to Mr. Loudermill whether he is suspended without pay and then granted a hearing and ultimately discharged after the hearing or whether he is discharged and given a hearing after that.
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1232.262,1232.823,That's correct.
1984.83-1362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1252.174,1255.627,What remedy did the Court of Appeals think Loudermill was going to get?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1255.627,1260.099,Did the Court of Appeals... we are unsure.
1984.83-1362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1261.902,1264.003,It certainly didn't--
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1264.003,1267.756,The court was unaware of what it could do.
1984.83-1362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1269.646,1278.392,"--Under the decision, all he was deprived of is a procedural due process."
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1278.392,1282.536,"--That's correct, and that was the only issue left, and the question would have been--"
1984.83-1362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1282.536,1283.815,"So under our cases, what remedy would there be?"
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1286.258,1287.958,--Probably.
1984.83-1362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1302.718,1306.762,Aren't there two aspects to his answer?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1338.712,1340.562,We are concerned that he got confused about it.
1984.83-1362,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1411.198,1416.481,May I ask you about the promptness of the postdeprivation hearing?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1421.005,1421.756,That's correct.
1984.83-1362,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1421.756,1425.467,But Ohio courts have said that is not mandatory.
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1425.467,1426.679,"That's correct, they've said that--"
1984.83-1362,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1426.679,1430.061,And in this instance it took nine months for a decision.
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1430.061,1431.231,--For a decision.
1984.83-1362,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1438.056,1444.621,And the Ohio court simply says that the statutory requirement of 30 days is not binding.
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1444.621,1446.17,--That's correct.
1984.83-1362,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1450.434,1455.918,What would assure a prompt postdeprivation hearing under Ohio's scheme then?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1455.918,1457.19,--The assurance is--
1984.83-1362,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1457.19,1458.559,Even if you are right.
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1458.559,1463.612,"--Well, our position is that there was in fact a prompt post-termination hearing in this case."
1984.83-1362,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1487.738,1490.199,Why are there so many cases in Ohio?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1491.651,1493.701,"We have a lot of public employees, Your Honor."
1984.83-1362,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.701,1497.294,May I just ask one other question?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1504.53,1505.249,Yes.
1984.83-1362,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.249,1506.982,Would it possibly have been a different decisionmaker?
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1506.982,1508.472,We would submit that it would not have.
1984.83-1362,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.906,1537.162,"Isn't that perhaps a relevant point, that maybe there would have been room for clemency immediately before the board, but it wouldn't be a legally sufficient basis for objecting before the Civil Service Commission?"
1984.83-1362,0,33702,james_g_wyman,,1540.883,1542.896,"From the board of educations' point of view, no."
1984.83-1362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1544.806,1549.22,Mr. Fertel.
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1549.22,1550.25,Thank you.
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.016,1652.428,"What is the time allowed for answer, say, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to answer a complaint?"
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1652.428,1653.419,--Twenty days.
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1653.419,1653.97,Twenty days.
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1657.313,1660.996,"Yes, sir, especially in the fact situation where there is no pretermination procedure."
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1667.107,1677.916,"Well, it seems to me your argument defeats itself, because if there are no pretermination procedures, then any amount of notice or no notice at all is really satisfactory, because there is nothing to be done."
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1677.916,1682.637,"Well, that is our position, that you need some... there has to be pretermination procedures."
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.637,1689.923,"Then the amount of days that go by between the notice and the action isn't really relevant, is it?"
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1701.311,1702.242,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1710.239,1712.643,Let's boil your argument down a little.
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1729.634,1729.974,--Right.
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.615,1737.407,So what difference does the amount of time between the notice and the action of the school board make to your argument?
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1737.407,1738.268,It isn't.
1984.83-1362,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.299,1763.085,When did this explanation that he was confused between a felony conviction and a misdemeanor conviction first appear?
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1763.085,1774.873,"It first appeared at the time of the hearing, before the referred at the Civil Service Commission, where he testified that he thought he was convicted of a misdemeanor, and when he saw the application, it said were you ever--"
1984.83-1362,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.873,1775.682,What was the conduct?
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1781.017,1794.065,"--It was a grand theft conviction approximately eleven years prior to the filling out of the application, and there are administrative code sections in Ohio saying that more than two years is insufficient."
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1802.031,1808.223,You contend this termination was in violation of that section of Ohio law?
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1808.223,1814.848,"It was a violation, plus the fact that his defense was that he thought he was convicted of a misdemeanor and not a felony."
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.848,1820.902,"What if the school board's approach was, we are not so worried about the felony, we are worried you lied about the felony?"
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1820.902,1821.774,"Well, that is the whole issue of the case."
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.809,1833.231,"Well, so then the school board's action doesn't violate Ohio law."
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1839.435,1844.998,"Right, but then you have to have an opportunity to explain the reason it is a factual conviction."
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.625,1878.86,"What if the school board had followed the action which Mr. Wyman, your opponent, was quizzed about, if they had simply, when this information came to their attention, they had suspended him without pay, and he had then gotten a hearing in the same manner that he did, and the hearing board, the Civil Service Commission says, well, we are converting your suspension into a discharge?"
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1884.053,1884.364,No.
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1913.193,1927.922,"Well, supposing then that there had been a suspension without pay followed by a hearing which would meet your definition of a prompt hearing, and the Civil Service Commission then said, we convert the suspension into a discharge."
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1929.685,1934.076,"Well, I think first of all you have to have a hearing in front of the... I think it is an opportunity to respond to the school board."
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1943.533,1951.317,"Well, but you are saying in effect that Ohio can't channel all of these Civil Service questions to the Civil Service Commission."
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1958.994,1970.063,"--I think it has to be a decision... prior to termination, he has to have a hearing in front of an impartial decision-maker, and then appeal, because I think you have different standards when you go to an appeal, because first of all the decision is already made."
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1985.834,1995.047,"So if Ohio wants to channel these personnel matters to the Civil Service Commission, then the Civil Service Commission would have to make the initial suspension decision."
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,1995.047,1997.669,"--No, I say the school board would have to make the initial suspension."
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1997.669,2005.215,"Supposing Ohio says, we want all these personnel matters to be considered by a uniform body in the jurisdiction, to wit, the Civil Service Commission."
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,2016.673,2022.836,"Well, it was the impartial decision-maker, because it should be made... the initial termination decision should be made by an impartial decision-maker."
1984.83-1362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2022.836,2027.098,Do you contend the Civil Service Commission in your case was not an impartial decision-maker?
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,2027.098,2034.444,"The Civil Service is an impartial decision-maker, but you are dealing within the appeal, right, instead of the initial decision."
1984.83-1362,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2062.502,2066.265,Loudermill... excuse me.
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,2073.381,2079.255,I believe he was sentenced to six months in the workhouse and fined.
1984.83-1362,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2079.255,2082.457,Did he actually serve for six months?
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,2082.457,2083.786,I believe they were suspended.
1984.83-1362,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2085.138,2086.778,Suspended for all of it?
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,2086.778,2087.619,Right.
1984.83-1362,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2124.552,2140.684,"Mr. Fertel, in both Arnett and in Mathews, this Court found no due process violation, despite the evidence that at least some of the hearings weren't completed for more than a year after the deprivation occurred."
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,2145.997,2150.611,In Mathews versus Eldridge it was a... the question was liability.
1984.83-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2247.515,2254.648,"May I ask, Mr. Fertel, what remedy do you think your clients are entitled to at the end of the road, and what do you think the issues would be at trial?"
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,2260.221,2264.073,"Well, first of all, you can't tell whether they would fire somebody, you know."
1984.83-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2273.43,2283.746,"--What if he had a trial and the federal judge or the jury decided, well, we don't believe his story, just as apparently the Civil Service Commission did?"
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,2283.746,2292.164,"--First of all, he was convicted of dishonesty, so he would have to have an opportunity to... you know, it is just... you know, it is after the fact."
1984.83-1362,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.016,2308.833,"I understand, but supposing at this trial that you seek to have now the determination is that, well, we analyze the facts exactly like the Civil Service Board did, that he was in fact dishonest."
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,2311.745,2315.228,I think you would be entitled to damages for denial of due process.
1984.83-1362,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2348.21,2355.313,"Did you make the point that bad eyesight is not important for a mechanic, but only for a driver?"
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,2355.313,2358.485,"Yes, Your Honor, I raised that issue in front of the Civil Service Commission."
1984.83-1362,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2358.485,2362.539,Do you think that would be true of airplane mechanics as well as automobile mechanics?
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,2362.539,2381.611,"The rationale they gave was that sometimes there is bad weather and they need substitute drivers, and therefore they should have... that sometimes they supposedly would have bus mechanics drive buses, and so I made the Point Number One, I thought if you are going to terminate everybody who can't pass an eye test, if you terminate somebody, you have to terminate everybody."
1984.83-1362,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2411.42,2414.853,"I suppose there are degrees of eye defects, too."
1984.83-1362,1,39234,robert_m_fertel,,2425.849,2426.79,"Well, obviously--"
1984.83-1362,2,33702,james_g_wyman,,3177.935,3183.939,"Yes, I do, Your Honor, a number of statements, possibly factual clarifications."
1984.83-1362,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3330.233,3331.264,"Thank you, gentlemen."
