1987.86-1406,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.558,"We'll hear argument next in number 86-1406, Puerto Rico Department of Consumer Affairs versus Isla Petroleum Corporation."
1987.86-1406,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,61.351,64.32,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.295,699.45,"You conceive of it, that is enough, right?"
1987.86-1406,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,699.45,700.403,--What is that?
1987.86-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,700.403,703.231,"You conceive of it anyway, so it is not inconceivable."
1987.86-1406,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,703.231,703.668,Yes.
1987.86-1406,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.804,1042.757,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
1987.86-1406,1,30821,john_c_harrison,,1045.007,1056.331,"Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1406,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.313,1485.124,"Thank you, Mr. Harrison."
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,1486.749,1494.228,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1536.51,1538.898,Who do those two questions differ so?
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,1538.898,1541.398,"Well, I have not gotten to the second question yet."
1987.86-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1541.398,1543.319,All right.
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,1543.319,1549.13,"The second question, Mr. Chief Justice, is what Congress' purpose was in 1975."
1987.86-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1551.878,1556.018,You propose kind of a dichotomy in your first question.
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,1569.998,1583.632,"--Well, the difference is illustrated, Mr. Chief Justice, by the definition of intention to preempt that is given in this case, which is really central to the analysis of the Petitioners and the Solicitor General."
1987.86-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1676.564,1684.968,Even though Congress may have had in mind at the time that it legislated the necessity to preempt those laws?
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,1684.968,1685.889,That is exactly right.
1987.86-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1697.057,1699.586,"Well, the framers have never seen Congress the way that we have."
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,1699.586,1700.492,That is for sure.
1987.86-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1730.935,1750.302,"How do you apply that kind of analysis to the Sherman Act, for example, where we have just had a case argued a few days ago about the Sherman Act preemption, how can you tell when Congress wants to create a free market to eliminate restraints on competition?"
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,1750.302,1760.532,"Justice Scalia, I do not think that this case is like Commonwealth Edison or Exxon v. Maryland which has been cited, which may be the case that was argued the other day, I do not know."
1987.86-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1760.532,1777.103,"I am talking about Brown, where we have said, well, the Sherman Act really just intended to set forth a federal policy, and we do not read it as meaning the states cannot do what we have said at the federal level that we do not want done."
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,1777.103,1788.552,"The question, Justice Scalia, is when Congress enacted in this case the EPCA in 1975, what had it set its sights on and what means did it choose to get there."
1987.86-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.663,1874.005,Why is it different from the Sherman Act?
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,1874.005,1877.207,"Well, I do not know that I can speak conversantly with the Sherman Act."
1987.86-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1877.207,1878.364,"Well, you know the Sherman Act."
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,1906.635,1909.915,I wish that I were better prepared to respond to the Sherman Act.
1987.86-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1944.259,1956.973,"But I think that you have to deal with some of the contentions that the Petitioner makes, that the Northern Natural Gas case in 1963 had held the whole area preempted."
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,1969.139,1973.904,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that there is that element of Transco."
1987.86-1406,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2067.838,2072.556,May I ask one question.
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2090.406,2092.078,No.
1987.86-1406,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.078,2100.185,Then you are really arguing that preemption occurred at the time of the repeal or the amendment?
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2100.185,2101.824,"That is absolutely correct, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1406,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2128.11,2129.954,"No, no, I did not say if there had been nothing."
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2134.342,2135.873,"Well, that is what was happening in 1975."
1987.86-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2328.233,2347.46,"Of course, all of the legislative history that you point to could be just as well explained by a Congress that really was not averting to state regulation at all, because it never conceived that state regulation would at all be feasible to destroy a free market."
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2364.298,2377.479,"I do not think, Justice Scalia, that the purposes that Congress articulated could be squared with sporadic regulation in certain parts of the country any more than a national regulation."
1987.86-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.479,2379.198,I mean they may not have worried about it.
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2379.198,2380.042,I think that is correct.
1987.86-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.042,2384.135,They assumed that when they passed this federal statute that that was going to be the end of it.
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2393.803,2395.052,I think that is probably right.
1987.86-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2409.03,2410.436,"But Puerto Rico had, had it not?"
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2410.436,2411.264,--Puerto Rico had.
1987.86-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2476.068,2478.502,You sound as though you think that the case should have come out the other way.
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2478.502,2481.002,"Well, no."
1987.86-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2789.805,2793.788,No federal regulation anyway.
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2793.788,2794.834,No federal regulation.
1987.86-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.123,2863.526,This scheme in which the Congress was remaining involved in other areas of regulation.
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2863.526,2870.445,"Well, I do not think that part of the analysis, Justice Scalia, is pegged to the field preemption notion."
1987.86-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2892.093,2899.044,"Of course, how do I know that that is what Congress has in mind, to sweep the field and leave it to free competition?"
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2947.977,2949.149,--I do not think that it is in either place.
1987.86-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2949.868,2951.696,You want me to read state of the union addresses.
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2951.696,2961.24,"--Well, I would hate to suggest that every piece of legislative interpretation requires a resort to the state of the union addresses."
1987.86-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2971.484,2975.514,"The only place where you find support for your position is not in the Act, but in the debate."
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2975.514,2978.56,"No, it is in the Act too, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2998.974,3004.005,But here Congress got into the business of regulating gas prices on 1973.
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,3016.062,3025.931,"Well, let us look if I can, Mr. Chief Justice, at some part of what as said in the course of the legislative history leading to the 1975 legislation."
1987.86-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3025.931,3034.96,"You have some of that to support you, but that seems extremely weak when you do not have a single sentence of an enacted law."
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,3034.96,3040.894,"Well, there are many cases in which this Court has applied a Hines v. Davidowitz kind of preemption analysis."
1987.86-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3040.894,3045.159,A law that repealed all congressional involvement in the area?
1987.86-1406,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,3045.159,3048.815,"No, this is the only case in which we have complete deregulation."
1987.86-1406,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3174.373,3176.199,"Thank you, Mr. Evans."
1987.86-1406,3,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,3179.698,3181.354,Thank you.
1987.86-1406,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3448.854,3450.838,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
