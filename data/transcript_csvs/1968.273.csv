1968.273,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,38.543,"Number 273, Russell Scofield et al., Petitioners versus National Labor Relations Board et al."
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,39.996,44.188,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.273,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,97.934,108.175,"And when you say set by the union, am I wrong that this was whatever the ceilings are they were embodied in the collective bargaining agreement?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,108.175,113.537,The subject of the ceilings was bargained from time-to-time.
1968.273,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,113.537,119.55,"But weren't the actual ceilings agreed upon between management, no?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,119.55,126.108,They were not agreed upon in the sense that they were a limit on the employee.
1968.273,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,154.451,173.613,Mr. Justice Brennan's question exposes what for me has been a difficulty in reading the briefs and to answer this argument and that is the apparent disagreement among the parties as to what the facts are.
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,218.022,222.049,I think there's some truth in both positions.
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,336.604,360.5,"Mr. Urdan may I see if I understand this, the collective bargaining agreement established or there was established pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement certain ceilings of any employee who produced above the particular ceiling was entitled to additional pay, is that correct?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,360.5,364.657,The collective bargaining did not establish ceilings.
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,379.114,393.644,"Is there a flat rate, flat rate no matter how much he produced or was there a point at which the incentive pay, that is to say a greater rate of pay was due?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,393.644,401.186,"The incentive pay started from the beginning, but there were certain guarantees in the contract."
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,402.858,413.627,"But if an employee reaches a certain number of units, is he entitled to incentive pay beginning with the units at that point?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,413.627,419.527,The pay is computed on the actual production starting with the first unit.
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,439.069,451.871,"That is to say there is a guarantee and I assume that that guarantee is equal to the per unit rate times a certain number of units, is that right?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,451.871,455.53,The guarantee is generally in terms of an hourly rate --
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,455.53,474.15,"I understand sir that but I'm trying to get an answer to this question perhaps I am -- I must be asking it very badly, but in your brief I've had the same difficulty with your brief as my brother Stewart."
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,516.878,519.061,I would say that is not the way it works.
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,519.061,520.104,Alright.
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,520.104,523.693,There is not a ceiling in the collective bargaining agreement.
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,563.764,570.303,Is that ceiling the same as the minimum guaranteed wage?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,570.303,572.585,"No, it is a higher rate."
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,572.585,573.058,"It's higher, alright."
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,573.058,579.688,It exceeds the minimum guaranteed rate.
1968.273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.298,617.946,But you are not suggesting that the union action is in breach of contract?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,617.946,622.508,"I think we are very close, we are very close to this line."
1968.273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,623.552,640.041,You are not suggesting that an employee who is also bound by the contract who works only enough to earn again the minimum and who never attempts to earn anymore is breaching the contract?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,640.041,641.528,This could be possible.
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,646.411,647.832,Are you serious?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,655.851,662.893,"When you say breaching the contract, I think we are getting at a concept of what the employer is entitled to."
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,669.247,674.937,"Well, that isn't what the contract says, is it?"
1968.273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.937,677.591,"Well, do you find that in the contract anywhere?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,677.591,687.46,"Not that language, however the contract does set shifts and I think it is recognized that -–"
1968.273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,687.46,692.323,Well are you willing to put your case on whether or not there is breach of contract there?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,692.323,693.683,Absolutely not.
1968.273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.683,695.478,"Well, I wouldn't think so."
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,695.478,697.603,This not our position.
1968.273,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,697.603,699.727,You represent employees?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,699.727,701.512,That is correct.
1968.273,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,701.512,702.693,Not the employer.
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,702.693,703.182,We represent the employees.
1968.273,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,703.182,705.012,You are the representative of employees.
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,705.012,706.812,We represent the individuals.
1968.273,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,712.825,723.786,"However, you are hardly in position say that that your clients or their colleagues have violated a contract, your argument is there anything any position like that, are you?"
1968.273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,723.786,739.611,"You wouldn't suggest that your employer, your people are because you are attempting to earn incentive pay, but the employee who doesn't attempt to earn incentive pay you are suggesting might be in breach of contract?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,739.611,741.713,What I am suggesting is that in an employment --
1968.273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,741.713,758.355,"Or would you say that 10 employees all of them get together and say we don't want to earn any incentive pay, and that's all agreed that we won't earn any incentive pay, you say that isn't protected by such Section 7?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,758.355,770.213,"An agreement to limit production, which is negotiated with an employer and which is incorporated in the collective bargaining agreement is protected."
1968.273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.679,800.106,I agree with that but then here there has been negotiated with an employer a scale of pay depending upon your effort and I doubt if an employer could just fire an employee under this contract for earning only the minimum pay?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,800.106,802.198,Well I tend to agree with that.
1968.273,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,816.335,842.474,"Incidentally this banking arrangement I understand that -- do I understand correctly, an employee need not report everything he has earned in a given period, but he banks it in the sense that sometime later he produces less units he can draw on the excess that he built up at an earlier time."
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,842.474,844.226,That is the way the process works.
1968.273,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,844.226,849.061,Well now doesn't that require the participation of the employer?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,849.061,853.172,The employer has accepted this as a procedure --
1968.273,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,853.172,857.765,No my question was doesn't he participate in it?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,857.765,860.327,No the employee keeps his own records of his bank.
1968.273,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,860.327,865.302,I know but doesn't the employer participate in that arrangement?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,865.302,866.48,I would say he does not.
1968.273,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,868.278,869.501,What does he do --
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,869.501,872.297,He pays for the production that is reported.
1968.273,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,876.728,883.71,"You don't regard that as participating later when he had done reports, the excess and some later pay period."
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,883.71,888.574,The employer generally did not have records as to when the actual production took place.
1968.273,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,888.574,890.173,That (Inaudible).
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,890.173,894.657,The employer paid as the work was reported for pay.
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,894.657,904.843,"Well the care string appears though whatever it may be, I don't know we'd say something suddenly appears and somebody's work is done, isn't that right?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,904.843,906.055,That is correct.
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,906.055,910.683,Well then are you suggesting that the employer doesn't know that anyway?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,910.683,922.664,"The record is quite confused on his point, but the picture that comes out is that the employer does not reconcile the pieces flowing through with the pay records."
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,926.396,933.427,"Is this a sovereign company, is this a sovereign company despite that kind of quaint practice?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,933.427,937.21,I think this is a very pertinent question.
1968.273,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1138.571,1148.982,"If the employer you said tried to discipline the employee for this type of restriction, the employer could and you said your opponent concedes that, I don't understand the statement."
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,1162.042,1165.479,It is not for not trying to make more pay --
1968.273,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1165.479,1169.137,What is the meaning of the statement that I disclosed?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,1169.137,1188.806,"A restriction on production by slow down, similar methods has been found to be unprotected activity under the act, such that the employer may lawfully discipline the employee for engaging in such an activity."
1968.273,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1188.806,1194.281,"And this case the applying that principle to this case, what do you say the employer could have done?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,1194.281,1210.075,"In this case, the people who are engaging in ceiling practices to the point of not performing their work, as the record shows, stopping work an hour or two early and reading magazine --"
1968.273,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1210.075,1215.366,"Because an hour or two before the eight hours have elapsed, they've completed their--"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,1215.366,1218.139,They completed their –-
1968.273,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1218.139,1227.166,And you say that having done so the employees could be fired?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,1227.166,1232.022,"I am saying so far as the Act is concerned, this is an unprotected activity."
1968.273,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1272.493,1279.857,"This collective bargaining agreement provided that's what the question would be in that kind of case, wouldn't it?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,1279.857,1289.99,"The collective bargaining agreement also provides restrictions on discipline. Discipline must be for just cause, this is the customary standard."
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1289.99,1306.919,"Actually you are saying that contrary, aren't you, that there are certain rights which the employee would have regardless of what the collective bargaining agreement provides in this situation, is that what you're saying?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,1306.919,1314.206,If the collective bargaining agreement established the ceiling and said you cannot collect more pay no matter what you produce --
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1314.206,1345.625,"Now suppose a collective bargaining expressly, in the collective bargaining agreement, employer and the union expressly agreed on a ceiling that an employee may quit and go home and then it provides for a -- incentives for additional production thereafter, and then it provides for this banking arrangement, just exactly what's here."
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,1358.25,1359.153,Very definitely.
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1366.278,1366.681,But --
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,1366.681,1372.461,Union cannot make a bargain with the employer and then pull it away by its fine?
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1372.461,1396.546,"Suppose the agreement expressly said that the union, that pursuant to union rules employees maybe prohibited from working more than enough to earn the base pay?"
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,1396.546,1401.866,I can only say that would be a very remarkable contract.
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1403.2,1413.105,What's making here in effect is saying that it's a part of the agreement they are saying that the employer acquiesced in it?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,1413.105,1427.809,"I think this is the point raised in the brief of the amicus here, that the question of whether the union has a rule that can be enforced should not be part of the bargaining process."
1968.273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.526,1550.865,"Well, it's (Inaudible)."
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,1550.865,1552.739,That is correct.
1968.273,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2010.835,2026.869,Is there any difference between the terms of the order entered as part of the court's opinion on March 5 and the decree issued on April 16th?
1968.273,0,33331,james_urdan,,2026.869,2029.186,There is no difference in substance.
1968.273,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2133.657,2136.846,Mr. Come?
1968.273,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2136.846,2144.884,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?"
1968.273,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2149.523,2151.46,[Inaudible]
1968.273,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2151.46,2152.346,Yes.
1968.273,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2152.346,2163.824,[Inaudible]
1968.273,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2163.824,2187.539,"Well, we believe nonetheless that under the Minneapolis Honeywell decision of this Court that the petition was untimely filed and that the 90-day period runs from the date of the March 5 order."
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4047.165,4051.132,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1968.273,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4142.247,4157.608,"Well, the employees here though do have a -- are beneficiary to this contract or parties to it and they do have a contractual right against the employer to take advantage of the incentive plan and to be paid and to collect their money then?"
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4157.608,4158.425,And if this were --
1968.273,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4158.425,4162.292,"And when they work and say pay me, the employer must pay them?"
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4162.292,4162.917,Right Your Honor and --
1968.273,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4162.917,4167.631,And that right the union and this union bylaw certainly interferes with it?
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4167.631,4172.402,"Right, we would know, I wouldn't say right Your Honor I would say wrong on two accounts."
1968.273,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4176.285,4176.573,I understand that --
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4176.573,4192.981,"-- live up to his contract, we say that two distinctions in this case and I want to emphasize they're quite two -- quite separate reasons why this bylaw is not of the order of the Homebuilders' case where the union is asking its member to violate the contract, either rights of the employer under the contract, of the employee under the contract."
1968.273,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4223.169,4236.42,Conceding that though the there still is the fact that the union by law does interfere with the contractual rights of the employee against the employer.
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4236.42,4237.837,Let us say it this way.
1968.273,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4238.52,4240.498,Well I'm not saying it that way.
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4240.498,4246.289,"I will say it infringes upon the contract to that employee, but may I say this Your Honor, Allis-Chalmers did too."
1968.273,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4259.192,4261.777,That isn't what I'm saying.
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4276.851,4276.966,No --
1968.273,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4276.966,4285.981,"He's worked above the ceiling, he's entitled to be paid and the -- and he can demand the money from the employer and the union says you may not collect it?"
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4285.981,4291.245,"No Your Honor, I'd say that if they were contracts, breach of contract suit brought by the employer here to test the question --"
1968.273,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4291.245,4293.082,"No, no I don't suggest there is any breach of contract."
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4293.082,4294.929,"Well, let me forget the contracts."
1968.273,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4303.13,4307.95,"Well, this isn't the point I'm making, you're just not --"
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4307.95,4308.423,I'm not getting it Your Honor.
1968.273,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4308.423,4310.168,You are communicating.
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4310.168,4318.656,"I don't think there is a vested right by a union member in this plant to work over the union ceiling, because we think the employer has agreed that no union member shall --"
1968.273,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4318.656,4320.02,That isn't what I said.
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4328.783,4331.823,"Oh he may collect it as a matter of contract right, of course."
1968.273,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4331.823,4334.479,"He may not though, without breaking the union bylaw."
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4334.479,4344.537,"As a matter of fact, he may risk breaking the union bylaw as these gentlemen have done, but as a matter of contractual right, he has a right to collect all that he earned by production and of course --"
1968.273,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4344.537,4357.475,"But these union members collected their money and worked over the ceiling, asked the employer to be paid now, they were paid as they were entitled to be, as far as the employer was concerned and the union filed the report?"
1968.273,2,32788,john_silard,,4357.475,4358.678,That's right.
1968.273,3,33331,james_urdan,,5327.385,5335.927,I'd like to comment first on the last two points made by counsel for the union.
1968.273,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5495.868,5517.97,"Why isn't that an ample answer to the employer if he really thinks the doing only the machine rate is not a decent day's work, to suggest that he negotiate a different level of what a satisfactory day's work is and put it in the collective bargaining agreement with the union?"
1968.273,3,33331,james_urdan,,5517.97,5524.094,This would be the proper way for the employer to proceed.
1968.273,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5681.502,5699.421,"Yes, but in Allis-Chalmers the employer invites workers back and will take them back and pay them if they come to work, when an employee says I want to come to work, and if he does, and the union fines him."
1968.273,3,33331,james_urdan,,5703.621,5708.595,I might say first we certainly don't agree with the Allis-Chalmers decision.
1968.273,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5715.495,5726.388,"And further more in Allis-Chalmers if the employee obeyed the rule and stayed away it might very well be, that he wouldn't have a job, because he might be permanently replaced?"
1968.273,3,33331,james_urdan,,5726.388,5737.15,"That's exactly right and I think this is a great evil of the Allis-Chalmers decision, and a great evil of the union position here that it puts the employee in the middle."
1968.273,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5750.847,5755.652,"Yes but given how Allis-Chalmers, what about this case?"
1968.273,3,33331,james_urdan,,5760.637,5767.095,There are two very important distinctions from the Allis-Chalmers case.
1968.273,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5911.428,5913.025,Is that on the record?
1968.273,3,33331,james_urdan,,5913.025,5915.436,No it is not.
