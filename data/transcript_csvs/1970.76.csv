1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.837,"-- arguments in number 76, Amalgamated Association against Lockridge."
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,43.773,47.559,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,216.266,223.89,How long after his delinquency arose for the October dues did the union terminate him?
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,223.89,226.254,"The union, Your Honor, did not terminate him."
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,235.53,241.957,When did they notify him that he was out of the union?
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,241.957,242.289,They --
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,242.289,244.264,For non-payment of dues?
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,244.264,252.928,"They had advised him, Your Honor, in advanced that he would be out of the union if he permitted his delinquency to be in arrears more than one month."
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,252.928,260.576,"Oh, what I’m trying to do that is how many hours or days was he delinquent when the acts fell?"
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,260.576,263.041,He was delinquent --
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,263.041,264.515,"24 hours, does it?"
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,264.515,265.39,About 48 hours.
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,265.39,266.023,48 hours?
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,266.023,269.076,"Yes, that is correct Your Honor."
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,270.064,282.317,"Does the union uniformally act in that way on every dues -- non-payment of dues every case, or does this record show anything on that score?"
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,282.317,287.78,The record indicates two things with respect to that Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,687.912,692.013,"Mr. Groner, my I ask you a question here, a general question?"
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,711.89,720.926,"Well, there’s no question that unions in general have a duty of fairly representing all those in the bargaining unit."
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,729.454,731.739,"Well, I put it little further."
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,750.009,750.809,No sir.
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,752.578,754.581,You mean he is an adversary?
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,754.581,757.823,"In this case, he comported himself as one --"
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,757.823,764.19,"48 hours -- 48 hour -- on a 48-hour delinquency in his dues, he becomes an adversary instead of a beneficiary?"
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,764.19,773.231,"Well, there are other alternatives Your Honor between being an outright adversary and responding to your question that the union must defend him in every way."
1970.76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,897.205,906.442,"Let’s assume that all he asked for in his suit was restoration of his membership of the union, that’s his claim?"
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,906.442,922.321,"If that was all he asked for in the suit and if all the other circumstances indicated that the crux of the action was the membership relationship rather than the employment relationship, then the state courts would have had jurisdiction to adjudicate it."
1970.76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,922.321,929.569,Sue just on the contract basis or to entertain whatever his action was?
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,929.569,931.7,"No Your Honor, no."
1970.76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,931.7,938.122,Given your some position would be that the state court could have entertained him?
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,938.122,942.999,Oh yes and could have granted the relief of restoration to union membership.
1970.76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,942.999,966.25,"But if he said I also want by the way not only restoration, but I would like some damages for my lost wages which I lost because I didn’t have my membership, now It’s wrongfully the fact -- that act let's that prayer in his complaint, is he awkward right there?"
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,966.25,976.961,I do not think that there is a -- that I can answer your question directly Mr. Justice White because it would depend upon many other factors.
1970.76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.903,1002.566,If he says I was wrongfully terminated from membership of the union and I want my membership back and I want damages for the lost wages?
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1002.566,1010.485,"The damages for lost wages, where the wages of course would relate to employment, a state court would have no jurisdiction to grant."
1970.76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1010.485,1011.756,In any circumstances?
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1011.756,1016.172,"Under any circumstances, yes Your Honor."
1970.76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1052.701,1065.219,"And you give the same answer if he had already gone to the General Counsel and filed a complaint and the General Counsel rejected it, and then he said well I must get a hearing some place, I’m going to go to court."
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1067.563,1068.062,Yes Your Honor.
1970.76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.521,1134.47,"Now (b) had alleged discriminatory conduct amounting to what he alleged was a breach the duty of fair representation, he could have stayed in the court?"
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1134.47,1135.716,If he had done so?
1970.76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.716,1136.588,Yes.
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1136.588,1138.334,"If he had done so, yes."
1970.76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1170.276,1171.154,Yes.
1970.76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1171.154,1175.003,"Oh Mr. Groner, what difference of punitive damages make, if any?"
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1175.003,1175.739,"I’m sorry, I didn’t --"
1970.76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1175.739,1183.654,"What difference does it make that he also asked for punitive damages, is that necessary at all in your case, is it?"
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1183.654,1184.313,No.
1970.76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1244.719,1247.264,"Well, what was the basis for the amount of damages?"
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1250.053,1252.565,"No, he would was."
1970.76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1259.92,1266.419,What I’m trying to get at that that’s the same thing he would have done if the NLRB had agreed to him and given him back wages?
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1266.419,1266.909,"Well, --"
1970.76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1266.909,1268.295,-- true are not.
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1268.295,1271.36,"It is the back pay, yes."
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1290.586,1296.518,"Mr. Groner, assume that it had moved over into the federal court pursuant to your efforts."
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1317.33,1320.176,"Well, I don’t see how that could have been done."
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1367.269,1376.759,Do you thing the equitable rules would -- doctrines would have no application to the relations between the Union and its members?
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1377.655,1379.471,In some other -- I’m sorry?
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1379.471,1383.591,Is it controlled exclusively by the statute?
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1383.591,1388.129,"It is con -- in any lawsuit Your Honor, no."
1970.76,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1476.507,1493.128,"Mr. Groner, what the -- I suppose, it’s difficult to talk abstractly, but let’s assume that this matter had gone to the board and the board had decided that there was no unfairly for practice here?"
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1510.209,1514.453,"Well, I don’t’ know as it would -- as it would be therefore."
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1546.676,1553.451,You mean that would be within the jurisdiction of the state court and not subject to preemption?
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1553.451,1568.812,"Under Borden and Perko Your Honor as we understand it, the text -- the test is what the crux of the action is, and if the crux of the action is the employment relationship, yes, the state court has jurisdiction."
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1568.812,1574.845,"But if it’s membership in the Union, is that exclusively federal in your view?"
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1574.845,1575.576,"No, Your Honor."
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1586.466,1599.922,"And why doesn’t the -- to pursue Justice White’s point, why doesn’t the suit for damages for wrongful termination of the membership, and therefore the employment fall in the same slot?"
1970.76,0,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1599.922,1627.371,"It does not Your Honor because with respect to the employment aspects of it, Congress has litigated and in the congressional litigation, Congress covered all such cases, and in covering all such cases, Congress provided that the National Labor Relations Act shall be the determining law and provided that the National Labor Relations Board shall be the tribunal."
1970.76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1663.243,1666.556,Very well.
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,1668.996,1673.901,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1970.76,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1731.073,1736.528,"Mr. Kilcullen, let me ask you there because you are repeating what Mr. Groner said."
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,1746.693,1748.982,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1970.76,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1779.5,1780.189,In this case --
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,1780.189,1780.543,His dues are --
1970.76,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1780.543,1781.742,-- is in the end of November?
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,1781.742,1797.272,"His dues are in arrears, and where a member allows his arrears and dues finds some assessments to run into the second month before paying the same shall be barred from benefit."
1970.76,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1797.272,1802.404,"But then, he suspended at the end of the second month which would be November 30th?"
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,1802.404,1809.117,"That would be November 30th, yes sir."
1970.76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2134.006,2136.671,"Now, what were you citing there?"
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2136.671,2140.989,This is in Gonzales Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2425.644,2440.73,"Now, it’s your -- it’s the theory of your brother on the other side, Mr. Groner as I understood him that had that kind of a lawsuit been brought in the state court, the defendant could have removed it to the federal court."
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2443.062,2452.521,"He could have Mr. Justice Stewart, but he could also have removed it as it was here."
1970.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2466.032,2467.278,You say there was diversity?
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2467.278,2468.026,Yes.
1970.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2468.682,2474.686,"Well, I didn’t understand Mr. Groner to be relying on diversity, but rather on federal question."
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2474.686,2474.902,I say --
1970.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2474.902,2475.701,Or well he didn’t.
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2475.784,2483.324,I say could have removed on whatever grounds was available and diversity was available to him to remove.
1970.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2483.324,2504.612,"But do you think in the absence of diversity of citizenship, either a failure to fairly represent complaint on the one hand or this sort of a complaint on the other would stay the case, it was removable to the federal court by the defendant in the absence of diversity?"
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2504.612,2505.932,"I think it would be removable, yes."
1970.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2505.932,2507.048,Both of them?
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2507.048,2516.809,"But I think the failure to remove is not -- did not prejudice the petitioner here, for the reason that petitioner had the opportunity to remove the case as it was."
1970.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2516.809,2517.583,Yes.
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2519.005,2521.448,Right.
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2523.022,2529.083,The petitioner also complains that he didn’t have chance at the NLRB?
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2529.083,2529.832,I’m sorry.
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2529.832,2538.433,The petitioner also complains that that he didn’t have a chance to argue the case before the NLRB?
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2538.433,2538.449,Well --
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2538.449,2540.428,Not just the federal court.
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2540.428,2555.539,"They -- the respondent here did not file a charge with the labor board because his co-worker, Day, filed the charge with the labor board, and the labor board refused to entertain it."
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2616.585,2623.145,But do you agree that this is strictly a matter between Lockridge and the Union?
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2623.145,2634.086,"This is the -- the source of this action, the thing that caused the injury was his suspension from the union, that was the first cause."
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2634.086,2645.847,Or in the language of the Perko that was principally if not entirely on the union’s action with respect to the member’s efforts to obtain employment.
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2648.513,2649.435,That’s correct.
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2653.2,2654.523,"Now I know, but --"
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2654.523,2656.836,But Perko was never suspended from the union.
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2660.645,2672.891,"Well, isn’t that one of the basis for the holding of this Court that where it is entirely or at least principally a matter between the man -- the union, you first talk to NLRB?"
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2672.891,2673.382,No.
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2704.063,2729.994,"Well, the language, you dispute is language that's quoted here in the Government’s brief on page 11 at the top of the page?"
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2729.994,2731.567,"No, I don’t dispute that."
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2732.503,2734.136,This was just quoted to you?
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2734.136,2744.239,This was a distinction that I believe this Court was making in Perko and Borden between Perko and Borden on the one hand and Gonzales on the other.
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2784.176,2788.492,But if the union gave him back his membership wouldn’t he have his job?
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2788.492,2790.181,"Yes, he would have."
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2790.181,2794.001,"So, union is in it at the beginning and that end of it?"
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2794.001,2795.375,That’s correct.
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2795.375,2799.53,And the company is not in it at all?
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2799.53,2802.572,"Well, he could have sued the company under 301."
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2803.122,2806.201,But he did sue the company and then dropped the charge?
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2806.201,2822.177,"Yes, because -- well Your Honor, that was before Smith versus Evening News, that was back in 1960, and this the court -- this Court had not at that point developed quite clearly the 301 concept."
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2864.52,2877.924,"Regardless to that, when the case gets to us, it’s obvious in action of a complaint of an employee against his own labor union."
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2877.924,2878.363,Yes sir.
1970.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2878.363,2881.304,"Period, nothing more in it?"
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,2881.304,2883.83,"That’s the way this case is here, right."
1970.76,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3075.951,3077.686,For their refusal to what?
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,3077.686,3081.113,For their refusal to continue the check-off.
1970.76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3108.041,3114.979,"You haven’t spoken at all Mr. Kilcullen, nor have you cited the cases as far as I can see."
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,3128.555,3145.79,"This doctrine originated Mr. Chief Justice I believe with the Steel and Tunstall cases, and it has evolved through the years and has been most recently reaffirmed by this Court in a series of cases."
1970.76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3174.838,3187.795,"Well, I’d almost thought and the authorities who write about them seem to think that the fiduciary is much broader, much more pervasive than the duty of fair representation?"
1970.76,1,31221,john_l_kilcullen,,3187.795,3188.606,It could be.
1970.76,2,28565,isaac_n_groner,,3538.823,3544.568,"Yes, it would for a reason that I’ll come to, but we have alternative positions."
1970.76,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3554.468,3570.379,"Because I thought you conceded in your argument in chief that an action for full restoration of union membership is a state law action between the member and the union which would be maintainable in the state court, wouldn’t it?"
1970.76,2,28565,isaac_n_groner,,3570.379,3573.749,"If that was all there was to it, yes Mr. Justice Brennan."
1970.76,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3573.749,3581.611,"But when you ask for that in the state court and also damages, then, the state court has the jurisdiction as to both remedies?"
1970.76,2,28565,isaac_n_groner,,3581.611,3596.902,"When you have a claim which involves the employment relationship and presumably, when you mentioned the word damages, you are I assume referring to damages measured by wages."
1970.76,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3598.094,3600.258,"So, this is damages for loss of earnings?"
1970.76,2,28565,isaac_n_groner,,3600.258,3604.943,"This is damages measured in this case, measured directly by wages without any question."
1970.76,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3631.693,3643.368,"Well I know, but I know your time is limited, but why is it this to say, the law of Idaho is that we disregard the pleadings."
1970.76,2,28565,isaac_n_groner,,3660.29,3664.43,"Because it is not a question of state law Mr. Justice Brennan, it is a question --"
1970.76,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3664.43,3674.63,"You mean that no matter how you look at it, this is only a remedy for an action with -- the thrust of which was directed at the employment relationship and not at the membership --"
1970.76,2,28565,isaac_n_groner,,3674.63,3676.548,Beyond any question.
1970.76,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3754.39,3755.652,Thank you Mr. Groner.
