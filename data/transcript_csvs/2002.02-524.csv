2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.242,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 02-524, Janette Price, Warden versus Duyonn Andre Vincent."
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,14.105,17.29,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,72.11,79.506,"When you... when you say this was a factual matter, I got the impression that as to basic facts, there really wasn't any dispute about them."
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,79.506,89.588,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the Michigan Supreme Court was evaluating what exactly this trial judge said."
2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,101.364,105.66,"But... but there was no... all I'm saying, there was no doubt about what... what he said."
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,111.017,122.669,"Your Honor, the factual question in terms of what it was that he said is... is different than what he had actually done."
2002.02-524,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,132.863,134.637,"Well, I guess there are really three questions, aren't there?"
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,156.815,158.701,"Yes, that's correct."
2002.02-524,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,158.701,170.026,"So there are three questions, and... and which one... is the middle one, what he meant, as opposed to what he said... is that a factual or a... or a legal one?"
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,170.026,180.921,That... it would be our position that it is a factual question and courts... the Court in Parker versus Dugger and Wainwright versus Goode have dealt with this issue.
2002.02-524,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,187.25,189.174,I'm sure actually... your inference.
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,253.912,255.627,--Well--
2002.02-524,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,255.627,259.434,But that's something of a quibble because I don't know that leads us to a different place.
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,259.434,264.831,"--The Michigan court found that this trial judge's decision was, in fact, tentative."
2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,286.605,286.95,What page?
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,286.95,289.433,--Page 12 of the--
2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,289.433,291.548,Page 12 of what?
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,291.548,296.411,--At the bottom of page 12 of the joint... the joint appendix.
2002.02-524,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,378.174,379.685,What about the docket entry?
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,381.598,391.35,--There was a docket entry which was made by a clerk which was not reviewed by... and which is not reviewed by the trial judge.
2002.02-524,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,401.53,406.233,May I... may I just ask you a further question to make sure that I understand the... the sort of the assumption behind your argument?
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,466.626,467.354,That's correct.
2002.02-524,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,467.354,467.972,Okay.
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,467.972,497.186,"The Court has also... and without conceding my case, in the alternative, if this Court was to conclude that this judge had, in fact, issued or made a judgment of acquittal, it would be the people's position or the petitioner's position that the trial court need not be able to reconsider to reach a just result because they... they rule so swiftly."
2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,513.162,525.989,"Well, Mr. Busch, this case here come... the case comes to us under... under AEDPA; that is, that you don't have to show that the Michigan Supreme Court was correct as a matter of law in its decision."
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,542.618,544.378,Exactly.
2002.02-524,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,552.135,576.193,"Mr. Busch, why wouldn't it be unreasonable if, as respondent asserts, the Michigan rules provide that a directed verdict made at the close of the evidence, that the judge may not reserve decision, must decide it, may not reserve decision."
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,585.455,597.298,"Yes, and in fact, in this particular case, the judge did not come to a conclusion as to... did not enter a verdict of acquittal."
2002.02-524,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,609.08,615.289,They... did they address... I didn't notice that the court had addressed the Michigan rule that said--
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,615.289,616.762,--They--
2002.02-524,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,616.762,617.756,--you can't reserve decision.
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,617.756,634.433,"--The rule of the Michigan courts... that is, the Michigan Rules of Criminal Procedure at 6.419, I believe it is... requires that there be some plain statement made, essentially, that there be something clear."
2002.02-524,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.427,639.737,I don't understand what you mean.
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,645.912,647.954,--Yes.
2002.02-524,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.954,651.959,--when a motion is made at the close of all... was this motion made at the close of all the evidence?
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,651.959,654.847,At these of the prosecutor's proof.
2002.02-524,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,654.847,656.278,Is that what the rule applies to?
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,660.435,663.716,It... it applies when the motion is made is my understanding.
2002.02-524,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.716,664.952,I don't understand that.
2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,664.952,667.006,"Well, that's not really an answer."
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,677.059,677.396,No.
2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,679.284,680.282,"A motion can be made, but--"
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,680.282,683.717,"--That is, the motion for a directed verdict of acquittal."
2002.02-524,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,683.717,690.594,"--Do you have the rule, the rule of criminal procedure, so we'll know... that might give us the answer to this question."
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,690.594,691.932,The--
2002.02-524,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,691.932,698.461,The Michigan rule that says the trial judge shall not reserve decision on the defendant's motion.
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,703.81,713.732,"--The rule is 6.419(D), and it's cited at page 17 of the petitioner's brief."
2002.02-524,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,713.732,714.68,Is it quoted there too?
2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,714.68,715.978,What does it say?
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,715.978,738.277,"It says... about in the middle of the page in... in bold, it says, did not substantially comply with the requirements of MCR 6.419(D), and provide that, quote, the court must state orally on the record or in a written ruling made a... a part of the record its reasons for granting or denying a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal."
2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,750.702,751.068,Well--
2002.02-524,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,751.068,751.34,--What is--
2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,751.34,763.851,"--But in ordinary trial practice certainly you... you can't... the defense counsel in a criminal case can't get up after the prosecution has called two witnesses and said, I move for... I... I move for a judgment of acquittal."
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,767.057,767.359,Yes.
2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,767.359,770.05,--after the close of the prosecution's case.
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,770.05,772.303,"That's correct, once the evidence is presented."
2002.02-524,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,772.303,777.544,"And what has the rule, as you just quoted it, got to do with... with reservation?"
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,794.199,802.621,"The rights of the judge to change his mind... our... our position is, is that he has that right until the jury would be discharged."
2002.02-524,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,802.621,804.265,"Well, does the rule address that?"
2002.02-524,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,818.625,820.549,"In respondent's brief, it's put in quotes."
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,830.229,831.876,"Yes, that--"
2002.02-524,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,831.876,833.616,Do those words appear in the rule?
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,833.616,834.892,"--Yes, that's the rule."
2002.02-524,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,834.892,836.105,That's fine.
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,840.245,842.924,"That's my... I don't think it's specific, but I think the--"
2002.02-524,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,842.924,843.454,Wow.
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,843.454,844.675,--Chief Justice--
2002.02-524,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,844.675,848.906,"So after two witnesses are called by the prosecution, the motion can be made and the judge cannot reserve?"
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,848.906,850.195,--Excuse me.
2002.02-524,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,855.166,858.437,Do... do we have the full text of this rule before us?
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,858.437,868.268,"The rule is quoted at page 29a, note 1 of the--"
2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,868.268,869.016,29 of the--
2002.02-524,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,869.016,869.581,--Of what?
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,869.581,870.291,--Of our brief.
2002.02-524,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,870.291,872.289,29?
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,872.289,873.218,Excuse me.
2002.02-524,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,879.419,880.516,29.
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,880.516,881.764,--petitioner's appendix.
2002.02-524,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.764,889.469,Petitioner's appendix?
2002.02-524,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,889.469,891.056,The cert petition.
2002.02-524,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.056,892.594,In the cert petition.
2002.02-524,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,892.594,893.566,"Yes, and footnoted."
2002.02-524,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,893.566,900.479,Yes.
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,902.706,903.897,"Yes, that's right."
2002.02-524,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,903.897,907.199,It's a little hard to understand that.
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,960.252,963.296,"Your Honor, I--"
2002.02-524,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,963.296,965.686,It can't mean instantly.
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,966.383,971.478,--The... the rule means that he should decide as promptly as he can is the way I understand--
2002.02-524,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,971.478,973.103,"Now, Mr. Busch, may I make this suggestion?"
2002.02-524,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,980.608,981.155,Yes.
2002.02-524,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,981.155,984.695,"It says in the latter case, the judge can reserve, take his time on it."
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,984.695,985.224,--Yes.
2002.02-524,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,985.224,997.435,"It seems to... it strikes me, just reading the thing, that the point of the rule is that before the defense goes forward, the defense has a right to know what the ruling is."
2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,997.435,998.512,That's what I would think.
2002.02-524,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,998.512,1011.662,"Now, in this case before the defense went forward, it knew what the ruling was because the judge had come in the next morning and said, okay, I... you know, I've... I'm going to listen to you again."
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,1033.071,1035.77,"Yes, and I think that happened in this case."
2002.02-524,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1043.218,1043.641,No.
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,1063.782,1064.944,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-524,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1064.944,1065.554,Okay.
2002.02-524,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1065.554,1066.55,But you would say that if the--
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,1066.55,1066.849,May... can... can I--
2002.02-524,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1066.849,1088.742,"--if the defendant was operating under the impression that the... if the defendant didn't know before he put on his case, would it be too late for the judge to change his mind at the end of the defense case?"
2002.02-524,0,15607,arthur_a_busch,,1088.742,1089.125,--Our... no.
2002.02-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1099.681,1100.967,"Yes, you may, Mr. Busch."
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1102.513,1120.97,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-524,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1173.239,1179.481,"I guess we never reach your... your argument, do we, if we decide this on the 2254 ground."
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1179.481,1180.908,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-524,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.946,1187.634,"Well, we shouldn't reach your ground unless we have to, should we?"
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1189.544,1199.322,"--Well, Your Honor, the Court would have discretion to reach the constitutional ground if it thought it were important enough to resolve the disagreements in the State courts and their... their rulings that are contrary to--"
2002.02-524,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1199.322,1202.312,I thought we try to avoid deciding constitutional questions.
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1202.312,1202.583,--Yes.
2002.02-524,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.875,1229.985,"Well, that's sort of a special situation because in those situations you could never get the answer if you always decided it on... on immunity grounds."
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1230.839,1238.226,"Justice Scalia, the Court would have discretion to reach the constitutional issue if it chose, but it would... certainly would not be required to do so."
2002.02-524,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1265.536,1285.397,"--If we follow the position that you're urging and... and the judge rules, as here, premeditation is out of the case, I'm not going to charge first degree, defendant puts on defendant's case on the assumption first degree is out of the case and then the judge says at the end, oh, sorry, I'm reversing and I'm going to charge."
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1294.346,1297.831,"--For double jeopardy purposes, but not for due process purposes."
2002.02-524,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1333.738,1348.614,"So then in Fong Foo when Judge Wyzanski I think got angry at the prosecution for some reason that escaped the Court and everyone else, directs an acquittal, what the prosecutor should have done is just go back to Judge Wyzanski and say, Judge, you made a mistake here."
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1366.668,1376.603,"--In our view that's precisely correct, so long as Judge Wyzanski had not discharged the jury because once you discharge the jury, the... the defendant's right to trial before his tribunal of choice has been eliminated."
2002.02-524,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1393.882,1397.307,What's your best authority for that proposition from this Court?
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1397.307,1398.573,--The--
2002.02-524,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1398.573,1400.389,Or... or--
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1400.389,1401.656,--I'd say--
2002.02-524,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1401.656,1404.454,--Or does that take us somewhat further than we've gone?
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1404.454,1418.585,"--Well, I think it would... our best case would probably be this Court's statements in Arizona versus Washington, in essence that the government... although the government often doesn't get an appeal and it doesn't get a second shot at... bite of the apple, it does get one full and fair opportunity before the trial court."
2002.02-524,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1437.104,1464.701,"So if you drop the first degree murder charge... or the judge orders it dismissed and then the defendant testifies thinking, well, at least I'm not going to be tried for first degree, in your view the trial judge can change its ruling and reinstate the first degree murder charges because the defendant shouldn't have relied?"
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1464.95,1467.013,No.
2002.02-524,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1467.498,1471.613,"--The... the defendant should know that the judge can change his mind, and so he better not take the stand."
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1471.613,1471.911,--No.
2002.02-524,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1488.413,1488.902,What--
2002.02-524,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1488.902,1489.63,"--Well, it wouldn't be if... excuse me."
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1513.427,1527.684,"--That's, actually points up a difficult question which is whether or not the dismissal of the... well, if it's dismissal in the indictment, it certainly isn't a double jeopardy problem, but if it's a judgment of acquittal at that point, the question the court would have to confront--"
2002.02-524,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1527.684,1531.976,"Well, say... change my hypothetical to a judgment of acquittal."
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1531.976,1532.321,--Right.
2002.02-524,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1546.147,1546.389,But that's--
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1546.389,1547.312,--We believe the actual answer would be--
2002.02-524,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1547.312,1549.275,--That's an extraordinary doctrine.
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1549.275,1556.125,"--Well, I... I would believe that the proper answer would be that if the jury is still available, the prosecution can seek reconsideration."
2002.02-524,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1570.401,1582.015,"But getting back to the earlier point, if a... if the defendant testifies, thinking there's going to be no first degree charge, and it's later reinstated, under your position I think you would say, he shouldn't have relied."
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1588.193,1589.286,"Well, the Constitution--"
2002.02-524,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1589.286,1592.202,"I mean, I don't know why you don't argue... that's the consequence of your argument it seems."
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1592.202,1597.955,"--Well, certainly the Constitution doesn't require there to be mid-trial rulings on judgments for acquittal."
2002.02-524,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1601.098,1602.593,"No, but the hypothetical is there is one."
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1602.593,1603.442,--Right.
2002.02-524,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1634.827,1642.967,"I suppose parties can... can repudiate a contract, can't they, since there's no... no involuntary servitude?"
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1650.448,1651.565,That... that--
2002.02-524,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1651.565,1657.153,The other party is entitled to rely upon the contract despite his knowledge that it can be repudiated.
2002.02-524,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1657.153,1657.891,--Right.
2002.02-524,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.051,1721.341,"Thank you, Mr. Lamken."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,1724.243,1728.099,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.6,1764.369,"Well, he didn't take it back, but he made it clear that he... he did not consider it... he did not consider that he had made a final ruling."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,1769.574,1776.469,"He... he took the position, Justice Scalia, that he could take back his ruling because he had not informed the jury of it."
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1776.469,1776.79,Right.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,1776.79,1780.347,A position that we submit is wrong under this Court's precedent in Sanabria.
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.347,1794.006,"Can I... can I ask you, do you believe like Justice Breyer that a judge can enter a final order without meaning to enter a final order?"
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,1794.006,1805.295,"What a reviewing court has to do under this precedent in Martin Linen, Justice Scalia, is look at the words and actions of the trial court and decide whether or not it amounts to a ruling."
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1806.324,1818.851,"And... and you do that just objectively, and even if there's plenty of evidence that the judge didn't intend it to be a final ruling, if he used certain magic words, it's a final... it's a final ruling."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,1818.851,1824.659,"--Well, actually, Justice Scalia, it's petitioner who's arguing for a magic words approach, or the Michigan Supreme Court at least."
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.659,1825.195,No.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,1860.819,1871.564,"Well, Justice Scalia, our position is, is that the trial judge's intent is a relevant fact, but whether or not what he did amounted to an acquittal--"
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.564,1872.726,Is a question of law.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,1872.726,1873.646,--is a question of law.
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.646,1882.407,"Well, in... in your position here attacking a State judgment, you don't... you don't immediately get to the constitutional question."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,1902.843,1903.467,Yes.
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1940.64,1954.616,"It could be, but presumably Michigan knows Michigan law, and if they want to say, under the law of Michigan, the events that took place here do not amount to an acquittal, I guess that's their right."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,1966.781,1977.67,"Well, this Court's precedents, particularly Martin Linen, teach that what the reviewing court is supposed to do is look not to the form of the trial court's ruling but the substance."
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1977.67,1978.011,All right.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2002.663,2003.738,"Well, Smalis, Your Honor."
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2003.738,2004.787,Yes.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2004.787,2005.757,Smalis came from a State court.
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2005.757,2009.877,"Yes, but in Smalis there was no doubt about what the judge had done."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2019.83,2020.601,That's right.
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2042.775,2048.155,"Well, under AEDPA, what is it you think that the Michigan Supreme Court did wrong?"
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2054.507,2057.619,It was a... it was its legal conclusion--
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2057.619,2058.129,Well--
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2058.129,2059.097,--that there had been no--
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2059.097,2061.418,--but AEDPA doesn't say one way or the other.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2063.867,2064.44,--No.
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2065.204,2067.266,So what is your answer to my question?
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2067.266,2074.435,"--Mr. Chief Justice, it matters for AEDPA whether it's law or fact because then we're under (d)(1) or (d)(2)."
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2074.435,2074.797,Right.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2074.797,2075.831,And so--
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2075.831,2079.734,"I'm asking you which one you... you want to be under, or perhaps you want to be under both."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2079.734,2088.884,"--Well, it is our position that we win under either because even if it's a finding of fact, it's so unreasonable to say that there was no directed verdict of acquittal here, that we should prevail."
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.331,2092.681,"Anyway, the Michigan Supreme Court didn't find the fact against you, did it?"
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2099.139,2100.155,--That's right.
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2100.155,2106.926,"It said even if he had made a ruling, unless... unless the jury had been advised, it was ineffective for double jeopardy purposes."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2106.926,2108.675,"Oh, that's not quite right, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2145.32,2145.726,All right.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2164.799,2165.584,"Not at all, Justice Breyer."
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2165.584,2165.859,Because?
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2168.988,2170.593,No.
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2177.465,2177.706,How?
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2178.207,2178.766,--I'm sorry?
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2178.766,2179.539,"Why, how?"
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2180.329,2182.371,Because the judge announced his ruling.
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2193.584,2203.564,"Reserve means, I take it, that you have to make a decision prior to the... the defendant putting on witnesses."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2203.564,2206.185,It... the... the court rule doesn't say that.
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.685,2222.661,"When I read the court rule and then read the Federal rule, the difference in the practice is what they mean by reserve under the Federal rule where you can reserve... and it happens every day... is a district judge says, you move at the end of the plaintiff's case."
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.296,2236.789,--Well--
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2236.789,2237.572,--Is that... am I right?
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2237.572,2244.324,"--The Michigan rule... I... I don't... frankly, I don't know because the Michigan rule simply says the judge may not reserve his decision."
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.324,2260.228,"But surely it can't mean that if a... if a motion is made at quarter after 4:00 in the afternoon and the court customarily recesses at 4:30, that he can't wait until the next morning, so no testimony being taken in the meantime."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2260.228,2266.342,In... in that case that would... that might well be all right because he hasn't made a final decision.
2002.02-524,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2267.637,2272.059,Suppose in that case the... the arguments by the attorneys end at 4 o'clock.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2301.047,2312.739,"--That's very similar to Lowe v. State in the Kansas case in which the Kansas Supreme Court, after this Court's decision in Smalis, concluded that a judge couldn't do that even though there had been no intervening proceedings."
2002.02-524,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2313.895,2316.487,What interest is served by such a rule?
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2316.487,2319.629,--An acquittal is final.
2002.02-524,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2322.966,2325.683,"Well, but what... no one... no one relies on it."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2326.688,2336.306,"--But, Your Honor, this Court has said over and over again that an acquittal by a judge, in the context of a directed verdict, is equivalent to an acquittal by a jury."
2002.02-524,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2337.065,2339.077,"But he... he didn't say, I acquit."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2346.704,2347.198,--Yes.
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2347.198,2350.078,"In the judge's own mind, he didn't acquit."
2002.02-524,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2350.078,2363.028,"And what you're urging is so different from how we approach trial rulings generally, and the point was made that in a trial, things go fast, judge... judges make rulings."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2402.74,2404.763,"I'm not arguing that, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.02-524,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2414.449,2415.292,"Well, what's different between--"
2002.02-524,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2415.292,2416.354,--Why?
2002.02-524,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2416.354,2426.421,"--saying at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I grant your motion, and then overnight... and then they come back the next morning and the judge says, I'm not so sure."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2437.094,2455.933,"But, Your Honor, if that was the law, then Smalis v. Pennsylvania is impossible to understand because in Smalis the prosecution there could have taken some sort of emergency appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme... Pennsylvania Superior Court, got a ruling late that afternoon, and come back the next morning and resumed the trial."
2002.02-524,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2462.135,2462.624,I'm sorry.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2469.51,2473.87,Actually the judge in Smalis agreed to a reconsideration motion--
2002.02-524,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2473.87,2476.968,But then he came up just where he was the first time.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2476.968,2478.82,"--Yes, that's... that's right."
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2496.304,2503.894,"Well, being... being revisited on appeal is different from being revisited at the trial by the trial judge."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2507.58,2508.724,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2518.078,2519.282,You don't have to go that far at all.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2527.126,2527.659,--Yes.
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2527.659,2529.238,So I'm back to my first question.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2541.627,2542.595,If--
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2542.595,2545.612,"My goodness, nothing at all happened in those 10 minutes."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2547.682,2551.458,"--If no further proceedings have occurred, and that is the line that almost all--"
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2551.458,2551.718,All right.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2571.039,2574.616,"--First of all, Justice Breyer, he said, I granted the motion."
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2576.287,2577.638,--So does... so does my judge.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2579.975,2582.721,--And he came back the next morning and said I granted your motion.
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2585.404,2587.54,"And he says, I say I granted the motion."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2590.859,2591.609,--Yes.
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2591.609,2595.306,You're saying that in my case too Smith is home free.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2595.306,2604.46,"If further proceedings have occurred, which unquestionably occurred here, then followed by an overnight recess, during a trial a defendant--"
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2604.46,2606.575,Which were the further proceedings?
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2606.575,2609.985,--There were five pages of proceedings that are--
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2609.985,2610.383,What?
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2611.536,2612.179,--No.
2002.02-524,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2619.735,2621.041,But they were all--
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2621.041,2624.674,"--But no... no evidence... no... no witnesses testified, did they?"
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2624.674,2625.661,"--Not at that point, no."
2002.02-524,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2626.351,2631.922,There was nothing that... that was done to the defendant that the defendant himself did to his detriment.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2636.126,2650.987,"--We know that his attorney made decisions on matters such as who is going to go first, will the defendants be present for each other's juries, will witnesses be allowed in the courtroom, a sequestration order."
2002.02-524,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2656.065,2662.84,"No, but is there any reason to believe that those decisions would have been different if he had understood that first degree murder was going to be in the case?"
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2662.84,2664.05,"We simply don't know, Justice Souter."
2002.02-524,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2664.204,2674.994,"Well, we don't... we don't know in the sense that there... there hasn't apparently been specific litigation to that effect, but is there any reason to suspect that the decisions would have been different?"
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2681.287,2681.711,--Yes.
2002.02-524,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2681.711,2683.538,"Maybe there is, but what... what is it then?"
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2683.538,2683.957,Yes.
2002.02-524,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2699.586,2699.811,No.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2709.539,2712.339,--That's actually not quite true as to Mr. Vincent.
2002.02-524,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2719.048,2719.25,But his lawyer knew.
2002.02-524,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2719.25,2720.025,But his... his counsel knew.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2720.353,2721.312,--His lawyer was still there.
2002.02-524,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2721.542,2721.797,Yes.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2730.619,2732.891,"The ruling had not been taken back, though, Justice Souter."
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2733.153,2739.225,"No, the ruling had not been taken back, but the... the judge said, sure, I'll hear you, prosecutor, in the morning."
2002.02-524,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2739.225,2740.814,I'm always glad to hear people.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2749.445,2752.792,--What... all he agreed to do is hear more argument.
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2753.715,2757.489,But surely that... that suggests that he has not finally made up his mind.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2757.489,2759.551,"--It suggests it, but it... he certainly doesn't say it."
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2759.551,2759.744,No.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2759.744,2760.825,All... he makes a general statement--
2002.02-524,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2760.825,2762.64,"Well, as a betting man, would--"
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2762.64,2762.959,[Laughter]
2002.02-524,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2762.959,2768.503,--would you not assume that there might be a change as a result of what he had said before they recessed?
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2768.503,2774.893,"--If I had been in trial counsel's position, I wouldn't have known what to do because we have a--"
2002.02-524,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2774.893,2775.671,"Yes, you would."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2786.012,2786.378,--But--
2002.02-524,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2786.378,2789.926,--because the judge had signaled that he might reverse his ruling--
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2789.926,2790.162,--But--
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2790.162,2791.135,--the next morning.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2791.135,2796.703,"--As trial counsel stated the next morning, it was my impression that you made a firm ruling, judge."
2002.02-524,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2797.276,2813.878,"Then at trial the next morning, if what you say about the overnight being so critical to the strategic planning, then counsel could say, judge, we plotted all this thing out, give me a recess so we can reshuffle the thing."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2824.307,2827.445,--I don't know if that would be possible with a... with two juries.
2002.02-524,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2830.5,2832.575,"It wasn't requested, though."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2832.575,2842.288,"--It... it wasn't requested because at the end of the hearing, in which the prosecution made his improved closing argument to the judge, there was no ruling."
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2847.57,2858.704,"These are due process problems that you're raising now, and I suppose we could always leave them to be resolved by further proceedings below, inquiry into whether there was any prejudice or not."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2866.326,2867.149,I agree.
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.884,2871.092,"So it's... it's no use arguing, well, he could have been prejudiced."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2873.118,2873.829,--And--
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2873.829,2875.476,But that doesn't got to the double jeopardy question.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2875.476,2879.374,--And I've taken the position in the brief that we don't have to show prejudice.
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.778,2880.961,Right.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2881.603,2885.766,--is inherent in being subjected to post-acquittal fact-finding proceedings.
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2885.766,2889.062,"Not only do you not have to, it does you no good to."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2889.062,2890.456,I agree.
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2890.456,2891.692,"Right, okay."
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2891.692,2896.011,But we still have good old lucky Smith who... who got off because--
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2896.011,2896.928,[Laughter]
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2896.928,2904.778,--five pages... of five pages of extraneous conversation went on with the... the judge and counsel.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2907.983,2909.544,"Justice Breyer, yes."
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2909.825,2910.98,"Okay, okay."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2913.646,2927.793,"--The rule from the Solicitor General's position would make it completely dispositive as to whether there happened to be other charges remaining, as in Smalis itself, and whether or not there happened to be other defendants."
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2927.793,2930.205,That's... that may be true.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2949.16,2950.825,If they're correct that it was not an acquittal.
2002.02-524,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2950.825,2952.064,"Well, not correct."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2957.736,2958.825,I agree.
2002.02-524,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2972.455,2987.422,"Mr. Moran, I'd like to get back to an AEDPA question, and that is, as I understand it, there is a division among lower courts on just how much leeway a trial judge has to take back a directed verdict."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,2993.443,3004.883,"Because what... what AEDPA requires is not to look at the decisions of the lower courts, but to look to see whether the decision of the Michigan Supreme Court was a clearly unreasonable application."
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3096.997,3103.744,"But you... that's assuming the... assuming the whole factual point at issue here, that there was a partial directed verdict."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3103.744,3104.251,--Yes.
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3104.251,3106.689,"And in Smalis, there was no doubt about that."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3106.689,3109.598,"Well, there was doubt as to what the judge had done."
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3115.489,3124.471,"Well, but that... that was a very theoretical thing, whether as a matter of... when you're saying there's no evidence as a matter of law, that's a factual ruling or a legal ruling."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3124.471,3124.869,--Yes.
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3124.869,3126.531,I... I don't think that bears on our case.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3126.531,3128.552,"No, and that is... and that is a distinction."
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3193.556,3196.789,"Well, let me follow up on an earlier question of Justice Breyer's."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3206.594,3207.253,Yes.
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3214.155,3227.672,"Well, but the fact that... that that case applies double jeopardy to the States I don't think necessarily settles whether a particular State procedure is or is not a directed verdict."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3227.672,3228.162,--No.
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.254,3272.946,"Well, so the Federal rule is that it attaches when there's been a directed verdict, but it's up to State law when... when there's been a directed verdict."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3274.242,3276.054,"Your Honor, I find that--"
2002.02-524,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3276.054,3277.791,--there's nothing incompatible there.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3277.791,3295.336,"--Justice Scalia, I find that hard to square with Martin Linen which teaches us that what a reviewing court must do is putting aside form, looking at substance to decide whether the trial court has found an essential element of the offense is missing."
2002.02-524,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3322.881,3324.903,He kept saying I didn't direct a verdict.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3331.625,3333.35,"--Excuse me, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.02-524,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3426.792,3429.737,"Wasn't that called to their attention in rehearing, though?"
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3429.737,3432.178,"There was a motion for reconsideration filed, yes, Justice Stevens."
2002.02-524,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3432.178,3434.478,How do you explain their failure to grant rehearing?
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3434.478,3438.106,Like this Court's denial of certiorari there--
2002.02-524,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3438.106,3442.276,"That's not a discretionary matter, I wouldn't think, in a criminal case."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3442.276,3443.27,--I... I believe it is.
2002.02-524,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3452.04,3454.394,Even when there was an error of law called to their attention.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3454.394,3456.665,"Well, it's an error in the record I believe."
2002.02-524,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3456.665,3457.186,Yes.
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3457.186,3458.821,I... I can't explain it.
2002.02-524,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3479.816,3480.959,May I ask you another question?
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3490.425,3492.783,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-524,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3504.311,3512.818,"So your syllogism is that if he was acquitted as a matter of Michigan law, a fortiori the Double Jeopardy Clause applies as a matter of Federal law."
2002.02-524,2,21199,david_a_moran,,3512.818,3515.687,"--I believe he was acquitted for all purposes, Justice Stevens."
2002.02-524,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3521.88,3523.099,"Thank you, Mr. Moran."
2002.02-524,3,15607,arthur_a_busch,,3525.27,3527.81,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2002.02-524,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3635.772,3636.794,"Thank you, Mr. Busch."
2002.02-524,3,15607,arthur_a_busch,,3636.794,3637.21,--Thank you.
2002.02-524,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3637.21,3638.576,The case is submitted.
