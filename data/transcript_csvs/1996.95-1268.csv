1996.95-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.857,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1268, Maryland v. Jerry Lee Wilson."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,9.367,12.079,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1268,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,65.474,66.275,Excuse me.
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,72.409,73.71,--The... yes.
1996.95-1268,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,74.43,75.521,"Well, that would cut the other way."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,81.405,91.091,"--Well, there were a total of some 52,000 assaults during that given year, '94, of which 5,700 were in traffic stops."
1996.95-1268,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,91.091,100.167,"What I'm suggesting is that the relevant figure is how many of the assaults came while a person was in the car, so that they might have been prevented by making the person get out of the car."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,104.099,104.99,Those are figures are not available--
1996.95-1268,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.99,105.801,Okay.
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,105.801,106.302,--Your Honor.
1996.95-1268,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,106.302,116.598,"Isn't it true, General Curran... I remember this from the Mimms case... that there's a split of professional opinion on whether it is safer for the officer to order them out of the car or to tell them to stay in the car?"
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,122.752,131.748,"Well, Justice Stevens, the typical practice, and I can refer to Maryland, of course, but I believe the briefs will show the typical practice is to control the risk."
1996.95-1268,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,153.042,161.187,"General Curran, are you saying that if the officer made the decision to keep the person inside, it would be the officer's call, too?"
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,168.242,171.625,"The answer is yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.95-1268,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.135,193.107,How far does the authority extend?
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,201.495,202.204,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1268,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.207,211.289,"Well, you want more than the right to require the passenger to exit."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,215.043,216.302,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1268,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.632,217.333,For how long?
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,217.333,223.007,--We want... there is no time frame as... I can tell you what the typical stop--
1996.95-1268,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,223.007,223.869,To be searched?
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,223.869,226.48,"--No, Your Honor, not a frisk."
1996.95-1268,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,226.48,228.2,To be asked any questions?
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,228.2,231.074,"Could be asked, but not required to answer."
1996.95-1268,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,236.217,237.677,"Well, you say there's no time limit."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,244.232,244.733,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1268,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,250.646,253.207,Can he order some people in the car and some people out of the car?
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,253.207,254.439,"Yes, Your Honor, he could."
1996.95-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,254.439,258.32,What would be the reason for detaining the passenger in a situation like that?
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,271.17,290.24,"The officer has to... Mr. Chief Justice, the officer has to be able to control the stop, to complete safely the transaction, getting the information from the driver, the registration, the license, et cetera, and in order to do that safely, he needs to be able to know where any potential danger to him or her lies."
1996.95-1268,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,324.084,331.647,"This right to control the site, what's your best citation from this Court giving you that authority, Michigan and Summers, or--"
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,331.647,335.511,"Well, Michigan and Summers, Justice Kennedy--"
1996.95-1268,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,335.511,336.973,"--Is that the closest case, do you think?"
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,336.973,338.545,--Sir?
1996.95-1268,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,338.545,344.459,Is that the closest case to support the proposition that the officer does have this authority to control the location?
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,344.459,344.818,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1268,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,358.187,359.747,"Well, but there is a difference."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,409.769,434.417,"--Justice O'Connor, we would respectfully suggest that it's the Mimms decision that required the driver to exit not because in this case he was speeding, as was the probable cause, or not because there was a faulty tag, but because the Court concluded that there was potential danger, and so for the reason that they wanted... police safety was the reason Mimms got out of the car, not because there was--"
1996.95-1268,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,434.417,446.885,"Yes, but nevertheless they had a right to stop the car because it was an alleged traffic violation by the driver, isn't that so, otherwise they couldn't have stopped the car at all, presumably."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,446.885,448.044,--That is correct.
1996.95-1268,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,448.044,460.384,"Okay, and that reason does not apply to the passenger, so I'm trying to understand what is your authority for claiming the right not only to require the passenger to exit, but to detain the passenger."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,460.384,473.473,"If Your Honor please, when there was a stop of the Mimms car or the Wilson car by virtue of physics both are seized, or both are detained, so there the driver and the passenger are identical."
1996.95-1268,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,490.453,514.981,"But it's not just physics, it's privacy and dignity, and we all know that the police will take our decisions as far as their language and logic permit, and I'm just concerned that you're going to have routine practices of whole families and four or five occupants of the cars being required to stand outside while the officer lectures the driver."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,517.722,531.139,"Well, Justice Kennedy, that would happen now in Mimms, because without any discretion, or any guidelines, the officer now may in that case require someone to exit."
1996.95-1268,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,531.139,532.861,"Well, but that's what we're here to decide--"
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,532.861,534.813,And for the same--
1996.95-1268,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,534.813,541.187,--And you're proposing a general automatic rule that passengers can always be required to exit at the demand of the officers.
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,541.187,542.327,--Yes.
1996.95-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,558.268,585.746,"But you have a lesser interest on the part of the driver in privacy or not being free from whatever you... whether it's searching... the driver... there's probable cause to believe that the driver has committed an offense, whereas there isn't any probable cause to believe that the passenger has committed offense, an offense, so the calculus, if it's a weighing process, the interests of the passenger would seem stronger than the interest of the driver."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,585.746,592.051,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I would take the position that the privacy interests of the driver and the passenger are identical."
1996.95-1268,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,610.132,612.003,"Well, not necessarily."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,663.326,671.312,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, I see the point you're trying to raise, and obviously the question of a baby and a yound mother out in the rain is obviously not--"
1996.95-1268,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,671.312,674.064,That's just one example and you want an automatic rule.
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,674.064,677.457,"--Yes, Your Honor, we do want the automatic rule, and I might add, the same--"
1996.95-1268,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.457,679.077,"And it will work automatically, too."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,679.077,679.998,--Yes.
1996.95-1268,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,679.998,692.796,"Because bureaucracies being what they are, in order to protect themselves from claims of discrimination, making some people get out because of their race or because of whatever else, to be sure that no such claims will be available they will make everybody get out."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,693.806,695.776,"With respect, Justice Scalia--"
1996.95-1268,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.776,696.788,Even the lady with the baby.
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,696.788,699.499,"--With respect, Justice Scalia, I appreciate the question."
1996.95-1268,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,706.144,708.656,"The question is, do you have concerns about it?"
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,730.32,734.201,"--Well, I obviously have."
1996.95-1268,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,758.138,761.7,Or suppose the passenger has certain dementia.
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,785.836,788.528,"--I do understand, Justice O'Connor, there is a difference."
1996.95-1268,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,794.883,795.654,Everybody agrees with that.
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,822.82,844.294,"--Your Honor, I am not able to say that I have researched the cases in the other jurisdictions, but indeed I will tell you that there are a majority... there are 20 States that have ruled the way Maryland wishes to rule, and there are five... including the District of Columbia, so there are 21 areas, including there are five, four or five Federal circuit courts, mostly in the--"
1996.95-1268,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,844.294,845.626,So we have to look at those.
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,845.626,846.127,--There is a--
1996.95-1268,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,846.127,846.747,We have to look those up.
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,846.747,850.739,--A substantial majority have ruled this way.
1996.95-1268,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,852.632,863.708,"I have another question which I wanted to ask, which is that I didn't know until this argument that you are suggesting that the police should have the right to detain the passenger."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,880.829,882.669,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1268,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,882.669,886.633,"Where is... I didn't find that in your brief, and I don't know what the rationale for that would be."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,886.633,894.038,"It is in our brief and in our argument in terms of the ability to control, Your Honor, the location."
1996.95-1268,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,909.947,918.823,"General Curran, you did say that it would only be to show his hands, that he could not be frisked."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,922.856,924.097,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1268,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,924.097,927.298,"So once he shows his hands, then he can walk away and hail a cab?"
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,927.298,928.04,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1268,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,928.04,930.431,"Well, what can he do, then?"
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,932.193,946.191,"Our rule would ask the passenger to get out, to stand in a certain location described by the officer, to show his hands, and to remain there for the 10 minutes while the information is obtained about the license and the registration."
1996.95-1268,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,946.191,947.603,--So he just has to stand there.
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,954.907,961.341,"Yes, Your Honor, or the officer may, with discretion, as we've talked about in Class, permit the passenger to remain in the car."
1996.95-1268,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,961.341,963.242,"General Curran, can I ask this one question?"
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,981.515,982.276,"No, sir."
1996.95-1268,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,982.276,994.904,"General, as you have put the case, you really just want the officer to have the opportunity to exercise judgment in deciding whether the passenger ought to get out or not."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,994.904,995.363,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1268,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,995.363,999.647,Why doesn't Terry give you the authority for that?
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1018.799,1025.083,"Your Honor, we would have thought that there was justification for a reasonable suspicion in the Wilson case."
1996.95-1268,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1034.618,1053.202,"But I thought your argument was that the officer was going to exercise judgment, and if your argument now is that he doesn't have to wait for some indication of risk, then I think you're really saying the officer as a routine matter is going to order every passenger out of the car, so I think that's a difference in your position."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1053.202,1064.36,"--I'm not so sure that's the case, Justice Souter, because as I say, the typical training in our manual, which indicates... and I believe it's typical across the Nation... is to require both the driver and the passenger to remain in the car."
1996.95-1268,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1064.36,1084.672,"Well, my understanding was that you want a holding that lets the officer at the officer's discretion require all parties to exit or no parties to exit, but if he wants all parties to exit, they must, and you want the right, then, to detain the passengers who have exited."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1084.672,1087.504,"That is correct, Your Honor, for this minimal--"
1996.95-1268,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1087.504,1092.397,"Well, all right, but the Fourth Amendment, after all, is based on reasonableness."
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1100.824,1118.134,"--We believe, Justice O'Connor, that the reasonableness factor is best weighed by the balancing test that the Court has used again and again, the high governmental interest against this minimal intrusion against what is already a de minimis privacy expectation of the passenger."
1996.95-1268,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1118.134,1123.477,And in circumstances where it isn't a de minimis intrusion.
1996.95-1268,0,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,1123.477,1125.067,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1127.709,1128.991,"Very well, General Curran."
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1132.063,1142.251,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1268,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.636,1217.248,"General Reno, you want no reasonableness limitation on this."
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1227.807,1228.065,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1268,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.568,1231.247,"Well, not for you."
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1233.139,1255.523,"--Again, the bus situation can be an unknown situation for that officer, and he needs the opportunity, under our position, to be able to size up the situation, to determine and observe the people involved, and he may determine that he wishes them to stay in or to exit."
1996.95-1268,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1296.36,1297.952,"Well, why isn't Terry enough?"
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1304.256,1315.983,"Terry might not have given, if the passenger had been in the same situation as Mimms with a gun in his... under his sports coat, he might not have been able to see that seated in the car."
1996.95-1268,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1315.983,1326.78,"Well, then I think what you're really arguing, and I think this was what the Attorney General from Maryland was really arguing, is you really don't so much want him to size up the situation."
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1335.386,1336.367,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.814,1368.227,But may I interrupt with just this one thought that crosses my mind?
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1382.146,1386.59,--One cannot say when... how he would be more apt to use the gun.
1996.95-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1391.293,1391.693,Right.
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1398.737,1430.278,"--That is... the justification that I'm advancing is that that officer should have the ability to immediately size up the situation, determine if there is any reasonable suspicion to believe that a person is armed, and then advance to Terry frisk if that is appropriate, but that he should have the opportunity to control the situation if he is the single officer on the scene before the backup comes, to keep them in the car so that he doesn't have a person moving here, here, and here, or to get them out of the car if there are circumstances that dictate that they should be out of the car."
1996.95-1268,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1430.278,1453.192,"General Reno, you are arguing for a bright line test, and I'm wondering how that squares with the very recent decision of this Court in Robinette, which said that reasonableness is always case-by-case totality of the circumstances, and yet here you're saying that it's reasonable in any and all circumstances for the police officer to say, everybody out, or everybody in."
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1455.934,1485.042,"In Robinette, Your Honor, the Court specifically cited it would favor the Mimms decision, and concluded... pointed out that Mimms, considering all the totality of the circumstances, that it was reasonable in light of the safety concern for the officer that was more than balanced against the de minimis intrusion into the passenger's personal security, that in those totality of circumstances it was reasonable, under Mimms, to justify it."
1996.95-1268,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1485.042,1489.917,"General Reno, how much of a problem is it in the States that haven't adopted this rule?"
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1508.33,1511.991,"I don't have any information that I could provide to you, Your Honor."
1996.95-1268,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1511.991,1521.297,"Let me ask you a question on something that frankly I think I should have done some looking into before I came on the bench, but I didn't."
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1531.054,1534.197,"I'm not familiar with the opinion, Your Honor."
1996.95-1268,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1534.197,1535.756,"I'm not, either."
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1544.993,1553.33,"At a crime scene, if someone entered in beyond the crime rope there would definitely be authority to control, and it would depend on the State law."
1996.95-1268,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1553.33,1564.407,--Do you think a policeman is more at risk from a passenger in the car than from the bystanders who congregate when the stop is made?
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1581.798,1588.423,"The issue with respect to a traffic stop, Your Honor, is the unknown, the danger in approaching the vehicle."
1996.95-1268,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1621.823,1622.844,The concealment thing.
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1635.003,1639.985,"That's not the issue before the Court, but we would submit that it would be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment."
1996.95-1268,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1639.985,1643.167,So that this is a prolonged seizure.
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1643.167,1648.41,It is not a prolonged seizure because this Court in Berkemer has referred to traffic stops.
1996.95-1268,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1661.289,1671.377,"Well, we know that when they check licenses on their radio and hold the passenger it can sometimes take 15 or 20 minutes for a routine traffic stop, can it not?"
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1671.377,1684.634,"It can, and the Court has recognized that is usually of that duration, but that is a limited duration in which the police officer can have the opportunity to size up the situation and see whether the person presents a threat."
1996.95-1268,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1701.806,1719.616,"Let's assume for the sake of argument that we do not adopt the rule that goes as far as you have just suggested it should, that... let's assume our... under our rule, once the passenger is out of the car, if the passenger wants to go, he can."
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1735.328,1736.747,May I--
1996.95-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.747,1737.699,Yes.
1996.95-1268,1,32660,janet_reno,,1737.699,1738.58,"--complete the answer, Your Honor?"
1996.95-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1756.442,1760.116,"Thank you, Ms. Reno."
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,1762.175,1771.072,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1268,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1792.587,1797.65,"Well, Mr. Warnken, may I just ask you the same question that I asked Ms. Reno?"
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,1860.569,1866.392,"Justice Souter, I think the answer is that the bright line should not be drawn there."
1996.95-1268,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1874.88,1896.892,"Okay, but I'm not sure that responds to my question, because my question is, if the bright line would allow the officer to go no further than to say either get out or stay in, would the officer have any... be having any greater authority there than the officer presumably does when making a public arrest, in which he is allowed to control bystanders in the crowd by telling them to stay away?"
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,1896.892,1899.044,"Justice Souter, I think that would be different."
1996.95-1268,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1921.43,1932.376,"No, but in the case of the public arrest the person who is being told to stay back 12 feet would normally... has done nothing wrong and would normally be able to walk up and down the sidewalk."
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,1955.672,1960.726,"--Justice Souter, on first blush it may appear that those situations are similar."
1996.95-1268,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1996.227,2006.714,"Well, the passenger will be detained during the stop unless under Justice Souter's hypothesis the passenger is free to walk away, but it's a voluntary thing."
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2028.979,2053.995,"--If this Court were to draw a bright line, Mr. Chief Justice, wherein the only authority that law enforcement had as to the passenger when there is no evidence of officer safety issues and no wrongdoing on the passengers, if the bright line were only to require that individual to get out of the car momentarily, that would perhaps be permissible."
1996.95-1268,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2061.679,2065.693,But under your rule he'll be detained anyway.
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2068.264,2082.112,"--Your Honor, although it is not the rule we are asking for, I concede that Justice Souter's drawing... potential drawing of the bright line is the least onerous of the bright lines that would be possible."
1996.95-1268,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2082.112,2083.185,And then you--
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2087.926,2099.006,"Absolutely correct, which is why, Your Honor, we have urged that to draw a bright line at all will have the unintended effect of overruling Terry v. Ohio and its progeny, Mr. Justice--"
1996.95-1268,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2099.006,2103.067,Isn't the practical answer to this case that officers really aren't going to ask everybody to get out.
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2111.562,2113.044,"--Your Honor, that is absolutely correct."
1996.95-1268,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.044,2114.346,Is that correct?
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2121.811,2124.793,"Justice Scalia, there is no firm information."
1996.95-1268,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2133.247,2140.563,"Mr. Warnken, I think that General Curran told us that the more usual practice is to tell the people you must stay inside."
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2146.147,2155.573,"Justice Ginsburg, I absolutely agree that the custom and usage within law enforcement agencies is, if given the option, to not have the people get out of the car."
1996.95-1268,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.632,2157.754,"But you say that's no good, too."
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2157.754,2167.969,"What I'm saying, Your Honor... Justice Scalia, what I'm saying is that to give the police the unfettered standardless discretion is the problem."
1996.95-1268,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.969,2170.921,"To... either to keep them in or to make them get out, either one?"
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2170.921,2171.843,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1268,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2175.305,2176.265,I just want to make it clear.
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2182.589,2187.053,"--Justice Kennedy, that is correct, in that there is--"
1996.95-1268,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2187.053,2191.825,"I'm not sure we're just... we have to decide that case here, but it... I'd like to know what the rule would be."
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2203.563,2207.617,"--Justice Kennedy, let's examine the continuum."
1996.95-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2242.168,2244.6,What about the Attorney General's view?
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2266.865,2288.678,"--Justice Breyer, one of the potential problems with that as the law is that brief to all of us sounds like, stand outside for a few moments, and I think, Your Honor, that what would happen would be, under the case law from this Court, that will pretty much defer to the natural steps that an officer must take to effectuate a traffic stop, effectuate an arrest."
1996.95-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2292.491,2293.943,"So what's your line, then?"
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2305.04,2308.773,"Justice Breyer, that is... that is my line on this case."
1996.95-1268,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2308.773,2309.865,"Yes, but I thought--"
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2313.916,2315.849,"Your Honor, I was saying Justice Scalia, in this case--"
1996.95-1268,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2315.849,2316.409,Ah.
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2316.409,2323.683,"--because we already have plenty of case law that if there is any evidence of officer safety, if there is any evidence of--"
1996.95-1268,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2323.683,2325.125,But what is that any evidence?
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2350.07,2352.592,"--Justice Ginsburg, you are correct on both counts."
1996.95-1268,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2363.029,2371.864,"But I would like to know what would be sufficient, since you said that a passenger fidgeting, ducking, making ducking motions, that wouldn't be sufficient."
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2378.88,2397.411,"--Justice Ginsburg, I did not necessarily mean that that would be insufficient, because, Your Honor, if the trial judge had on this record determined that there was reasonable suspicion under Terry v. Ohio and its progeny, on this record, probably on appeal that would not have been found to be clearly erroneous."
1996.95-1268,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2397.411,2402.865,"Well, you see, that... part of that illustrates that... and sometimes bright line rules actually help our citizens."
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2424.659,2438.708,"Justice Kennedy, this Court can easily paint... draw a line to fashion a rule that will fully accommodate the legitimate and weighty interest of Government in the safety of officers and still balance Fourth Amendment interests of the individual."
1996.95-1268,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2438.708,2439.209,But you just told me--
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2454.218,2464.945,"Justice Ginsburg, ever since Terry v. Ohio and its progeny, that's what we have had, and yet the States, the officers, the courts have not had a problem with that."
1996.95-1268,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2464.945,2466.567,You don't have it in Mimms.
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2469.309,2480.946,"Mr. Chief Justice, that's correct, but the reason Mimms is a bright line rule is a combination of officer safety and the valid underlying stop of the driver."
1996.95-1268,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2491.103,2520.423,"Well, it might be the first time that we did it, but I'm not sure that it would be much of an innovation, if at all, because it seems to me that the argument you're making, and in particular in your response to Justice Breyer's last question, you're saying in effect that an officer who stops a car on a highway has less capacity to control the people around him who might hurt him or interfere with what he is validly doing than he does if he makes an arrest in a public shopping mall."
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2564.84,2572.676,"Justice Souter, my answer to Justice Kennedy must be taken in the context of where I think this Court should fashion a rule."
1996.95-1268,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2584.333,2585.645,"No Terry suspicion, in other words."
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2585.645,2591.009,"--That is correct, and again, this Court has deferred to the first level fact-finders."
1996.95-1268,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2606.558,2606.908,Okay.
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2644.223,2672.051,"Justice Souter, the officer probably would have that authority, because, Your Honor, in the alternative to our asking you to draw no bright line at all, what this Court could do to fashion the rule would be to say, all of our continuing case law exists wherever we have any evidence of reasonable suspicion or fear of officer safety, and in addition, we will do as we did in cases like Florida v. Wells and United States v. Sokolow."
1996.95-1268,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2694.566,2725.606,"Mr. Warnken, this Court itself in dicta in Michigan v. Long referred to the right of officers to require all persons in a vehicle to exit, and many courts around the Nation have similarly thought that it... the Mimms principle extends to everyone in a vehicle at a traffic stop at least to get them out if the officer wants to get them out of the vehicle."
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2739.614,2741.995,"--Justice O'Connor, you are correct."
1996.95-1268,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2741.995,2753.324,Have we had any particular problems with the many jurisdictions that say Mimms does allow an officer to require everyone to get out?
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2762.879,2775.578,"Justice O'Connor, I... as to your last part of your question, I cannot, and that is because the way the statistics appear to be maintained on a national level, it includes all types of situations such as stops as well as pursuits."
1996.95-1268,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2775.578,2785.516,But you admit that many jurisdictions have followed what this Court at least said in dicta in Michigan v. Long and allowed officers to order people out--

1996.95-1268,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2786.224,2786.745,--in a traffic stop.
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2786.745,2792.249,"--Justice O'Connor, you're absolutely correct, there are a number of jurisdictions, as General Curran pointed out--"
1996.95-1268,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2792.249,2792.709,Yes.
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2792.709,2795.44,--that believe that your earlier decision--
1996.95-1268,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2795.44,2795.891,Right.
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2795.891,2797.033,--in Mimms was extended to--
1996.95-1268,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2797.033,2801.335,And that doesn't appear to have offered any particular problems.
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,2811.412,2817.546,"--Justice O'Connor, you're correct that there's no hard evidence as to one way or the other."

1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,3165.142,3167.093,"Justice Stevens, that's correct."
1996.95-1268,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3167.093,3175.54,I had not understood Justice Souter's hypothesis... I thought his hypothesis you can be told to get out of the car but you can't be detained.
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,3215.566,3249.279,"Justice Stevens and Justice Souter, I certainly concede to this Court that were this Court to fashion a rule saying, State of Maryland, we reject your absolute, bright line, unlimited, unfettered discretion in all circumstances, but we will draw a line that would permit unfettered discretion, meaning a bright line to the limited extent of having the passenger exit the vehicle, and then the passenger having the complete discretion whether to get back into the vehicle, whether to leave, or any other reasonable steps the officer would take--"
1996.95-1268,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3249.279,3256.475,"Well, how about getting identification of who the passenger is and where they could be reached if they're needed to be a witness?"
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,3256.475,3268.9,"--Your Honor, Justice O'Connor, I think the case law from this Court already would probably give an officer, if that officer had reason to believe that an individual were a witness to the crime, to try to seek that information."
1996.95-1268,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3268.9,3270.402,"Well, we're talking about a traffic stop."
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,3276.226,3297.661,"Justice O'Connor, that is correct, which is why I stated earlier that this Court could fashion a line between the one end of the spectrum that we would like to see, which is, you need reasonable suspicion in each case, and the other end of the spectrum that the State of Maryland asks for, which is, you need nothing and anything, to say, the line is as follows:"
1996.95-1268,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3397.145,3420.671,"Which might be different in every State, and suppose... are you saying that if Maryland had a manual and said, after 5:00 p.m., it's beginning to get dark, the officer at that time can order the passenger out, and then if they had that rule, then we would defer to it and your client would legitimately have been asked to get out because it was after 5:00?"
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,3420.671,3422.201,"Justice Ginsburg, that is probably correct."
1996.95-1268,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3437.13,3451.8,"Which would mean that if that's what your answer is, that all they need is a manual that says after 5:00 this is okay, then the next client like yours loses, because in... with your client it wasn't a question of detention."
1996.95-1268,2,18174,byron_l_warnken,,3457.705,3459.948,"--It... yes, Your Honor."

1996.95-1268,3,29427,j_joseph_curran_jr,,3551.648,3559.395,"--Justice Scalia, you are right, we don't have the specific numbers, but may I infer from information we do have."
