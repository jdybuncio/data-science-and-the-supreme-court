1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,8.731,17.358,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.533,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,249.297,251.788,Is he possible a veteran?
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,251.788,252.327,Sir?
1960.533,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,252.327,253.298,Is he a veteran?
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,253.298,254.095,"No, sir."
1960.533,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,263.698,266.03,Isn't that (Inaudible)
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,266.03,266.726,That's correct.
1960.533,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,268.322,273.758,Was he correct in that assumption Mr --
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,273.758,277.956,That the appraisal would reveal a -- a structural defect?
1960.533,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,277.956,277.995,Yes.
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,277.995,278.658,"Yes, sir."
1960.533,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,293.57,294.946,Yes.
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,294.946,305.204,"The -- Mr. Neustadt then made an offer on this house for the sum of $24,500."
1960.533,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,803.462,807.375,His appraisal was a statutory obligation of the FHA.
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,807.375,808.914,"Yes, sir."
1960.533,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,808.914,813.913,He had no choice whether it would appraise or not appraise.
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,813.913,814.447,"No, sir."
1960.533,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,845.531,854.502,"Was that requirement in any way, for the benefit of the purchaser or is it just for the Government's own information?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,854.502,881.46,"Under Section 226 and 1954, Mr. Chief Justice, the Congress imposed upon the seller, the duty of transmitting to the perspective purchaser a written copy, a written statement of the amount of the FHA appraisal."
1960.533,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,995.09,995.814,May I ask you of there's --
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,995.814,996.521,"Yes, sir."
1960.533,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,996.521,1005.949,-- any suits of this kind filed against insurance companies that appraised the properties for the purpose of insurance.
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1005.949,1008.157,I am not familiar --
1960.533,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1008.157,1010.259,By the insurance companies.
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1010.259,1031.292,"Justice Black, of a case where an insurance company has appraised property to determine whether or not, it should insure and then was held liable to a perspective purchaser of the property, it's -- to me, it is a novel --"
1960.533,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1031.292,1034.538,Where was this -- where did this case arise?
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1034.538,1038.655,This case arose in Eastern District of Virginia.
1960.533,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1038.655,1039.491,In Virginia?
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1039.491,1040.853,"Yes, sir, in Alexandria."
1960.533,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1040.853,1044.19,Is there any such cases of that kind in Virginia?
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1044.19,1048.852,I have not -- I just don't know of any.
1960.533,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1060.185,1074.234,"Mr. Orrick, if the statute didn't have this misrepresentation exemption from a case, would the Government be liable?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1074.234,1075.393,"No, sir."
1960.533,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1096.491,1097.996,"Well, not only that."
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1104.164,1104.555,"Yes, sir."
1960.533,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1104.555,1105.461,And that's all?
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1105.461,1106.457,"Yes, sir."
1960.533,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1108.537,1109.654,Isn't that fundamental?
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1118.411,1119.732,"Yes, sir."
1960.533,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1119.732,1122.586,To whom does the duty run under the statute?
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1122.586,1133.653,The statute Mr. Justice Harlan was enacted for an entirely different purpose.
1960.533,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1170.391,1180.491,"But wouldn't that indicate that in passing this bill, Congress had some concern about the buyer and was trying to protect the buyer in some way?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1180.491,1192.093,"Oh, I don't -- I'm quite sure that it did Mr. Chief Justice and they said so in so many words that they wanted to put the buyer on an equal footing with the seller."
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1234.842,1235.68,Mr. Orrick --
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1235.68,1235.76,Yes.
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1235.76,1253.002,I understood you or did you ascent to Justice Whittaker's question that the crucial question is whether the duty of correct or reliable appraisal where at the question was to whom did that duty run?
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1256.145,1257.754,And it ran to his employer --
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1257.754,1265.718,"A non -- a non-negligent or a non-negligibly -- negligence protect him correctly, didn't he?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1265.718,1266.48,"Yes, sir."
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1266.48,1273.625,"And you -- I understood do you agree that the question is a crucial question as to whom did the duty to run, is that right?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1273.625,1274.071,But --
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1274.071,1275.32,Did you agree to that?
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1275.32,1278.369,"Well, I'm not -- I don't recall the full --"
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1278.369,1278.594,Or whatever the (Voice Overlap) --
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1278.594,1299.014,"-- the context of the question Mr. Justice Frankfurter, but the duty here is for of the -- the appraiser is to determine for the United States what the value of that property is so that the FHA will know to what extent the -- it should approve mortgage insurance and --"
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1299.014,1305.366,"No doubt that the FHA -- that he had a duty -- an appraiser had a duty to FHA, is that correct?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1305.366,1307.056,"Yes, sir."
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1307.056,1318.12,"But the question recently put or just put by Chief Justice, wasn't it reasonably to be expected that -- that there wouldn't be a buyer or buyers or candidate for purchase."
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1320.454,1321.507,"Yes, sir, Your Honor."
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1321.507,1333.201,"What would reasonably do you expected that the buyer would make real --- would -- would look, to take into account, whether conclusively or not, the appraisal made for FHA?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1333.201,1334.208,"Oh, certainly that --"
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1334.208,1336.879,Then -- I -- I ask you this question?
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1342.668,1343.704,This is a tort problem.
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1343.704,1344.734,It's a tort problem.
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1344.734,1344.833,I said --
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1344.833,1357.073,"Therefore, the question to whom a duty of care non-negligence runs isn't something that -- that is mathematically determinable or that you find expressed in the statute."
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1357.073,1357.543,No that's --
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1357.543,1366.559,"But if the reasonable likelihood is that there would be a purchaser and that he would rely, why isn't this come within the Buick against MacPherson doctrine?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1366.559,1366.619,Well --
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1366.619,1372.621,"If the reasonable expectation is, why is that any different from the Buick doctrine, Mr. Orrick?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1372.621,1387.721,"Well, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the -- the tort and you -- they're quite correct that the -- this is -- this is a tort case and we're now trying to establish to whom that duty run."
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1397.043,1399.766,"But that the Congress didn't tell us in terms, did it?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1399.766,1400.944,Well I -- that's --
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1400.944,1402.647,It couldn't (Voice Overlap) --
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1402.647,1407.026,You'll -- to term that in my opinion it was quite clear --
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1407.026,1407.511,But I mean to statute --
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1407.511,1409.81,What they wanted to do and what they intended to do.
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1409.81,1410.971,Statute do it in terms?
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1410.971,1412.653,Yes -- pardon me?
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1412.653,1422.284,"Did the statute in terms say that they restrict the obligations for violation of the duty of care to the FHA, if this is --"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1422.284,1423.079,"No, sir -- no, sir."
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1423.161,1427.988,"So then we asked to argue from analogy as reasonableness of things, etcetera."
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1427.988,1428.652,That's right.
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1428.652,1432.621,And my -- my problem is why isn't this a Buick situation?
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1432.621,1445.104,"Well, I think if the Court please, that this is a -- this is an incidental purpose to this -- to the federal -- the National Housing Act, I don't think that the --"

1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1455.681,1455.789,In this --
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1455.789,1465.941,Part of was dealing here was taking of conventional concept of the law to applicability.
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1465.941,1479.854,"The thrust of this case if the Court please, is to indentify the tort that it's -- that has occurred, it's the tort of the misrepresentation."
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1479.854,1480.244,The reaching --
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1480.244,1480.542,"Now, assuming --"
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1480.542,1485.13,"-- the reaching the tort, not the tort, the tort is perfectly fine, merely the fellow is careless."
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1485.13,1495.446,"The fellow is careless, but the -- to identify the tort is the duty -- it's the task that we ask the Court to do."
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1512.581,1528.956,"Suppose this were -- if you -- can you give me, put the case leaving out the United States, no doubt at all that introduced a new principle of liability in the sense that it was truly immunity of the sovereign from suit."
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1528.956,1529.567,"Yes, sir."
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1529.567,1533.542,"But it didn't create a new -- a new conception of liability, did it?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1533.887,1534.528,No.
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1534.528,1541.461,"-- in passing down, took over the liability for this same situation, if done between private people, is that correct?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1541.461,1542.101,That's correct.
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1552.334,1561.256,"Then the answer of your answer, if I may suggest, by Mr. Justice Whittaker is that that to whom the liability runs, that is not the question."
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1568.178,1570.673,"That's right, the -- the tort of misrepresentation --"
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1570.673,1571.344,Oh that's a very (Voice Overlap) --
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1571.344,1577.021,"And therefore this being a tort of misrepresentation, the United States is not liable."
1960.533,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1577.021,1590.987,"Well, I should think you'd have to deal with discussion, I should think the answer to my question would be that if you didn't have the exclusionary clause in the statute, there wouldn't be liability in the part of the United States."
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1590.987,1598.959,"I'd -- Mr. Justice Harlan, we -- the United States does not -- this is our position, is that --"
1960.533,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1598.959,1599.669,You're relying on the --
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1599.669,1611.751,-- there is no lied -- no duty running from the FHA to the perspective purchaser that that is incidental to the main purpose of that section.
1960.533,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1611.751,1614.076,You don't think -- you don't think this is the immigration case.
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1614.076,1615.975,"I do not know, sir."
1960.533,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1615.975,1626.363,"Is it different materially Mr. Orrick, from the Indian Towing case, leaving out the exclusionary cause of the -- of your statute."
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1626.363,1628.346,"Yes, it does."
1960.533,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1708.262,1712.124,Does communication or lack of communication make any difference?
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1735.274,1748.756,"The -- that argument Mr. Chief Justice, has been made and there are elements of misrepresentation and made negligence cases just as in this case, there are elements of negligence."
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1765.138,1766.794,"But where is, may I trouble you just one more question?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1766.794,1768.36,Yes.
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1768.36,1772.751,"If don't set forth a full text of the exception in age, where is that?"

1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1778.778,1779.094,It's Section 26 (Voice Overlap)

1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1782.825,1784.073,"Now, what are they?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1784.073,1789.144,They -- they are --
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1789.144,1796.224,"I notice the tendency of the problem of Government if you just ask there is, with the immediate problem with statute not involved."
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1796.224,1802.507,"I don't think that's a very good idea, I may say so, because when one wants to see a -- concept at its context.--"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1802.507,1803.576,"Yes, sir."
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1839.327,1843.551,"Well now, most of those things only involve element of dishonesty, do they?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1843.551,1845.593,"No, sir, they'd -- they don't."
1960.533,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1845.593,1864.94,"Assault, doesn't it slander and libel doesn't it -- it appears in the contract where (Inaudible) doesn't, you are arguing that -- what happen to the rulings as to whether misrepresentation must be merely a representation that's inactivate or representation that's falsely based?"
1960.533,0,45775,william_h_orrick,,1864.94,1877.948,"The -- the eight times, six different circuits have held that that term misrepresentation means negligent misrepresentation."

1960.533,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1897.457,1902.48,Mr. Latto.
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,1902.48,1905.769,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.533,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2373.58,2382.133,"I understand you it would not contend, however, that FHA insures anything more than mortgage, which it approves."
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2382.133,2389.5,"Under the National Housing Act, the FHA issues insurance to the mortgage lender.Our claim is not based on the National Housing Act."
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2413.362,2416.695,"What was -- what was the date of the Tort Claims, (Inaudible)"
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2416.695,2419.683,"1946, I believe."
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2419.683,2425.208,What was the Act in which is -- what was the holding act under which this transaction took place?
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2425.208,2432.651,1934 with the Housing Act and the amendment that I have been discussing -- legislative history that I've been reading to the Court is in connection with the 1954 amendment.
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2432.651,2445.996,"Now, what you're saying is -- what you're saying is that -- that taking -- calling the statements from the Housing Act is an implied repeal of the exclusion of misrepresentation acts from the Tort Act (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2445.996,2447.985,"That -- that is not my position, sir."
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2448.126,2451.831,"I do not in turn, but that's when it gets down to."
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2451.831,2452.665,Certainly not.
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2506.403,2511.325,"Now, these purposes of Congress in the two acts referring to it, are wholly unrelated."
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2511.325,2512.339,"They're wholly unrelated, I agree --"
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2512.339,2531.833,"Wholly unrelated and Congress in the -- in the Federal Tort Act sought it in its own vibe in the capricious way, more capricious (Inaudible) and to exclude certain categories of misconduct or conduct which has between man and man, would give rise to assume, that's correct isn't it?"
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2531.833,2535.26,"There are certain exceptions in the Tort Claims Act, which I agree are capricious."
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2535.26,2538.322,And assume (Inaudible) even to the court of these two problems.
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2548.635,2550.255,"Yes, a deliberate misrepresentation."
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2550.255,2553.132,Deliberate -- deliberate falsification.
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2569.686,2570.075,No.
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2570.892,2573.262,"Even the word, that's what it gets down to."
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2573.262,2575.621,"I don't think so Justice Frankfurter, for this reason."
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2620.641,2622.128,(Voice Overlap) -- evade myself.
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2631.708,2635.858,"Well, I -- I hope to show in a moment that it's not strange, but I -- I beg your pardon."
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2635.858,2651.296,"It all depends without (Inaudible) that the exception in age, including misrepresentation followed by deceit, misrepresentation does not to include the time of age that the other Courts of Appeals have included."
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2651.296,2652.757,"Yes, I make that argument."
1960.533,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2656.081,2657.855,May I ask you preliminary question --
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2657.855,2658.539,"Certainly, Justice Harlan."
1960.533,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2658.539,2662.463,-- (Voice Overlap) address yourself to it.
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2672.326,2674.014,I think it must be federal law.
1960.533,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2674.014,2675.1,You do?
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2675.1,2675.718,Well --
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2675.718,2676.022,The whole --
1960.533,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2676.022,2676.308,Why do you (Voice Overlap) --
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2676.308,2681.985,-- whole actually states on state conception of tort.
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2681.985,2684.646,"No, let me withdraw that, if I may."
1960.533,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2708.894,2713.562,"Supposing, you had a flat Virginia case -- this is a Virginia current --"
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2713.562,2713.863,"Yes, this case is --"
1960.533,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2713.863,2721.093,"Supposing how the flat case and Virginia is saying this, under our law, is not misrepresentation, it's negligence."
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2721.093,2729.101,"I -- I -- as I say, I -- I misspoke before and I think that's -- that the correct answer to Your Honor's question is that it would be decided by state law."
1960.533,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2773.523,2779.259,"Mr. Latto, does the Government concede negligence at all here?"
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2779.259,2779.644,"Oh, yes."
1960.533,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2782.832,2783.515,It does?
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2783.515,2784.065,Yes.
1960.533,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2792.302,2813.87,"Would you mind telling me what is the distinction so far as liability for negligence is concerned between the Fulger Mortgage Company here in Washington, which makes appraisals or money lenders and issue certificates of appraisal."
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2825.187,2826.106,Well --
1960.533,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2826.106,2827.406,-- in liability?
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2827.406,2831.587,-- the distinction I -- I suppose rest upon this.
1960.533,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2859.637,2864.218,Wouldn't that apply as well to this private appraiser?
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2864.218,2868.538,"Well, it -- it would depend upon the purpose for which he was pertained."
1960.533,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2883.15,2883.452,"Well, but now --"
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2883.452,2890.345,"In that connection, may I -- may I just read a -- an illustration from the restatement of a -- the law of torts, which bears on this."
1960.533,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2924.63,2927.268,"Well, that's MacPherson against Buick, isn't it?"
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2927.268,2927.904,"Well, no."
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2947.224,2963.587,"I myself, that this were pure man to man issue, I would have no trouble at all if this case coming within the general -- the conference of the general area of Buick against MacPherson."
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2985.084,2988.765,"Oh, I think this is an entirely separate question, one that I'm anxious to get to."
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2988.765,2990.19,Alright.
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2990.19,2992.536,"And if I may, I will turn that now."
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2992.536,2994.535,I apologize to how to this (Inaudible)
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,2994.535,2996.464,"You have not, sir."
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3127.166,3128.841,"Before you move on, may I ask you this question?"
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,3128.841,3129.433,"Yes, you may."
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3129.433,3137.978,"Suppose this appraisal as for reason for its own, purposefully put in a line of appraisal, will that be excluded on the Tort Act?"
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,3137.978,3143.41,"It certainly would and there is some sense in this, if Your Honor please."
1960.533,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3204.408,3220.704,"(Inaudible) I'm having trouble getting to my mind, doesn't (Inaudible) right that when a person files an FHA insures a house, not only gets and insured mortgage, but he gets an insurance against defect."
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,3220.704,3226.644,"He gets no insurance at all, because if the inspection has been properly conducted."
1960.533,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3241.018,3249.69,The negligence here seems to be established on the mere existence of the facts that the house did crack.
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,3249.69,3251.596,"Oh, that's -- that is not the case at all."
1960.533,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3254.444,3261.292,"I understood him to say, counsel, Mr. Orrick, to say that the time amount was appraised at a perfectly (Inaudible)"
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,3264.617,3267.66,The petitioner does not say that and the record does not say that.
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3360.708,3382.15,I hope I don't reduce your time that you've left if I ask you whether there's any explicit reference in the legislative history to the meaning that was in the mind with the draft which they explicitly in words as to what misrepresentation of purposes of age was intended to cover.
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,3393.247,3406.298,"The reference is to 2680 (h), the explicit reference is where to the statute -- where through that section as a whole, not 2680, but 2680 (h) and to the exception of assault and battery."
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3441.77,3445.433,That couldn't be slander and libel and not deliberate torts?
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,3445.433,3450.387,"Well, they are certainly commonly thought of as deliberate torts."
1960.533,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3450.387,3460.463,"But really, well, the most of the (Inaudible) and slander and libel, except when it purposefully done and (Inaudible) non-deliberative forms."
1960.533,1,34754,lawrence_j_latto,,3460.463,3469.418,"Well, it is true and the Government has relied very heavily on this that there are occasions on which these torts can be committed negligently."
