1967.33,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,15.945,"Number 12, United Mine Workers of America, District 12, Petitioner, versus Illinois State Bar Association."
1967.33,0,26739,harrison_combs,,17.973,24.91,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,245.313,249.918,"That was for the day, Workmen's Compensation Act 1913."
1967.33,0,26739,harrison_combs,,249.918,252.676,Workmen's compensation solely.
1967.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,252.676,255.728,But it was before the days workmen's compensation wasn't it?
1967.33,0,26739,harrison_combs,,255.728,266.093,"Well it was in fact that contemporaneously worth it, I think that the workmen's compensation law was passed in 1912, if I'm not mistaken and this occurred in 1913."
1967.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,280.543,285.925,"Since I have already interrupted you, you tell me what is District 12, is that the statewide --?"
1967.33,0,26739,harrison_combs,,285.925,295.551,"Yes Your Honor, District 12 is branch of national organization, administrative purposes and this jurisdiction is in the State of Illinois and Iowa."
1967.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.551,297.538,Throughout the state of Illinois and Iowa you say?
1967.33,0,26739,harrison_combs,,297.538,298.47,Yes.
1967.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,303.66,311.263,"Is this, does the UMW have the same plans or similar plans in other states?"
1967.33,0,26739,harrison_combs,,311.263,312.836,Yes Your Honor.
1967.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,312.836,314.096,How many other states?
1967.33,0,26739,harrison_combs,,314.096,323.094,I would say they operate in 28 states and I would say that over half of them have some plan of similar nature to this.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,1956.782,1958.449,"I would, thank you very much."
1967.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1958.449,1962.79,Mr. Bertrand you may proceed now.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,1962.79,1967.91,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1967.33,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2021.531,2023.368,(Inaudible)
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2023.368,2027.072,"Well I only wanted to clear the fact that you asked the question Mr. Chief Justice, oh I'm sorry."
1967.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2027.072,2033.106,"No, that's not what I asked."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2033.106,2040.063,"Well, I didn't wanted to have any correction that it was from this proceeding that there was a disciplinary action and that is what the Mr. Combs indicated."
1967.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2040.063,2041.157,Let me ask you this.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2041.157,2043.247,Yes sir.
1967.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2043.247,2052.556,"If this is unauthorized practice of the law, certainly the lawyer who is employed is guilty of unlawful practice of law."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2062.61,2072.574,Because the matter never was brought to the attention to the unauthorized practice committee by anyone making a complaint.
1967.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2072.574,2074.158,Who is the complainant here?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2074.158,2082.6,"The complainant here originally was in some 1957, a lawyer from West Frankfort, Illinois."
1967.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2082.958,2084.409,What was his complaint?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2084.409,2113.02,His complaint was that the present man who was his predecessor Mr. Trainer was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in being a salaried employer for the union and that was taken up by the bar association at that time and through developments it finally reached it's -- the point to where we file a suit at the approval of the bar association.
1967.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2113.02,2114.801,Now this case is 10 years old?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2114.801,2115.959,At least Your Honor.
1967.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2115.959,2118.94,I thought that this man is only been there two years.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2118.94,2126.31,"No, the problem of unauthorized practice by the salaried lawyer is 10 years old."
1967.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2162.047,2172.907,But other than that the state bar has had no interest in this matter since 1913.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2172.907,2180.132,"That is perhaps true, yes Your Honor, there has never been any matter brought directly to the state bar on -- that is correct."
1967.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2200.867,2201.957,Mr. Bertrand.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2201.957,2203.98,Yes Mr. Justice Marshall.
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2203.98,2208.165,Has any miner complained.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2208.165,2211.107,"Yes, miners have complained to the extent--"
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2211.107,2212.152,Is it in the record?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2212.152,2214.1,No sir.
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2214.1,2218.626,"Well, I assume that if complaint has been made would put him in (Inaudible)."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2218.626,2252.338,"Well, these complaints occurred after the bar association started, this proceedings and before and after actually the interrogatories were made and filed and after the deposition of the Mr. Stewart Trainer and it was at that stage of the proceedings that the mine workers, United Mine Workers District 12 came in and asked for a summary judgment and we in turn filed our motion for summary decree and as the court considered both motions."
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2252.338,2254.968,Less than 50 years there were no complaints?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2254.968,2257.393,No active complaints known to the bar.
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2257.393,2261.629,Did the conversation commission make any complaint?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2261.629,2262.844,No sir.
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2262.844,2267.519,Did anybody make any complaint except this one lawyer?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2267.519,2283.204,"No one made any official complaint, but it was a matter of common knowledge among lawyers practicing before the compensation commission of the manner, the wholesale manner in which this was handled by the --"
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2283.204,2287.304,These lawyers complained that the men weren't happily represented?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2287.304,2289.237,"That was part of their complaints, Yes Sir."
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2289.237,2290.968,How did they know that?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2290.968,2314.592,"By virtue of the fact that here was a man that saw these miners -- the day of the occurrence, of the day of the hearing I should say, and for the first time that they did that the man who represented the miners did not handle the case like other people who have cases before the compensation commission."
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2314.592,2319.085,Did you know of any two lawyers that handled the same case in the same way?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2319.085,2321.856,"Yes, I know many handled the same cases the same way--"
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2321.856,2322.081,Did you?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2322.081,2336.732,"Mr. Justice Marshall, yes sir in a manager of this kind I think it would be quite proper and quite often handled that once they get the report from their company doctor, they would then send that man to an independent doctor --"
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2336.732,2340.565,But the record all of this came out during this hearing doesn't it?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2340.565,2342.91,"Yes, that's true, that's part of it is."
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2342.91,2345.702,So I mean you didn't have any complaints before?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2345.702,2348.788,No there was no official written complaint.
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2348.788,2351.553,The record showed that there were no complaints--
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2351.553,2351.77,That's right.
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2351.77,2355.441,There is one name appeared for 50 years.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2355.441,2357.388,That's right.
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2357.388,2361.228,And the only complaint then the complaint with the bars.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2361.228,2363.763,That is correct sir.
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2363.763,2368.872,Why is this case taken 10 years to get here?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2368.872,2389.028,"First instance was the illness of Mr. Hannigan, it was pushed aside by the then members of the unauthorized practice commission because the man was apparently having a condition which, from which he, it was expected he would die."
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2389.6,2391.27,How long was it --?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2391.27,2421.863,It was delayed from 1957 and 1959 till about ‘63 when Mr. Trainer took over and then – and incidentally in that period before that Mr. Chief Justice there was a period of time where Mr. Hannigan was interrogated by the committee and the same general information that appears in the deposition of Mr. Trainer came out at that time.
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2421.863,2428.253,So from ‘57 to ‘63 did Mr. Hannigan serve in this capacity?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2428.253,2428.622,Yes.
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2428.622,2429.792,Was he working?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2429.792,2430.675,Yes.
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2430.675,2434.764,Why would that change the attitude of the bar?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2434.764,2445.878,He was working -- he was working as best he could under the circumstances of his condition and I believe he used his son to help him.
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2445.878,2450.683,Would not that be unauthorized practice of bar too?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2450.683,2468.528,"This of course I agree but it was never brought too ahead due to the fact that there was a certain humanitarian feeling towards Mr. Hannigan, they did not want to do anything at that time that would make him, would worsen his condition."
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2468.528,2469.515,Did he die?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2469.515,2489.783,"Yes sir, he died and that is the reason why Mr. Trainer was replaced, as a matter of fact in an interim of some four or five months his son acted as the mine workers attorney and received his salary."
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2588.175,2606.755,"Now I wonder precisely what your point is, you wouldn't question would you, at this date that the union had the right to recommend a particular lawyer to its members, would you?"
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2606.755,2608.448,Mr. Justice Fortas –
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2608.448,2610.76,You are not asking us to over rule Railroad Trainmen.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2610.76,2618.758,We -- the Illinois State Supreme Court in In re Brotherhood of Trainmen set that pattern.
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2618.758,2621.209,Alright now what is your objection?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2621.209,2622.096,Our objection is –
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2622.096,2632.142,"Let us say the union couldn't have referred every one of these miner to Mr. Trainer or whatever his name was, correct?"
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2632.142,2633.081,That's correct.
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2633.081,2639.332,And that's established by a decision in Railroad Trainmen and now what is your --
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2639.332,2667.984,"Our position is that, our position is that when you make the jump from mere recommendation to the employment of a lawyer, then you insert that particular union or that particular agency into the practice of law and you clove that union with the practice of law which is prohibited and the State of Illinois has the right to regulate the practice."
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2667.984,2681.809,"Is it your point -- well the question is whether it's practice of law -- certain -- state regulation begins that's really the question, no question about the state power to regulate the practice of law."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2701.855,2729.265,"Well the record shows that he had people, members of the union who took these reports of actions, who sought that the man had a medical examination by the company doctor -- that the international secretary, the local stewards, the three or four secretaries of the --"
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2729.265,2733.575,"I am afraid you are not, I am afraid I didn't make my question clear."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2747.941,2751.875,"Not in that specific step, no sir, it does not."
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2751.875,2763.408,Does the record show that the union controlled or attempted to control Mr. Trainer's methodology as procedure in handling these cases?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2763.408,2772.486,"I would say that it shows it by indirection, by the virtue of the number of cases that he had, but it doesn't show it directly."
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2772.486,2773.7,Mr. Bertrand --
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2773.7,2775.038,Yes Mr. Chief Justice.
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2775.038,2793.612,"-- as I understand it, your great interest in this situation and the thing that prompted the action was your concern for the miners themselves, whether they were getting the right kind of legal services under this system."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2794.075,2795.353,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1967.33,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2795.353,2824.547,"Now when this man and his lawyer made this complaint 10 years ago in the preparation of the case before a committee, was any investigation made of whether there had been any malpractice on so far as any of the minors are concerned or whether the minors individually had any claim of that kind?"
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2824.547,2826.074,"No, sir."
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2826.074,2843.984,"I wonder why you wouldn't do that if that's what you are really interested in and in the preparation of your case, I wonder why you wouldn't want to show that that the fact that this man did have that number of cases actually resulted in these people having poor service?"
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2843.984,2852.867,"Mr. Chief Justice, I can only say that the beginning of this occurred before my tenure on the unauthorized practice --"
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2852.867,2853.786,But you are here representing the bar—
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2853.786,2855.845,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2855.845,2857.284,--and not just while you've been --
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2857.284,2874.272,"No, no I am just saying that that occurred beforehand and then when -- during my time on the committee, the present developments occurred with respect to Mr. Steward training."
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2929.157,2936.851,"Okay, did that go to the question of whether the minors themselves received the treatment."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2936.851,2939.443,"I don't know, it did not other than the fact that from --"
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2939.443,2940.821,It's isn't in the record.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2940.821,2941.964,"No sir, it is not."
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2941.964,2943.315,Then we can't consider it can we?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2943.315,2944.367,"No, no that's correct."
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2944.367,2946.584,Now when did you come into this case?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2946.584,2947.756,When did I come into the case?
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2947.756,2948.182,Exactly.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2948.182,2950.524,In 1963 I believe.
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2950.524,2951.757,1963?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2951.757,2952.588,Yeah.
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2952.588,2963.929,"Did you make any, did you make any investigation to find out whether minors have been properly treated under this system before your motion for summary judgment?"
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2963.929,2965.444,In an informal way yes.
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2965.444,2965.726,Yes.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2969.315,2978.319,"Not specific but general, from general conversation with parties including attorneys who represented the coal companies."
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2978.319,2981.176,Why didn't you put them in the record by affidavit or otherwise?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2981.176,2988.431,"Because I felt that the time had transpired, the decree was entered before I could get any of that into the record."
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2988.431,2989.748,When was the decree entered?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,2989.748,3002.137,The decree was entered in 19 -- I don't have the exact date Your Honor.
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3009.094,3010.192,Very well.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3022.431,3023.598,I think it isn't.
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3024.116,3038.752,"Is it not question of challenge to assist him, and are you challenging in any way the manner in which this man -- or do you think it doesn't have anything to do with its constitutionality?"
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3038.752,3039.156,No.
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3064.1,3066.383,But doesn't have anything to do with the constitutionality?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3066.383,3069.516,"No I don't think it does, other than the sense that the --"
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3069.516,3071.47,But he does a good job of it.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3071.47,3071.942,That's --.
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3071.942,3088.919,"Well then why shouldn't we just approach the constitutional question here, Mr. Justice Black's suggestion wholly asides them from these matters you have been talking about it, why shouldn't we just assume that the service here is good if not better?"
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3088.919,3089.113,Well --
1967.33,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.113,3091.915,Under this system or any other system. -
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3091.915,3097.05,I think you have to consider in order to consider the question of whether or not this is --
1967.33,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3097.05,3105.908,Would you be making the same argument if it were shown in this record clearly that this is perhaps the best system for legal services that could possibly be provided?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3105.908,3107.701,I think I'd make the same argument.
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3109.289,3124.73,Well in other words if they employed five men to handle these 400 cases and that would have been adequate under your judgment as to how many cases a lawyer should handle without the same --
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3124.73,3129.355,You have the same evil of being a lay agency interfering with the practice of law.
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3129.355,3131.166,That's all there is in the case.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3131.166,3133.609,That is -- my judgment is the basic element of the case.
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3133.609,3150.082,"Well in substance what you're arguing here is that these people were being represented not by the lawyer or the lawyers, but that their legal work was if anything performed by a lay agency, that's your point."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3150.082,3151.35,That is correct Mr. Justice Fortas.
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3151.35,3173.059,"And there -- and you have to show some basis for that argument because if we go to the compensation and commission records, I suppose it goes that John (Inaudible) who is represented by Mr. Trainer or whoever is a qualified lawyer."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3204.904,3206.505,That's correct.
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3206.505,3229.304,"What you're saying is that that's kind of (Inaudible) since the members then pay them – they then control them since the mineworkers paid them with salary, therefore the mine workers controlled him in the sense that the mine workers were really the representatives of people who appeared to be his clients."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3231.76,3242.102,"No, there isn't -- they either control him or have the right to control him and they could use the influence of their organization to control them and so therefore --"
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3242.102,3250.538,"Suppose they did, what does that have to do with constitutionality, under the federal constitution of this law?"
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3250.538,3255.294,It is my intention Mr. Justice Black that this isn't a federal question at all.
1967.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3255.294,3282.436,"Well Mr. Bertrand, you surely -- it is true isn't it that in Button, we got there with a Virginia system, under which the -- rather NAACP system in Virginia, where the compensation to the lawyer on behalf of the litigants was not paid by the litigants but was paid by the NAACP, wasn't it?"
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3301.076,3302.259,Yes.
1967.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3302.259,3306.515,"Now surely on the constitutional question, you just can't say there isn't any in light of that decision."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3306.515,3329.844,"Well I can for this simple reason, because in that case there was, as has been time and time repeated, this was a case of political expression and in that case the opinion itself, the opinion stated sir that this was different than private disputes."
1967.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3337.584,3349.342,"It certainly says that this was in an area of lawsuits to vindicate political rights, otherwise by the First Amendment."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3349.342,3349.563,That's right.
1967.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3349.563,3352.506,"But surely it didn't decide the question about the dispute, didn't it?"
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3352.506,3354.133,"No it did not, it left it open."
1967.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3354.133,3357.058,But we do have that issue before us --
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3357.058,3376.653,"Then if you take the Virginia Brotherhood case, you will find there that the court stated there that the members had the right to discuss within themselves and to pick a representative, to recommend --"
1967.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3376.653,3386.633,"There wasn't any issue presented in the Brotherhood case as I recall it and that's correct, the issue presented by this case was not presented in that case."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3386.633,3398.51,Well the issue presented in the Brotherhood case was clearly that Virginia wouldn't let the Brotherhood getaway with a recommendation for -- approach.
1967.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3398.51,3401.699,Perhaps I didn't state my question well.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3414.808,3415.176,No.
1967.33,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3415.722,3435.703,"Would you be making the same argument as the union here instead of calling in an employee and paying the salary, just paying the retainer -- say the gentleman was in private practice and a general practice or with a firm and the union just paid him --"
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3435.703,3441.778,"Mr. Justice White, I find no difference between a salaried employer and a person on retain."
1967.33,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3441.778,3452.864,I gather you would not make the same argument then if the union just told all of its employees go hire any lawyer you want and we'll pay his fee.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3452.864,3454.017,That is correct.
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3454.017,3464.397,"Mr. Bertrand can you distinguish this case from the legal assistance program or the Poverty Office, the OEO."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3511.213,3521.399,"On the contrary Mr. Justice Fortas, this is a question which you have raised is a question of taking care of the need of indigents."
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3526.63,3529.224,What's that got to do with any legal front?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3529.224,3530.441,Well I submit that --
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3530.441,3534.013,Or the regulation of the practice of the law.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3556.654,3565.002,But the bar of Illinois and the bar throughout this country did not object to the OEO program for the indigent.
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3565.236,3568.927,"Oh I'm very proud, I'm very proud of the fact that they supported it enthusiastically."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3568.927,3570.474,That's right.
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3605.574,3621.236,You mean that's fundamentally different even though the individual minor lost an arm or a leg they could still -- different from the OEO situation because one is an indigent and the other isn't?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3621.236,3623.026,"Mr. Chief Justice, yes I do."
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3625.922,3627.208,What if he lost both legs.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3627.208,3630.511,Well if he -- again I have to say that's the same thing.
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3630.511,3631.204,Same thing.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3631.204,3631.453,Same thing.
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3631.453,3634.389,What makes a person indigent and subject to --?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3634.389,3667.113,"Well, he became indigent perhaps after that particular occurrence if you might say, maybe he didn't I don't know what the situation maybe from his injury that he received as a minor but that does not put him over into the class of the indigent before the event by any manner or means and it would have to be the most serious type of situation that you could call him then an indigent."
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3667.113,3684.066,Suppose a man was not an indigent and he lost both legs in an automobile accident and he then became indigent and he went to the OEO for help.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3690.144,3695.038,Because there's a protection of employment that he had in one instance as opposed to the other.
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3706.827,3709.97,So did the fellow who lost his two legs in an automobile accident.
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3709.97,3719.352,But in the minor situation he has of course the protection of the collective bargaining arrangements and the welfare program of his union.
1967.33,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3800.533,3822.986,"Okay but those segments are not in this case but there are some things that are relevant I think that are now and how do you dispose off the legal aid bureaus in this country that are devoted to defending, taking care of people's lives in civil matters as well as criminal matters?"
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3863.483,3874.863,"And I would say that Illinois is a forward-looking bar association because it does engage in that type of procedure, there's a large legal aid bureau in Chicago."
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3878.679,3885.378,Now what is the basic difference between that employment and the employment there is here?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3885.378,3894.229,Because there the people are in need of legal assistance and they don't have the means to get it.
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3915.205,3938.513,"Isn't that the general situation so far as medical care in this country is concerned with a great mass of working people, they are not indigent at one moment but when they became ill, they are indigent because they can't pay the medical expenses but in this situation they can't pay the legal expenses to get their rights."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3938.513,3946.2,Of course Mr. Chief Justice I say that that's the extreme I mean we -- I claim that that's the extreme that they can't.
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3954.211,3966.648,"There are many millions of people who are supposed to be in that class or in this country from all of the studies that have been made, that's what brought Medicare into existence, isn't it?"
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3966.648,3970.957,That is correct.
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3970.957,3976.697,"But it wasn't the extreme case, it was normal case."
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,3976.697,3999.254,"Well, I don't know how you can categorize them of course in the true sense of the word but it was found there was a need to legal aid societies, lawyer reference services were established and the bar has done a great service to the public by being involved in all those things."
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4070.182,4071.776,How about Appalachia?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,4071.776,4075.407,Appalachia is a different thing what occurs in Appalachia and what is --
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4075.407,4081.845,Will the constitutional principle of your case be different than Appalachia?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,4081.845,4097.429,"I won't say no because if you remember Mr. Combs informed the Court that in Appalachia in West Virginia, they also had a complaint by the Bar Association and they sat down and worked it out."
1967.33,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4105.732,4107.13,What did you want them to do?
1967.33,1,17474,bernard_h_bertrand,,4107.13,4124.499,"We wanted them, our major premise was we wanted them to follow Illinois mineworker's opinion which said that you can recommend attorneys whom you feel to be competent; we wanted them to do that."
1967.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4150.31,4155.34,Mr. Combs.
1967.33,2,26739,harrison_combs,,4155.34,4178.944,"Court please, by way of rebuttal in connection with the position taken by counsel that the bar association as a matter of policy had a compelling interest to protect the coal miners against their legal aid system of Illinois that's what it was known to."
1967.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4275.994,4288.581,"Mr. Combs on the one hand, I gather you would also argue to sustain union counsel right across the board for members -- again by the litigation of all kind."
1967.33,2,26739,harrison_combs,,4288.581,4293.226,"I think there would be a difference if the Court please -- in this case, this --"
1967.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4293.226,4295.592,"Well that's all, I just wanted to figure."
1967.33,2,26739,harrison_combs,,4295.592,4299.758,"Well let me read what the court said about that, I think I can get it for you in a minute."
1967.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4362.774,4383.822,"Well let's see, this record contained a series of interventions by the union in to these cases with reference to the attorney or a reservation of the contract to get the -- employer wants some thing in the direction of the union, would you say then that the state had made out a decent case?"
1967.33,2,26739,harrison_combs,,4383.822,4385.429,That would make a different case Your Honor.
1967.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4401.791,4406.244,A different case -- would then the state have an interest?
1967.33,2,26739,harrison_combs,,4406.244,4407.902,I think it was the --
1967.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4407.902,4409.603,(Inaudible)
1967.33,2,26739,harrison_combs,,4409.603,4416.243,I think it probably could in some instances you have to have the facts in order to determine it.
