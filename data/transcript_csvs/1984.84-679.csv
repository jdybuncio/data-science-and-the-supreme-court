1984.84-679,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.359,We'll hear arguments next in Bateman Eichler against Berner.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,66.744,70.547,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-679,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,181.34,183.54,Was that a violation of the securities laws?
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,183.54,188.454,"At that particular point there is a suggestion that it would be, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-679,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,257.469,264.014,And you suggest that was a signal that in effect was a violation of the act?
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,264.014,264.975,Exactly.
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,322.021,335.16,"Well, Mr. Warren, is the tippee liable derivatively through Lazzaro or directly, in your view, from Mr. Neadeau?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,335.16,360.658,"The tippee here, Justice O'Connor, is liable both directly from Mr. Neadeau, through the contact with Mr. Neadeau, and derivatively by virtue of being, if you will, a subtippee from Mr. Lazzaro, knowing of Mr. Neadeau's involvement or of some counterpart of Mr. Neadeau."
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,360.658,365.0,"We have to look at this based on the face of the complaint, do we not?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,365.0,366.42,Exactly we do.
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,366.42,376.788,"And the complaint does not say, of course, how Mr. Lazzaro got his information or what it was that Mr. Neadeau told Mr. Lazzaro, if anything."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,376.788,377.867,That is correct.
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,378.979,386.225,It could be a total fabrication by Mr. Lazzaro that he was told anything by Mr. Neadeau.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,386.225,386.702,--It could have been.
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,389.664,394.299,"Well, just looking at the face of the complaint, that could be true, could it not?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,394.299,395.608,--That could be true.
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,396.119,404.066,"And therefore, no derivative liability of the tippee through Mr. Lazzaro from the face of the complaint alone."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,404.066,410.1,--Not on the basis of what the facts are as the Plaintiffs assumed them to be.
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,419.915,430.002,And what is it that Mr. Neadeau said directly to the tippee that you say imposes this liability on the part of the tippee?
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,430.002,467.767,"First, the Plaintiffs allege, and they allege this as a charging allegation, so it is assumed that this was an important statement to them and one that they deemed important in determining to go upon this acquisition program of stock... they said they told Mr. Neadeau that they were dealing with Mr. Lazzaro and that they wanted to confirm certain information, and they said in the complaint that what they wanted to confirm was the gold strike in Surinam and the prospective joint venture with St. Joe's."
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,467.767,474.972,I thought the complaint discloses that Mr. Neadeau refused to confirm or deny that.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,474.972,502.579,The complaint alleges a statement by Mr. Neadeau that the Plaintiffs allege misled them into believing that they had inside information and a jump on every other TONM shareholder in that he made a statement to them that they allege in their complaint... it must be to make it a charging allegation... was a clever confirmation while nonconfirming.
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,637.909,653.368,"In your view, Mr. Warren, would the in pari delicto defense always be available then to a tippee who voluntarily trades on what is represented to be insider information?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,653.368,680.705,"--I believe that if the tippee, as here, is put in the position to understand that the information was received from a corporate insider with a fiduciary duty not to disclose it selectively, and as here, they know that it has been disclosed selectively for the purpose of causing the customers of a certain broker to enjoy an unfair advantage, yes."
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,694.116,703.6,"Do you think it is correct to say that at common law, the in pari delicto defense was available in an action for fraud?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,703.6,704.512,Yes.
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,752.914,753.913,By what?
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,753.913,754.894,I beg your pardon?
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,754.894,759.887,"By passing out false information or what, or by... or withholding information?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,759.887,769.343,They allege that the Defendants were engaged in what they call manipulation of the market.
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,777.188,796.061,"So if equal... if close to equal fault is essential for the defense to be invoked, what is the difference between... is there some difference between these... the tipper, the tipster and the tippee, in this case?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,796.061,807.989,"Not a meaningful difference, in our view, because they each intended according to the allegations of the complaint as we read them to commit a fraud on stockholders."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,807.989,812.07,"Well, they also... they also intended to use inside information."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,812.07,816.635,The tippees?
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,816.635,818.225,Well so did the tipster.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,819.537,821.187,"Oh, the tipster to use in side information."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.542,832.547,"Well, then, the tipster not only was purporting to use inside information, but he was also lying."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,832.547,839.229,"And says, I believe, the Dirks... I'm sorry."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,839.229,843.442,"And the tippee, the tippee didn't lie to anybody, he just didn't tell them what the facts were."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,843.442,866.497,"Well, I don't... I suggest that the difference between an actionable misrepresentation under 10(b)(5) and an actionable nondisclosure such as under Affiliated Ute under 10(b)(5) are indistinguishable."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,867.468,874.504,"Yes, but the tipster might be stuck under state law for defrauding somebody."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,874.504,879.637,"--The tipster might be stuck under state law for defrauding somebody, of course."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.637,886.491,He wouldn't be... but the tippee wouldn't be committing a state law offense by just not... just by saying caveat emptor.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,886.491,894.766,"Oh, I... perhaps I am unduly influence by the fact that I am from the State of California, but I don't think that could be--"
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,894.766,895.727,You have statutory.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,895.727,897.467,--I don't think that could be said in the State of California.
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,897.467,898.469,You have statutory remedies.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,898.469,903.221,"Well, we have, yes, we have a... yes, we are a code state."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,926.059,931.451,So the tippee wants to buy some stock from some stockholder because he thinks the stock is going up.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,941.577,953.956,"--No, but if he, if he had gone to a corporate insider with a fiduciary duty to that shareholder that he is going to go buy it from--"
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.956,954.546,I understand that.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,954.546,968.924,"--and he gets told something by that corporate insider that is not to be revealed and is a breach of duty to do so, and he then goes and buys that stock and he doesn't disclose, yes, I believe indeed he is guilty of actual fraud."
1984.84-679,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,977.48,988.507,"If this stock had gone to 28 and then this fellow had sold it and made a very large profit, would it be subject to some vulnerability on the part of others?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,988.507,994.844,Would the plaintiffs here be subject to vulnerability to a suit by others?
1984.84-679,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,995.873,1023.071,"Now, as I read the District judge, he said he wasn't going to get into a fine tuned weighing of quantitative dishonesty, quantitative fraud, quantitative violations of the Securities Act, that he was going to weigh and did weigh what he thought was the qualitative violations, and he thought qualitatively they were in the same boat."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1023.902,1024.951,That is correct.
1984.84-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1188.259,1189.548,"Mr. Warren, can I interrupt with one question?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1189.548,1189.929,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1189.929,1203.96,"I guess one of the problems is what really is equal fault in cases of this kind, and if I understand your colloquy with Justice White, you say it really doesn't make any difference whether the tipster was telling the truth or not; in either event it is equally bad."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1203.96,1205.14,Yes--
1984.84-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1205.14,1218.269,"Is that... in other words, supposing you had a case in which a tipster... a broker says to a customer, I just talked to the president of the company and they are about to buy a gold mine, and in one case that is just no basis in fact for it; in the other case it's totally true."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1224.882,1238.351,"--I would say in neither case could the customer recover, and if it is true, of course, as pointed out in Kuehnert and pointed out in Tarasi, it is likely that there will be no need to worry about the problem because all concerned will be wealthy."
1984.84-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1238.351,1243.895,"Well, no, not because... at the time he tells him, it is true, but then a month later the deal falls apart."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1246.506,1247.748,There's that possibility.
1984.84-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.748,1253.903,"So that at the time of the transaction, though, everybody was dealing in at least not a false way."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1258.173,1263.026,"Oh, well, in the former case, we also will leave out now the wealthy because it didn't pan out."
1984.84-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.986,1278.677,"Well, there is intent in both case to trade on inside information."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1282.31,1283.121,Yes.
1984.84-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.121,1296.749,"And it seems to me that one could make a stronger argument that when everybody thought it was true but they just thought they would make a little money on the side, that you would say they are equally guilty, but it is a little different if he... I just... if one of them is lying and the other one didn't realize it."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1296.749,1314.862,"I understand, Justice Stevens, but I don't think, still, in your first postulate, there would be any cause of action at all because the two parties may have engaged in inside trading, but there would be no relationship between the inside trading and the loss."
1984.84-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1328.349,1334.714,But there would be... isn't it a violation of the securities law to give inside information in that situation?
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1334.714,1340.086,"Perhaps insofar as the SEC is concerned, but not insofar as a private right of action is concerned."
1984.84-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1340.086,1340.787,"Well, why not?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1346.221,1349.623,"Because there's no deception, there's been no violation as to him."
1984.84-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.281,1366.995,"So you are saying that the broker who gives inside information, truthful inside information to a customer, does not violate the statute?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1366.995,1368.247,Not to the customer.
1984.84-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1403.37,1405.059,"Well, I don't understand your as to."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1410.354,1414.786,But they call it a violation not because the broker did something bad to the customer--
1984.84-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1414.786,1422.91,"That may be the reason why, but I still say there is a violation, as I understand the law, and it conceivably, it could cause an injury to the person who acts on the basis of the information."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1422.91,1441.604,"--But the person against whom the violation is perpetrated is not the customer, it is the stockholder out there, and yet under your postulate, you are having the customer come in and sue, and it is not the customer who has been misled under those circumstances."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1447.027,1454.524,"Well, why don't we leave out all these... why don't you just say that the insider, the tipster is, say, an officer of the corporation."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1454.524,1455.403,All right.
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.403,1456.745,And he tips a friend.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1458.267,1458.364,Yes.
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1458.364,1467.57,"And that friend then goes out and buys a bunch of corporate stock without revealing anything, without revealing that he is dealing in inside information."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1467.57,1468.161,Yes.
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1468.161,1470.893,Those people he bought the stock from have a cause of action against him.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1470.893,1471.714,"They do, yes."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.714,1472.904,"Yes, they do."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1478.179,1479.388,No.
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.388,1482.361,What if it... but that's only on the assumption--
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1482.361,1483.032,He has not been wronged.
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1483.963,1487.754,"--Yes, but that's only on the assumption though that the inside information is true."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1505.084,1510.429,"He would but for the existence of the in pari delicto defense, that's right."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.429,1511.17,"Well, I know, but--"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1511.17,1512.1,That's the one hypothetical--
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1512.1,1523.697,"--In this case, in this case, in this case you are comparing, as Justice Stevens and I were pursuing before, you are comparing dealing in inside information with deliberate fraud."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1523.697,1525.159,"--No, but the--"
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.159,1535.325,"And the only, in really inside information case, the tipster has breached his duty to the stockholders."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1535.325,1536.957,--Justice White--
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1536.957,1540.009,And you are trying to enforce that also through the tippee.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1540.009,1544.29,"--Justice White, an insider trading case is an actual fraud."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1546.972,1547.763,"On whom, on whom?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1547.763,1549.706,--on the shareholder that sells the stock.
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1549.706,1553.149,All right.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1553.149,1556.461,"The shareholder that sells the stock without being told the truth, that's the fraud."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1556.461,1558.103,It's a breach of fiduciary duty.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1560.315,1561.066,"Well, it is a--"
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1561.066,1563.256,"That's fraud, a type of fraud."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1563.256,1566.559,--It is a fraudulent or deceptive practice under Section 10.
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1566.559,1579.117,"And you say that's... if that's all the... and you think that the tipster who does that... suppose he just lies, as I said."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1583.189,1584.03,No.
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.03,1585.259,If he just lies?
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1585.259,1588.973,"If he just lies to his customer, he has defrauded his customer."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1588.973,1594.276,"All right, he has lied to his friend, and he has committed on fraud on the stockholders of the corporation."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1594.276,1595.748,"That's right, he has just defrauded his friend."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.748,1602.623,"And so then I would think you still think, though, in that case there would be in pari delicto defense."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1602.623,1615.309,"I do, if the customer, knowing of the wrongful breach of fiduciary duty, capitalized on it to his own benefit to go out and commit the fraud that he intended to commit on the customer."
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1632.86,1634.483,Mr. Warren--
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1634.483,1635.572,Yes.
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1635.572,1645.38,"--Dirks seemed to talk in terms of a requirement that the insider, the tipster, act for personal gain."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1656.295,1664.303,"It's clear that the plaintiffs had every reason to believe that he was acting for personal gain, and it is their mind set that we look at."
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1664.303,1674.589,"Well, did Dirks look at what the tippee thought, or did Dirks also speak in terms of a requirement that the tipster be acting for personal gain?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1674.589,1680.182,"In the case of in pari delicto, I think we are looking at what the tippee thought, but let's add both."
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1680.182,1686.347,"So suppose the tipster just let it slip at a golf game, no personal gain at all."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1686.347,1688.578,"Now, that's correct, that's correct."
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1718.326,1721.381,"Well, how does that relate to any personal gain by Neadeau?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1721.381,1737.309,"It was made clear in Dirks, I thought, that on an objective fact basis we would look to see whether there was any benefit to the insider, meaning wrongful desire to secure something for himself, either monetarily, or to give--"
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1737.309,1741.323,"Well, did the complaint allege that Mr. Neadeau was going to gain personally?"
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1741.323,1743.774,--It did not say those words.
1984.84-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1746.416,1752.58,"Well, since we look only at the Complaint, it looks to me like you don't have in pari delicto defense here."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1752.58,1762.708,"Justice O'Connor, we look at the facts in the complaint, and those facts, while they don't say he personally gained, they show that he did personally gain."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.418,1780.76,And drove the price up.
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1780.76,1784.482,"--And it drove the price up, yes, for the benefit of all."
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.609,1797.249,Could I ask you one quick question?
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1809.828,1810.429,--All right.
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.152,1849.675,So you think that the Complaint on its face alleges that part of it is false and part of it is true?
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1849.675,1851.185,I think that is correct.
1984.84-679,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.569,1856.731,"I know, I know."
1984.84-679,0,40797,robert_s_warren,,1856.731,1861.322,"Because as in the case of Judge Weinfeld, I believe that is beside the point."
1984.84-679,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1877.282,1879.715,Mr. Knudsen?
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,1879.715,1885.709,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-679,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1920.922,1923.793,"Well, would that make it any less a violation of 10(b)(5)?"
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,1923.793,1925.013,--Pardon me?
1984.84-679,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1925.013,1930.457,"That he was... the narrowness of, the scope of the fraud."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,1930.457,1956.095,"Well, the scope of the fraud, as alleged in the complaint, would have some effect in terms of interpreting whether the Plaintiffs could be considered to be of equal fault or in pari delicto, but the complaint itself is meant to alleged a... just a fraud 10(b)(5) violation in the context of a market manipulation, and that the plaintiffs were injured by it."
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2035.316,2048.484,"Well, would the tippee in this case have been... be liable to those people that he bought stock from?"
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2048.484,2054.959,"Because the allegations are that the information was false, there would be no liability."
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2054.959,2056.181,Because?
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2061.802,2062.922,No one was injured.
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.148,2073.971,So you think we have to read the complaint as alleging everything was false.
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2073.971,2080.756,--I think you need to read the complaint as alleging everything is false.
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.567,2095.805,"Well, let's assume we don't agree with you, part fault, part true, and so there was some use of inside information, which the person who bought the stock on the open market didn't disclose."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2095.805,2106.022,"--Well, I don't think you can look at the face of the complaint and then conclude that the allegations are part false and part true."
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.474,2112.767,"I know, but let me just give you my question again."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2112.767,2114.277,--Okay.
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2114.277,2119.029,"Let's assume we don't agree with you and that the complaint says part true, part false."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2123.624,2125.574,Would he have liability?
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.574,2126.285,Yes.
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2126.285,2130.998,To the extent that there was damage to such a person--
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.998,2131.959,So the answer is yes.
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2131.959,2134.941,--Related to the true information.
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2134.941,2140.284,"So he failed to disclose, and he could be held liable under the securities laws."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2140.284,2141.987,If he received true information.
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2141.987,2142.905,"Yes, exactly."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2142.905,2143.536,Right.
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.536,2146.056,So at least he is delicto.
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2146.056,2153.643,"To the extent that he receives true information, he would be delicto, in delicto."
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.643,2154.505,Exactly.
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2154.505,2155.433,That's right--
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.433,2162.639,"And the argument would... then the question would come down, is it in pari delicto."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2162.639,2183.363,"--Okay, and in terms of deciding in pari delicto, then if you are trying to decide it on the face of the complaint, assuming that you read the complaint that some is true and some is false, the complaint in my opinion would be a very bad device to make that determination of in pari delicto."
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.363,2185.523,"Yes, but it was made below."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2185.523,2187.644,"Well, it was made by the district--"
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2187.644,2188.625,That's why the cast is here.
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2188.625,2195.02,"--It was made by the District Court, and that was my argument in the 9th Circuit, that it would be a bad device to use."
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.716,2209.72,"So as far as they are concerned, there was no use of inside information at all."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2209.72,2216.724,--I don't think that they decided the issue of whether it is inside information in the context of this--
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2216.724,2217.845,"Well, if it was false, it wasn't."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2217.845,2220.477,--No.
1984.84-679,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2250.566,2251.896,"I agree with you, I agree with you."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2251.896,2287.409,"Which at common law, if you have an actual fraud and the determination, there is a public policy issue if withholding the relief would do more to offend public morals, then in pari delicto would not apply, and that is the situation that the 9th Circuit addressed and said if there is a fraud aimed at these Plaintiffs and aimed at the market, then to withhold relief or to withhold the opportunity to pursue their claim would be more offensive in the concept of... in the context of in pari delicto."
1984.84-679,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2287.409,2309.655,"Do you agree with your friend's response when I put to him this question, that if this stock had gone up to 28 and then this gentleman sold out at 28, would you be subject to a claim for recovery from them, and then after that it dropped to where it did drop, 1 or less?"
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2318.801,2341.806,"I'm into Justice White's problem in the sense that if you read that there is some true inside information or nonpublic information and some false, and the stock goes to 28 based on an activity of trading, and then there is this true information about the gold find, yes, there would be liability."
1984.84-679,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2354.614,2358.265,I take it you concede there was market manipulation here?
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2358.265,2378.361,"Absolutely, but that is not the activity that my... that was done unknowingly with my clients and the Plaintiffs as an instrumentality of that, and they were not part of a conspiracy to benefit from that market manipulation, and in fact, they lost money, and that is why they have come forward and asserted their claims."
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.361,2382.723,I don't understand how you can say that in response to the Chief Justice's question.
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2396.242,2397.442,"Yes, that's correct."
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2397.442,2398.984,"Now, why isn't that a violation?"
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2402.377,2405.917,I said they would if the information was true information.
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.917,2407.299,--What difference does it make?
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2419.227,2425.111,"Well, I think that the hypothetical becomes a little difficult to deal with because if it is false information, the stock doesn't go to 28."
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2427.0,2429.892,"Well, it may have as long as people think the information is true."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2432.924,2435.946,"--Oh, I see, and they sell out in the context of--"
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2435.946,2439.609,"--They sell out when... you say they wanted to, and they were talked out of selling out."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2443.483,2450.306,"--That's absolutely right, and that's what is charged by the complaint."
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.1,2473.743,Isn't it almost certainly true that some of the information is going to be true?
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2486.531,2486.971,--No.
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2495.196,2497.096,And the scheme involved a mixture of--
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2497.096,2497.717,--Essentially--
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2497.717,2499.95,--half truths and truths and falsehoods.
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2499.95,2501.751,--But essentially false information.
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2501.751,2517.301,"Well, I just have difficulty understanding how your... whether your client was engaged in wrongdoing turns out... depends on whether he finds out later that the information was false or not."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2517.301,2556.367,"Well, to the extent my client is engaged in wrongdoing may not depend on that at all unless you look at it in the context of perhaps this court's Chiarella and Dirks analysis, and then you have to look at a duty to disclose, and then the question comes up how can you have a... how could the insider have a duty to disclose false information because that is the very thing you don't want to happen, but in ignoring that distinction recently drawn, yes, I think the SEC's position would be that it doesn't matter whether it is true or false, my clients are in delicto, as Justice White said."
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2580.061,2582.882,May I ask you just one other question?
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2582.882,2583.283,--Sure.
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.283,2584.885,Then I will get it all off my chest.
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2605.428,2613.673,"Well, I say he has no cause of action because you don't have the degree of scienter on the Defendant that would be required by Ernst & Ernst for a 10(b) violation, I agree."
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2613.673,2618.686,"He would know he is deal... he is passing out inside information, he knows he has a duty not to do so."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2627.024,2629.034,Maybe I misunderstood your question.
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2629.034,2630.454,Everybody is telling the truth.
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2631.665,2632.844,Everyone is telling the truth.
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2632.844,2638.921,"The broker says they just found a gold mine, they are going to make a billion dollar deal, it is a good buy, it is inside information, don't tell anybody."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2638.921,2639.129,Right.
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2639.129,2646.906,"You trade on it, and the stock goes up for a while, but then the deal falls through, but everybody is dealing on inside information."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2654.78,2664.868,"No, I don't believe so because of the scienter requirement for... because it is not an insider... he doesn't have a claim for insider trading."
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2680.736,2682.919,"So what it boils down, it is all right to trade on inside information as long as it is true."
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2682.919,2683.658,Pardon me?
1984.84-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2683.658,2687.601,What it boils down to is it is all right to trade on inside information as long as it is true.
1984.84-679,1,25562,geoffrey_p_knudsen,,2687.601,2690.013,"No, that's a different question."
1984.84-679,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2779.081,2788.028,Mr. Kuhlik?
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,2788.028,2792.049,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-679,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2999.554,3000.966,May I ask just one question?
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3000.966,3001.875,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-679,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3001.875,3007.922,Assuming after trial there is a findings that everything everybody said was entirely truthful; is there liability or not?
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3007.922,3009.482,On whose part?
1984.84-679,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3010.413,3013.215,"Well, does the Plaintiff recover from the Defendant in this case?"
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3013.215,3015.295,--If all of the information was truthful--
1984.84-679,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3015.295,3017.036,"It's all inside information, but it was truthful."
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3017.036,3020.359,--Then I do not believe they could recover because they would not have been deceived.
1984.84-679,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3020.359,3022.83,All right.
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3022.83,3037.278,"I think when tippees consider whether to trade on inside information, they do not consider seriously the possibility of recovery in court if the information turns out to be false."
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3064.139,3072.154,"So your submission is that we ought to just, in this case at least, forget the notion of equal fault?"
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3072.154,3075.335,"No, Justice White, I believe--"
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.335,3083.36,"I should say that no matter whether they are equal or not, enforcement of the securities laws is so important that the defense should not be allowed."
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3083.36,3098.901,"--My position is that the enforcement of the securities laws is so important that the defense should only be allowed where it will further the purposes of the securities laws, even if in a particular case the fault of the parties were relatively equal."
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3110.339,3111.858,Because?
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3111.858,3125.856,--Because they abused their special position in the scheme of the capital market system and in the scheme of the enforcement of the securities laws to perpetrate a fraud on the investors.
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3125.856,3136.475,"Well, the tippees, assuming there was some true information that wasn't disclosed, the tippees also are in trouble, aren't they, with the people they bought from."
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3136.475,3137.924,It is true that if--
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.924,3139.066,Under the securities law.
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3139.066,3162.391,"--Under the securities laws, Justice White, if a plaintiff could prove that the investors here traded on inside information knowing that information or being on notice that that information was received in breach of a fiduciary duty of an insider and that that caused a trading loss to some other group of investors, then they would be liable, but--"
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.391,3171.888,"Well, but that is... you think that is less reprehensible than what the broker and the tipster did?"
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3171.888,3173.828,"--I believe it is, and that the--"
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3173.828,3175.521,Because of their special position?
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3175.521,3176.921,"--Because, well, of a number of factors."
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3350.414,3381.585,"Could I ask you in this connection, please, if all the information that the broker and the insider handed out was false, all of it was false, and they knew it to be false, and they passed it out to the investor who acted on it thinking it was true inside information, he buys stock, the stock goes down, is then the investor liable to the people he bought from?"
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3381.585,3390.761,"If all of the information is false, Justice White, I don't believe that the other parties to the trade would have an action."
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3390.761,3393.753,"Yes, because there really, he wasn't using inside information."
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3393.753,3397.783,But he... there was nothing that he used that he should have disclosed to them that--
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.783,3398.284,Exactly.
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3398.284,3400.886,--caused them the loss in those circumstances.
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3400.886,3401.406,Yes.
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3404.308,3407.511,"Well, he might not be, although I believe--"
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3407.511,3408.873,What would he be?
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3408.873,3412.363,"--Well, some of the cases, Justice White, speak in terms of moral blame--"
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3412.363,3415.776,"They may be similar cases, but your view is that he wouldn't be in delicto at all."
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3415.776,3417.679,"--He would not be in delicto, he would not have violated--"
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3417.679,3423.841,"So, but he... but certainly his rights were violated at the outset."
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3423.841,3425.714,"--I might have misspoken, Justice White."
1984.84-679,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3467.051,3468.283,I see.
1984.84-679,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3468.891,3475.556,"At this posture of the case, we don't believe the complaint conclusively shows that."
1984.84-679,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3549.966,3552.327,"Thank you, gentlemen."
