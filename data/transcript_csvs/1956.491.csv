1956.491,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,6.817,"Number 491, Leona Peak versus United States of America."
1956.491,0,33602,john_s_wrinkle,,9.072,12.182,May it please the Court.
1956.491,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,976.508,982.375,What is the name of that case who counsel that you just -- the one in 85 Pacific?
1956.491,0,33602,john_s_wrinkle,,982.375,992.877,Howard versus Equitable Life Insurance Society 85 Pacific 2d 253.
1956.491,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1387.369,1387.67,You may.
1956.491,0,33602,john_s_wrinkle,,1387.67,1389.206,In fact if I need to --
1956.491,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1389.206,1390.081,"You may, Mr. Wrinkle."
1956.491,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1398.046,1407.235,The Government moved in the trial court to dismiss the complaint on two separate grounds considered with the alternatives.
1956.491,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1452.277,1457.65,You won't reach that point if -- if you just work on the other one.
1956.491,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1457.65,1460.069,"That could be said, either way, sir."
1956.491,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1474.475,1476.874,"But on the second point, there's no conflict."
1956.491,1,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,1476.874,1478.6,"On the second point, there is no conflict."
1956.491,2,33602,john_s_wrinkle,,2084.181,2091.404,I don't know.
1956.491,3,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2094.371,2108.671,"No, he -- four payments amounting to $26 had been deducted from his pay to be -- waiver could have been accomplished at anytime after August 1, 1947, under amendments to the Act."
1956.491,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2124.37,2130.168,But after the pay and coming as of the date that he disappeared.
1956.491,3,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2130.168,2132.6,"I have no knowledge how they account for that, sir."
1956.491,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2132.6,2135.731,Did they hold it or until he was found or --
1956.491,3,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2135.731,2155.853,"Well, I -- I do know that there are number of cases which have held that the premiums cannot be paid by this amount which even the Veterans Administration declares to the policy holders under these payments they make from time to time of the excess."
1956.491,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2173.881,2175.367,"No, but my point is this."
1956.491,3,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2188.501,2190.177,"There is nothing in the record to show, sir."
1956.491,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2191.653,2195.792,What is the normal way of doing that in a situation of that kind?
1956.491,3,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2195.792,2204.246,I have an idea that when a person is charged with being absent without leave and possible suspicion of being a deserter that they forfeit the money.
1956.491,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2210.616,2216.269,But is this man listed as a deserter?
1956.491,3,25631,george_stephen_leonard,,2216.269,2217.992,No official action has been taken.
1956.491,4,33602,john_s_wrinkle,,3136.702,3159.443,"If I may go out at the record a little, Mr. C. G. Milligan who is on our brief has account some representative in the American National to Life Insurance Company and that company had felt the policy ought to being paid and he brought a suit against the father to have that settled."
1956.491,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3376.362,3390.043,"Mr. Wrinkle, may I ask, does your argument add up to this that you can see that you have to prove death but you say that proving it or having alleged it sufficiently to justify the influence of death in 1943?"
1956.491,4,33602,john_s_wrinkle,,3396.174,3396.7,That's right.
1956.491,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3400.143,3414.298,"Now, may I ask another question, does at any part of your argument today that there's to be an inference from this complaint or that any is justified that a claim was made with the Veterans Administration during the seven-year period?"
1956.491,4,33602,john_s_wrinkle,,3414.298,3415.717,I don't think it was made.
1956.491,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3417.874,3418.928,So you're not relying on that.
1956.491,4,33602,john_s_wrinkle,,3418.928,3421.288,-- from the pleading.
