1973.72-1597,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,37.276,"We will hear arguments next in 72-1597, Beasley against Food Fair of North Carolina."
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,38.535,41.469,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-1597,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,353.618,369.079,We’ll resume there at 1 o’clock counsel.[Noon Recess]
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,371.145,372.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-1597,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,664.6,675.426,Did the state court have any -- did the state court identify any particular provision that the state law was in conflict with?
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,675.426,676.527,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-1597,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,771.072,772.802,But here you don’t have a right to work.
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,775.86,776.72,Yes sir.
1973.72-1597,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,780.058,785.481,The point involved in this case as to whether these supervisors had the right to organize.
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,785.481,786.584,"No sir, that is I submit --"
1973.72-1597,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,786.584,788.448,"Well, what are they fired for?"
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,788.448,790.623,For simply signing union card.
1973.72-1597,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,790.623,791.701,Is that organization?
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,791.701,792.172,Yes sir.
1973.72-1597,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,793.369,800.254,Is that what the Labor Act is set up to control organizing of labors?
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,800.254,805.935,"Your Honor, yes sir but I submit to the Court that organization includes much more than just joining a union."
1973.72-1597,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,812.999,823.45,All I am talking about is you keep saying that this is the right to work that North Carolina statute is interested in protecting the right to work.
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,823.45,824.196,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1597,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,824.196,827.559,And the right to work is not involved I submit in this case.
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,831.941,836.492,I respectfully disagree with you Your Honor for this reason if I might explain.
1973.72-1597,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,859.682,862.519,But you did go to the Hanna law basis.
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,862.519,865.011,"Your Honor, we were specifically told by the NLRB --"
1973.72-1597,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,865.011,866.124,But you did go?
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,866.124,867.58,Yes sir we filed charges.
1973.72-1597,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,867.58,872.517,And you filed charges that they had interfered with the right to organize?
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,872.517,872.769,"No, sir."
1973.72-1597,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,886.167,886.816,That’s right.
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,886.816,888.418,That was our theory before the NLRB.
1973.72-1597,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,888.418,892.73,But they participate in the union and the NLRB said no.
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,892.73,897.115,From discouraging the employees Your Honor as opposed to anybody else.
1973.72-1597,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,898.521,904.647,I thought the NLRB said that we don’t have a jurisdiction because supervisory employees are not under our jurisdiction.
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,904.647,907.842,They said -- they clearly said that and that was a decision of the general counsel.
1973.72-1597,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,913.194,916.603,So now you go to the state court on the right to work?
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,916.603,917.967,Yes sir.
1973.72-1597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,936.236,952.541,"You have to establish don’t you Mr. Eubanks that the North Carolina Law is not a law relating to collective bargaining under 14 (a) and your contention since all it talks about his membership in the union, it doesn’t require an employer to do anything once a man is in the union."
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,954.742,978.802,"We submit if they were Your Honor it will be preempted and we agree with your position but we certainly say, if it were one relating to collective bargaining it would certainly be preempted because of 14 (a) in the second half for that sentence says, “You can’t require an employer to recognize that kind of situation and we agree with that and with all the cases relied on by North Carolina Supreme Court in holding against us or in reversing the Court of Appeals we agree with."
1973.72-1597,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1004.923,1023.031,"I take it in that result of the state court’s ruling is that under the federal law, under the federal labor statute the employer has a guaranteed right that can’t be interfered with by the state, a guaranteed right to fire a supervisor for union membership."
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,1023.031,1025.886,That’s what the Court’s position was Your Honor but even the board --
1973.72-1597,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1025.886,1031.888,"That is not, isn’t -- that’s where the -- necessarily where the State Court ended up."
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,1031.888,1032.691,Yes sir.
1973.72-1597,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1033.646,1046.637,And that although the Federal Act says nothing herein shall be taken to prevent membership nevertheless apparently has a guaranteed right to fire if you are a member.
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,1046.637,1093.486,"Well, Your Honor that’s what the State Court as I understood it said Your Honor and that’s why I so vehemently disagree with because even if you will come into the case called (Inaudible) which I believe -- and it involved one of these situations where a supervisor was fired because he was told to go out and engage in some unlawful conduct on part of his employer and he said, “I am not going to do it” and the employer said “Well, if you don’t do it I will fire you,” and he wouldn’t do it so he got fired and the case went up through the board and it was ended up to the situation that the board ruled and was supported by enforcement that that really coerced employees who were covered by the Act and by firing a supervisor who was being in an effort to coerce employees we feel that situation is covered by 8 (a) 1 of the Act and I agree fully."
1973.72-1597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1213.492,1225.038,"Well but your example of the ordinary employee is the easy case because there, the federal law protects that right and obviously it wouldn’t get this far with that kind of a situation."
1973.72-1597,0,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,1233.491,1235.362,That’s correct Your Honor.
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1430.17,1434.925,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1539.489,1544.847,"I thought Hanna was seven and eight, are you sure it is fourteen?"
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1550.051,1554.077,"I didn’t understand your question Your Honor, it was a reference to the citation that Hanna Mining --"
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1554.077,1558.183,"No, does it involve Section 7 and 8?"
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1558.183,1571.773,"It involves Section 7 and 8 and the fact that in Hanna this Court said that this was a supervisory union, supervisor’s union in Hanna."
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1651.947,1657.825,"Well getting back to the other question, why did the Supreme Court say preempted?"
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1661.426,1664.13,"The Supreme Court of North Carolina, Your Honor?"
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1664.13,1665.644,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1665.644,1690.393,"They referred to Section 211 the definition of taking supervisors out of the definition of employees, Section 14 (a) as -- and the legislative history and the Federal Court cases -- Circuit Court cases."
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1690.393,1701.989,"Well, what in the Act in any federal act says that the state is prohibited from taking the action against the supervisor?"
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1701.989,1703.956,The Section 14 --
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1703.956,1713.788,"I’m wrong, of the state taking action against an employer that it be has of the supervisor."
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1713.788,1717.81,What says that the state is --
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1717.81,1723.361,State is prohibited from giving relief to a supervisor.
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1723.361,1724.529,To a supervisor.
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1724.529,1727.283,"Yes, against an employer."
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1727.283,1731.266,They referred to Section 14 (a).
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1731.266,1732.15,Which says?
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1732.15,1735.7,Which says nothing prohibits the supervisor.
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1745.758,1746.821,That’s all it said.
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1746.821,1774.442,"No sir, it says but no employer subject to this sub-chapter which we are shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors with these plaintiffs and these civil damage state suits as employees for the purpose of any law, either national or local relating to collective bargaining and this state court action is bound --"
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1774.442,1778.108,That’s related -- related to collective bargaining.
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1778.108,1779.529,"Yes, Your Honor but this is --"
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.529,1785.226,And this -- is there anything in this action in the state court that says anything about collective bargaining?
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1785.226,1788.494,In the state statute itself?
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1788.494,1790.318,"No sir, I said in the action."
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1790.318,1791.372,In the action of the state.
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1791.372,1793.208,How about the supervisor?
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1793.208,1798.381,There is nothing in the compliant that says we are relating this to collective bargaining.
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1817.849,1823.894,"Well, Mr. Stockton supposed this supervisor is no longer members of the union?"
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1826.173,1828.021,At this time?
1973.72-1597,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1828.021,1828.429,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1828.429,1833.338,"They are no longer members of the union when they start the suit, is that your question, Your Honor?"
1973.72-1597,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1871.654,1875.461,Of course union activity isn’t all that clear.
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1879.504,1889.331,"Well, if they joined a union in the process of a union election going on then we would say this is certainly union activity."
1973.72-1597,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.37,1911.12,"Well, do you say that the North Carolina Law here that prevents a man from being fired for either joining or not joining a union is a law relating to collective bargaining under 14 (a)?"
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1911.12,1913.297,Yes sir and I think it has to.
1973.72-1597,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1913.617,1917.502,"Well, all they want there, all they said they were doing was joining the union."
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1921.246,1930.063,"No sir, but when they joined the union, they are a necessity affecting the employer's collective bargaining rights."
1973.72-1597,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1960.395,1970.658,Do you think the National Labor Relations Board would count the ballot of the supervisor when they came to an election on the union?
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1970.658,1974.126,They ruled them out of the bargaining union insofar as --
1973.72-1597,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1974.126,1998.554,"Then I take it, you’re relating their acts, the supervisor’s acts to union activity is narrowed down to the proposition that when the foreman or other supervisor joins the union, he maybe giving -- aiding comfort to the union and indicating an employer attitude in favor of the union as far as the other employees are concerned."
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,1998.554,2000.943,That’s one possibility.
1973.72-1597,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2019.997,2021.18,"Well, have it finished."
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,2021.18,2053.128,This legislative history makes it clear that the conflict is recognized by Congress in enacting -- in taking supervisors out of the National Labor Relations Act in enacting 14 (a) and that it relates to the day to day activities and the possibility of domination of the union by the supervisory member of the union and says specifically evidence before the committee shows clearly that unionizing supervisors under the Labor Act is inconsistent with the purpose of the Act.
1973.72-1597,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2053.128,2066.987,"What would be the posture of a foreman, these particular men, supervisors, if a strike were called, what would be their obligations with respect to the picket line?"
1973.72-1597,1,40537,ralph_m_stockton_jr,,2074.969,2095.032,I don’t know the answer Your Honor but I think the question reveals the problems that and the fact that we are actually dealing with questions of collective bargaining when you give a state court a right to give a remedy and state court damages in this type of situation.
1973.72-1597,2,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,2923.085,2931.499,I think they are engaging in union activity and that would be in subordination in the interest of the employer and they could be terminated.
1973.72-1597,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2931.499,2941.688,"Let’s take it one step per move, suppose the supervisors just go around with the union business agent, stand there and say nothing while they are soliciting."
1973.72-1597,2,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,2941.688,2948.018,"Your Honor, I think that would be a closer question but I still think it would be giving comfort to the enemy to some extent."
1973.72-1597,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2991.81,3005.652,I take it that you concede that any activity which could be regarded as aiding and assisting the union campaign would be grounds for dismissal.
1973.72-1597,2,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,3005.652,3009.448,"Your Honor, I think that counts in an appropriate factual context."
1973.72-1597,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3024.837,3029.204,"Well, then the remedy there is to join a union of supervisors, isn’t it?"
1973.72-1597,2,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,3029.204,3030.844,"No, sir because you got to remember."
1973.72-1597,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3052.753,3054.296,Well that’s not our case --
1973.72-1597,2,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,3054.296,3054.592,No but --
1973.72-1597,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3054.592,3054.898,"-- right here, isn’t it?"
1973.72-1597,2,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,3054.898,3066.092,"No, but the reason I make in this point to the Court is that if at that point he has got to quit or be fired or leave the union, he is put in the situation of having to give up."
1973.72-1597,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3066.092,3088.669,"Well don’t we have an unresolved, possibly, an unresolved factual question here namely whether the conduct of these supervisors in whatever they may have done, signing the card and talking to people, whatever, whether that constituted aiding and assisting the union’s organization campaign."
1973.72-1597,2,34394,larry_l_eubanks,,3088.669,3090.739,I play the Court rule exactly that.
