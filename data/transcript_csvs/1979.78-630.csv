1979.78-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.05,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 78-630, State of Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation."
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,21.375,25.832,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,526.085,535.57,"Mr. Gorton, just so I understand it, if the legal incidence of this tax had fallen on the retailer, the Indian retailer, it would clearly be invalid."
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,535.57,536.635,It would be.
1979.78-630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,536.635,537.836,Okay.
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,537.836,554.574,The tribes here claim a more expansive preemption to apply when a state tax on a private party impacts the income of those tribes than obtains when such a tax impacts the United States government itself.
1979.78-630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,833.702,839.693,General Gorton is the extent of the competitive advantage significant in your argument?
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,846.724,848.142,The same argument is applicable to both.
1979.78-630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,848.142,852.46,So the extent of the competitive advantage really isn't critical here.
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,852.46,852.727,No.
1979.78-630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.068,870.707,"Does your argument apply to retail sales by Indians of, say, things they might make on the reservation, artifacts or souvenirs or things like that?"
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,870.707,871.366,To non-Indians.
1979.78-630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,871.366,871.436,To non-Indians.
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,871.436,871.827,Yes.
1979.78-630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,871.827,872.301,The same --
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,872.301,877.133,"And as a matter of fact, that kind of tax was even upheld by the District Court in this case."
1979.78-630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,877.133,879.451,All right.
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,879.451,894.952,The answer is that the tribe cannot trigger such a preemption since no federal statute has been cited for the preposition that tribal enterprises are entitled to unequal advantages over their non-Indian competitors.
1979.78-630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,902.402,916.788,"Mr. Attorney General, you answered brother Stevens that if the incidence of the tax was on the Indian seller, there would be -- it would be illegal or unconstitutional or what?"
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,920.0,924.311,The basis for that would be McClanahan.
1979.78-630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,924.875,926.234,And what do you understand the legal --
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,926.234,928.157,It would be preemption.
1979.78-630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.157,929.455,From what?
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,929.455,943.594,Preemption from the statutory and treaty pattern which was utilized in McClanahan and then later in Moe to preempt exactly the --
1979.78-630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.594,953.174,"Would this be a wrong statement, that absent some federal statute expressly permitting such a tax, it is forbidden?"
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,956.31,977.245,"I think that the correct statement would be, based on Moe and expressly on Footnote 17 of Moe, that absent a federal statute or treaty provision preventing or prohibiting such a tax, the state would be permitted to impose it even on sales to Indians."
1979.78-630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.245,985.601,And you suggest that it is preempted by some -- by a pattern of federal statutes and treaties?
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,985.601,991.136,It is precisely the pattern which was utilized in McClanahan and --
1979.78-630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,991.136,997.431,Preemption in the sense of conflict or just occupying the field?
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,997.431,1005.643,"In McClanahan, it would be a prohibition because there was no occupation of the field, nor was there in Moe."
1979.78-630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.645,1026.101,So you think it is an expression of congressional consent that in light of the existing statutes there shouldn't be any state tax?
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1026.101,1029.336,That's correct.
1979.78-630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1101.007,1107.8,"General Gorton, I suppose the parallel would be could Great Britain require the United States retailer to keep a lot of records to do the regulating necessary to --"
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1107.8,1111.54,"No, it could not because the United States retailer is not within Great Britain."
1979.78-630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1111.54,1115.369,That is really the problem because there is no doubt about your power to impede the tax.
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1119.075,1120.626,We could impose a different tax.
1979.78-630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.374,1132.589,Couldn't you impose the tax?
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1139.508,1148.296,My British analogy would not cover this situation because the United States Constitution would prevent the state of Washington from making that imposition.
1979.78-630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.768,1215.86,"General Gorton, would the reaching of the majority allow an Indian automobile franchise on the reservation to sell new automobiles and prevent the state of Washington from collecting a use tax if those automobiles were used outside of the reservation in the state of Washington?"
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1215.86,1227.749,"If the automobile dealership were a tribal enterprise producing income for the tribe the theory of the District Court would prevent that tax, and I intend to get to that in a little bit greater detail in just a moment."
1979.78-630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1505.259,1522.108,"Well, could it make any difference to your argument if the state of Washington had adopted a tax of a dollar a load upon bread and the Indian tribes on their lands sold the bread tax-free?"
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1522.108,1540.513,"It would not make any theoretical difference in the argument, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, remembering, of course, that the Indians could sell it tax-free to their own members, but that tax might very well be found to be unconstitutional or in some kind of violation of due process, but that is --"
1979.78-630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.513,1542.804,What tax?
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1552.171,1559.309,"If the set of statutory patterns and the tribal arguments were identical to those here, the result would be the same."
1979.78-630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.309,1563.746,And furniture shops or --
1979.78-630,0,41407,slade_gorton,,1563.746,1578.061,"In the case of furniture shops, the District Court here found that the tax would apply because the Indians had not shown that it had any effect on their income."
1979.78-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1742.73,1744.69,Mr. Anderson.
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,1744.69,1748.358,"MR. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1814.997,1823.595,Are you addressing yourself now exclusively to the cigarette tax or more broadly than that?
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,1823.595,1829.057,"I am addressing right now the cigarette tax, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-630,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1838.817,1842.046,You represent the three tribes other than the Yakima nation?
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,1842.046,1845.465,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1882.337,1885.902,Do you mean that is because it is economically not feasible?
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,1885.902,1900.705,"Yes, I am talking about the practicalities of the situation and I think Williams v. Lee was a practical test and I think the imposition of state law in this case ought to be judged by its practical effects."
1979.78-630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1910.826,1917.989,"You are not claiming that the basis for your exemption here is constitutional, are you?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,1917.989,1921.793,"We make that argument as well, Your Honor, yes."
1979.78-630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1921.793,1924.966,In spite of Footnote 17 in Moe?
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,1924.966,1956.306,"Footnote 17 in Moe, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, stated that -- it was talking about the issue in McClanahan, whether or not state tax laws could be applied to Indians on the reservation, and the Court said that the McClanahan decision made it clear that there was no automatic exemption and that is, of course, clear because in McClanahan the Court looked to the specific federal statutes rather than the United States Constitution to find the preemption."
1979.78-630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2013.071,2035.889,But didn't McClanahan make the statement that we had moved from an era of automatic lines between constitutional and unconstitutional to a less sovereign and more preemptive type of test?
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2035.889,2043.917,"McClanahan did say, Your Honor, that the Indian sovereignty doctrine was the backdrop and not the dispositive principle."
1979.78-630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2219.677,2224.949,"What about the furniture store, the automobile dealership?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2224.949,2228.191,I think the District Court answered that argument very well.
1979.78-630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2257.666,2267.99,"Well, what theoretical principle separates a furniture store or an automobile dealership on the one hand from a smoke shop on the other?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2267.99,2272.803,"Well, there perhaps is no absolute theoretical difference."
1979.78-630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2274.069,2277.568,"Well, is there any theoretical difference?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2277.568,2288.188,"Well, it seems to me that the core of the District Court's holding was that the tribes were acting in a limited capacity, in a limited way they were acting with restraint."
1979.78-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2315.355,2323.495,"Mr. Anderson, there are extensions in some other reservations, aren't there, around the country, or not?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2323.495,2327.693,There are other tribes that are taxing alcohol sales.
1979.78-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.413,2330.354,What about ski areas?
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2330.354,2332.738,I believe that the Mescalero Apache --
1979.78-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.738,2334.842,I thought that was off reservation.
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2334.842,2335.658,That was off.
1979.78-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.658,2338.763,"How about some other areas, though?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2338.763,2341.413,I am not aware of other tax systems.
1979.78-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.096,2347.214,"How about hotels, inns?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2347.214,2353.326,"I'm not aware of -- well, there are several tribes that have established resorts on the reservations."
1979.78-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2356.023,2361.273,"But you would make the same argument if the tribe taxed those, you would make the same argument, I suppose?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2361.273,2377.893,"The same arguments could be made but I would like to remind the Court that because of the isolation, the physical isolation of these tribes, there are very practical limitations on the tribes' ability to raise revenues in this manner."
1979.78-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.681,2384.01,"Aren't those limitations, wouldn't they be affected by the number of cartons you permitted them to purchase?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2389.943,2408.441,"Well, the District Court advised us I think in its opinion that one of the reasons that this tax was sustained was that it was limited and the tribes were acting responsibly and the tribes were not attempting to take an unfair or excessive share of state tax revenues."
1979.78-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2410.351,2416.424,I have the same problem that Mr. Justice Rehnquist expressed about why is that legally significant.
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2416.424,2421.244,Let me respond to that in this way.
1979.78-630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2442.554,2448.266,"He was joined by one other Justice in that opinion, wasn't he?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2448.266,2459.521,"Well, there were a number of separate opinions written by the Court, but I think that is -- the point I want to make is Justice Frankfurter's observation is a sound one."
1979.78-630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2467.818,2480.866,"As a practical matter, if you can get so many people to come to buy three cigarettes, couldn't you get an awful lot more to come to buy a new Chevrolet if it is tax free?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2480.866,2496.175,"Well, one of the problems with that kind of program is that in order for this tribal enterprise to work, we have to be dealing with an area in which the state taxation is substantial."
1979.78-630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2506.882,2511.199,"Well, doesn't the state of Washington levy a sales tax on new cars?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2511.199,2514.689,"It does, yes."
1979.78-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.689,2518.46,"Well, what if the tribes levied exactly the same tax?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2518.46,2519.925,If the tribes levied the same tax --
1979.78-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.925,2530.794,What if there was a dealership on the reservation and the tribe levied an equal tax on the sales of new cars to non-Indians?
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2530.794,2532.483,On sales of new cars to non-Indians.
1979.78-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2532.483,2533.455,Yes.
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2533.455,2546.056,"Well, the principle that a tribe when it exercises its taxing power can preempt inconsistent state law would apply."
1979.78-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2546.11,2553.935,"Well, that is all Justice Rehnquist has been asking, isn't it, whether the same principle would apply if you had a tribal tax on sales of new cars."
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2553.935,2566.204,"Yes, except that it is not necessary for this Court in deciding this case to consider extensions of this doctrine to their ultimate and perhaps illogical conclusion."
1979.78-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.864,2577.655,Like we could say this may not apply to new cars?
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2577.655,2584.863,If this Court said that it cannot be applied beyond the facts of this case to another situation.
1979.78-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2599.588,2608.49,I don't understand why you characterize the economic situation in saving $200 or $300 on the sales tax on an automobile as an illogical conclusion.
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2613.291,2617.02,I don't believe I said it was an illogical conclusion.
1979.78-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2626.175,2635.72,"Well, couldn't we say the case before us is the taxing of commodities?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2635.72,2640.444,The issue before us is taxing commodities that are involved in commerce between Indians and non-Indians.
1979.78-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2640.444,2640.759,Right.
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2640.759,2641.009,Yes.
1979.78-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2641.009,2647.802,"So that would include tires, batteries, and --"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2647.802,2648.222,Those are --
1979.78-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2648.222,2649.084,Yes or no?
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2649.084,2649.883,"Yes, I would think so."
1979.78-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2649.883,2651.264,All of that is before us.
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2651.264,2652.801,Yes.
1979.78-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2652.801,2657.088,But yet you say the only thing we can decide is the tobacco.
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2661.199,2663.627,I don't think it is necessary for this Court to say --
1979.78-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2663.627,2666.209,"Well, I am trying to find out what you are saying."
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2666.209,2676.792,"I am trying to say that the principle before this Court is a limited one, and I think that it must be considered in context, because --"
1979.78-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2676.792,2679.435,All commodities you say would be limited?
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2679.435,2680.656,"Well, the --"
1979.78-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2680.656,2683.338,"All, a-l-l."
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2683.338,2683.818,The tribe is --
1979.78-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2683.818,2689.041,"There is noting in ""all"" that is limited, is there?"
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2689.041,2691.245,Perhaps I don't understand your question.
1979.78-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2691.245,2698.884,You say limited and a minute ago you said that the Indians could tax all commodities.
1979.78-630,1,40949,steven_s_anderson,,2698.884,2725.539,"I said that the tribe has extended its taxing ordinance in a limited way in this case and if the tribe exercised its power to seriously interfere with state government or some such thing, facts which are not now before this Court, this Court might well be in a position to draft a holding that would prevent that kind of abuse if it was regarded so of tribal power."
1979.78-630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2728.0,2738.417,"Your time is expired now, Mr. Anderson."
1979.78-630,2,30760,james_b_hovis,,2739.377,2742.197,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2873.544,2876.783,I take it then regardless of whether there is an Indian tax?
1979.78-630,2,30760,james_b_hovis,,2876.783,2881.39,Regardless of whether there is an Indian tax.
1979.78-630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2883.148,2887.246,"This isn't a request to reargue Montana, is it?"
1979.78-630,2,30760,james_b_hovis,,2887.246,2889.769,"No, no, no. No, sir No, sir."
1979.78-630,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3278.185,3286.869,"Is this issue before the Court, the issue of the sale trucks that go through Washington to the reservation?"
1979.78-630,2,30760,james_b_hovis,,3286.869,3287.009,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-630,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3287.009,3290.786,I thought the District Court didn't reach it because it struck down the tax on interstate --
1979.78-630,2,30760,james_b_hovis,,3290.786,3299.65,"It struck down the tax situation on the preemption and the infringement test, on the Williams test, and they didn't reach that."
1979.78-630,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3336.206,3358.908,"Well, what if the state of Washington simply stated or stationed tax collectors on the Washington side of the boundary between the reservation and the state of Washington and inspected cars coming off the reservation, and if they bought cartons of cigarettes on the reservation they would impose a use tax."
1979.78-630,2,30760,james_b_hovis,,3358.908,3367.147,"I would think, Your Honor, that we are not in any different -- nor do I claim that we are any different from the state of Oregon."
1979.78-630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3383.632,3386.449,Do you think your colleague from the three tribes agrees with you?
1979.78-630,2,30760,james_b_hovis,,3386.449,3387.464,"No, they do not."
1979.78-630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3387.464,3388.773,Nor the United States?
1979.78-630,2,30760,james_b_hovis,,3388.773,3391.723,"Well, I have not asked the United States."
1979.78-630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3396.922,3407.319,"Would you say that you would emphasize enforcement if the state could collect at the boundaries of the reservation, may they make the indian seller collect?"
1979.78-630,2,30760,james_b_hovis,,3407.319,3408.431,"No, they may not."
1979.78-630,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3591.422,3595.572,"Your time is expired now, Mr. Hovis."
1979.78-630,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3597.114,3600.298,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4009.988,4025.695,"So you would say that because collection at the border of the reservation from the buyer would have the same impact, the tax collected that way would be too burdensome?"
1979.78-630,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4025.695,4029.413,"Mr. Justice White, if forced to an answer, I think I would probably would say that."
1979.78-630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4037.662,4048.444,"No, the Washington law is that we impose on the buyer a tax when he buys cigarettes and they just collect it from him at the border."
1979.78-630,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4048.444,4052.041,"Mr. Justice White, I appreciate the hypothetical, but it is a hypothetical."
1979.78-630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4054.739,4058.48,"I know, that is a fine answer."
1979.78-630,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4058.48,4084.365,"I thought I said, Mr. Justice White, that if compelled to an answer, but emphasizing the difference between your hypothetical and the case before the Court, I would argue that they both fall because of the effect on not merely the commerce but --"
1979.78-630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4084.365,4087.494,"I suppose the state could repeal it, its own sales tax."
1979.78-630,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4087.494,4090.826,"Yes, I have no quarrel with that and I --"
1979.78-630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4090.826,4092.687,Even just on cigarettes.
1979.78-630,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4092.687,4099.113,-- I recognize that that is so and that that too might have the same effect.
1979.78-630,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4104.59,4136.72,"What if the Indians went into the business of manufacturing automobiles and made automobiles which they sold to the public, didn't tax them at all, but the state of Washington imposed an excise tax on them, would you say that the fact that the state of Washington's excise tax was enough to ruin the margin of profit that the Indians had been making before they imposed the tax fall, even though collected as a use tax outside the reservation?"
1979.78-630,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4136.72,4146.192,"In that instance -- and I am not clear, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, whether the enterprise of manufacturing the cars in your hypothetical is done by the tribe or by some entrepreneur --"
1979.78-630,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4146.192,4147.178,By the tribe.
1979.78-630,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4147.178,4177.975,"There is perhaps an important difference there, but that case it seems to me would fall on the other side of the line, that is that we could not invalidate Washington's tax in those circumstances, there being no collision between the tax imposed by the tribe, there being none in your hypothetical, and that imposed by the state."
1979.78-630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4344.456,4349.859,Do you have solid statistical basis for saying one is a pattern and the other is the exception?
1979.78-630,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4349.859,4360.682,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I can't say that there has been sufficiently accurate or adequate investigation of the various state laws."
1979.78-630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4375.347,4386.334,"But with respect to some of the states that don't attempt to collect its own tax, it doesn't make any difference whether there is a tribal tax or not, isn't that true?"
1979.78-630,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4386.334,4387.702,Yes.
1979.78-630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4407.163,4419.668,"You don't suggest that without the tax that Washington would be out of bounds here, without the tribal tax?"
1979.78-630,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4419.668,4426.353,I suggest that it would be on a very close boundary except --
1979.78-630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4426.353,4428.39,"Well, would it be covered by Moe or not?"
1979.78-630,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4428.39,4443.979,"It would -- there is another distinction between that case, between this case and Moe which is that here we are dealing with a governmental operation not only in the sense that the tribe taxes but that the tribe regulates everything, including price."
1979.78-630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4443.979,4446.53,How about the Yakima Nation?
1979.78-630,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4446.53,4448.306,"That is so, the Yakima Nation."
1979.78-630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4448.306,4450.318,"Well, is that a tribal enterprise?"
1979.78-630,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4450.318,4453.013,It is a tribal wholesale enterprise.
1979.78-630,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4488.319,4489.231,"Very well, Mr. Claiborne."
1979.78-630,4,41407,slade_gorton,,4505.531,4510.1,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-630,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4808.538,4815.341,"General Gorton, before you sit down, do you view the issues on the motor vehicle excise tax scheme -- that is still before us, I guess."
1979.78-630,4,41407,slade_gorton,,4815.341,4815.968,They are.
1979.78-630,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4815.968,4819.683,"We haven't talked about them very much this morning, but aren't they essentially the same as the others?"
1979.78-630,4,41407,slade_gorton,,4819.683,4821.484,They are essentially the same.
1979.78-630,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4854.986,4861.794,"Well, it is not the typical use tax that is paid, a one-time tax in connection with the transaction, isn't it an annual tax?"
1979.78-630,4,41407,slade_gorton,,4861.794,4862.346,"No, no, no."
1979.78-630,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4864.162,4869.165,"And its economic incidence, I take it, is precisely the same as a personal property tax?"
1979.78-630,4,41407,slade_gorton,,4874.374,4886.855,"That is correct, but it is expressly -- and in our state it always has been, this wasn't a recent amendment, it is expressly a tax on the right to use an automobile on the roads of the state of Washington."
1979.78-630,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4886.855,4892.724,Is that the same way in which the tax which is collected from non-Indians on motor vehicles is characterized?
1979.78-630,4,41407,slade_gorton,,4892.724,4896.526,"Yes, it is."
1979.78-630,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4896.526,4897.542,"Thank you, gentlemen."
