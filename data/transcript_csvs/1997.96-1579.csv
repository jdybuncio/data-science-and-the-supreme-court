1997.96-1579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.685,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1579, James Brogan v. the United States."
1997.96-1579,0,41482,stuart_a_holtzman,,8.92,12.027,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,67.77,72.096,"Well, what part of the text of the act do you rely on for the exculpatory no?"
1997.96-1579,0,41482,stuart_a_holtzman,,72.096,82.28,"Well, the portion of the... the text itself does not have a provision excluding from its coverage the exculpatory no."
1997.96-1579,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,171.041,175.242,"Mr. Holtzman, may I clarify what your point is?"
1997.96-1579,0,41482,stuart_a_holtzman,,182.053,182.475,--No.
1997.96-1579,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.657,198.795,"--So if it's in the words, makes any false statement... but there's materially before that, so I was supposing maybe that's what you meant."
1997.96-1579,0,41482,stuart_a_holtzman,,198.795,201.278,"--No, I think that's the new statute, Your Honor."
1997.96-1579,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1698.613,1704.423,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1579,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.351,1767.087,"General Waxman, can I just... this was not on your watch, I'm sure, but I'm just curious as to why it took so long for this issue to come before this Court, and that there are so many circuit courts that have adopted the exculpatory no doctrine over what, 20 years, more than that, and the Justice Department itself has provided in its manual to United States attorneys that where the statement takes the form of an exculpatory no, 18 U.S.C. section 1001 does not apply regardless of who asks the question."
1997.96-1579,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1769.243,1772.975,"Well, that's a pretty broad question, and I'll try and give as many answers to it as I can."
1997.96-1579,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.78,1829.732,But your manual for United States attorneys recites it.
1997.96-1579,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1843.103,1846.96,"Justice Scalia, our policy statement is just that."
1997.96-1579,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1856.753,1858.721,"Well, it does purport to be that."
1997.96-1579,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1870.372,1873.496,"--With all due respect, I--"
1997.96-1579,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1873.496,1874.231,I thought it didn't say that.
1997.96-1579,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1874.231,1875.027,"--No, it--"
1997.96-1579,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1875.027,1886.429,I thought it said it's not appropriate to charge a section 1001 violation where a suspect during an investigation merely denies his guilt in response to questioning by the Government.
1997.96-1579,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1896.628,1907.999,"--That is not only how we read it, but it is what we appended to our brief in reply to the petition for certiorari in this case, and the language, the exact language is found at page 4a."
1997.96-1579,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1909.015,1910.014,Yet it was charged here.
1997.96-1579,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1910.014,1911.56,"--It was charged here, and--"
1997.96-1579,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1911.56,1918.292,"And do you... can you tell us how often it is used, and that charges are brought?"
1997.96-1579,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1918.292,1938.612,"--Our experience, and I think this is reflected in pages 8 and 9 of our brief at the petition stage, is that in light of this policy, which in one form or another has been outstanding for several decades, there... it is relatively infrequent for the Government to charge a defendant where there is nothing more than a simple exculpatory no."
1997.96-1579,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1938.612,1949.31,"Well, if we were to agree with the Government in this case, and reject the doctrine, is it likely that the Justice Department would alter its guidelines?"
1997.96-1579,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1949.31,1954.448,I... I'm not in charge of writing the guidelines.
1997.96-1579,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1956.495,1958.948,But presumably you have some voice in what goes on over there.
1997.96-1579,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1958.948,1963.992,"If it were my decision, and I think I do have a voice, I would say that we might alter the language of the guideline a little bit."
1997.96-1579,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1998.384,2008.41,"But General Waxman, just to make clear I was not making this up, I was quoting the description of the manual in petitioner's brief at page 20."
1997.96-1579,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2018.767,2019.156,--I--
1997.96-1579,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2019.156,2020.313,--Maybe that's been changed.
1997.96-1579,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2020.313,2020.719,--I--
1997.96-1579,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.719,2022.921,You tell me the current manual does not say that.
1997.96-1579,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2022.921,2036.479,--The current man... the manual that was in effect at the time the petition was filed was... is reprinted at pages 3a and 4a of our brief in reply to the petition for certiorari.
1997.96-1579,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2058.562,2061.578,So that it now says what on the CDROM?
1997.96-1579,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2061.578,2077.087,"--It now says that it's the Department's policy to... it is the Department's policy not to charge a section 1001 violation where a suspect during an investigation merely denies his guilt in response to questioning by the Government, and then it just goes on as it's recited on page 4a."
