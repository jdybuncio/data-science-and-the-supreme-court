1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,77.947,81.923,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1055,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,274.68,275.528,What page?
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,275.528,277.655,1310.
1974.73-1055,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,282.953,284.326,Excuse me.
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,285.892,288.217,There are two volumes to the --
1974.73-1055,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,288.217,289.362,I have only one.
1974.73-1055,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,289.362,291.592,There's volume two.
1974.73-1055,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,291.592,292.478,I have only one.
1974.73-1055,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,292.478,295.932,"Here, you can look at mine."
1974.73-1055,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.932,297.887,"Page 1310, Finding 11?"
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,297.887,301.422,"It's Finding 11, yes, sir."
1974.73-1055,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,567.16,568.796,Do we have to --
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,568.796,569.322,I'm sorry.
1974.73-1055,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,569.322,573.786,"Do we have to read this 42,000 pages?"
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,573.786,575.473,"You will not, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1974.73-1055,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,611.11,620.153,"Mr. Patton, do I gather if we were to agree with you, what do we do, remand the three-judge court to apply the proper test?"
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,620.153,625.972,"Mr. Justice Brennan, we believe that the case should be remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint."
1974.73-1055,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,632.674,638.738,Is there any occasion for considering remanding to the Commission?
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,638.738,640.54,"I don't believe so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1055,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,663.153,669.934,"I don't understand the latter, Mr. Patton, because if in fact they should have and did not apply the substantial evidence test --"
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,669.934,670.223,Well --
1974.73-1055,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,670.223,671.822,How can we act and dismiss?
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,671.822,678.72,"Mr. Justice Brennan, they -- of course, the Court would ordinarily not apply on its own motion, unless they were asked to review the findings."
1974.73-1055,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,678.72,680.157,"Well, can we?"
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,683.895,685.384,"It ordinarily is, but there are --"
1974.73-1055,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,685.384,687.09,"It's not ordinarily, wasn't it?"
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,687.09,707.652,"Well, there are cases where this Court has made some determination and, for example, the Illinois Railroad case which is at 385 United States Reports or cases gone on a long time where it's clear from the opinion and from the things in the appendix, that the decision is supported by substantial evidence."
1974.73-1055,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,708.212,715.572,"Well, I know but, I mean -- Here, as I get it, what you're saying is that the issue isn't even in the case, about substantial evidence."
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,715.572,716.387,That's correct.
1974.73-1055,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,716.852,718.198,"But, if you say --"
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,718.198,718.36,We don't --
1974.73-1055,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,718.36,729.32,"-- the District Court is wrong on the standard it used, what you are in effect are saying is that the fact that their substantial evidence is accepted by the other side."
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,729.32,729.761,"Well, I --"
1974.73-1055,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,729.761,730.879,They didn't raise it.
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,730.879,732.806,"They did not raise it, but --"
1974.73-1055,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,732.806,739.14,"If that isn't your position, then we, ourselves, you're suggesting, would have to look at the record and decide about substantial evidence."
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,739.14,740.226,"Yes, sir, that's right."
1974.73-1055,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,740.226,747.675,"But, don't you also say that the District Court, in effect, conceded there was substantial evidence, but said there is something more needed?"
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,747.675,753.142,"That's correct because its finding, it says a mere review of the sufficiency of the evidence is not enough."
1974.73-1055,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,770.221,780.574,"Well, technically, you think then it would be -- it is not --it wouldn't be acceptable just to say the issue of substantial evidence isn't in the case."
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,780.574,782.527,"Well, I think --"
1974.73-1055,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.527,788.261,And then -- and that we either have to remand to determine it or determine it ourselves.
1974.73-1055,0,45815,william_l_patton,,788.261,792.815,"I believe that's correct, Mr. Justice White."
1974.73-1055,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,927.129,928.04,"Very well, Mr. Patton."
1974.73-1055,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,938.746,941.16,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1055,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1487.271,1494.23,"Mr. Rhyne, doesn't it -- the District Court does have to make up its own mind as to whether there's substantial evidence, I suppose."
1974.73-1055,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1494.23,1495.064,Well --
1974.73-1055,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1495.064,1498.679,"And, just some evidence isn't enough, is it?"
1974.73-1055,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1498.679,1507.583,"What the District Court did was, it focused only on the appellee's evidence and it didn't talk about substantial evidence ever."
1974.73-1055,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.755,1530.831,"Well, I know, but there's some suggestion in your argument that it's wrong for the District Court to weigh the evidence."
1974.73-1055,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1530.831,1532.003,"Yes, I think it is wrong."
1974.73-1055,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1532.496,1535.046,"Well, they've got to decide whether it's substantial."
1974.73-1055,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1535.046,1540.538,"Well, I think that they don't have to weigh it to look at the record and find out whether it's substantial."
1974.73-1055,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.919,1543.564,"I know, but it is --"
1974.73-1055,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1543.564,1545.162,"But, in this case, they --"
1974.73-1055,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1545.162,1547.43,"Just any evidence isn't enough either, is it?"
1974.73-1055,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1547.43,1549.02,"No, it has to be substantial evidence."
1974.73-1055,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1575.966,1576.569,Well --
1974.73-1055,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1576.569,1578.097,The big point --
1974.73-1055,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1578.097,1588.461,If you make that argument in contradistinction to the idea that the Court should weigh and re-weigh the evidence and see whether the Commission weighed it correctly.
1974.73-1055,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1596.208,1598.268,"Yes, and if there is, the Court's function is over."
1974.73-1055,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1598.268,1601.213,"And that's not a re-weighing function, is it?"
1974.73-1055,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1601.213,1605.408,"No, it's looking at the evidence to see whether there is substantial evidence."
1974.73-1055,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1609.79,1614.144,It is not the same kind of a function as the primary trier engages in.
1974.73-1055,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1614.144,1615.228,"No, and that's what they did here, you see."
1974.73-1055,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1615.228,1616.789,Isn't that your --
1974.73-1055,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1616.789,1621.258,They conducted themselves as a primary trier here.
1974.73-1055,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.969,1863.916,"Thank you, Mr. Rhyne."
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,1865.736,1870.34,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1055,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.043,1903.914,Where is it in the appendix?
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,1903.914,1905.281,It is not in the appendix.
1974.73-1055,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.63,2023.457,"Well, isn't there some difference, Mr. Stevens, between deciding whether a particular witness may have spoken truthfully and then going on from that to make, what you would call, findings of ultimate fact that would be the basis of the Commission's decision?"
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2023.457,2031.974,"That -- the latter, Your Honor, is what I would call a conclusion drawn from the facts."
1974.73-1055,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2034.999,2044.984,But what Rule 50 of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure would call findings of fact that you would call ultimate conclusion?
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2044.984,2046.905,"No, I do not know that, Your Honor."
1974.73-1055,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2064.248,2068.237,"Well, that's really no more than a concession that none of them lied, isn't it?"
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2068.237,2072.659,"No, it's not just a question of testing their credibility, but what is it?"
1974.73-1055,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2089.94,2104.697,Do you mean that -- you don't think the substantial evidence is sufficient or adequate or intended to test out the conclusion there's a need for more service?
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2104.697,2124.187,"Mr. Justice White, I think as the court below thought that the arbitrary or capricious standard -- arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion is a test, a standard that more suitably describes that particular type of error."
1974.73-1055,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.187,2126.942,So your answer is no?
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2126.942,2139.056,"No, I won't go so far as to say that I believe that the Court could have reached every conclusion that it reached in terms of the substantial evidence rule."
1974.73-1055,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.379,2154.207,"Well, we -- so, if we disagree with the District Court in terms of arbitration, either disagree with it that it's applicable at all arbitrary and capricious, or that even if it is, there was nothing arbitrary and capricious about this order."
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2156.059,2157.063,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2166.654,2170.713,Is there substantial evidence of need in this record?
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2170.713,2171.898,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2171.898,2172.849,Why not?
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2172.849,2180.328,"Because, when you consider the entire record, there is so much evidence that shows to the contrary."
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2180.328,2181.869,I didn't ask you if there were other evidence.
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2187.368,2191.383,"Phrased in that manner, Your Honor, yes, there is some evidence."
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2194.276,2197.713,"Term -- in terms of substantial evidence, no, Your Honor."
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2197.713,2199.177,Why wasn't it substantial?
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2199.177,2206.852,"Because, Your Honor, you would have to consider only, for example, the direct testimony of the witness."
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2216.795,2219.922,You just disagree with their finding.
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2219.922,2221.857,The Court disagreed with it.
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2221.857,2223.076,That's all it was.
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2226.114,2227.227,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2227.227,2228.532,You sound like it.
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2228.532,2244.614,"No, what I'm trying to explain is that the way the Commission looked at this was to consider only bits and pieces of the record, and they said “we will not consider the rest of the evidence.”"
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2244.614,2251.454,"Well, what statement do you have that says that, that that's what the Court did -- that's what the Commission did?"
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2251.454,2261.625,"The principal statement, I think, is summarized very succinctly in the reply brief that the appellants filed just a few days ago."
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2276.824,2277.188,Pardon me.
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2277.188,2278.554,That's on page 6 of the reply brief.
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2278.554,2281.404,I don't understand one word of that.
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2281.404,2282.091,I beg your pardon?
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2282.091,2285.459,"I don't understand one word of that, in answer to my question."
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2293.193,2295.009,"Not -- I would've found otherwise, yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2295.009,2296.087,"Yes, right."
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2296.087,2296.625,Because --
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2296.625,2299.995,Isn't that what the District Court did in this case?
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2299.995,2312.754,"No, I do not think that it is because when you look at what I was coming to, when they cite why did the Commission not give consideration to the evidence."
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2341.684,2353.894,"If you disregard all of the evidence, then you fall a thought of the rule of substantial, and they didn't ignore all of the evidence, right?"
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2353.894,2354.966,They did not --
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2354.966,2356.547,Ignore all of the evidence.
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2356.547,2358.755,They did not ignore all of the evidence.
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2484.073,2486.705,Did you make all those arguments in your exceptions?
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2486.705,2491.8,We made all of those arguments in our briefs before the Commission.
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2492.324,2494.068,And the Commission considered them?
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2494.068,2496.143,"The Commission did not consider them, Your Honor."
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2496.143,2497.076,They didn't consider them?
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2497.076,2497.556,"No, sir."
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.481,2513.135,"Well, what did they do that rejected them?"
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2513.135,2514.251,They overruled it.
1974.73-1055,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2518.886,2520.896,"So, you gave all that argument there."
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2520.896,2525.844,"Yes sir, and they did not give any consideration to our argument."
1974.73-1055,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2589.408,2604.371,"I take it you would agree, Mr. Stevens, that at least a considerable part of this case involved evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to particular documentary evidence."
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2604.371,2609.96,"Your Honor, no sir, Mr. Chief Justice, not to the credibility of the witnesses."
1974.73-1055,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2615.492,2630.724,How do you square that back with the statement that I thought you just made that the Commission paid undue attention to the direct testimony but ignored the cross-examination?
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,2636.537,2649.278,"I use that as an illustration because the Commission did in fact consider only that portion of the witness' testimony, for example, that it come out on direct."
1974.73-1055,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3019.823,3020.951,Mr. Stevens.
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,3020.951,3023.872,"Yes, sir?"
1974.73-1055,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3023.872,3031.396,Did Judge Miller adopt your proposed findings of fact and conclusions pretty much verbatim?
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,3031.396,3033.785,"Pretty much verbatim, he did, Your Honor."
1974.73-1055,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3175.36,3177.396,We'll resume there at 1 o'clock.
1974.73-1055,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3182.689,3183.469,You may proceed.
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,3189.143,3191.849,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1974.73-1055,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3193.559,3195.68,The Chief Justice is necessarily absent.
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,3195.68,3197.569,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1055,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4366.091,4377.103,"Can I ask you, would there -- would the District Court have remanded had it thought the record was not stale but was current?"
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,4377.103,4380.277,"Your Honor, that is pure speculation because it was never argued."
1974.73-1055,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4380.277,4381.649,"Well, then I'll ask you the other way."
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,4383.349,4387.817,"In the first place, the only suggestion was the man had to do with jurisdiction."
1974.73-1055,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4397.158,4401.973,What reason did the District Court give though in response to the motion to amend the judgment?
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,4401.973,4404.881,"First, it says that we have the power to enter the judgment."
1974.73-1055,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4418.861,4419.577,One of the reasons was that --
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,4419.577,4420.543,What other reasons?
1974.73-1055,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4420.543,4423.969,One of the reasons was that they thought the record was very stale.
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,4423.969,4427.518,"That was one of the reasons, yes, but, Your Honor, I might suggest this."
1974.73-1055,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4435.71,4436.829,"Well, I understand that."
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,4460.632,4464.39,"No, I do not think that they were saying that the order cannot stand."
1974.73-1055,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4478.114,4490.889,"Well, when it put its final -- when it finally said that, dismiss and enjoin permanently the issuance of these certificates, it must have had a reason for doing it."
1974.73-1055,2,38287,phineas_stevens,,4490.889,4499.4,"The reason it assigned is because the order was arbitrary and capricious, not because of the age of the record."
1974.73-1055,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4608.647,4615.258,"Mr. Rhyne and Mr. Patton, I -- as I'm advised, you -- the two of you have 15 minutes left."
1974.73-1055,3,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,4615.258,4620.475,"Thank you, Mr. Justice Douglas, and may it please the Court."
1974.73-1055,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4691.534,4709.496,"Mr. Rhyne, how about, for example, the Commission, one of its order was partly based on the fact that Red Ball had 94 terminals and now we're told that it's closed 35 of those of the commission."
1974.73-1055,3,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,4712.452,4741.083,"Well, in our reply brief we point out that the Commission, at the time of its decision based its official notice on one document that was a 1971 document and what they're talking about on the closing is a 1972 document but, Mr. Justice Stewart, what they're really talking about is agency discontinuances and consolidations done by Red Ball."
1974.73-1055,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4745.451,4753.147,"And if they went out of their way to, as I understand it, to point out that one of the protestants had closed a single terminal, one terminal?"
1974.73-1055,3,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,4753.147,4757.61,"Well, again, they did that, yes."
1974.73-1055,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4797.213,4806.6,"Well, at the time of the hearing I think there was one direct line from Atlanta to Baton Rouge and the Commission's order was based on that."
1974.73-1055,3,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,4808.924,4813.841,"Your Honor, the Commission's order is not based on one line."
1974.73-1055,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4883.356,4887.55,The case is submitted.
