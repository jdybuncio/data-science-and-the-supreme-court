1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.309,"-- first this morning in number 71-5097, Huffman against Boersen."
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,16.567,22.928,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.71-5097,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,603.893,607.156,Was there any argument before the Supreme Court of Nebraska?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,607.156,607.744,"No, Your Honor."
1971.71-5097,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,607.744,609.591,This was all on the papers?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,609.591,611.038,This was all on documents.
1971.71-5097,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,629.911,633.381,Was the Boddie versus Connecticut argued to the --
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,633.381,638.943,"No sir, it was raised however by Mr. Huffman in his pleadings."
1971.71-5097,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,666.449,674.591,"Mr. Eisenstatt, as a matter of practicality, how much protection is a $75 bond in Nebraska practice?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,679.202,682.492,"Very much in excess of that, Your Honor."
1971.71-5097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,701.302,705.645,Could the appellee tax the cause of his brief in the Supreme Court of Nebraska?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,705.645,716.913,"He can -- the winning party in the appeal gets reimbursement for 75 pages x $2.60, which is taxed as cost."
1971.71-5097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,720.419,726.75,"And the purpose of the cause found in nearest to the benefit and of the other party, the appellee in this case?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,726.75,733.491,"That's right, because the statutory cost as far as the state are concerned in an appeal are taking care of the $20 docket fee."
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,733.491,739.025,What is the actual cost of printing a brief per page out in Omaha and Lincoln?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,739.025,744.212,"In excess of $3, three and a quarter."
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,747.848,753.383,"I see, so it could rule on $2.60 a page is reasonably modern."
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,753.383,754.192,Very modern.
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,754.192,759.578,"But, what about the $75 statute that Mr. Justice Blackmun raised."
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,763.012,771.309,That statute has been on our books since the turn of the century.
1971.71-5097,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,771.309,773.036,Now that we've interrupted you --
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,773.036,775.57,"No, that's quite right."
1971.71-5097,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,780.831,781.477,Could I ask one more then --
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,781.477,783.772,Yes.
1971.71-5097,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,783.772,798.16,"Somewhere in here, I have the impression that there is a statement that relief from printing cannot be obtained in the Supreme Court practices, is this a rule in your state?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,798.16,832.788,"There is a provision, Your Honor, in the rules of the Nebraska Supreme Court, which provide that the Rule 9 (a) of the Supreme Court which is quoted on page 5 of our brief provides in part, all briefs shall be printed unless otherwise allowed by the court on good cause shown."
1971.71-5097,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,832.788,846.51,"Well, I think perhaps in the opposition's papers, there was an intimation at least that she had to have her briefs printed and could get no relief and I wondered about the accuracy of that statement?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,846.51,854.308,"I would agree with that statement based upon the background and experience of our court, our Nebraska court to date."
1971.71-5097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,973.621,989.577,"Mr. Eisenstatt, do the Nebraska decisions indicate that dismissal is automatic upon failure to file the $75 bond or does the Supreme Court on occasion exercise some sort of discretion?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,989.577,995.975,There is no case in the state where a waiver has been granted.
1971.71-5097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1008.14,1014.236,"So, so for as Nebraska law is concerned, the failure to file a bond would be an automatic ground for dismissal?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1014.236,1021.613,"Although it isn't classified as jurisdictional, as the notice of appeal and the $20 docket fee, it has the same effect."
1971.71-5097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1211.203,1226.909,"Mr. Eisenstatt, do you see any legal significance in what at least appears to be a factual distinction here that this bond is not something that goes to pay for something that the appellant has but is to reimburse the other party for an expense that they have incurred?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1226.909,1233.323,"Yes I realize, this is a distinction, but if in our opinion this is a distinction without a difference."
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1272.57,1274.406,Which way did we decide it?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1274.406,1280.939,You decided that the double appeal was not valid and put as a matter of equal protection of the law cannot be imposed upon attainment.
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1280.939,1282.558,Or the double bar I guess?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1282.558,1283.725,Yes.
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1283.725,1292.281,But didn't we decide that the litigant could be forced to protect the landlord against loss of rent?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1292.281,1293.206,That's right but there was --
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1293.206,1298.559,"Protect the landlord against loss, so he would have to pay money in the court, to protect the landlord against the loss --"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1298.559,1304.338,But there the Court was addressing itself protection of property that is the tenant was occupying the --
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1304.338,1310.128,"Well, it was protecting the landlord against the financial loss from the litigation?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1310.128,1319.075,"Well, but it did not address itself -- we're talking about the initial, the payment or requirement of paying rent during the pendency of the action."
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.075,1327.079,"That's right, and the court yeah, and the only reason to do was protect the landlord from economic loss?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1327.079,1344.631,"But it applied to a particular situation Your Honor, it dealt with property that the tenant was occupying, it was this case and the matter of cost are not opposite, I mean are not consistent or the same."
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1354.918,1369.597,So you say it's just not unconstitutional or that it's unconstitutional for the state to insist that litigants protect those who may sue against the cost the parties will incur --
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1369.597,1370.934,Well at least --
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1370.934,1374.729,-- where the plaintiff at least as an indigent?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1374.729,1381.295,"That's right, if it denies him access to the courts and this has already been the Court's position in Boddie."
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.683,1401.835,You think the state would also have to relieve non-indigents from the obligation to pay the other party's cost?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1401.835,1406.271,"Not necessarily, and there is another thing Your Honor, I would like to point out in that regard."
1971.71-5097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1423.926,1435.713,Isn't that a fairly common practice among all the states though to say that once that litigation has been come to a decision in the trial court that then the burden shifts and effects so far as securing costs?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1435.713,1447.754,"Yes, it's very common and it is a -- and we do not attack the essential validity of that, we agree that this is a valid exercise of state rights."
1971.71-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1460.117,1466.035,"Well, couldn't they allow both sides to proceed on typewritten papers under that rule?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1466.035,1471.936,They could Your Honor and that was suggested Mr. Dowding in his answer brief.
1971.71-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1471.936,1478.346,"What evidence you are arguing with that, if they had done that you wouldn't have the argument, would you?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1478.346,1484.525,Well then there wouldn't be a need for a cost security either because the only purpose of the cost security provides in the --
1971.71-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1484.525,1485.519,But that's my whole point.
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1495.864,1496.921,No Your Honor.
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1496.921,1498.598,But they did.
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1498.598,1499.304,They did.
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1499.304,1500.953,(Inaudible)
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1500.953,1506.977,"Right, but the court does not permit the filing of typewritten briefs in the State of Nebraska."
1971.71-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1506.977,1511.454,"Well, I thought the rules said under extreme circumstances or something they would?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1511.454,1515.67,"I know that the rule says that Your Honor, but I know of no case where the court has ever done it."
1971.71-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1515.67,1532.908,"Well, my whole point is that the court had a choice it seems to me of exercising its discretion under its own rules, not to print, and if they exercised that discretion, there would be no need for the security bond?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1532.908,1537.987,"That's right, the only thing that the bond protects is the brief printing cost of the appellee."
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1537.987,1540.618,Well did you ask for a waiver?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1540.618,1543.163,"My client did not, Your Honor."
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1549.031,1552.5,"Without specific, they were asking for waiver to the customer."
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1552.5,1557.32,"Right, he asked generally for the right to proceed in forma pauperis."
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1557.32,1573.72,Is it possible then that this case comes down to a claim of abuse of discretion by the Supreme Court of Nebraska rather than constitutional issue?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1573.72,1582.19,"I would say no Your Honor, on the basis of the experience of the Nebraska Court did not ever varying from its rule requiring printed briefs."
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1582.19,1584.578,But the rules permit them to do it.
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1584.578,1585.103,They could.
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1588.133,1600.403,"So that there would be no problem if they had been excer -- if they had been asked to exercise their discretion to waive and had granted the request, is that correct?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1600.403,1605.806,"No, as to the cost bond there is no discretion, as to the printing of the briefs there would be."
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1605.806,1610.195,"But if there is no printed brief, do they need the cost bond?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1610.195,1616.97,"Well the statute, 29 -- 25-1914 does not give them that discretion, it's an evidence."
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1616.97,1619.337,But what if a motion had been made?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1638.059,1643.7,"No, Your Honor, you would not need a cost bond, but the statute does not give that discretion."
1971.71-5097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1643.7,1653.893,"Emotion is a kind of an odd one, that we're talking about basically whether it be the appellant more than that the appeal be permitted proceed on a type written brief?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1653.893,1655.14,Right.
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1655.14,1672.54,"Well, his emotion might will be that both parties I had assumed in my hypothetical that your emotion would be that both parties be permitted to do so first for your client's problem and second you relieve him of the need to file the bond?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1672.54,1683.618,"Your Honor, the only way that I see that the Nebraska Supreme Court could have done that would be have been to have deny the application of a statute, there is no discretion in that statute."
1971.71-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1686.718,1709.37,"Are you saying Mr. Eisenstatt that even where they do waive the requirement for printing the briefs, even where they do that for both parties, the bond would still have had to be filed even though they have been never -- since they have been filed, and not printed, there would be no occasion ever to pay any bonds?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1709.37,1711.05,That's right.
1971.71-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1711.05,1713.586,What is this bond?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1717.763,1721.724,It can be a secure surety bond or cash security in lieu thereof.
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1721.724,1730.323,"Well, is there a bond that when you file it, does it automatically collected on, and say the appellant files it and loses?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1730.323,1731.509,Yes sir.
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.509,1732.964,What happens to it then?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1732.964,1740.226,"If the appellant, the loosing party does not pay the brief cost is $2.65 --"
1971.71-5097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.226,1745.101,"So it's not a -- $75 dollars automatically, does it go to the appellee?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1745.101,1752.956,"No Your Honor, it's only if he doesn't pay the taxation of costs that are included in the mandate."
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1752.956,1757.671,And he could not actually cost unless there was a printing as distinguished from a type writing?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1757.671,1758.967,Right Your Honor.
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1758.967,1781.638,"Well, is it not possible to construe that, not for us, but for the Nebraska Supreme Court to construe its own statute as meaning that the waiver of printing would permit a waiver of the filing of the $75 by bond or cash?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1781.638,1786.972,"I see no discretion allow the court, it's an absolute requirement in the statute."
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1786.972,1798.858,And the statute would require them to do a useless thing and you think the Supreme Court of Nebraska would probably construe it that way as nearly as you can judge now?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1798.858,1800.337,I would assume sir that it would.
1971.71-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1800.337,1806.17,Incidentally it costs to get the briefs typed as well as printed?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1806.17,1806.668,Yes Your Honor.
1971.71-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1806.668,1815.659,"And suppose the appellee -- the appellant loses, does the cost bond go to reimburse the appellee for the cost of typing when he submits a typed brief?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1815.659,1827.555,All that the statute says is that it is conditioned that the appellant shall pay all costs adjudged against him in the Supreme Court without specification.
1971.71-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1827.555,1827.941,Well might --
1971.71-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1827.941,1835.069,Has Nebraska ever decide in a real close case that side bears its own costs?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1835.069,1836.568,"Yes sir, it had well --"
1971.71-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1836.568,1839.049,What happens to the $75 then?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1839.049,1840.696,Then it would not.
1971.71-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1840.696,1842.469,"The state keeps it, I get it."
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1842.469,1847.12,"Well no, it's released."
1971.71-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1847.12,1851.148,"To get a surety bond, what's the premium?"
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1851.148,1853.181,It would be a minimum of $20.
1971.71-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1853.181,1854.538,For $75 bond?

1971.71-5097,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1865.157,1869.912,Are there any statutory costs as such to in your Nebraska practice?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1869.912,1874.051,None other than the $20 docket fee which must be paid in advance.
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1874.051,1875.264,And he did pay that?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1875.264,1876.329,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1876.329,1879.45,Out of the 114 that you said he had in his pocket?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1879.45,1879.896,Yes.
1971.71-5097,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1888.006,1891.244,Does the appellee pay docket fee also?
1971.71-5097,0,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,1891.244,1903.787,"No he pays a $5 appearance fee, thank you, Your Honors."
1971.71-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1903.787,1906.044,Thank you Mr. Eisenstatt.
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,1911.151,1914.332,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-5097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1976.747,1985.09,Do you disagree with Mr. Eisenstatt's statement that the Nebraska case law indicates that dismissal will follow virtually automatically?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,1985.09,1997.403,"I respect his decision on that, but you can't tell from the record why they dismissed it here, but I think we all are assuming it was because he didn't come up with the $75."
1971.71-5097,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2043.585,2050.826,"As long as it's a state action, I don't suppose that would make any difference as to what the purpose of it may have been?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2050.826,2057.277,"No, I really don't whether they went off on that ground or not."
1971.71-5097,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2059.945,2065.531,Are there any other decisions of the Nebraska Supreme Court on this
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2065.531,2066.262,No.
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.857,2093.312,Could I ask you a question?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2102.471,2104.247,No it would cover its past and --
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.247,2117.679,And would you think -- is that act-- would that act be applicable or of any relief if this case were remanded for reconsideration in the light of that statute?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2117.679,2126.877,"Well if it were remanded for reconsideration, I would file a motion to proceed pursuant to that statute and then the question would be whether or not they would apply a retroactive;y?"
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2126.877,2128.062,What does it say?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2130.879,2144.692,"But the problem is Your Honor is that new statute says that before you can proceed in forma pauperis on appeal, the Trial Court must say that the appeal is taken a good faith, so they may not apply it to this specific case."
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2145.827,2151.499,"Well, that would be -- that would may raise another question, but not this one?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2151.499,2154.105,"Yes, they could it and we'd certainly ask them --"
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.105,2157.828,"I mean the statute -- if there is a statute, on its face."
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2157.828,2158.772,Covers it.
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.772,2159.212,What?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2159.212,2160.42,It covers it Your Honor.
1971.71-5097,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2161.458,2162.976,Is that new statute?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2162.976,2164.823,"Yes and it's in affect now, passed --"
1971.71-5097,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2164.823,2165.749,Is it in your brief?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2165.749,2168.576,Yeah it's attached as an appendix to my brief.
1971.71-5097,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2168.576,2173.504,"As a matter of fact the statute was past pursuant or as a result of the grant of cert in this case, was it not?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2173.504,2175.54,I don't know Your Honor whether it was or not.
1971.71-5097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2188.266,2198.346,"I suppose the Supreme Court of Nebraska, if this case were remanded might in term remand to the trial court for appropriate findings to whether the appeal were taken in good faith?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2198.346,2201.554,Yes they certainly could.
1971.71-5097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2234.23,2242.495,Would you distinguish annulment from the divorce in terms of the basic approach of the Boddie case?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2242.495,2243.71,"No, I do not."
1971.71-5097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2243.71,2248.741,State has exclusive control of each?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2248.741,2249.982,I do not distinguish it to --
1971.71-5097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2249.982,2259.037,You distinguish the initiation of the suit in Boddie from the right to an appeal?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2259.037,2261.32,"Yes, that's right Your Honor."
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2283.253,2289.15,"But it is a right under the law of Nebraska, it's an absolute right, it's not a discretion as a right?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2289.15,2297.278,"No it isn't, but under the Nebraska law, the right to put some requirements on it is also specified and we would further state that the due process is --"
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2297.278,2300.159,Is that specified in the constitution?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2300.159,2300.859,No that's case law.
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2300.859,2305.873,The Constitution says that you have an absolute right to appeal in a civil case?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2305.873,2308.089,"That's right Your Honor, it does."
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2317.968,2319.58,And how do you distinguish?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2319.58,2320.495,What?
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2320.495,2327.034,"Just by saying Federal Due Process law doesn't help me, how do you say that that's not a part of the procedure?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2327.034,2328.344,"I am sorry Your Honor, I didn't hear you."
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2328.344,2336.626,Isn't that just integral part of proceeding as original trial where it's a matter of right?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2336.626,2346.6,"I will concede that, except that under the case law at the time this particular statutory requirement had been held to be valid."
1971.71-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2347.358,2349.515,Valid under your Nebraska Constitution?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2349.515,2351.467,"Yes, that's right."
1971.71-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2351.467,2356.629,The Supreme Court's decisions had said that that's this legislature could put conditions on it.
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2356.629,2357.955,That's right.
1971.71-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2357.955,2359.801,Including this one.
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2374.816,2383.75,"That would make -- perhaps that would then make the right to appeal in Nebraska a fundamental right under Boddie, perhaps my distinction would not be valid."
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.75,2391.571,"Well, what you say is Nebraska says you have an absolute right to appeal in any civil case, if you have $75?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2391.571,2395.013,"That's what it amounts to Your Honor in Nebraska, that's right."
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2395.599,2398.08,That squares with the Federal Constitution?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2398.08,2399.262,We feel that it does.
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2422.745,2426.161,And ought to be correct to recoup part of the cost?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2426.161,2427.416,"Yes, it's right Your Honor."
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.416,2433.973,Well isn't that equal protection for other parties to make sure that the action isn't frivolous?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2433.973,2438.953,"I agree that the policy behind this statute, one of which is --"
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.953,2442.52,"Or it isn't any longer, the policy of the state anyway?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2442.52,2447.638,I feel that it is still one of the policy for this particular statute to deter frivolous appeals.
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.117,2468.523,"But the -- that isn't the policy of the state of Nebraska anymore, is it?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2468.523,2473.977,"No, not now, nit in forma pauperis."
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2545.373,2550.877,Do you know of any bonding company in Nebraska that give a bond to a prisoner in the state penitentiary?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2550.877,2558.705,"No, I agree that Mr. Huffman was indigent and when was unable to make this bond because of his poverty."
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2558.705,2577.073,"Suppose the case came in the equity court or some court of Nebraska and it seized all of the money that man had, every dollar he had in the bank, his house, his clothes, his car and everything and he wanted to appeal?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2577.073,2579.388,I think you might have a different case.
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2579.388,2579.787,Why?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2579.787,2585.281,"I think you have got to judge each case when you have -- when you are at the appeal level unlike Boddie, when you are at the appeal --"
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2585.281,2602.236,"Well, my case is that if we agree that in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, the court gave all of this to the plaintiff in the case and left the defendant broke."
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2605.415,2608.522,"That's right, that's exactly right."
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2608.522,2609.971,And that also squares up for --
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2609.971,2613.419,"Well, this is where I am asking the Court to draw the line."
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2638.631,2641.844,"It posted a cost bond, they just say a $75 bond?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2641.844,2643.627,"Yeah, no it's a cost bond."
1971.71-5097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2643.627,2657.049,"Well, if the case involved 14 constitutional points and $16 million and the brief cost $4,000 and 75 bucks."
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2664.074,2678.305,"That's right, in some cases perhaps this statute is not adequate, perhaps we need more protection, but again get back to the point and that is the line that the respondent is asking the Court to establish at this point."
1971.71-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2703.465,2705.21,"Well, ironically he paid the $20?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2705.21,2708.02,"Yes he did, and he also paid for the printed brief."
1971.71-5097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2723.294,2733.073,"Do you agree that Nebraska's Supreme Court could not waive the filing of the $75, if they waive the printing of the brief?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2733.073,2735.445,I think they could waive them both.
1971.71-5097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2735.445,2736.725,You disagree with your friend?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2736.725,2740.877,"Yeah, well under on the face of the statute they are both discretionary."
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.877,2742.453,It's like as if they just never had?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2742.453,2743.46,They never have --
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2743.46,2744.766,And they didn't in this case?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2744.766,2746.684,I differ to Mr. Eisenstatt.
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2750.117,2765.209,"Well, what would you -- would you say the same thing if a plaintiff in the trial court he not only really has to pay his docket fee but he has to file a cost bond to protect the defendant?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2765.209,2775.352,As Cohen versus Beneficial Industrial Loan Company Your Honor and the question is would that case be decided different today if that plaintiff were broken that case.
1971.71-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2775.352,2778.412,"Well, or would it be decided differently if it were a domestic relation?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2778.412,2787.85,"Well, this is right if the Court of course follows this line of marital relations being the crucial line here of course then they wouldn't --"
1971.71-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2787.85,2798.119,Would it be decided differently if it were litigation that could not be settled but that the only state could determine that status of a marriage or paternity of a child.
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2798.119,2801.27,That's basically where we are at on this Huffman versus Boersen.
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2801.27,2812.381,Then you would say the same thing if the state required him to post a bond to get into the trial court to pay the defendant's attorneys fees.
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2812.381,2823.143,"I would, I think that the state, again if they are protecting a private civil litigants and it's got some reasonable basis in fact to the purpose they are trying to accomplish."
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.143,2829.765,And you would say the same even if admittedly the case was not frivolous?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2829.765,2832.835,Yes I would.
1971.71-5097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2863.018,2878.61,"Mr. Dowding, do you think it would be an appropriate solution of this case if the Court were to decide to remand it to the Nebraska courts and let them reconsider the whole problem in light of the new statute?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2878.61,2887.728,"I do, I certainly could not object because the purpose behind this appeal statute was to give my client financial protection."
1971.71-5097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2954.214,2968.54,"Suppose your case here is somewhat stronger because you've had a hearing in the trial court and it is on appeal, then it would be if you simply had a cost bond requirement in the state -- I mean in the trial court before there would be any determination?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,2968.54,2979.641,"I feel that's right, against State policy once, the litigant is a winner perhaps they are entitled not to behold into appeals court without some protection."
1971.71-5097,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2983.891,2991.256,Mr. Dowding let me go to the other issue to wet my curiosity?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3001.781,3005.225,Yes and Mr. Eisenstatt furnished that for the record.
1971.71-5097,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3012.791,3017.6,Do you know why such an order wasn't issued in this case?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3017.6,3019.661,"No, Your Honor."
1971.71-5097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3038.487,3040.711,Was there any dispute on the facts at all?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3040.711,3043.814,Not on the marriage issue and annulment issue.
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3053.288,3057.293,Exactly was that a proper issue in this case?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3057.293,3065.569,"Well, I would say it probably was under Nebraska pleading because Huffman set it up in a cross petition."
1971.71-5097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3089.547,3102.438,"Isn't that a rather unusual procedural device to determine paternity suit, paternity issue in annulment suit?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3102.438,3115.177,"Yes, it is Your Honor, but our Nebraska court has held that either party can raise that issue in an annulment, if it has alleged that there are issue at the marriage and as far as I am concerned that issue is not been foreclosed."
1971.71-5097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3115.177,3117.446,That's established Nebraska law then.
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3117.446,3125.905,I believe it is Your Honor and Mr. Eisenstatt cites a case in his reply brief which indicates as such.
1971.71-5097,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3141.45,3145.346,"What is that new bill, is it the legislative bill of 1920?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3145.346,3147.448,"Yes, it's attached to our brief as in appendix."
1971.71-5097,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3147.448,3150.263,"But as I read it, it's not retroactive?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3150.263,3151.866,"Well, this is right Your Honor."
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3157.042,3160.288,"Well, it doesn't need to be retroactive, this is still a live case?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3160.288,3169.848,"Well, we might have to go back and ask the Trial Court to certify that the appeal was taken in good faith before the appeal rules apply because that's what the statute says."
1971.71-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3169.848,3174.863,"Well you have to do that whether or not it's retroactive, you have to do that in every case, just under the terms of this statute?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3174.863,3177.81,I think that the Nebraska Supreme Court would apply this.
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3181.302,3183.812,(Inaudible) then you'd be back?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3183.812,3184.824,Yes.
1971.71-5097,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3184.824,3192.172,"What you say is in your brief as I understand it, your argument that it was not taken in good faith?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3192.172,3195.791,"Well, I don't -- I feel the appeal is frivolous on the annulment issue."
1971.71-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3200.932,3210.011,"You told us today that you concede that the determination of the paternity question was insufficient, invalid."
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3211.111,3215.835,"Yes, I am willing just to agree that Mr. Huffman did not have his fay in the court on the paternity issue."
1971.71-5097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.835,3217.753,We could say so in the remainder.
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3217.753,3220.014,"Yes, so stipulate."
1971.71-5097,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3220.014,3227.332,"But, the question of -- basic question is the validity of the marriage, does that reach your brief?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3227.332,3228.629,"Yes, it has been decided."
1971.71-5097,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3228.629,3231.906,That is your standards of frivolous question?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3231.906,3240.577,"Yes because the Nebraska law was clear on that point that if the party is married when they enter into another marriage contract, then the marriage is void."
1971.71-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3256.763,3266.96,"It introduced, I saw in the record a certified copy of her divorce decree from the first husband which came after the marriage to this man, to Mr. Huffman?"
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3266.96,3267.567,Yes.
1971.71-5097,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3267.567,3275.066,Do you think that the issue of annulment stands on a separate ground?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3275.066,3277.24,I feel it does.
1971.71-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3288.07,3289.891,Of course it's all one law suit isn't it?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3289.891,3290.018,Yes it is.
1971.71-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3290.018,3292.698,So wouldn't it be considered so by Nebraska?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3294.31,3297.288,Well that gets into the pleading laws.
1971.71-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3301.362,3305.023,And that's part of all one lawsuit because it began as an action for annulment?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3305.023,3305.98,Yes it is.
1971.71-5097,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3305.98,3310.225,Then you shouldn't say as you are doing your brief that the appeal was frivolous?
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3310.225,3315.379,"Alright Your Honor, I will even concede that if in fact the paternity issue was decided --"
1971.71-5097,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3315.379,3315.902,Yeah.
1971.71-5097,1,43578,vincent_l_dowding,,3315.902,3323.778,-- but I am again willing to open up the Courts on remand or anything for Huffman to decide this issue.
1971.71-5097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3323.778,3325.721,Thank you Mr. Dowding.
1971.71-5097,2,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,3332.088,3334.751,"Just two minutes, if you may Your Honor."
1971.71-5097,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3348.656,3353.419,But it may have something to do with whether or not this appeal is a substantial appeal or frivolous one?
1971.71-5097,2,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,3353.419,3389.262,"Right, and as to one point with respect to the Lindsey versus Normet case, I would like to call the Court's attention to the distinguishing characteristic of that bond or payment provision for rent pending appeal and the Court said, there are unique facts and legal characteristics of landlord-tenant relationship that justifies special statutory treatment inapplicable to other litigants and then goes on to refer to the fact that the landlord is incurring expenses and the tenant will be getting free occupation."
1971.71-5097,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3402.402,3411.658,You agree with Mr. Dowding that a remand to the Nebraska Courts would be an appropriate solution to this problem?
1971.71-5097,2,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,3411.658,3414.166,I would hope it would.
1971.71-5097,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3428.342,3434.109,Now that you -- when you say give them a nudge you mean by that to make it clear that we expect Nebraska to solve this problem?
1971.71-5097,2,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,3434.109,3435.78,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.71-5097,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3435.78,3436.791,Thank you.
1971.71-5097,2,34395,leo_eisenstatt,,3448.233,3448.614,Thank you.
1971.71-5097,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3448.614,3451.338,And thank you Mr. Dowding.
