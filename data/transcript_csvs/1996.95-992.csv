1996.95-992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.948,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-992, the Turner Broadcasting System v. The Federal Communications Commission."
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,10.869,15.932,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,95.046,101.598,"Well, at some point during the argument... maybe now if it's convenient... would you just explain this to me, Mr. Farr."
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,118.821,121.883,"Well, I think there are two different questions that are involved."
1996.95-992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,170.093,179.379,"Well, can we conclude from your argument that if you prevail on this case a large number of broadcasters will be dropped?"
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,179.379,184.993,"Well, I guess it depends on what the term large number of broadcasters means."
1996.95-992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,300.629,311.206,How do you think we ought to assess the significance of the fact... I take it's a fact... that the brunt of the decisions not to carry tends to fall on the new stations?
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,340.637,346.859,"Well, I think first of all it very much would depend on what the programming of the new stations would be."
1996.95-992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,418.787,434.268,"Do we know how many of those... in the period before the present must-carry rules, do we know how many of those 50 percent and 33-1/3 percent, or whatever it was, failed to survive when they were not picked up by the cable channels?"
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,434.268,439.521,"Well, the numbers on stations that do not survive suggest that the number is very low."
1996.95-992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,460.895,461.055,Right.
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,462.385,462.656,That's right.
1996.95-992,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,467.878,491.273,"--Following up Justice Kennedy's question, from the cable operator's side, is this a diminishing problem to the extent that there is a problem with must-carry as cable, as the channel capacity expands, this becomes less and less of a problem?"
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,491.273,495.627,"Well, unfortunately, it has not become less and less of a problem to date."
1996.95-992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.351,549.093,"Mr. Farr, when you use the term, programmer... I want to be sure I understand... are you referring to a company that presents a full line, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, or however much they're on the air, or do you also include within that term companies that might produce individual programs they try to sell, like the Civil War documentary or something like that?"
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,549.093,553.725,I'm using it I think as it's been in use throughout this case to mean the first of those two.
1996.95-992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,553.725,553.935,Just the first.
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,553.935,556.927,Essentially a network of some sort.
1996.95-992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,556.927,562.841,We're not here concerned with the impact on people who try to sell individual programs?
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,562.841,568.187,"Well, I don't think they're specifically plaintiffs in this particular case."
1996.95-992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,594.243,599.105,"And that's the... that's what you're referring to on that 150 figure you used, is that full-line programmers?"
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,599.105,599.636,--That's correct.
1996.95-992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,601.877,604.669,And how many of those are affiliated and how many are unaffiliated?
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,604.669,608.942,--If you're talking about affiliated with cable operators--
1996.95-992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,608.942,609.213,Right.
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,609.213,611.684,--I don't have a particular number.
1996.95-992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,639.781,643.294,"Mr. Farr, may I go back to the subject of Justice Ginsburg's question?"
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,691.456,695.016,"Well, to begin with I don't think it is for two reasons."
1996.95-992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,714.401,720.394,"It's true, but do we have anything but a speculative basis to assess that latter significance?"
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,720.394,721.695,--In terms--
1996.95-992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,721.695,725.247,"I mean, we'll assume it exists, but I don't know how we... I don't know that we have any measurement of it."
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,725.247,742.349,"--Well, I don't think there is any particular way to measure it, because obviously must-carry has been in place since 1992, or since it was implemented, so there isn't a way to test particularly what cable operators will do given the program selections right now."
1996.95-992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,802.638,816.826,"Well then, why do... your implication is that there is not a substantial interest here because the beneficial impact under the three headings that Turner I spoke of is insufficiently significant."
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,821.791,825.932,"It is implicit in this sense, I think, Justice Souter, if I understand the question."
1996.95-992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,889.135,890.245,"Well, Mr.--"
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,890.245,892.178,--the amount of benefit to the broadcasters and harm to the programmers.
1996.95-992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,892.178,904.195,"--Mr. Farr, you say that the First Amendment doesn't require... it doesn't usually import any balancing, but when you're talking about, is there a substantial Government interest here under the O'Brien test, that itself is a form of balancing, isn't it?"
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,904.195,918.314,"Well, that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, there certainly has to be a weighing, if that is a proper term, of the governmental interest, but I don't think that can be divorced from the question of the means by which the Government is pursuing it."
1996.95-992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,931.491,938.807,"Do you say it can't, then, simply promote broadcast television in general because it's free to the listener?"
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,938.807,941.328,I'm not saying that they can't promote it in general.
1996.95-992,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,958.389,964.533,"Mr. Farr, suppose... this is not a hypothetical."
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,985.066,989.631,"Obviously, that would be a less restrictive alternative, there's no question about that."
1996.95-992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1021.891,1025.464,Less restrictive; why?
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1034.71,1050.691,"It's less restrictive because it only has one of the two constitutional flaws of the must-carry statute, because in that particular case it is not excluding a programmer at that moment that the operator has decided it would otherwise carry."
1996.95-992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1050.691,1057.476,Which is to say that the one both compels you to say what you don't want to and prevents you from saying what you were about to say.
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1057.476,1060.727,"The must-carry law has both of those effects, that's correct."
1996.95-992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.727,1067.853,"May I ask you if you think that section 4 and section 5 are equally bad, or equally good, whichever way we go?"
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1067.853,1072.114,"I do believe that they are equally bad, Justice Stevens."
1996.95-992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1122.958,1125.351,"They get some donations, don't they?"
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1130.373,1139.209,"--I don't think, though, typically, that someone who is choosing to donate to a public television station is choosing between that and running a local ad on the cable system."
1996.95-992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1146.382,1154.13,"Well, but they... but they do choose to make the endorsement or not based on a projection of the size of the audience, surely?"
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1154.13,1156.791,"Oh, I think that is true."
1996.95-992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1371.56,1372.641,Is the term structural borrowed from some body of the law?
1996.95-992,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1372.641,1375.143,--Not that I know of.
1996.95-992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1392.083,1393.954,"Very well, Mr. Farr."
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1396.127,1402.7,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.602,1514.645,"Mr. Dellinger, I... General Dellinger, I'm sorry... I suppose it can be said that whenever you save a single station that would otherwise go out of business you're preserving the diversity, in a sense, but I thought that what our earlier opinion meant was that, did you not save this broadcaster, or the ones that are saved by this legislation, there would not be any diversity, period."
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1526.891,1533.766,"Justice Scalia, I think to the extent it is conceded that"
1996.95-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1541.941,1542.902,Is that conceded?
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1544.515,1546.425,--I believe--
1996.95-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1546.425,1550.378,--is asserting that no voices would be lost if this legislation were not--
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1550.378,1571.013,"--They spend a considerable amount of time in their brief suggesting that the Government needed to prove that the entire national broadcast industry, or the local broadcasting industry would collapse in the absence of must-carry, but I want to explain why I think the loss of some over-the-air broadcast stations is a matter of critical importance to the Government."
1996.95-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1586.681,1587.001,--But--
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1597.697,1601.811,I think Congress had an ample basis for--
1996.95-992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1601.811,1613.848,"I mean, on the basis of the... assuming that Congress made the appropriate finding, I think the prevailing opinion last time said something more was required to show the rationality of Congress' choice."
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1620.213,1630.191,"--I think what is shown by the evidence on remand, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the problem is even worse than Congress initially supposed."
1996.95-992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1644.169,1644.938,Eight thousand?
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1644.938,1652.935,"Eight thousand times, broadcast stations were dropped from one or more cable systems."
1996.95-992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1652.935,1654.925,Out of how large a universe?
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1654.925,1656.708,How large a universe?
1996.95-992,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1698.884,1701.015,"General Dellinger, was there any offset?"
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1707.339,1711.703,There would be during that period broadcast stations added.
1996.95-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1717.997,1719.858,"Where they were dropped, how many were left?"
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1739.61,1748.476,"Well, the total number of broadcast stations that were carried were 35,000 Nationwide, so there's a lot."
1996.95-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1799.269,1801.132,Most communities have only one newspaper.
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1811.057,1820.764,"Well, it is clear that Congress has, I think, since the Radio Act in 1927 and the Communications Act, treated communications differently."
1996.95-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1830.441,1835.443,"The radio spectrum, is that what the cable operators have that newspapers don't?"
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1835.443,1835.653,--No.
1996.95-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1853.296,1857.78,What you're saying is that cable is a natural monopoly because nobody else is going to put in a piece of copper.
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1881.803,1897.304,The answer to that question I think is that... is that local over-the-air broadcasting is probably the... now the cheapest and most accessible form of sources of information in this country.
1996.95-992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1957.343,1962.767,But the over-the-air... the question that I have... I'm only thinking of the section 4.
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1994.487,2004.925,"--Justice Breyer, I think that there is ample evidence that even in the absence of loss of survival... I mean, Justice Souter asked the same question."
1996.95-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.675,2041.497,"So it's the prosperity of programmers that the Government is now concerned about, not just their continued existence."
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2041.988,2042.358,--No.
1996.95-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.358,2045.702,"--This is the overwhelming interest, that they must prosper?"
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2045.702,2056.697,"It is very important that the prosperity of programmers is only an intermediate step, not the final goal, as Mr. Farr has suggested or as your question would posit."
1996.95-992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2065.002,2089.701,"But is there evidence in the record on that, for the reason that, of course, I sought evidence in the record of economists who said, if you have less money, you will put on less expensive programming, while at the same time the station, while having less money, will then direct its attention to the minority, namely those who don't have cable."
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2113.535,2113.736,--Yes.
1996.95-992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2120.969,2122.602,Roger Knowles said that--
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2122.602,2123.323,--He said--
1996.95-992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2123.323,2126.793,"--you have less money, you will spend less on programming."
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2129.527,2134.089,"--Well, he said it's an important factor in determining the quality of a station's programs."
1996.95-992,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2141.174,2144.916,"Is the common sense viewpoint that the quality will be better, is that what you mean?"
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2144.916,2145.096,--Yes.
1996.95-992,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2145.477,2152.522,"Well, when you start talking about quality, you're walking your way in, aren't you, into a content-based justification?"
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2164.762,2177.65,"--One of the virtues of the must-carry system as compared to what the cable industry suggests as an alternative, that is, of Government subsidies, is the Government doesn't have to make those content-based decisions."
1996.95-992,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2177.65,2202.235,"Well, it doesn't make them on a specific case-by-case basis, but I think the tendency of your answer to Justice Breyer is, when you talk about vibrancy and quality, you are talking about some kind of a content-based standard, and I think what you're... I think what you're saying is that overall, not on a program-by-program basis, but overall, the content is going to be better."
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2203.647,2218.466,It seems to me that one can say that providing this kind... that these over-the-air broadcast channels are not starved financially in the hopes that they're available to the community for the quality programming that is chosen by--
1996.95-992,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2218.466,2219.556,"The quality program, yes--"
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2219.556,2220.467,--those local programmers and not by the Government.
1996.95-992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2220.467,2233.266,"--But you say, Mr. Dellinger, you want quality programming, and yet you also say that the 60 percent of the people who don't have cable, or 40 percent, whatever, are perhaps people in lower income brackets and that sort of thing."
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2240.921,2245.585,"Well, it's... these are stations that often appeal to communities."
1996.95-992,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2271.121,2297.207,"But to argue that it's better for people to have more news programs certainly reinforces the notion that it is a content-based interest here that's being urged, and I wonder, General Dellinger, the broadcast stations and the stations that aren't on cable are still out there on the air for a viewer to receive if they switch off of cable, aren't they?"
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2304.743,2325.458,"--Let me respond to your first question first, which is that I do think it's important that having a legitimate congressional concern that local broadcasters are not depleted of revenue so that those local broadcasters can make their own decisions and have the resources--"
1996.95-992,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2325.458,2327.508,"Well then, why not give them subsidies?"
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2338.894,2364.821,"--I think both the subsidy and the A/B switch are unsatisfactory and not less restrictive alternatives, but it is important to me that we understand that one is not touching a third rail of content skewing by the Government for the Government to think that local broadcasters ought not be starved of resources so they can choose, but on these two alternatives, the problem of Government subsidies--"
1996.95-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2364.821,2368.194,You at least... the Government at least thinks that expensive programming is better programming.
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2368.194,2368.804,--The Government--

1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2376.538,2376.748,--Yes.
1996.95-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2376.748,2377.349,--at any rate.
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2379.37,2392.5,"Congress believes that there are... that the harm suffered to local broadcasters when they're not carried by local systems includes reduction in a whole range of services, of content, that they could offer."
1996.95-992,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2400.223,2410.501,"General Dellinger, may I ask you on that point, at least with respect to the public stations, am I... and I'm talking about section 5."
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2434.158,2466.188,"--Justice Ginsburg, during the period in the mid-eighties to 1992, it was of course a period of great economic growth, so statistics generally are good, but in the joint record before Congress there are many instances of public stations where the... particularly the secondary... second or third public broadcast stations, ones that might be serving a community college, is being repositioned, losing its channel place in the middle of a community college course, and there's also the additional interest that Congress has always had in promoting educational television and making sure the cable homes have access to educational programs."
1996.95-992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2488.992,2508.487,"No, but we indicated, General Dellinger, that we wanted evidence that there was a significant... a significant effect, beneficial effect that must-carry had, and you at the very first said well, even if just a few stations are dropped, that's significant."
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2524.424,2525.446,Yes.
1996.95-992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2525.446,2530.929,--that must-carry produces insofar as the number of stations dropped or not dropped are concerned?
1996.95-992,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2530.929,2569.334,"The evidence was more than substantial, and the averments were more than reasonable that the loss of 8,000 local broadcast stations being kept off of cable systems during that period, coupled with, just in the printed appendix, 2,511 pages of substantial evidence to support Congress' judgment that they were going to suffer financially, have less resources to provide programming, and those 90 million homes that depend upon local broadcast television would have a less diverse, broad, and healthy source of broadcast information."
1996.95-992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2569.334,2570.586,"Thank you, General Dellinger."
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2572.336,2588.278,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2648.237,2652.269,"Excuse me, the Government's interest is in unending multiplicity, no matter how many?"
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2656.432,2657.292,Justice Scalia--
1996.95-992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2657.292,2658.433,I think that's what you just said.
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2658.433,2660.364,"--No, that's not what I just said, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2690.333,2693.615,"I read that as saying, at least one, is what the Government--"
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2693.615,2694.827,"Well, Justice Scalia--"
1996.95-992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2694.827,2695.487,--considers an irreducible minimum.
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2695.487,2695.967,--If I could--
1996.95-992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.967,2697.72,And the rest is whatever the market will give it.
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2697.72,2703.934,"--Let me just respectfully refer you, Justice Scalia, to the House report and the conference report, which make clear what the Government interest is."
1996.95-992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2703.934,2723.667,"Look, Mr. Ennis, there's no question... I guess there's no question in anybody's mind about there being a significant repositioning as a result of must-carry, but isn't the ultimate measure of the value of that repositioning, or its absence, the 31-station measure?"
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2748.392,2755.176,"Justice Souter, let me respond first by saying that Congress was not making a snapshot about a frozen historical past."
1996.95-992,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2803.829,2817.817,"How does that refute what seems to be the message of the... there were only 31 stations, that none of that had much effect on the great, great majority of broadcast stations?"
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2817.817,2822.011,"Well, Your Honor, it did have effect on the great majority of broadcast stations."
1996.95-992,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2822.011,2827.745,"How do you answer the fact that only 31 broadcasting stations actually departed this world, so to speak?"
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2827.745,2835.85,"Because, Your Honor, Congress made the predictive judgment that there was incremental weakening of the broadcast system."
1996.95-992,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2835.85,2843.524,But in the first opinion in this case we said that because there's intermediate scrutiny we didn't accept as final Congress' judgment on that score.
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2843.524,2849.511,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I'm not suggesting you should accept it as final without evidence, but there is evidence."
1996.95-992,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2853.011,2861.269,"How do you respond to the apparently conceded fact that only 31 stations out of the great, great number actually went under?"
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2862.658,2873.133,"--The response is, there was hundreds of pages of testimony before Congress and in the additional evidence showing the actual impact on broadcast stations of being denied carriage."
1996.95-992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2873.133,2873.974,"Well, what was the--"
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2873.974,2875.266,It meant they had to cut back on their programming.
1996.95-992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2888.063,2890.267,"--Are we now, then, back into content?"
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2890.267,2891.586,--No.
1996.95-992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2892.287,2893.008,Why not?
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2893.008,2907.137,"Because Congress expressly found in the act, another one of the policy objectives, that they wanted to rely on market forces to the maximum extent possible to decide which broadcast stations would survive and which would not."
1996.95-992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2908.639,2928.722,"But the justification, as I understand your argument, or your argument on behalf of Congress, the justification for that is that in fact there will be a higher quality of programming if there is this greater choice as a result of greater advertising revenue, and so on, and doesn't that, then, bring us to a content-based congressional choice?"
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2928.722,2931.072,"--Your Honor, I don't think it's a judgment about a higher quality of programming."
1996.95-992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2975.121,2982.067,"Well, you're just assuming that all the money the station gets will be spent on better programming."
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2998.997,3018.229,"Your Honor, Justice Scalia, in terms of the owner's pockets, Congress knew that in 1990 and 1991, 50 percent of all independent stations, and that's approximately 500, 800 stations, lost money, and 25 percent of them lost over $1.26 million in those 2 years."
1996.95-992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3018.229,3021.08,--Even less likely that it will be spent on programming.
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3022.693,3026.056,"We're not talking about money to put in the owner's pockets, Your Honor."
1996.95-992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3032.707,3045.116,"It might be that if I no longer broadcast to the 8,000 people who have cable, and I can only broadcast to the 2,000 people who don't, my programming will be aimed more at what those 2,000 want, not less."
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3047.598,3047.978,Justice Breyer--
1996.95-992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3047.978,3051.971,"And so I just don't... I look for evidence, and I can't find empirical evidence."
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3051.971,3054.584,"--Let me give you some evidence, Justice Breyer."
1996.95-992,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3138.089,3139.131,"Thank you, Mr. Ennis."
1996.95-992,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3139.131,3140.102,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1996.95-992,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3140.102,3142.283,"Mr. Farr, you have 5 minutes remaining."
1996.95-992,3,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3142.283,3145.155,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-992,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3217.461,3222.235,"Mr. Farr, can I ask you kind of a basic question that the colloquy has developed?"
1996.95-992,3,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3240.447,3240.856,Yes.
1996.95-992,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3243.239,3245.65,So therefore section 5 is unconstitutional on its face.
1996.95-992,3,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3245.65,3249.363,I'm... well--
1996.95-992,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3249.363,3253.454,"And I suppose a comparable provision of the 1934 act is unconstitutional, too."
1996.95-992,3,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3253.454,3255.726,"--Well, again, it depends what the justifications are."
1996.95-992,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.547,3259.459,"The justification is, diversity and better programming."
1996.95-992,3,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3259.459,3269.556,"--If that is the sole justification that is offered, and the means by which that is being obtained is to say to cable operators that you have to carry this program--"
1996.95-992,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3269.556,3270.245,"No, forget the means."
1996.95-992,3,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3274.84,3279.204,"--Well, it's very hard to answer the question, to be honest, Justice Stevens, without thinking about means."
1996.95-992,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3282.687,3285.348,"Even though it's content-based, the justification."
1996.95-992,3,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3285.348,3288.47,Government provides funding for all sorts of things where content is an issue.
1996.95-992,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3290.922,3297.375,"Well, then can we say that this colloquy about whether the justification is content-based or not really shouldn't affect our analysis?"
1996.95-992,3,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3297.375,3302.348,"Well, in my view the law should go down whether it's content-based or not, of course."
1996.95-992,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3305.4,3312.076,I thought it was also your position that it goes down a lot easier if it is content-based--
1996.95-992,3,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3314.477,3314.847,--Of course.
1996.95-992,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3314.847,3318.209,"If it's content-based but doesn't affect First Amendment rights, no problem."
1996.95-992,3,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3318.209,3318.65,Of course.
1996.95-992,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3318.65,3321.713,How can it be content-based and not affect First Amendment rights?
1996.95-992,3,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3321.713,3331.27,"Because the Government can say, we are going to subsidize something with a particular content, and if it does... if those are the means by which it's choosing to do it, that is one thing."
1996.95-992,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3401.396,3412.063,"So the FCC's efforts to, in the fifties, sixties, seventies, to get the broadcasters to have news and public service, et cetera, also in your view are unconstitutional?"
1996.95-992,3,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3412.063,3414.274,"Well, if you're talking... I'm sorry, if... I--"
1996.95-992,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3414.274,3423.99,"The NBC, ABC, you know, all the networks in the forties, fifties, sixties, and seventies, the FCC encouraged them in very strong ways to carry news and public service broadcasting."
1996.95-992,3,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3426.882,3441.211,"--When I said it crossed a First Amendment line that had not been crossed, it has been crossed partially in the broadcasting context, and the Court has looked at one or two specific examples of it, for example in Red Lion, and said it was tolerable."
1996.95-992,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3447.258,3448.169,"Thank you, Mr. Farr."
