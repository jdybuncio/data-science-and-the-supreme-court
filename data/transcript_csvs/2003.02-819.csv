2003.02-819,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.339,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-819, Patrick J. Kontrick v. Robert A. Ryan."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,9.743,14.489,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,54.985,64.81,"Mr. Poor, may I suggest that the question you have raised is not the one that I understood this case to involve."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,101.962,122.496,"And I... and I would agree with Your Honor that the question of waiver, or sometimes referred to as forfeiture, is... is part of... that is the question that's before your Court, whether that... the fact that we had not raised it until some later date is something that can be waived or forfeited."
2003.02-819,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,122.496,123.51,"Well, Mr. Poor--"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,148.569,149.601,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-819,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,157.031,158.639,"Oh, that was in the motion to reconsider?"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,158.639,181.673,"--Correct, but I would hasten to add that we have steadfastly maintained that we raised it in opposition to the motion for summary judgment in that we specifically said that the family account claim was not in the original complaint, and that to be timely, a claim had to be in that... that original complaint."
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.295,193.54,"But in that very pleading you asked the court to strike a number of things in the complaint, and yet you did not ask to strike the family account claim."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,193.54,199.301,"--Well, Your Honor, we have maintained that we did and in the context of this--"
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,199.301,206.238,But you didn't... did you expressly say that you wanted those certain allegations struck?
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,206.238,211.933,"--Well, we did as best we could at the time because this was part of a--"
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,211.933,215.359,"Did you... did you say, court, strike these allegations?"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,215.359,216.102,--Yes.
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,216.102,216.741,"Yes, the answer is yes?"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,216.741,217.893,"Yes, we believe we... we did, Your Honor."
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,217.893,221.964,"And you did not say, strike with respect to this allegation?"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,221.964,228.901,"Not specifically as to that, and that's... and that's what the... what the bankruptcy court found."
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,238.477,254.369,"What was your reason for distinguishing the two, for saying strike others, but as to this one all that you did was mention that it wasn't in the original complaint?"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,254.369,260.973,"--Well, we felt that that was... at the... in the opposition we raised the 4004 untimeliness issue."
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,266.053,271.376,"Well, if we're going to get into all of that, then they would say there's a relation back and none of those issues are really before."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,277.942,279.178,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I--"
2003.02-819,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.178,297.648,"Mr. Poor, there are cases with which I'm sure you're familiar where a statute of limitations has been held to be deemed waived, even though there's nothing in the statute itself talking about waiver."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,297.648,299.406,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-819,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,299.406,303.121,"And this is much like that, is it not?"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,328.673,338.332,"Well, in this case, Your Honor, this deadline is very much unlike a classic statute of limitations where you have a, say, a 2-year statute."
2003.02-819,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,366.939,373.255,"But what's your answer to the argument that a waiver is not an extension, it's a waiver?"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,374.637,404.546,"Well, it... any... any attempt to excuse a late filing, whether it is waiver, equitable estoppel, and it could be waiver in the sense of it's an implied waiver where a debtor, by inaction, does not raise it, or it could be a situation where there's a stipulation by the debtor to... with the creditor and says, after the deadline the creditor goes to the debtor and says, I want you to stipulate to a late time period."
2003.02-819,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,425.822,434.821,But you could make the same argument for an ordinary statute of limitations that doesn't talk about waiver or equitable alteration.
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,434.821,438.62,"--You... and that's correct, Your Honor, for an ordinary statute of limitations."
2003.02-819,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,503.803,512.179,"Well, do you think that Rule 4004(a) limits the Court's subject matter jurisdiction?"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,512.179,524.729,"Not in the least, Your Honor, and I think that's a very important distinction in this case, because I think that's where the court below got off the trail in focusing on the concept of subject matter jurisdiction."
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,555.194,567.704,"Why do you pin the word jurisdiction on it at all when rules, whether bankruptcy rules or creditor rules, cannot alter or affect the Court's jurisdiction?"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,580.252,604.772,"--I... and I... I, Your Honor, and as I recall in Your Honor's concurrence in the Carlisle case, you pointed out that to use the term subject matter jurisdiction for something like this, for a time prescription, is... is anomalous, where in... in this case if we're not... we're not dealing with subject matter jurisdiction, we're talking about jurisdiction as a shorthand for a time--"
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,604.772,611.748,"You're talking about a rigid time limit, a time limit that cannot be extended for good cause."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,611.748,620.681,"--Exactly, and I... I know there are a number of courts that decline to even use the term jurisdiction, because they think that that's probably not the best term to use."
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,622.067,636.64,"Could you... could you have, according to your analysis of what this animal is, here you made your motion to reconsider after the summary judgment motion was granted, but before judgment was entered--"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,636.64,637.3,Correct.
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,637.3,638.414,--final judgment was entered.
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,656.042,664.215,"I think, so long as it's within the same proceeding, Your Honor, you could, and that's... that was the holding in the Kirsch case, which the Seventh--"
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,664.215,665.535,How about initially on appeal?
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,679.281,693.732,"--I think that that would probably be a rare instance, but I think that in... if it is jurisdictional or unalterable, then so long as it's within the same proceeding that's just... that is part of what a jurisdictional rule is."
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,693.732,709.54,"Do you have any authority with respect to this kind of rule, a rigid time limit, that it's okay to untimely bring that to the court's attention?"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,724.235,733.689,"We have cited a number of those, Your Honor, in our... both our opening brief and our reply brief, and I would invite the Court's attention to--"
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,733.689,735.713,Where the defendant was untimely... that--
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,735.713,736.827,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,736.827,737.404,--where as here?
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,737.404,767.952,"Yes, and... and even more extreme, a more extreme example, if I would invite the Court's attention to the Dollar case, where after the time limit had passed, the creditor went to the debtor and says... said I want you to extend the time limit, and for whatever reason, the debtor said, okay, I'll agree to that, and then they brought that to the bankruptcy court for approval and the bankruptcy court said, no, this is a jurisdictional time limit, you can't have a side deal with a creditor--"
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,767.952,779.264,That was a case where the court made an... an initial ruling without having expended any time in adjudicating the case.
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,797.385,798.583,--Well--
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,798.583,800.562,I did... was not aware of such a case.
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,800.562,805.558,"--Well, there... there are a number of them where they're not raised in the... there's a whole spectrum."
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,806.59,810.305,Raised after the case is adjudicated on the merits?
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,810.305,810.843,--Yes.
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,834.908,837.814,Who made those decision where the--
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,837.814,854.97,"--The... the Kirsch case is from the bankruptcy court in the Northern District of Illinois, and... and the Poskanzer case is from New Jersey and we cite a number of them in page 16 and in our footnote on that--"
2003.02-819,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,854.97,873.73,"--The... the law... like... like the time limit here, the law is unalterable, and if you fail to make a legal argument at the trial level, you're not normally permitted to raise that argument on appeal where you haven't raised the objection below."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,873.73,875.238,--That--
2003.02-819,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,875.238,883.661,"The court... the court doesn't say, well, the law is unalterable so you're entitled to... to raise this point at any stage in the proceeding."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,897.779,913.892,"--Well, Your Honor, the... to go back to the... the concept of... of waiver or... or forfeiture, if the rule is... is truly jurisdictional, using the shorthand that it cannot be altered, then--"
2003.02-819,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.892,914.58,"No, no, no."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,930.223,957.222,"--But if... if the rule itself, for instance, does not allow a... a debtor and a creditor to extend this time line themselves, then it would be, I submit, anomalous to allow the debtor to do, by inaction, what the Court could never do on its own or... or permit a rule that says that--"
2003.02-819,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,957.222,967.641,"Well, that... that's like saying you cannot let the defendant change the law by merely failing to raise a legal objection that was fully available."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,973.402,978.11,"--Well, if it can be forfeited, Your Honor, then I would submit that it can also be waived."
2003.02-819,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,980.006,981.864,What's... what's the citation of that?
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1001.516,1001.926,--A day--
2003.02-819,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1001.926,1002.63,--A day late.
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1002.63,1003.123,--Right.
2003.02-819,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1003.123,1004.86,And then nobody said a word about it.
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1038.501,1050.223,"Well, I... I would invite the Court's attention to the cases that we cite on pages 16 and 17, such as the... the Rinde case, debtor failed to plead--"
2003.02-819,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1050.223,1052.247,"No, I'm not talking about bankruptcy."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1056.705,1068.306,"--Well, I can... I can point the Court to a case that is in that 6(b) family, in the Criminal Rule 45(b)."
2003.02-819,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1068.306,1074.372,"I'm talking about civil rules of procedure, ordinary civil cases."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1086.965,1088.301,And--
2003.02-819,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1088.301,1092.0,"--and in a certain percentage of that percentage, the other side will have said nothing--"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1092.0,1092.843,--And--
2003.02-819,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1092.843,1093.941,--waking up on appeal.
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1093.941,1094.972,--And in--
2003.02-819,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1094.972,1099.142,"And then there must be a lot of cases, if you're right, that would say, that's okay."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1110.038,1114.868,"--Well, I would... I would invite the Court to the Kirsch case that we cite in our brief."
2003.02-819,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1114.868,1116.065,Is Kirsch a bankruptcy case?
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1118.544,1154.992,"In... in Kirsch, the court relied upon that 6(b) analysis in a case called Hulson from the Seventh Circuit, where just such a thing happened where after the... after trial the... the party did not... did not file his Rule 59 motion on time and actually the other side... they stipulated to an untimely rule... they stipulated to it, and then on appeal in that case they... the Seventh Circuit said, we don't care if you stipulated to it, it's untimely and you cannot--"
2003.02-819,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1154.992,1157.843,"All right, so that would definitely support you, and what's the name of that case?"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1157.843,1161.391,"--That's Hulson, H@l u@l l@l s@l o@l n@l."
2003.02-819,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1161.391,1162.051,All right.
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1162.051,1167.214,And that's... and that was the basis... that was the basis of this whole analysis in the Kirsch case.
2003.02-819,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.214,1179.845,"Under your... your view of the law, could the respondent here, the creditor have argued that this amendment relates back to the complaint?"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1179.845,1184.425,Relation back has never been in our--
2003.02-819,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1184.425,1199.453,"Could he... could he have made that argument under your view of the law, post-judgment, after you... March 2000, it was decided in 1980... 90... 99, March 2000, you object."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1202.675,1203.584,"--He... he could have, Your Honor."
2003.02-819,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1203.584,1203.79,All right.
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1214.071,1214.564,Well--
2003.02-819,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1214.564,1219.559,And that's... that's... you put all of the parties in a very difficult position by your rule.
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1227.157,1235.163,"--That's correct, that we... we... we've never argued the... there's never... the relation back issue was never before the Seventh Circuit."
2003.02-819,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.163,1246.02,"I'm not saying it is before, but I'm saying under your view, under your framework, it would be very difficult to handle that at such a late point, and it's a legitimate argument that they could have made."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1246.02,1251.51,"If they... they raised it on appeal, as it might be a... an issue."
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1256.301,1274.877,"Mr. Poor, I'm still looking for that case that you cited, because at least the two cases that you relied on principally, Taylor and Carlisle, those were both cases where the untimeliness point was timely raised."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1274.877,1293.758,"That is true, Your Honor, both in Taylor and Carlisle it was raised, but I would suggest that in Taylor, if the Court did not allow a late extension based upon a bad faith claim of exemption--"
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1293.758,1298.033,"Well, the rule says good faith isn't an excuse, so--"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1298.033,1298.571,--And--
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1298.571,1313.554,"--But... but you are arguing that an untimely raising of the lack of timeliness is okay, and neither Carlisle nor Taylor stand for that proposition."
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1313.554,1320.984,"--Well, they do in a broader sense, Your Honors, that they do not... I would submit that they do not allow any kind of equitable--"
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1320.984,1327.094,"They were both cases where the objection to the untimeliness was timely made, right?"
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1327.094,1327.837,--That's correct.
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1327.837,1334.07,So then they could not have considered the case such as this one where the objection is untimely made?
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1334.07,1349.591,"And that... what that gets... what that gets back to our point in our brief that in the Santos case that the Seventh Circuit relied upon most heavily here, they did what I would call a pick and choose of different type of equitable exceptions."
2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1351.038,1354.315,I didn't think that forfeiture was an equitable exception.
2003.02-819,0,22931,e_king_poor,,1354.315,1356.157,"--Well, in--"

2003.02-819,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1564.974,1570.834,"But Mr. Poor, it can't be like Carlisle because the Government timely made that objection."

2003.02-819,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1761.219,1761.558,--that... that holds what?
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,1766.996,1768.732,"--I believe they can, yes."

2003.02-819,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1772.63,1773.273,All right.

2003.02-819,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.75,1791.849,--It can be waived.
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,1791.849,1796.557,"--therefore, it can be waived, and there's tolling agreements that are entered into regularly--"
2003.02-819,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.557,1796.929,Exactly.
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,1796.929,1798.802,--with respect to statute of limitations--
2003.02-819,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.802,1799.135,Right.
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,1799.135,1801.114,--and I think it could apply to 4004(a) as well.
2003.02-819,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.114,1803.798,So you think the what's his case is wrong... what was the name of the one that--
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,1803.798,1806.194,"I think it was Barley, In re Barley, Your Honor."
2003.02-819,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1809.249,1817.134,"--And was that a case in which the... in which the court expressly addressed the issue and say... and said, I'm not going to allow... I'm not going to permit the extension of time?"
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,1817.134,1818.166,--I think that was.
2003.02-819,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1818.166,1820.19,That... that's... that's far different than just a waiver.
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,1820.19,1820.683,I do understand.
2003.02-819,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1820.683,1830.426,"There the judges said, you're... we're not going to allow you to delay the processes of this court, and that's quite different than parties simply doing it on their own without the judges' intervention."
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,1830.426,1844.998,"I agree, Your Honor, and the rule, like Rule 6(b) or 9000(6)(b) focuses on motions for extension and enlargement and it is strict and it does provide the guidelines for the court to follow, but I--"
2003.02-819,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.998,1846.69,I... I'm not sure what you're saying now.
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,1847.144,1847.516,--Well--
2003.02-819,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.516,1855.029,"--you think in Barley, when the parties signed an agreement to extend the time limit, the court should have accepted?"
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,1855.029,1857.508,"--I believe that, yes."
2003.02-819,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1857.508,1857.796,Okay.
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,1857.796,1870.14,"But I think the court... the reason in the court, as I understood it, was that they could not agree to do that because extensions and enlargement of time is governed by the rule and that it wasn't permitted by the rule."
2003.02-819,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1912.78,1940.356,"Would you agree... do you agree with the Government that if the statute in question, not the bankruptcy rule, but at 157(b)(2)(J), if that required timely objection as some other statutes in the bankruptcy realm do, then you would lose, if the statute rather than the rule required timely objection?"
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,1940.356,1964.422,"I think if the statute provided... if Section 157 provided timely, like it does for abstention, I think that would make the rules more of an exercise of the code and perhaps a stronger basis for arguing the mandatory strictness of the rules."
2003.02-819,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1967.682,1977.592,"Well, many... many statute of limitations are, of course, enacted by the legislature rather than by rule, and nonetheless you have tolling there, do you not?"
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,1977.592,1978.168,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2003.02-819,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2004.053,2010.944,In the typical case there's not a whole bunch of people who are hanging on the resolution of this issue.
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2037.406,2056.847,"Your Honor, I don't quarrel with the fact that the time limit is important and it serves a valid purpose, but when we look at waiver... and we're not talking about exceptions to extend time here, we're looking at the defendant's objection to... to assert a timely objection to the untimeliness of the complaint."
2003.02-819,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.755,2067.498,But are you--
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2076.31,2079.82,It's a position I support but it's not critical to the--
2003.02-819,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2079.82,2079.985,Well--
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2079.985,2084.157,"--position that we advocate, but I do think it's right, because I do think--"
2003.02-819,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2084.157,2092.618,"--Well, would you... would you agree that a district court could override that determination of the parties, say I'm not going to allow the late filing?"
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2102.111,2121.059,"--I think the... the bankruptcy court level, that probably would be within the court's discretion, but I... my view is that it's... it's like a tolling agreement and it should be permitted, because a statute of limitations or a limitations period is a personal defense."
2003.02-819,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2134.145,2148.43,"Isn't the difference between the statute of limitations and the case we've got here that in the statute of limitations case we make the assumption that the only two interested parties are the plaintiff and the defendant, and if they don't care, why should anybody else?"
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2173.154,2177.696,"Your Honor, I think that's a sound distinction."
2003.02-819,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2224.264,2225.146,You don't have to maintain that.
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2228.389,2228.844,--But I do--
2003.02-819,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2228.844,2235.781,"--that this is simply... the question is essentially, where does one draw the line?"
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2282.054,2292.002,"--I know that in this case, once... once the court adjudicates the merits, it is waived, it's over, it's too late."
2003.02-819,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2292.457,2294.936,And that's all you have to maintain to prevail here?
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2294.936,2304.717,--I do believe... I do believe that whether there's been an implied waiver or a waiver has some of a fact inquiry that's necessary.
2003.02-819,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.379,2330.601,I have one question of bankruptcy practice.
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2348.184,2350.042,"No, that... it's pretty set, Your Honor."

2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2381.433,2384.489,"Your Honor, that was argued before the bankruptcy court."
2003.02-819,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2404.738,2409.857,If you're through I'd like to ask you an irrelevant question.
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2416.711,2421.374,"Your Honor, I wasn't involved at that time."
2003.02-819,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2436.317,2439.661,I gather it was a pretty acrimonious proceeding in the district court.
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2439.661,2440.033,"It... it was, Your Honor."

2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2490.272,2510.621,"--My... and I approach this with little trepidation, but I believe equitable exceptions, the traditional equitable exceptions of tolling and equitable estoppel, continue to apply and should apply to Rule 4004(a) and 4007."
2003.02-819,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2515.368,2527.257,"A problem then about the other part that says you can't extend the deadlines in this main part except for the reasons that are there given, which is good cause, et cetera, what do we do about that?"
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2527.257,2544.43,"--I... I think the... the... Rule 9006(b) or 6(b), it eliminates excusable neglect as a grounds for extending time for a late-filed motion, but I don't think it eliminates equitable tolling."
2003.02-819,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2556.774,2562.18,What would be a cause for tolling if excusable neglect is out of it?
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2575.926,2592.084,"--I... it's a relatively... I think equitable tolling, in the context of this rule, is relatively narrow exception, it's not... it's little broader than the unique circumstances that relate to if a party's misled by a rule of court."
2003.02-819,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.261,2606.557,Why isn't that excusable neglect?
2003.02-819,1,30257,james_r_figliulo,,2606.557,2607.505,--I don't think it's neglect.

2003.02-819,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2751.866,2753.269,"Well, when is it too late to amend the answer?"
2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2753.269,2761.564,"That's... there's a... a whole body of precedent about that, and as respondent correctly says, it's clearly too late once the judgment has been determined."

2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2766.659,2769.244,--In this case judgment was announced after the trial.
2003.02-819,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2784.559,2786.827,"Well, quite frequently, does it not, at pre-trial?"
2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2786.827,2795.827,"--Not infrequently, but it's also the case that sometimes amendments are denied at that point because of the particularity, facts of the case."
2003.02-819,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2802.143,2808.625,"Well, now, at this stage of the case, judgment had not yet been entered, but the motion for summary judgment had been granted."
2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2810.938,2817.83,--It would be... I... I think that it... it might be not an abusive discretion... there's a lot of nots there.

2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2879.38,2880.7,"--I'm sorry, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-819,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2888.668,2891.186,I'm sorry.
2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2891.186,2893.515,And that's a different... and I do think the court has that discretion.
2003.02-819,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2911.536,2918.761,I don't... you're distinguishing between granting... I'm sorry... granting--

2003.02-819,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.049,2925.532,--granting a late-raised objection and granting a late-filed complaint?
2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2925.532,2926.397,--Correct.
2003.02-819,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2926.397,2927.527,Okay.
2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2927.527,2935.123,Under ordinary principles of 8(c) and the Rules of Federal Procedure which are applicable here.
2003.02-819,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2952.669,2973.307,"Well, the rule on amendment, which the pleading rules, the Federal rules would apply, says that it should be... if after you miss the time limit in which you are allowed to amend as a matter of right, then you may or may... and with the court's permission, and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires."

2003.02-819,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2992.437,2995.947,At the outset you said there's a text-based or a rule-based--
2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2995.947,2996.524,Rule-based.
2003.02-819,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2996.524,2998.093,--And that's 4000(e)?

2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3000.61,3001.148,B.
2003.02-819,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3001.148,3001.808,Where is... where is that?
2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3001.808,3002.468,It's at--
2003.02-819,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3002.468,3004.492,Was that in... did you make that argument in your brief?
2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3004.492,3006.183,--We did not make that argument.
2003.02-819,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3069.507,3073.965,So you think this is a totally different issue and it's a much broader issue and more important--

2003.02-819,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3074.337,3097.167,"--And you think, in other words, if they had come in and said, hey, we... I've been taking all the money out of wife's account, putting... put it in... you know, I put it all in her name, ha ha ha, and I had hired people to prevent the creditor from ever finding out, that then the correct defense there would be equitable estoppel, which is an enlargement of the time period?"

2003.02-819,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3102.035,3103.771,I'm... I'm assuming they acted very inequitably.
2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3103.771,3106.865,--that we were unable to find... they hid from us what they were doing--
2003.02-819,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3106.865,3107.236,"Yes, yes."
2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3107.236,3108.517,"--yes, I think that would apply."
2003.02-819,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3118.548,3120.627,"You see, that... that's the argument the other way."
2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3132.128,3138.155,"--If, to the extent that there are other ways to deal with it, then equity doesn't need to step in if there's an adequate legal remedy."

2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3160.818,3161.478,--Yes.
2003.02-819,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3161.478,3165.193,"--but I continued to deposit my salary in it, I continued to pay the family expenses from it."
2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3166.308,3167.134,It's a hypothetical--
2003.02-819,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3167.134,3168.415,It's a hypothetical case.
2003.02-819,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3209.404,3218.775,"--Well, I... I think you're right about that that you can waive an argument of any... based on those rules in... in the trial court, but let me--"

I can imagine that there's a case out there that says something along the following, that this Court's jurisdiction, by statute, is based on the requirement, for example, that there be a notice of appeal filed within 30 days."
