1955.281,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,18.16,"Number 281, United States of America versus Joseph P. Ryan."
1955.281,0,37425,oscar_h_davis,,22.129,24.018,May it please the Court.
1955.281,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,604.362,612.469,"Mr. Davis, is there any particular reason why in (Inaudible) when they define a person they think of legal representative."
1955.281,0,37425,oscar_h_davis,,614.453,615.467,"No, sir."
1955.281,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,615.467,616.225,Very strange.
1955.281,0,37425,oscar_h_davis,,616.225,623.296,It -- I think they must have taken it from some other statute as most of these and many of these definitions were taken.
1955.281,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,623.296,628.641,"When it comes to defining it, legally it's left out and as you referred to."
1955.281,0,37425,oscar_h_davis,,628.641,628.861,"Yes, in the (Voice Overlap) --"
1955.281,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,628.861,632.015,(Inaudible)
1955.281,0,37425,oscar_h_davis,,633.133,650.419,"No, but I think they mean that in referring to a person who is the heir or the -- or the administrator or executor, they want to make sure that -- that if somebody do some back pay for instance that it won't necessarily be refused to his executor."
1955.281,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1044.406,1050.876,"And if you do not -- if you do not so limit it, how far do you extend it, to what do you extend it?"
1955.281,0,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1073.147,1073.864,"I -- I will do it right now, Mr. Justice --"
1955.281,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1073.864,1075.129,You can leave it at large.
1955.281,0,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1075.129,1077.659,"I will do it right now, Mr. Justice."
1955.281,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1105.451,1109.912,"You agree that you must give -- you can't say, ""Well, anyhow the president is here, can we stop there?"""
1955.281,0,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1110.344,1115.835,"No, but you can stop at -- at those people who deal with the -- with the employer."
1955.281,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1162.162,1167.381,But not in relation to collective bargaining or negotiation.You wouldn't restrict it?
1955.281,0,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1167.381,1170.978,"No, because you could have a strike aside from collective bargaining associations."
1955.281,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1306.966,1312.953,Or the other way around that the context shows what representative means.
1955.281,0,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1312.953,1313.834,That's right.
1955.281,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1313.834,1319.404,"Well, that's a very different thing from what you said that it's always qualified."
1955.281,0,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1319.404,1320.573,But it is always qualified.
1955.281,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1441.239,1442.235,What is that so?
1955.281,0,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1446.075,1448.005,Because some of them may not be representing.
1955.281,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1575.795,1584.896,Do you -- do I understand your argument to be that this particular bill was offered for the purpose of protecting employee of employers?
1955.281,0,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1584.896,1585.844,"Partially, yes, sir."
1955.281,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1585.844,1588.674,Who offered it?
1955.281,0,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1588.674,1595.677,I'm talking [Laughs] -- and of course there was a great interest in welfare funds.
1955.281,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1720.878,1724.304,Mr. Waldman.
1955.281,1,35221,louis_waldman,,1724.304,1731.827,It pleases the Court.
1955.281,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2619.392,2621.301,"Where is that definition, Mr. Waldman?"
1955.281,1,35221,louis_waldman,,2621.301,2624.965,"I -- I'm quoting at page 58, Your Honor --"
1955.281,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2624.965,2625.219,Oh.
1955.281,1,35221,louis_waldman,,2625.219,2626.24,-- of -- of our brief.
1955.281,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2626.24,2626.718,All right.
1955.281,1,35221,louis_waldman,,2629.843,2638.887,Then a Conference Committee was appointed to iron out the differences between the Hartley Bill in the House and the Taft Bill in the Senate.
1955.281,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2824.494,2829.538,"Mr. Waldman, what -- what was the form of 302 before it went to Congress?"
1955.281,1,35221,louis_waldman,,2829.538,2840.032,The form was substantially as it is now plus a subdivision (g) which was the special definition quoted in our brief at page 58.
1955.281,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2849.964,2851.919,What was it that is on that point --
1955.281,1,35221,louis_waldman,,2851.919,2852.008,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1955.281,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2852.008,2854.396,-- how could it just -- just leave the House?
1955.281,1,35221,louis_waldman,,2854.396,2857.01,The House didn't have that provision.
1955.281,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2860.899,2863.6,"Well, and that came back to the House to the contrary."
1955.281,1,35221,louis_waldman,,2863.6,2864.514,That's right.
1955.281,2,37425,oscar_h_davis,,3380.697,3407.363,"It is clear, I think, both in the argument and the brief and the opinion of the Court of Appeals that the -- the main focus of the argument is that a deletion of the special definition of representative which was originally in the Byrd Amendment and in the Ball Amendment and its -- the substitution of the amendment of the definitions which appear in the Act is given as the reason for the complete and drastic change in the coverage of the statute."
1955.281,2,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3437.534,3447.533,"Was -- was this on page 58 of the respondent's brief, is that the form of the Act 302 as it represented?"
1955.281,2,37425,oscar_h_davis,,3447.533,3456.899,"That was a special definition of representative which was included in 302 as it passed the Senate, of Senator Ball's amendment."
1955.281,2,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3475.005,3481.983,"Well, I got the impression that this section has been brought forward and then refused by the Senate as an Act."
1955.281,2,37425,oscar_h_davis,,3481.983,3482.852,No.
1955.281,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3517.324,3522.586,May I ask if this charge was made both against the man who gave the money and the man who took it?
1955.281,2,37425,oscar_h_davis,,3522.586,3524.255,In this case it was not made against the --
1955.281,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3524.255,3526.528,What has been done to him?
1955.281,2,37425,oscar_h_davis,,3526.528,3528.218,"I do not know, Mr. Justice."
1955.281,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3531.256,3532.456,The statute covers both the (Inaudible) --
1955.281,2,37425,oscar_h_davis,,3532.456,3536.821,It -- it does and there are other cases in which charges have been made against the employer.
