2004.03-932,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,6.616,The Court will now hear argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo.
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,8.887,17.117,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-932,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,130.797,139.255,"Can... can you tell me if... if we had not granted certiorari in the case and the Ninth Circuit's opinion became final, what would have happened on remand?"
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,140.746,143.256,"At the trial court, the--"
2004.03-932,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,143.256,153.117,"And... and wouldn't there have been a... a motion to make the pleadings more specific and they would have then come up with a measure of damages, or am I wrong about that?"
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,153.117,163.087,"--Well, the Ninth Circuit remanded for specific reasons on repleading, which Your Honor has articulated, and those would have occurred."
2004.03-932,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,188.995,196.995,"Well, I mean, I... I assume you say that the trial judge and... and defense counsel and... and the trial court would have had real problems with this opinion."
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,198.395,199.256,Well--
2004.03-932,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,199.256,201.494,--insofar as the measure of loss is concerned?
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,201.494,216.03,"--Well, the... the real problems that the trial court had and what we would continue to espouse with this opinion is that it doesn't link the loss with the misrepresentation."
2004.03-932,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,234.789,242.44,"Under this opinion, how would... under the Ninth Circuit's opinion, how would the jury have been instructed to come... to calculate the loss?"
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,245.328,264.17,"The... the problem is we wouldn't have been able to... to frame a clear jury instruction that would have indicated whether or not the loss that the jury should look at would be related to the disclosure about Albuterol Spiros, which would have occurred in the November time frame, or whether we would have had to step back to the February time frame and... and the loss that was incurred then."
2004.03-932,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.584,298.104,What would have happened if the disclosure about Albuterol was made before the company announced revenue shortfalls?
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,298.104,300.045,"--Well, I think that would have been different."
2004.03-932,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,319.116,323.465,Why is it difficult to figure out what the Ninth Circuit was thinking?
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,345.121,348.128,That... that would be the theory under the Ninth Circuit.
2004.03-932,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,348.128,348.338,All right.
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,349.003,349.225,"Well, the--"
2004.03-932,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,349.225,350.342,It's clear.
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,351.303,359.686,--The problem with... with that theory is that Congress has told us that the misrepresentation has to have caused the loss and--
2004.03-932,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,359.686,359.886,Yes.
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,361.348,371.339,--And... and what we would be looking for is evidence that... that such a actual loss occurred in response to a corrective disclosure in the marketplace.
2004.03-932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.339,375.737,"Well, it doesn't depend on... on what you... what you consider to be the value of the stock."
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,383.269,384.035,"Yes, it is."
2004.03-932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,384.035,386.169,Because everybody else thinks they found gold too.
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,393.158,393.727,That is correct.
2004.03-932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,393.727,408.354,And we're dealing with a special rule that looks to market value.
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,408.608,409.378,That is correct.
2004.03-932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.378,411.628,"So he paid $60, he got $60."
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,412.128,419.363,And would have the ability to continue to sell that stock for $60 in the marketplace until such time as there was a corrective disclosure.
2004.03-932,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,419.363,420.31,Is there any other problem?
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,429.817,431.468,Thank you.
2004.03-932,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,476.21,477.725,"Now, can we... can they prove this?"
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,508.369,515.619,"The Congress has told us that we should look for loss, and that--"
2004.03-932,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,515.619,516.193,It's a loss.
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,518.217,523.409,--and that leads us to the... the point that... that whether the increase can actually be pled.
2004.03-932,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,550.803,566.15,And both would be all right because what's the difference between not getting as much appreciation as you would have gotten if the correct information had been out there and getting less than you would have gotten.
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,594.297,598.739,"Well, that shareholder... it would depend on what has happened in the marketplace."
2004.03-932,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,607.664,612.655,"Yes, but I'm assuming that... that there is, and so the stock goes up but not as much as it would have."
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,658.691,667.036,Our position is we believe that a drop in the price is necessary to demonstrate the loss.
2004.03-932,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,667.036,669.343,But the Government--
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,669.343,669.86,They do.
2004.03-932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,669.86,671.632,"It doesn't matter in this case, does it?"
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,673.717,674.302,In this case--
2004.03-932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,674.302,675.372,Do we have to decide that issue here?
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,675.372,678.007,--We don't have to decide that issue for this case.
2004.03-932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,678.007,690.248,And is it... is it easy to prove that... that the price of this now valuable stock because they found platinum would have been $40 higher had they found gold?
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,694.269,695.924,The plaintiff has that burden--
2004.03-932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.924,697.828,"It would be very hard to prove, it seems to me."
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,697.828,707.409,"--And... and at the pleading stage, I believe that they could be segregated and... and an upward movement in the stock could be distinguished from a downward movement in the stock."
2004.03-932,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,710.919,723.704,"In... in your view, is the plaintiff entitled to an expectancy measure of damage, or is it more the traditional tort measure which is out-of-pocket losses?"
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,723.704,727.024,We don't believe that they are entitled to any expectation damages.
2004.03-932,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,730.128,737.52,Is the... is the respondents' position properly characterized as asking for expectancy damages or is that too simplistic a view?
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,737.52,745.34,I... I think that it is perhaps inclusive of expectancy.
2004.03-932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,748.25,750.126,I think they'd be called reliance damages.
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,753.825,765.724,"And it gets back in our view to the transaction causation distinction in the securities cases that talk about the reliance transaction, price inflation that occurs at the front end."
2004.03-932,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,765.724,786.455,"If that's so then... then on the platinum/gold theory, you can't really recover what would have happened if there had been gold because it might be that the stock would have been worth $400 if there had been gold even though 15 years earlier when he only paid $50 for it, he's only out of pocket, at most, $50."
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,798.96,817.48,"Following your... your suggestion about the price of gold, it would depend on where that... that disclosure occurred in connection with the price of... the price of gold, if that disclosure occurred, and if there was an economic loss that could be... could be tied to it."
2004.03-932,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,826.35,832.492,"But, Mr. Sullivan, you refer to the disclosure as being the key point and when you measure the... the loss and so forth."
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,841.27,842.135,I think--
2004.03-932,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,842.135,842.705,How would you handle that case?
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,842.705,852.871,"--I think that a plaintiff would be able to handle that in... in a pleading and they would have to identify the leaks and if there are several, identify each of them and identify them as--"
2004.03-932,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.871,854.112,"Well, maybe they don't know the leaks."
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,868.101,875.014,--The key is that they have to prove that the loss was connected to the misrepresentation and that the drop in--
2004.03-932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,875.014,877.355,"Well, they... they wouldn't have to prove how it came out."
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,893.513,896.596,--So I was distinguishing... yes is the answer to your question.
2004.03-932,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1086.354,1086.587,You certainly may.
2004.03-932,0,46185,william_f_sullivan,,1086.587,1087.492,Thank you.
2004.03-932,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1087.492,1094.413,Mr. Hungar.
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1094.413,1097.786,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-932,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1112.703,1119.701,Would you tell us how you differ with petitioner on what ought to happen here and why?
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1119.701,1130.082,"--Well, our view... well, what ought to happen in this case is that the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed because the court failed to require loss causation."
2004.03-932,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1134.457,1136.093,You agree with the bottom line.
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1136.093,1136.481,--Yes.
2004.03-932,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1136.481,1138.084,"Now, where do you disagree?"
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1138.084,1171.832,"Well, I'm not sure that I can accurately tell you petitioners' position, but I can tell you our position, which is that in a fraud-on-the-market case the plaintiff cannot... has failed to plead loss causation unless the plaintiff pleads that the... the inflation attributable to the misrepresentation or omission has been removed or reduced from the price of the stock through dissemination of corrective information of some sort to the market."
2004.03-932,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1198.716,1205.797,"Well, doesn't the general rule 8 governing complaints... isn't that adequate?"
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1209.767,1210.306,That's right.
2004.03-932,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1211.383,1218.331,Why is the Government proposing that you have to follow rule 9 not 8 or some other requirement?
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1218.331,1230.251,"Well, the... I don't think the question... we cited rule 9(b) in our brief because fraud must be pled with particularity and... and that... and that rule applies to all the, quote, circumstances constituting a fraud."
2004.03-932,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1236.381,1237.532,We don't have to get into that.
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1237.532,1237.782,That's correct.
2004.03-932,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1238.639,1255.648,"But, Mr. Hungar, if you look at the forms of what's proper pleading under the Federal rules on causation, the sample pleadings say, for example, for money lent, the defendant owes the plaintiff for money lent."
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1279.959,1283.009,"Well, as we said in our brief, we think 9(b) applies here."
2004.03-932,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1284.356,1289.915,"But that... that's to the... to the allegation of fraud, but not causation."
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1289.915,1293.985,"Well, Congress has made very clear that loss causation is an element of the cause of action."
2004.03-932,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1299.66,1300.005,It says... no.
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1304.145,1311.77,"--Well, with respect, Your Honor, we think circumstances... it does not constitute fraud if there is no loss causation."
2004.03-932,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1320.8,1321.85,"Well, that's not correct I don't think."
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1327.849,1333.608,"--Yes, but in a... in a private action for securities fraud, loss causation is an element of the cause of action."
2004.03-932,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1334.965,1335.722,It's not an element of the fraud.
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1338.34,1340.251,"Well, it may be a semantic question."
2004.03-932,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1340.64,1342.242,"Well, that's what Justice Ginsburg's point--"
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1342.242,1370.339,"--But there... I mean, there are cases in the... in the courts of appeals saying that... that rule 9(b) applies to all the elements, and we're not aware of cases... the... the... one of the amicus briefs cites cases which focus on the nature of the representation, and that's certainly where 9(b) issues are generally fought out because in a... in a typical securities case, loss causation is not a difficult issue because the... the bad news is... is announced, the stock drops, and the plaintiff pleads loss causation as a matter of course."
2004.03-932,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1375.666,1376.04,Well--
2004.03-932,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1376.04,1396.402,"In any event, the difference between getting the... the complaint dismissed on the pleadings or having to wait for a... a 12(b)(6) motion because as soon as you, you know, ask for the... the proof of the elements of the cause of action, you're entitled to have, if... if your analysis of the case is correct, you're entitled to have the drop in... in the value of the stock shown."
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1396.402,1408.822,"Well, as a... as a practical matter, Your Honor, there's a huge difference in how these cases are litigated because it's the difference between spending millions of dollars on discovery, literally millions of dollars on discovery, or not."
2004.03-932,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1431.456,1432.137,--Is... is the--
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1432.137,1433.626,--Congress did what it did in 1995.
2004.03-932,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1433.626,1437.858,--Is the reason... is there a further reason that they've got to... to plead loss causation?
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1486.92,1498.264,"I think that's... that's a helpful way to look at it, Justice Souter, because it's... in... in a fraud-on-the-market case, by definition the plaintiff is alleging that there was an efficient national market and that is what makes the difference."
2004.03-932,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1537.646,1542.871,"Do you... do you take the position that the phrase in (e)(2), if the plaintiff... I'm sorry."
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1544.711,1551.822,You're referring to section 12(b) or?
2004.03-932,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1551.822,1552.311,No.
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1569.069,1573.364,"Well, I suppose a plaintiff in--"
2004.03-932,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1573.364,1574.145,It certainly includes it.
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1575.947,1587.153,"--I think what that encompasses is a... is a case in which the plaintiff purchased the stock on the market... on... on a open market, which will typically be in practice a fraud-on-the-market case."
2004.03-932,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1596.245,1610.719,"--If... if it's not confined to fraud-on-the-market, then there's the argument on the other side that all... all (2) is really doing is saying that if you are going to establish your damages by reference to market price, this is the way you've got to do it."
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1626.678,1630.328,"--Well, I think they... they unquestionably are trying to establish their damages."
2004.03-932,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1635.818,1637.014,--To the... to the purchase price.
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1637.014,1643.85,"The plaintiffs alleged they purchased at the market price in this fraud-on-the-market case, and... and the damages are the difference between what they paid at that market price and what it should have been."
2004.03-932,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.113,1650.217,But they paid... they paid whether it was a market price or not.
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1651.105,1652.916,"Well, they... they alleged they purchased on the market."
2004.03-932,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1654.172,1663.151,"--Well, what they paid happens to be the market price, but... but you can't really say that the Ninth Circuit was referring to the market price as part of its... its damages."
2004.03-932,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1667.852,1681.449,"--Well, in any event, we interpret it to refer to... I mean, by definition they are, in a fraud-on-the-market case, alleging that they have purchased at the market price, and that's exactly what this statute would be encompassing."
2004.03-932,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1697.23,1698.942,"--Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,1703.279,1706.377,"Justice Stevens, may it please the Court:"
2004.03-932,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1732.971,1742.041,But surely they wanted to have a person be able to read a complaint and just understand what it's about in a securities fraud case.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,1779.979,1781.479,I don't think that's so hard to do.
2004.03-932,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1785.206,1786.923,And this case doesn't seem to do it.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,1807.742,1809.846,"--And... and you're right, Your Honor."
2004.03-932,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1848.338,1861.559,"But there's a... but there... there is a basic difference between, as was pointed out in the colloquy with Mr. Hungar... one thing is the particularity of pleadings."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,1909.422,1916.144,"Your Honor, I don't think it's enough to prove that we just paid an overinflated price."
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2014.332,2014.819,Why?
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2028.546,2030.74,Maybe and maybe not much.
2004.03-932,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2052.636,2063.915,"But it sounds to me as if the things you're saying now are matters for proof, and I... I think the wiggle room in the Government's position was it said it has to be disclosed to the market in some form or other."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2078.005,2079.396,"--There's no doubt, Your Honor."
2004.03-932,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2083.244,2084.973,"Well, you just have to say at the pleading stage what your theory is."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2084.973,2086.21,And... and I think we did that.
2004.03-932,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2090.645,2111.267,"I thought your theory was, at least as I read your brief, that your loss occurs at the moment of purchase, not at some later time, that when you bought the stock, the price was inflated and that's when you suffered your loss, on the day of the purchase, not at a later time."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2111.267,2112.275,--That's absolutely correct.
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2117.34,2131.652,"How can you reconcile that with your concession that if the person who... who buys it at an inflated price turns around 2 days later and sells it at that same inflated price, he cannot bring suit?"
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2133.093,2134.269,--Would not allow recovery in that--
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2134.269,2135.514,How... how can you reconcile that--
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2135.514,2135.914,--Because those--
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.914,2138.825,--with the notion that the loss occurred at the time your purchased?
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2138.825,2146.055,"--Justice Scalia, because those are... what we're talking about are recoverable damages, and then there's a limitation from section 28."
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.572,2177.118,They're saying there's no losses.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2193.053,2194.08,"Well, that's--"
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.08,2196.208,But that's your theory and it seems to me you're stuck with it.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2203.658,2207.559,--It doesn't matter for that plaintiff if they sell it to a poor... somebody unexpected.
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2237.418,2239.328,You have to show what before recovery?
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2240.061,2241.315,--The inflation came out of the stock.
2004.03-932,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2270.393,2276.593,"Yes, but if you've got to show the inflation, then you don't have a complete cause of action the day after you buy the stock if there's no loss."
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2284.194,2284.991,That's what they're saying.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2284.991,2285.927,You can only recover--
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.927,2286.307,To me your... your--
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2286.307,2289.696,--You can only recover if that inflation is taken out of the stock.
2004.03-932,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2291.706,2303.266,"No, but I... I thought you were conceding that you... you, in fact, do not have a... a loss... forget what you can recover... that you don't have a loss until the inflation is followed by a drop."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2313.776,2321.432,"I... I believe that the day you overpay something, just like in the Sigafus, just in the... in the Bolles case, both of them had to do with gold mines--"
2004.03-932,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2321.432,2323.907,Then you're talking about a cause of action without damages.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2323.907,2327.536,--You may not have recoverable damages.
2004.03-932,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2328.497,2333.116,"If you have no damages, you have no cause... I mean, on normal tort theory, you have no cause of action."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2333.116,2336.857,"I understand, and I think you have $50 worth of damages right there."
2004.03-932,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2339.03,2344.097,"Well, that's exactly what we're debating, I suppose, that very point."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2355.111,2362.679,"--In the most complex frauds, a... a company is reporting revenue and earnings and their stock is, let's say, trading at $60 a share."
2004.03-932,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2394.958,2395.158,All right.
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2431.251,2432.337,--And that's worrying me too.
2004.03-932,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2432.337,2434.303,It might come out in many different ways.
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2436.86,2437.317,Right.
2004.03-932,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2437.317,2445.021,"It could come out because he doesn't say anything but it sort of oozes out as earning reports come in, but it has to come out."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2457.355,2459.446,I certainly don't want to be disagreeing with Judge Posner.
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2461.341,2464.168,I think... I think you're... I think you're agreeing with the petitioners.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2468.022,2469.902,"--I would agree with that, Your Honor."
2004.03-932,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2484.781,2495.062,"--When we have this happy agreement and if you'll agree, you at least have to prove what you... you have to plead what you intend to do, that is, you have to plead and there was a loss and this is my theory."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2510.42,2513.103,"Justice Breyer, I think the Government says that we can recover."
2004.03-932,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2521.333,2524.272,What happens with the transaction causation?
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2536.663,2538.074,--Right.
2004.03-932,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2538.074,2538.625,All right.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2557.952,2563.874,"Well, I dream to have those clients that gain four times, but since we don't usually have those and it is the drops that we're really talking about."
2004.03-932,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2594.767,2595.969,But there's a problem.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2606.375,2606.843,AlSpiros.
2004.03-932,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2606.843,2607.531,Yes.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2637.534,2647.343,"If... if we move to the proof stage, the people that purchased in the class period and sold before that announcement will not be able to recover that 20 cent drop at the end."
2004.03-932,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2662.77,2669.908,I... I thought that you were trying to pick up on the drop that seemed to be attributable to the other--
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2669.908,2671.108,"Product, Ceclor?"
2004.03-932,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2671.108,2677.248,"--Yes, and that's what... well, there... there are two frauds going on."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2691.6,2695.529,There... there are some things in that drop attributable to the other product.
2004.03-932,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2753.131,2764.612,"Well, one of the problems for me is the Ninth Circuit seems to think that it has a theory... and it is the theory of your complaint... that's different from, say, the Third Circuit."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2785.411,2798.062,"I wish that the circuit said if the bad news came out, but the Koger case and... and emergent out of the Second Circuit seem a little stronger and talk about almost the only way it can happen is with a corrective disclosure."
2004.03-932,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2815.872,2818.537,"Well, that may be clear but it may be clearly wrong."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2820.007,2823.672,"--That... it... it... I understand that, Your Honor."
2004.03-932,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2835.79,2847.609,"Well, I... I thought that Judge Sneed recognized that if the stock was sold before any loss was incurred, even if there's been a misrepresentation, recovery should be denied."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2847.609,2848.622,That's correct.
2004.03-932,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2848.622,2849.153,All right.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2849.153,2850.71,That's absolutely correct.
2004.03-932,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2850.71,2852.338,That's not what the Ninth Circuit said in this case.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2852.338,2858.925,The Ninth Circuit didn't... it cited... it cited the Green v. Occidental opinion and the Blackie I believe.
2004.03-932,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2858.925,2862.173,But I'm submitting it cited it for the wrong conclusion.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2862.173,2865.258,I... I think it... I think it--
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2865.258,2872.66,"It cited... I thought cited Knapp and... which, in turn, cited Gray or... or--"
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2872.66,2873.609,--There are all the appendants.
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2959.863,2963.109,"--I mean, if you're worried about it, why aren't you worried about it later, as well as earlier?"
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2976.185,2977.471,I don't think I said--
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2977.471,2980.53,I don't... I don't know why... why it's desirable not to include that at the pleading stage.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,2980.53,2983.261,--I don't think I said that that was difficult or hard to prove.
2004.03-932,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3081.48,3082.146,But that's a--
2004.03-932,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3082.146,3094.865,That's why the term loss causation is used because under the statute it's... it's a loss experienced by the plaintiff caused by the misrepresentation.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3094.865,3099.126,"Justice O'Connor, I... I couldn't agree more, and that's why it goes to proof."
2004.03-932,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3101.059,3101.75,Well--
2004.03-932,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3101.75,3102.203,No.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3102.203,3103.171,--I agree.
2004.03-932,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3104.094,3108.87,--The Government said you don't want unnecessary discovery.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3114.253,3115.008,There's no doubt.
2004.03-932,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3115.008,3116.13,--which yours don't do.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3116.13,3119.395,They don't do well enough in this case.
2004.03-932,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3119.395,3123.177,"No, but what... it seems to me that what Judge Sneed's theory boils down to is this."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3157.98,3158.685,That's fair to say.
2004.03-932,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3158.685,3159.436,Okay.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3159.436,3160.117,"I agree with that, Your Honor."
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3192.677,3198.46,So... so... I'm not sure I understand what... I'm... I'm really coming to believe that this is a misunderstanding.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3221.633,3223.196,--It's the limit on your loss.
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3223.196,3225.45,But that is not your loss.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3233.953,3234.347,No.
2004.03-932,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3245.141,3247.31,But the... let's approach it a different way.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3264.227,3264.768,Correct.
2004.03-932,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3264.768,3275.125,"Number two, you as a purchaser do not know about the fraud until the market finds out about the fraud."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3275.125,3276.414,Correct.
2004.03-932,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3276.414,3290.233,"If that is the case, then I don't see that it makes any sense at all to talk about your having a cause of action the day after you purchase before the market has found out and before the fraud is known."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3294.753,3302.574,"And here's why it matters, if I might, is that what petitioners and perhaps the Government would say is that you're right."
2004.03-932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3324.493,3326.617,"You don't know about it, but the market knows about it."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3328.575,3329.545,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
2004.03-932,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3395.898,3406.673,I thought that that's what the Government was getting at in the passage I read earlier where they don't make it... there must be a statement by the issuer of the correction.
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3440.704,3443.207,"I... I don't agree with that, Your Honor."
2004.03-932,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3450.253,3451.64,You... you seem--
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3451.64,3452.118,Can you recover?
2004.03-932,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3468.617,3487.677,"But aren't... aren't you... aren't you, in... in effect, equating two different things: one, a loss that you suffer which you say occurs immediately upon purchase of the inflated stock; and on the other hand, a limit on the loss that is attributable to the fraud?"
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3496.309,3507.615,"Well, Your Honor, I think that that's an interesting statement because if the limit is... let's say for a $100 stock that's worth $50 and you overpay by $50, let's say that's the limit of our loss, even if the stock--"
2004.03-932,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3507.615,3511.555,"Mr.... Mr. Coughlin, I'm afraid you've had a full opportunity to explain this very difficult case."
2004.03-932,2,37791,patrick_j_coughlin,,3513.296,3514.373,"--Thank you, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-932,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3514.373,3516.135,"Mr. Sullivan, you have 2 minutes."
