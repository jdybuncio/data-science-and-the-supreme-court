1987.87-16,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We'll hear argument this morning in No. 87-16, Richard D. Shapiro versus the Kentucky Bar Association."
1987.87-16,0,20715,donald_l_cox,,15.926,18.978,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1987.87-16,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,211.417,211.984,Mr. Cox?
1987.87-16,0,20715,donald_l_cox,,211.984,212.686,Yes sir?
1987.87-16,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,212.686,217.471,"Let me look at this precise letter: it states, doesn't it, that"
1987.87-16,0,20715,donald_l_cox,,231.23,243.205,"Well, I think what it indicates, Justice Blackmun, is that Mr. Shapiro had gone to the court records and determined that, in fact, there was a foreclosure action pending."
1987.87-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,279.997,289.519,"But Mr. Cox, isn't it possible that all three of those agencies, while it's clearly banned by an existing rule, so we don't have to reach the question of whether the particular advertisement is misleading."
1987.87-16,0,20715,donald_l_cox,,289.519,291.469,--That is a possibility.
1987.87-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.188,301.994,"And in fact, has anybody reviewed this particular letter under the rule that was promulgated after the letter was submitted?"
1987.87-16,0,20715,donald_l_cox,,301.994,303.946,--The Kentucky supreme court did.
1987.87-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,303.946,306.731,"But they didn't tell us anything about whether it was misleading or not, did they?"
1987.87-16,0,20715,donald_l_cox,,311.266,326.959,"But they cited... and I think it's important that the cited in their decision the fact that it had been reviewed by these lower court... these lower bodies, and there had been no finding that it was false, misleading, or deceptive."
1987.87-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,328.228,331.096,"There is no finding that way, but there was no finding the other way either."
1987.87-16,0,20715,donald_l_cox,,331.096,332.013,--That's correct.
1987.87-16,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,332.013,334.298,"Well, Mr. Cox... go ahead."
1987.87-16,0,20715,donald_l_cox,,355.461,359.163,But this letter is sent to people whose homes are being foreclosed on.
1987.87-16,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,359.163,361.049,Well--
1987.87-16,0,20715,donald_l_cox,,361.049,362.651,"I mean, that's--"
1987.87-16,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,362.651,364.617,"--I, might be that would be a mistake."
1987.87-16,0,20715,donald_l_cox,,396.038,408.013,"--It is my view that the false, misleading, and deceptive rubric has to be judged in context; and we're talking in the context of a letter coming from an attorney, so obviously--"
1987.87-16,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,408.013,408.463,Yes.
1987.87-16,0,20715,donald_l_cox,,409.663,418.988,"--and I am suggesting that under those circumstances, a letter coming from an attorney might be judged somewhat differently than a letter coming from the soap company."
1987.87-16,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,418.988,422.44,So you would concede that higher standards may be imposed?
1987.87-16,0,20715,donald_l_cox,,422.44,428.094,"Somewhat higher standards, depending upon what the context of the letter is."
1987.87-16,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,428.094,434.497,Do you think the state can ban telephone-targeted advertising?
1987.87-16,0,20715,donald_l_cox,,434.497,439.567,It is my view that that is not the issue before the Court here--
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,1905.952,1908.971,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1960.237,1963.439,How does this disapprove this letter?
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,1963.439,1968.26,"The Kentucky supreme court did not as such disapprove this letter, Justice White."
1987.87-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.26,1970.712,Why it disapproved it?
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,1970.712,1972.245,It did neither.
1987.87-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.698,2011.687,"Well, do you think that Shapiro was free to go ahead with his advertisement after the Kentucky supreme court decision?"
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2011.687,2012.706,"No, Justice White, I do not."
1987.87-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.706,2015.741,"Well, if he wasn't, then they must have applied some rule to ban it?"
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2015.741,2016.541,They did.
1987.87-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2016.541,2017.86,And what did they apply?
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2017.86,2022.394,At the time they deleted Rule 3.135.
1987.87-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.333,2042.058,"Well, the claim is that Kentucky is not entitled under the First Amendment to require this particular letter."
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2042.058,2042.608,And that claim--
1987.87-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.608,2046.693,And that claim rejects it.
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2046.693,2060.937,"--If the Court please, I believe that claim was raised for the first time in this Court and that is the heart of our jurisdictional argument; that what Petitioner attacked in the trial court was Rule 3.135, which he asked be deleted."
1987.87-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.937,2070.875,"Well, what he said, what he claimed was, that he is entitled to publish this... to mail, this advertisement; he's entitled to under the First Amendment."
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2074.779,2083.635,"And that gets to the substantive issue, Justice White, as to whether Kentucky can constitutionally ban the letter as proposed by Shapiro."
1987.87-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.103,2090.722,Isn't that the issue before us?
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2092.824,2100.062,"I think the issue is not properly before you, Justice White, because it was not raised in the Kentucky supreme court."
1987.87-16,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2129.664,2139.472,"But that seems rather strained to me, because he never knew about Rule 7.3 until the supreme court of Kentucky adopted it."
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2163.504,2166.956,"Mr. Chief Justice, it does not for these reasons: the old rule began,"
1987.87-16,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2199.093,2204.164,Did the Kentucky supreme court disapprove this letter?
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2206.281,2206.783,It did.
1987.87-16,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2206.783,2208.116,"It disapproved it, did it not?"
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2208.116,2208.516,Yes.
1987.87-16,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2208.516,2212.485,And did it not disapprove it on the basis of the new rule?
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2212.485,2212.853,Yes.
1987.87-16,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2212.853,2217.055,"Well then, why is the case here?"
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2219.924,2229.029,"Well, our position is that that new rule should have first been challenged in the Kentucky supreme court rather than before this Court."
1987.87-16,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2229.029,2236.968,"Well, what chance do you think a challenge would have had in the Kentucky supreme court after that court had adopted the rule?"
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2239.587,2257.966,"I can't get inside the mind of the Kentucky supreme court, but they, like other courts, are willing to listen and be educated; and if there was a challenge to the new rule, I think they would apply their wisdom and experience to it; and the facts that are presented to that court about the rule."
1987.87-16,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.966,2264.636,"Mr. Doheny, it would be a different question if all the Kentucky Supreme Court did was to say,"
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2286.485,2288.168,"Well, perhaps I--"
1987.87-16,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2288.168,2289.168,Did it say that or not?
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2290.353,2296.691,"--Well, perhaps I overstated it, Mr. Justice Scalia, because it does not say in the opinion that they made a finding with respect to this letter."
1987.87-16,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2302.995,2310.183,"Well, your response to one of the other Justice' questions was that, indeed, there has been a determination that this letter is no good."
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2312.016,2314.318,"I believe I was in error when I said, that, Justice."
1987.87-16,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2314.318,2314.935,I don't think so.
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2333.014,2333.464,Sure.
1987.87-16,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.464,2339.434,Am I correct in recalling that you did not make this argument in your Response to the Petition for Certiorari?
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2339.434,2340.303,It is true.
1987.87-16,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.873,2348.389,Did you have a problem under the Tuttle opinion?
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2348.389,2349.975,We did make it late.
1987.87-16,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2349.975,2360.949,"Mr. Doheny, it strikes me you'd be well-advised to spend time on the merits of the case, because I think your jurisdiction argument may be unpersuasive."
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2384.315,2396.372,"I think that, if the substance of the letter, Justice O'Connor, were deemed to be not misleading, without question, in Kentucky, it could appear in a newspaper."
1987.87-16,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2398.139,2405.828,"Yes, and then could the newspaper ad be mailed... copies of it, to targeted recipients?"
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2405.828,2407.362,"No, not under the rule."
1987.87-16,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2430.843,2448.841,"Well, under the First Amendment analysis, why is it more of a concern by the state to protect the recipients from opening up the ad in an envelope than from reading it in their newspaper?"
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2448.841,2460.815,I think that the distinction is that it has been touched upon by this Court; that it gets to the ability of a trained advocate to persuade on a personal basis.
1987.87-16,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2480.46,2493.018,"If what's in the envelope is a copy of an ad clipped out of a newspaper, why isn't that... why shouldn't it be treated like the newspaper?"
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2493.018,2500.19,The newspaper ad is a generalized statement of advertising.
1987.87-16,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2556.043,2557.76,But you could say the same thing of a newspaper ad...
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2579.809,2581.492,To targeted individuals.
1987.87-16,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2581.492,2583.144,"Well, you want to call it ""targeted""."
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2584.228,2585.661,"All right, sir."
1987.87-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.661,2588.68,You have to mail it to somebody.
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2588.68,2599.238,"You could mail it generally to those who do not... are not known to have the problems, some of whom may."
1987.87-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.238,2611.895,"It's a rather odd First Amendment doctrine that we forbid ads only when they're targeted at people that are interested in them, which is the purport of your argument--"
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2611.895,2621.067,"I'm trying, and am prepared to, draw a distinction between advertising on the one hand; and again, solicitation on the other."
1987.87-16,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2648.568,2654.37,"--So basically, you're saying you can't be too effective?"
1987.87-16,1,23832,frank_p_doheny_jr,,2654.37,2657.005,"I wouldn't word it that way, Justice Kennedy."
1987.87-16,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2801.597,2802.747,"Thank you, Mr. Doheny."
