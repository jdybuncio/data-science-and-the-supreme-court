1978.77-1301,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.553,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 1301, Gannett Company against DePasquale."
1978.77-1301,0,38617,robert_c_bernius,,11.716,12.55,Thank Your Honor.
1978.77-1301,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,35.443,42.782,Do you place your argument principally on one amendment as against the other or on both?
1978.77-1301,0,38617,robert_c_bernius,,42.782,52.483,"Your Honor, I believe our argument is based first on the First Amendment, secondly on the public trial clause of the Sixth Amendment."
1978.77-1301,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,54.986,56.396,Which do you prefer?
1978.77-1301,0,38617,robert_c_bernius,,56.396,57.669,I prefer neither Your Honor.
1978.77-1301,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,121.755,125.081,"Incidentally Mr. Bernius, is there a transcript to what happened?"
1978.77-1301,0,38617,robert_c_bernius,,125.081,133.212,"Yes Your Honor at pages 4 through 6 of the appendix is the transcript of that ejection, a request --"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2175.36,2178.481,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2266.628,2289.117,You wouldn't -- you -- it would just be a timesaver is it -- or would it be anything other than saving your time if there was a hearing about why it was important to close the proceedings and why some other mechanisms wouldn't suffice?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2289.117,2297.843,"Well, the New York Court of Appeals has held that the press is certainly entitled to have their views known before the Court."
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2297.843,2300.235,"Well, that isn't what the trial judge did, is it?"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2300.235,2306.787,"Well, the situation that was presented to Judge DePasquale was that this motion was made."
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2319.542,2322.037,"Yes, but they made motions later."
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2322.037,2334.099,"Well, they did in fact make motions later and Judge DePasquale did in fact hold the hearing and listened to their arguments, so they did have the hearing."
1978.77-1301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.099,2336.745,Did he make -- what kind of determinations did he make?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2336.844,2337.062,Well --
1978.77-1301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.062,2338.064,"-- denied the motions, didn't he?"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2338.064,2338.53,"No, no."
1978.77-1301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2356.619,2356.87,And the --
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2356.87,2358.056,This was his finding.
1978.77-1301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2358.056,2361.423,And did he indicate that some other mechanisms wouldn't be sufficient?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2361.423,2373.099,"Well, the only reference to that is one of the defense lawyers in the transcript mentions change of venue that is the only alternative specifically mentioned in the appendix --"
1978.77-1301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.099,2379.412,What does the Court of Appeals think should happen in a normal case?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2379.412,2381.171,What?
1978.77-1301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.171,2385.569,Did they think something should happen in addition to what happened in the trial court?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2385.569,2394.567,"Well, they obviously mentioned the alternatives mentioned by this Court in Sheppard, in the opinion."
1978.77-1301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2422.114,2425.324,But the gun is already out?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2425.324,2435.246,"The gun and that's true and for that, we might well -- this isn't the only alternative available to a Court to deal with prejudicial publicity."
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2441.842,2448.578,"Yes, but the money -- must the exclusion however be the last alternative or --"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2448.578,2460.525,"Well, the difficulty with exclusion is the last alternative is that if you wait till the voir dire or if you wait till change of venue can be done, the hearing is already over."
1978.77-1301,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2576.812,2578.01,Was the body ever found?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2578.01,2581.177,"Never, never found."
1978.77-1301,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2597.653,2602.868,"But when you make that statement, are you basing it on what's in the appendix?"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2602.868,2606.269,I think we can accept that.
1978.77-1301,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2606.853,2617.726,"This is far different than in some of the other cases that had been decided here, isn't that -- it doesn't strike you as rather routine reporting, factual reporting?"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2617.726,2630.061,"Oh, Your Honor, I -- they might -- they claim it to be factual reports but as a defense attorney trying this case I mean you would not want to accept that as factual reports."
1978.77-1301,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2631.93,2637.749,"Well then, comparing that with the material in Murphy against Florida for instance?"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2637.749,2641.144,Alright.
1978.77-1301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2675.962,2678.207,Is Geneva this county (Inaudible) of Seneca County?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2678.207,2678.712,"No, no."
1978.77-1301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2690.235,2692.163,Where was this Court sitting In Seneca?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2692.163,2693.847,"Seneca County -- oh, it is --"
1978.77-1301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2693.847,2695.289,What town?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2695.289,2699.696,I believe Waterloo.
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2712.368,2715.21,"Well, are these statistics very important?"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2715.21,2715.735,"No, no."
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2754.132,2761.0,"Mr. Kobroff, can you identify what it was they wanted suppressed?"
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2761.0,2766.017,"Well, yes, I mean I know what it was because I've seen the transcript."
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2766.017,2768.241,But that is not in the record before us though.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2768.241,2773.349,"Well, they made a motion to suppress physical evidence."
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2781.312,2788.884,"Well, had there been any publication of what it was that the physical evidence was found in Michigan?"
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2788.884,2789.573,Right.
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2798.873,2803.947,"But you say the motion is suppressed also, was addressed to statements made to Michigan police?"
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2803.947,2806.731,"Oh yes, they had given statements and written confessions --"
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2806.731,2811.249,And there'd been no publication that they had made such statements?
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2811.249,2823.527,The publication dealt with the fact that New York police were -- they listed -- they gave one statement that Greathouse had made to the Michigan police when he was captured that was he was afraid he'd be shot --
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2823.527,2826.924,"I mean, to the extent that though this already had been published, why --"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2826.924,2831.592,"Well, the substance of the confessions has not been published."
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2831.592,2835.954,So is this down merely to the substance of the confessions?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2835.954,2836.752,"Well, no."
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2842.009,2853.246,I understood your friend to say that even though the newspaper reporter knew of it they had not published but it's just a matter of their own editorial judgment.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2853.246,2855.605,It would appear so.
1978.77-1301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2892.849,2895.749,But they also had published that he was on probation from San Antonio.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2895.749,2897.907,"Right, I would say that's not exactly a fact."
1978.77-1301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2897.907,2908.387,That the state police hoping to bring the pickup truck back and they're still looking for the 357 magnum revolver which was later found.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2908.387,2909.31,"Yes, I think he --"
1978.77-1301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2909.31,2911.713,That everything in there but the confession.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2911.713,2913.843,They had a lot of damaging evidence in there.
1978.77-1301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2913.843,2922.043,"Well, what did they have other than the confession they didn't have that they published here."
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2924.628,2925.563,Right.
1978.77-1301,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2927.508,2928.869,"That's the only thing then, isn't it?"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2928.869,2933.951,"Well, I think in this case, that's the difference perhaps between having a triable defense and --"
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2933.951,2941.041,"Well Mr. Kobroff, would you be defending this closure if everything that was a subject to the motion to suppress was already been published?"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2941.041,2945.299,"Yes, I think that they could still make their emotion."
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2945.299,2948.806,What justification would there been for the closure of everything that was --
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2948.806,2948.967,Well --
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2948.967,2950.587,-- subject to the motion to suppress and then (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2950.587,2953.437,I think that the defense counsel would certainly make the motion.
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2953.781,2955.746,I'm not talking about the defense counsel.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2960.993,2966.232,The same that it would threaten their right to get an impartial jury in that County.
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2978.106,2979.162,I don't suggest he is.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2982.775,2983.287,Well --
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2983.287,2984.413,-- of everything or a subject to motion or --
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2984.413,2985.449,That he might well not --
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2985.449,2986.277,-- even of public knowledge.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,2986.277,2987.198,He might well not.
1978.77-1301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3018.629,3047.414,"Counsel, in our position, is it solely the protection of the defendants' rights that is involved here, supposing the New York legislature passed the law saying that all trials, all criminal trials in the state shall be closed unless otherwise required by the constitution of the United State and both the defendant and the prosecutor agreed in this particular case that the trial should be closed."
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3051.997,3055.883,"Well, I would first of all say that I think that's a very unlikely situation."
1978.77-1301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3055.883,3061.614,"It's rather, it would be a rather strange statute but let's suppose it was enacted."
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3061.614,3069.302,"I think that if that -- if such a statute was ever enacted by the state legislature, it might well raise constitutional problems."
1978.77-1301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3069.302,3072.77,What sort of constitutional problems?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3072.77,3074.901,Public is the ultimate sovereign.
1978.77-1301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3075.041,3075.24,Well --
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3075.24,3077.172,-- has the right to know.
1978.77-1301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3077.172,3087.935,What about a rule of an appellate court or the rule of the Governor of New York that his cabinet meetings are going to be private or the rule of the President of the United States that his cabinet meetings are going to be private?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3087.935,3095.071,I think that's a -- I think that you have -- that's a little different I think than perhaps a public trial --
1978.77-1301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3095.071,3095.292,Well --
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3095.292,3097.289,-- by definition a public trial.
1978.77-1301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3097.289,3104.954,"Well, but why do you say by definition of public trial if the New York State legislature says, it's not going to be a public trial?"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3104.954,3112.479,"Well, no, I just meant that it -- in comparison to an executive closure of a cabinet meeting as compared to that difference."
1978.77-1301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.907,3116.072,"Yeah but if you're in trial, you're referring to the Sixth Amendment I take it."
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3116.072,3116.887,Yes.
1978.77-1301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3116.887,3121.189,I know but are you -- your argument is that it's the defendant's right?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3121.189,3122.402,Yes it is.
1978.77-1301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3140.966,3145.805,I was trying to find the Jelke case in the New York Court of Appeals.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3147.946,3150.64,"Yes, I believe I've cited it in my brief."
1978.77-1301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3150.64,3156.069,"You do, are you?"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3156.069,3157.477,Yes.
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3157.477,3158.458,Did the judge in this case --
1978.77-1301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3158.458,3160.28,(Voice Overlap) the citation features.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3160.28,3165.499,"It's 308 New York 56, 123 Northeast 2nd 769."
1978.77-1301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3165.499,3167.353,308 New York 56.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3167.353,3170.099,123 Northeast 2nd 769.
1978.77-1301,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3170.099,3170.115,Is that --
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3170.115,3175.492,Did the judge put any limitation on the prosecutor or others releasing statements about the confession or (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3175.492,3176.227,No.
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3179.325,3183.138,Does this record show how the media found out about the adjustments of the gun?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3183.138,3187.871,I believe it was certain of the statements.
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3187.871,3198.463,The motions made in open court which was -- were there references to the pistol in the motions in open court?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3198.463,3203.018,"No, I believe -- the papers were filed that would've have referred to the physical evidence."
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3203.018,3203.572,I see.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3203.572,3204.715,Those were filed though.
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3204.715,3207.084,But those are public records and they weren't sealed.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3207.084,3209.442,"No, they were not sealed."
1978.77-1301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3223.307,3236.338,Do you think the threat to the fair trial rights of the defendant are as great from admissible evidence being published ahead of time as inadmissible or not?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3236.338,3237.373,No.
1978.77-1301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3247.314,3252.683,"Well, I know but suppose you know in voir dire you asked the jury have your read about this case?"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3257.646,3258.011,I ask a few more questions --
1978.77-1301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3258.011,3259.994,-- shrug your shoulders or not?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3259.994,3260.73,"No, no."
1978.77-1301,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3266.48,3277.293,"Well, suppose one of them says, ""I read a verbatim transcript published in the paper of the suppression hearing which turned out that -- and the evidence was admissible""?"
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3277.293,3286.94,"Well, I don't think I have cause but I might not want them anyway."
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3286.94,3293.792,The -- do I understand correctly that the transcript of the suppression hearing is now available and is part of the public record?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3293.792,3294.545,"Yes, yes."
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3294.545,3296.82,But its not -- it was not sent here?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3296.82,3298.997,"Well, it wasn't part of -- this is a collateral proceeding --"
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3298.997,3299.707,Yes I know.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3299.707,3301.215,-- to the case.
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3301.215,3303.675,Collateral but perhaps of some interest.
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3303.675,3304.485,Yes.
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3308.821,3309.916,Could it be?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3309.916,3310.957,I suppose so.
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3347.473,3356.15,"How about the -- do you see any constitutional problems had -- what Judge DePasquale did say, ""Well, the press may stay and public may stay""."
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3363.782,3365.446,I don't think he could do that.
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3365.446,3365.524,You don't think he --
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3365.524,3369.549,I think Nebraska Press pretty well decided that issue.
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3378.229,3378.362,Would that (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3378.362,3381.747,-- cannot be prior -- cannot be a subject to a prior restraint.
1978.77-1301,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3386.477,3393.514,"Would that fall within what I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter said once the cat is out of the bag, it's impossible to get it back in again."
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3393.514,3399.466,That seems to be the rule.
1978.77-1301,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3399.466,3404.606,What was the judge's decision in this case on admissibility?
1978.77-1301,1,17785,bernard_kobroff,,3404.606,3409.928,"Certain confessions, certain statements were suppressed, the others were not."
