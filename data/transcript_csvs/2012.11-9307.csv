2012.11-9307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.92,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-9307, Henderson v. United States."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,7.804,11.891,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-9307,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,50.599,54.135,What -- what about the time they come up here?
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,57.087,58.003,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-9307,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,58.003,72.929,So suppose there's been -- been no objection to a uncertain question of -- on an uncertain question of law until the case gets here.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,88.558,97.997,I believe that the Court would have the authority to do that because it says if it is on direct appeal or not yet final.
2012.11-9307,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,105.583,112.256,I -- I wonder how we would go about deciding whether we would take such a case or not.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,137.455,151.631,"Well, I believe the Supreme Court has, under its own special rules, the -- the ability to take an argument in -- a petition that has not been raised before, but on its own could accept it if it is clear at the time--"
2012.11-9307,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,151.631,157.416,But then what your -- your first answer was that this is a very small set of cases that you're dealing with.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,173.045,175.145,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2012.11-9307,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.578,210.67,"Well, it would be narrow in the sense that substantial rights would have to be affected and the other conditions of Olano on that."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,232.683,233.983,"--Well, Your Honor, I think--"
2012.11-9307,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,233.983,244.974,"So at the end of the day, it could be a small subset of cases, but the number that would be presented, both to this Court and the court of appeals, would be quite substantial."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,244.974,248.759,"--Well, I think there would be very few that would come directly to the Supreme Court."
2012.11-9307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,277.278,285.634,"Well, this is a -- I mean, the time from the district court decision in this case to today is how long?"
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,285.634,290.622,"It's -- well, this case started in 2009."
2012.11-9307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,294.49,301.728,"So it's 2 years -- in any case in which -- in a typical case in which this happens, you've got 2 years of cases, right?"
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,301.728,306.132,"I think that my -- this case, Mr. Henderson's case, is unusually long."
2012.11-9307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,361.634,365.42,May I ask you what you think is the purpose of the Plain-Error Rule?
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,387.717,391.253,"Your Honor, it serves a very important purpose."
2012.11-9307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,418.721,421.173,But what purpose does it serve?
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,440.234,450.692,"--The purpose of -- of 52(b) is -- is a safety belt for the very extreme measures of Rule 51, which says if you -- if you fail to raise contemporaneously--"
2012.11-9307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,450.692,457.18,"Well, but I'm not asking why we have -- why we permit plain errors to be raised."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,474.391,474.774,--I absolutely would.
2012.11-9307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,475.741,476.057,All right.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,481.378,487.282,"The finding, the assessment of plain error; is that the question you're--"
2012.11-9307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,487.282,487.699,Yes.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,487.699,495.971,--I think that it very much helps to assess and evaluate the plainness of the error at the time of appeal.
2012.11-9307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,502.292,509.731,Does it serve -- does it serve judicial efficiency better to say that we apply the Plain-Error Rule at the time of trial or at the time of appeal?
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,509.731,532.061,"--I think that it serves judicial efficiency very much better, as amicus very well stated in his brief, the example of the Ninth Circuit, where, if you don't have plain error, and then the appellate court must go back to the trial level, the trial stage, and determine was this, was this clear at the time of trial?"
2012.11-9307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,535.263,554.843,"Well, if you apply it at the time of trial, it may eliminate the need for an appellate court, under some circumstances, to get to the ultimate question of whether there was error; or, it could say, there might have been error, but it wasn't -- it's not plain to us, I suppose."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,567.584,573.555,"--Well, I'm not sure that that would be a correct assessment."
2012.11-9307,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,590.683,611.68,"But when, as is the situation in this case, the law is uncertain at the time of trial, and there are some circuits that have gone one way, some circuits that have gone the other way, surely it greatly serves efficiency to bring that situation to the attention of the judge."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,693.417,698.238,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, multiple parts to that question."
2012.11-9307,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,737.51,739.962,But -- but there's -- this brings you back to Justice Alito's question.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,786.51,792.747,"--Well, we have the rules going back to the Atkinson case."
2012.11-9307,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,836.942,864.193,"I suppose one answer to Justice Scalia's question is that, well, if you require an objection, and you have to have a laundry list of everything that might change, the -- the answer to that, in turn, is, if -- if you use that rationale, then we're just asking the attorney to conceal from the judge every -- everything that's important."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,864.193,865.879,Well--
2012.11-9307,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,865.879,882.923,"It would seem to me the laundry list, even though that's perhaps an initial objection to Justice Scalia's concern, is, frankly, preferable to a system where we just don't -- don't talk about what might be clear error."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,882.923,885.808,"--Well, I think we must talk about clear error."
2012.11-9307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,919.946,925.5,Where in Johnson did they -- I'm looking at the two paragraphs the Court spent on this in Johnson.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,934.606,944.747,I think -- and -- and I would like to refer to Judge Owens' concurring and dissenting opinion in Escalante-Reyes in the Fifth Circuit.
2012.11-9307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,960.356,961.64,No.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,967.16,978.552,"--Well, I believe that what Justice Rehnquist looked to was the text of--"
2012.11-9307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,978.552,979.952,"He was the Chief Justice, by the way."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,979.952,980.304,--I'm sorry.
2012.11-9307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,982.687,984.122,It matters to one of us.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,984.772,987.038,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-9307,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.038,990.49,That's okay.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,993.309,1004.417,"And -- and I noticed in my record that I, in fact, had promoted Justice Clark in my brief, which the errata shows, and so I'm -- I'm not perfect."
2012.11-9307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1054.166,1061.772,I want to go back to Justice Alito's question for a moment because I thought -- and Justice Scalia.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1155.398,1156.317,Yes.
2012.11-9307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1156.317,1156.884,Okay.
2012.11-9307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1159.102,1160.169,Then let me ask you this question.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1190.838,1196.109,I think that the four prongs of Olano are the justification.
2012.11-9307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1197.311,1198.611,"No, I mean in real world terms."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1219.774,1221.926,"--Well, there -- there is no purpose for that."
2012.11-9307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1223.026,1225.811,Then why should it have to be plain at the time of appeal?
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1225.811,1230.782,--But the appellate court has the responsibilities of applying the law as it is current.
2012.11-9307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1277.679,1298.676,"You could promote efficiency at the appellate stage by having a rule like the rule that we have in qualified immunity cases, which gives a court the discretion to decide whether something was clear or go to the -- to the merits of the argument."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1321.458,1329.962,"--Well, the -- the reason would be similar to what Mr. Henderson faced in the three-judge panel."
2012.11-9307,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1370.239,1372.807,Was there a reason -- I think you represented your client at the trial.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1372.807,1373.674,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-9307,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1373.674,1378.378,Is there a reason why you didn't bring this up when the judge imposed that sentence?
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1394.471,1395.506,"I did not, Your Honor."
2012.11-9307,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1417.519,1419.455,Were you -- were you aware of the statute at the time?
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1419.455,1419.988,--I was not.
2012.11-9307,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1454.878,1465.917,"And let me ask you, I don't wish to sidetrack the discussion on the metaphysics of the Plain-Error Rule, because it's important and it's the -- part of the case, but in this case, there wasn't going to be a new trial."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1477.125,1490.718,"Your Honor, certainly Petitioner has not made that; but, there are so many law review articles out there right now on ways of changing plain-error review, it might--"
2012.11-9307,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1490.718,1493.336,Some circuits have even said that.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1493.336,1494.12,--Yes.
2012.11-9307,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1494.569,1507.946,"The Second Circuit says that if it's a sentencing error, that the amount of substantial rights and the integrity of fairness of the preceding question is a different balance."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1507.946,1509.029,--That is correct.
2012.11-9307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1509.029,1512.481,"So you can -- if you lose, you can't get through the door."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1528.927,1530.21,And the third.
2012.11-9307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1530.21,1534.745,"If what's at stake is a whole new trial and everything, it's probably a little bit harder to satisfy that prong."
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1541.648,1544.85,"It could -- it could be possible, and it could be--"
2012.11-9307,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1544.85,1545.619,Why -- why is that so?
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1563.714,1565.633,"--Well, I think that whenever -- and I--"
2012.11-9307,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1565.633,1568.199,You're -- you're here complaining about sentencing.
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1570.085,1571.703,--It is very substantial.
2012.11-9307,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1728.822,1731.857,How many months are left for the defendant's sentence?
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1731.857,1738.261,He is scheduled to be released in May of 2013.
2012.11-9307,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1743.414,1744.448,He didn't?
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1744.448,1750.402,"He did not, and it's unlikely he would have ever gotten it because of the fact that he had a gun charge."
2012.11-9307,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1773.018,1776.553,But the judge was not aware of those impediments?
2012.11-9307,0,37918,patricia_gilley,,1776.553,1782.206,"The judge was very well aware, and that was part of the problem that we had."
2012.11-9307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1815.845,1817.213,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1823.2,1825.7,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2012.11-9307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1827.902,1846.197,Was Justice Breyer essentially correct that in most of the cases where an error is not plain at the time of trial that the third and fourth prong of Olano almost always take care of the issue?
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1880.787,1881.787,--No.
2012.11-9307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1909.489,1923.28,"Well, I would say to you that that's more in keeping with the attitude that Justice Kennedy asked about, which is I think most circuit courts believe the fourth prong is more easily met in sentencing than in trial cases."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1926.934,1929.251,--The Second Circuit has adopted that rule.
2012.11-9307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1949.781,1950.549,But why?
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1970.261,1971.213,"--Oh, no question."
2012.11-9307,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2004.732,2008.136,"Mr. Wall, why doesn't that describe this case?"
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2033.084,2037.405,"Justice Ginsburg, I think it cuts actually exactly the opposite way."
2012.11-9307,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2062.771,2065.639,But he was not aware of the statute.
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2067.857,2068.357,No.
2012.11-9307,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2085.219,2087.136,"Well, what about the -- I mean, that's the question."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2192.005,2194.273,--And I'll see if I can get them all in.
2012.11-9307,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2211.819,2229.179,"But, Mr. Wall, your whole argument about judicial efficiency is an incentives argument, and it depends upon the notion that a lawyer is going to change their behavior, a lawyer is going to make an objection that he otherwise wouldn't have made if the rule that Ms. Gilley proposes is accepted."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2262.335,2264.954,"--Justice Kagan, it's not just about incentives."
2012.11-9307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2303.762,2309.482,I can -- I can also not imagine a lawyer who intentionally makes that decision.
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2346.322,2349.874,"The Government agrees with that, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-9307,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2349.874,2351.975,"Well, should the Government agree with that really?"
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2380.745,2389.684,"Justice Kagan, I'm not here saying that I think lawyers are sitting in -- in trial courts intentionally going through the kind of thought processes that you describe."
2012.11-9307,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2412.966,2414.483,Why -- why was it a Tapia claim?
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2434.713,2439.015,"So, Justice Ginsburg, I didn't mean by Tapia claim, depending on -- because this Court hadn't issued Tapia."
2012.11-9307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2455.21,2469.22,"Mr. Wall, why is this whole test, as you're proposing it, dependent on the smartness or not smartness of a particular circuit and the speed with which a particular circuit reaches an issue or doesn't?"
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2512.214,2513.998,Justice Sotomayor--
2012.11-9307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2513.998,2528.073,"And going back to what Justice Ginsburg said, we take cases where the split is 8 to 1, okay, or 8 to 0, because a particular circuit hasn't gotten to -- to an issue."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2542.249,2546.303,--It's -- it's not about rewarding or faulting district courts.
2012.11-9307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2560.812,2564.931,But why isn't the focus of the system on the nature of error?
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2564.931,2571.768,"--I think the focus of the system is on the contemporaneous objection requirement in Rule 51, which is what Rule 52 is designed to enforce."
2012.11-9307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2571.768,2574.054,But 52(b) is about not making the objection.
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2576.906,2582.81,"Well, only in the sense that what Rule 52(b) does is it says okay, you didn't object."
2012.11-9307,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2596.069,2596.469,"Whoa, whoa."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2596.469,2597.402,--because there's a governing precedent the other way.
2012.11-9307,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2597.402,2598.319,"Here, that's -- it's the second part."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2669.582,2675.67,"I think Johnson -- as the Chief Justice pointed out earlier, the analysis in Johnson, it's fairly brief."
2012.11-9307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.889,2690.531,"Well, more than that, Johnson stood on its head, did it not, not to decide the case the easy way, which was simply to say if it's clear on appeal, the rule applies."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2714.73,2720.05,"Well, in danger of running afoul of Justice Kagan, I'm going to agree again."
2012.11-9307,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2726.72,2728.754,"Well, the Government had a different argument before."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2749.284,2753.855,"And this Court disagreed, but studiously avoided placing its decision on the text--"
2012.11-9307,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2753.855,2754.505,This Court did not disagree.
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2778.237,2791.128,"--Justice Kagan, there is no question that in the briefs and in argument, the Government in Johnson asked this Court not to draw a futility exception to Rule 52 for cases in which an objection would have been pointless at trial in light of governing precedent, and the Court disagreed with us on that."
2012.11-9307,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2838.358,2846.53,"Yes, but the -- the -- well, this -- I mean, the trouble is you've run into, like, four different interpretations of what Johnson really means."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2903.283,2903.616,Justice Breyer--
2012.11-9307,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2903.616,2903.999,--sometimes.
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2903.999,2911.603,"--there is no question that that concern animated this Court's decision -- retroactivity decision in Griffith, and there is no question that that is one of the concerns underneath the rule."
2012.11-9307,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2912.989,2913.305,"No, it's not."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2913.305,2914.622,--The rule wouldn't say plain.
2012.11-9307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2915.841,2916.507,Absolutely.
2012.11-9307,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2923.678,2924.045,Yes.
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2983.382,2991.119,--So I -- I want to suggest that the administerability problem is very small because it has not been difficult for the lower courts to apply this test.
2012.11-9307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3041.302,3050.342,"Counsel, I -- it strikes me that we are having a very usual discussion in that we are competing policy considerations that have been raised."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3075.059,3076.859,I -- not in general--
2012.11-9307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3076.859,3085.748,"I mean, it highlight -- it -- just to take a moment -- it was highlighted for me in your brief when you said, Well, Johnson, there was a special circumstance, so they read this rule, then, this way."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3092.854,3093.404,--No.
2012.11-9307,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3105.494,3107.53,And what about what the rules -- what the rules advisory committee?
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3174.823,3179.727,"Well, I -- but Wiborg falls squarely within what we all believe is the core of the rule."
2012.11-9307,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3228.475,3242.133,"What about Mr. Henderson sitting in prison, serving a sentence that we now know was imposed for a reason that is not permitted under Federal sentencing law?"
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3260.012,3268.2,"--I think he could certainly raise that claim in habeas and attempt to -- to get relief, but I don't think there is any relief for him under Rule 52."
2012.11-9307,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3269.3,3276.104,"And is there any relief for him in the -- in the regulations of Bureau of Prisons or the Government -- other than a pardon, I suppose, of defendants?"
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3276.104,3279.906,"--Well, he -- he been a -- not specifically aimed at this, Justice Kennedy."
2012.11-9307,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3284.293,3284.993,Eligible for?
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3284.993,3290.53,--For the -- the -- for the residential drug abuse treatment program that the district court wanted him to participate in.
2012.11-9307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3292.066,3299.053,"Counsel, I guess, I -- I continue to be confused about what makes error plain or clear."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3336.178,3337.778,"--I -- not invariably, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-9307,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3381.374,3384.992,"Mr. Wall, can -- can I ask you about footnote 4 of your brief?"
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3416.13,3434.008,"We are leaving open, if the Court says that there is an actual innocence exception in habeas to procedural default rules, that whatever it covers, acts that are no longer criminal, sentences beyond the statutory maximum, that whatever that exception covers, we leave open the possibility that you could also get relief for that under Rule 52."
2012.11-9307,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3438.46,3443.38,Because then that creates yet another complication in this interpretation of Rule 52.
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3468.23,3473.049,"Justice Kagan, I think far stranger than letting the Johnson tail wag the plain-error dog would be letting the--"
2012.11-9307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3473.049,3474.416,I agree that that was a bad footnote.
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3478.037,3480.287,"--Now, I'm going to go the other way."
2012.11-9307,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3480.287,3490.845,"But -- an honest footnote, an honest footnote in that you're saying there is this other category of cases that's lurking out there, and that category seems as though we should have the Johnson rule."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3490.845,3494.73,"But actual innocence isn't the tail, it's like the nub or the tip of the tail."
2012.11-9307,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3502.653,3503.519,But now we have two tails.
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3508.057,3509.573,"One tail, one nub."
2012.11-9307,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3523.149,3529.136,"Then what harm does it do, in the interest of simplicity, in reading a word to mean what it says?"
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3565.409,3566.076,--Justice Breyer--
2012.11-9307,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3566.076,3566.928,The words mean what they say.
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3566.928,3567.461,--I agree.
2012.11-9307,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3568.228,3568.995,"Well, if you agree, then--"
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3568.995,3569.38,--No.
2012.11-9307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3582.605,3583.738,I don't understand how you get that from the rule.
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3591.544,3591.844,--That's right.
2012.11-9307,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3605.57,3607.755,--That is Mr. Dreeben's excellent argument.
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3612.057,3625.634,"Again, Justice Breyer, Johnson did nothing, either as a matter of its holding or its rationale, to say what the rule requires more generally in cases like this one, where a contemporaneous objection could have been quote helpful to the district court."
2012.11-9307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3625.634,3632.538,"I joined Johnson, and maybe I have to repudiate it if it leads -- leads to that conclusion."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3632.538,3635.572,"Justice Scalia, you did not join the relevant portion of Johnson."
2012.11-9307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3635.572,3636.122,"Oh, I didn't?"
2012.11-9307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3638.357,3640.523,Counsel--
2012.11-9307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3640.523,3641.392,It didn't sound like me.
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3645.927,3648.046,It's fully open to you to agree with the Government here.
2012.11-9307,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3648.046,3656.069,"Mr. Wall, your time is up, but we have a rule -- the Supreme Court has a rule -- and I would like to know how the Government reads it."
2012.11-9307,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3682.636,3690.14,I don't think there's anything about the text or history or the way that rule has been used that suggests it should be interpreted differently from Rule 52.
2012.11-9307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3690.14,3691.806,"--Thank you, counsel."
