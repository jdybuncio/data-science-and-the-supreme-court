1974.74-107,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.118,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 74-107, Preiser against Newkirk."
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,11.296,14.498,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-107,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,413.366,417.878,"Mr. Hoffman, am I right in thinking that this was not a class action?"
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,417.878,422.312,"That is correct, Your Honor it was not."
1974.74-107,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,490.184,494.414,What was the date of the district judge's decision?
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,494.414,502.024,His decision and judgment were handed down in October of 1973.
1974.74-107,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,502.024,507.939,But he had -- he didn't have benefit of course of Wolff against McDonnell.
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,507.939,513.953,That's correct.
1974.74-107,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,713.68,718.272,And maybe they might not want the hearing?
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,718.272,719.929,That may be true Your Honor.
1974.74-107,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,719.929,721.702,You'd only give the hearing if they asked for it.
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,721.702,732.932,Yes but I think many inmates faced with the transfer to a facility that they might not wish to go to would probably request the hearing if they could get one.
1974.74-107,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.178,896.446,Is there such a thing as the disciplinary transfer?
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,896.446,898.531,"In New York, we try to avoid them."
1974.74-107,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,899.562,902.202,Is there such a thing?
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,902.202,911.157,Technically speaking there could be such a thing because our disciplinary rules do provide for a program change as one of the consequences of act of misconduct.
1974.74-107,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,911.157,914.609,Let's assume you have one of those.
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,914.609,925.134,"If we had one of those, I believe that the inmates' remedy would be to complain to the superintendent and complain to the Corrections Commissioner that he should've been given hearing under our rules."
1974.74-107,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,928.785,932.438,Is there any way to find out whether you do have them or not?
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,934.578,938.063,"Well, we keep records on the movement of inmates and usually the --"
1974.74-107,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,938.063,941.426,The records on why they're moved?
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,941.426,956.316,"Normally, the transfer order itself will merely state administrative reasons separation from enemies it's usually a one line statement and these are very common and as in this case they don't have disciplinary consequences."
1974.74-107,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,956.316,958.163,Are they available?
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,958.163,966.369,They're not available to the inmate but they could be available in a court proceeding if the court directed that they be produced as a matter of discovery.
1974.74-107,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,966.369,982.825,"Well, if the inmate commits some punishable act at which he stayed in the same prison he might suffer some loss of privileges or he might be put in solitary confinement or he might lose good times something like that."
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1001.206,1010.878,"No, because we don't believe that there's no punishment intended and we don't believe that the loss is sufficiently grievous."
1974.74-107,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1010.878,1020.18,Why would you say there's ever a disciplinary transfer even if the Commission of some punishable act is the thing that should use the transfer?
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1022.734,1024.494,"Well, I think there would be in New York."
1974.74-107,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1040.558,1040.682,Oh!
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1046.933,1058.295,"Well, it's disciplinary in the sense that it's a response to a violation of the rules and it would be entered in this record and there would be a packet of papers in his record which would indicate that he was brought up on charges."
1974.74-107,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1067.679,1076.169,"Well, then I take it that in any -- that there will never be a due process problem arise in the disciplinary transfer because he will have had his hearing?"
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1076.169,1083.895,"Yes, if he's brought up on charges if he has committed a rule violation or policy is that he should get a hearing under our disciplinary rules."
1974.74-107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1092.409,1110.887,"That's a little bit backward reasoning is that what you -- you said that if it's disciplinary he does get a hearing but what if he claims its disciplinary and you say well, it is just administrative that's the problem."
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1110.887,1112.366,"Yes, it is a problem but we feel --"
1974.74-107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1112.366,1114.329,"That is the problem here, isn't it?"
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1114.329,1120.872,It is a problem but we feel that this is an area where the balance should be struck in favor of the state rather than the inmate.
1974.74-107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1141.405,1147.928,"No, on the other hand or as the mere fact that you denied that he is being punished mean that he is not being punished."
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1147.928,1149.139,That's correct.
1974.74-107,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1164.529,1167.71,In this case all it took was a telephone call?
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1167.71,1171.744,It was a telephone call followed by formal paperwork that went --
1974.74-107,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1171.744,1176.631,But I mean the decision was made is just a result to telephone call I won't get these guys out of here.
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1176.631,1177.929,Yes it was deemed an emergency.
1974.74-107,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1177.929,1179.419,That's all he was too it.
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1179.419,1182.605,It was deemed an emergency situation but the Department in Albany determined --
1974.74-107,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1182.605,1184.415,"Well, who determines it was an emergency?"
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1185.232,1187.064,"The warden did, yes."
1974.74-107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1196.977,1200.714,How many institutions are there -- penal institutions are there in your state?
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1200.714,1207.286,We have a total of 24 and we have 5 maximum security prisons.
1974.74-107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1207.286,1208.598,Auburn and Clinton and --
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1208.598,1212.439,"Auburn and Clinton, Attica, Green Haven and Great Meadow are the maximum security."
1974.74-107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1212.439,1213.052,Maximum?
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1213.052,1213.692,Yes.
1974.74-107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1213.692,1216.137,And the 24 and they are all of the state.
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1216.137,1216.496,All of that state.
1974.74-107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1216.496,1217.778,-- every area of the state?
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1217.778,1219.162,"Yes, that's correct."
1974.74-107,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.162,1224.151,Then I take it there are an additional up in municipal and county?
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1224.151,1225.924,"Well, those we have no jurisdiction over those."
1974.74-107,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1225.924,1229.52,"Nevertheless, there are in New York State in addition of the states that you mentioned."
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1229.52,1229.744,Oh!
1974.74-107,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1239.335,1240.433,Those are short term?
1974.74-107,0,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1240.433,1240.783,Short term institutions.
1974.74-107,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1240.783,1242.341,Are they not?
1974.74-107,1,27228,houston_bus_hill,,1242.341,1249.213,We take felony prisoners and we also take detainees from New York City under a special contract with the city.
1974.74-107,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.685,1262.622,"Mr. Hoffman, could he had been sent to Clinton on the first place?"
1974.74-107,2,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1262.622,1267.04,"Certainly, he could've been sent there by the classification or the reception."
1974.74-107,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1267.04,1269.846,That he been sent there we wouldn't have a lawsuit I suppose?
1974.74-107,2,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1269.846,1288.313,That's correct and that's one of the things that we're afraid of that ones you established the principle that if a man's custody level is changed or if it is an institution that farther from the place of the conviction then we feel that inmates who were coming in the classification process will also request the same due process hearing.
1974.74-107,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1288.313,1293.939,"Well, we got a process about an issue that may not need at all that in his jurisdiction."
1974.74-107,2,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1293.939,1299.976,"Yes, as an alternative grounds we raise them to District Court and the Court of Appeals the issue of mootness."
1974.74-107,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1299.976,1302.711,But why is it was primary?
1974.74-107,2,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1305.265,1317.202,"Well, having loss on this issue twice in the lower courts I felt that we had to brief the merits as well as the mootness question but I think this is clearly an example of the moot case."
1974.74-107,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1341.989,1349.724,But it is in the words of the many opinions capable of repetition as to this particular respondent?
1974.74-107,2,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1349.724,1352.905,"Yes, it is capable of repetition, yes if --"
1974.74-107,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1352.905,1360.627,(Inaudible).
1974.74-107,2,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1360.627,1372.435,"No, not necessarily but I think one has the way the likelihood that the conduct occur again in our view we felt it was not very likely that Mr. Newkirk was going to be transferred in the near future."
1974.74-107,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1372.435,1374.57,Was there any injunction entered here?
1974.74-107,2,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1374.57,1374.901,No.
1974.74-107,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1374.901,1375.679,Just the declaratory judgment?
1974.74-107,2,27276,hillel_hoffman,,1375.679,1381.316,"Yes, yes and the district judge felt that there was not a sufficient basis to grant an injunction."
1974.74-107,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1394.216,1399.524,Mr. Pochoda.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1399.524,1404.572,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1442.828,1444.32,What was the first factor?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1444.32,1455.677,The first factor is the change from a medium to a maximum security institution thereby resulting in a major change and a loss of interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.957,1465.125,How do you define minimal?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1465.125,1466.301,"In matter of procedure, Your Honor?"
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.301,1467.385,Yes.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1467.385,1480.596,"Well, though we have not appealed from the Second Circuit is granting a minimal due process which in this case was only notice of the pending allegations against from Mr. Newkirk and an opportunity to respond."
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1492.849,1496.997,It was notice and opportunity to respond to allow the personal hearing?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1496.997,1497.86,"No, with the personal hearing."
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1497.86,1498.798,For the personal hearing?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1498.798,1500.003,Yes.
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.003,1501.153,Confrontation?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1501.153,1501.771,Yes.
1974.74-107,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1511.422,1526.353,"When you said a moment ago loss of interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment in connection with the transfer from Wallkill to Clinton, what are those interests?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1526.353,1532.01,The most direct deprivation suffered by Mr. Newkirk was a loss of his liberty interest.
1974.74-107,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1548.791,1551.011,It was more closely confined in Clinton.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1551.011,1563.413,"Yes, in fact, the object I mean the object of Wallkill itself is defined by New York State is to provide relief fund the regimentation and restrictions found in maximum security institutions."
1974.74-107,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1601.458,1616.235,Any interest or I'm thinking of the subsequent Second Circuit case which apparently held that even in a transfer from institutions of comparable security there was a hearing required.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1616.235,1622.756,"Yes, that case of Hames versus Montana which is presently pending before this Court was cert."
1974.74-107,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1681.728,1693.435,You don't claim then if someone is transferred from Wallkill to a comparable place near Buffalo he suffered a grievous loss because he's closer to Buffalo than he is to New York?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1693.435,1698.102,No we feel that the major loss here is due to the differences in the institutions.
1974.74-107,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.102,1708.445,"Well, I know that's the major loss but do you claim that there's any protected interest by virtue of the fact that you're transferred 400 miles away?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1708.445,1716.258,"Well, it's hard to make that judgment without having the record before us and might in fact that a result of that transfer there are certain interest that would be affected."
1974.74-107,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1721.133,1722.15,Like what?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1722.15,1727.608,"Well, then maybe that the transfer -- well, you're saying only because of the distance involved and no difference in the institutions?"
1974.74-107,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1727.608,1727.937,Yes.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1727.937,1729.209,I would say probably no.
1974.74-107,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1778.008,1783.016,"Well, do you agree with Mr. Hoffman that he could've been assigned at Clinton in the first place?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1783.016,1783.15,Oh!
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.627,1790.588,Wouldn't be here had that happened?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1790.588,1795.617,We would not be here if he had remained at the maximum security institution throughout his incarceration.
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.617,1800.454,"So, you're not complaining about a classification initially?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1800.454,1801.564,No.
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.318,1827.877,(Voice Overlap) place there a right close from that even though it might have been erroneous assignment administratively?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1827.877,1850.236,"Yes we feel it's analogous for example to place a man on parole that even if the person is erroneously granted parole and even though the state does not have to setup a parole system, once placed in that institution assuming this Court finds that there is an interest that there is a loss of Fourteenth Amendment interest in terms of a change from that type of institution to a maximum security institution."
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.059,1874.396,Do you want -- do you think that inmates are entitled to participate in all reclassification decisions as long as the decision may increase the severity of confinement whether there disciplinary or not if they just decide -- well this man hasn't getting along quite as well here?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1874.567,1876.793,Your Honor -- excuse me.
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1876.793,1883.045,We think he would progress better in another type of institution.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1883.045,1913.677,"Yes, the problem is with the use of the words “disciplinary and administrative” I mean most of the trial courts when confronting this question when confronted with the similar situation have stated that a transfer is in fact disciplinary when it involves a closer custody, when it involves this type of change, when it involves punishment in fact because it is clear that the difference in life at Clinton as oppose to Wallkill involves a severe deprivation and punishment to the inmate."
1974.74-107,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.708,1974.49,What if Wallkill becomes overcrowded and Clinton is under used so that there's an administrative matter some people have got to be chosen to go from Wallkill to Clinton?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,1979.441,1980.519,"No, Your Honor."
1974.74-107,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1998.979,2008.013,Even though in my hypothesis certainly the man is subjected to sort of constraints that you say amount to a restriction on his liberty?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2008.013,2025.966,That's right Your Honor and we say that even when that loss is present in terms of a procedural Due Process right it would not exist because it would be meaningless that the court specifically stated both of the lower courts stated that unless that the transfer is based on some evaluation about the individual himself.
1974.74-107,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2034.26,2042.754,Let me alter Mr. Justice Rehnquist's hypothetical case just to trifle perhaps not to trifle.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2098.454,2103.079,"Well, to the extent that the decision involves conclusions about individuals."
1974.74-107,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2134.046,2136.546,May I ask a question before you move on?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2141.203,2144.053,It was a manslaughter offense.
1974.74-107,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2144.053,2147.132,And what was his sentence?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2147.132,2149.057,I think 20 until life.
1974.74-107,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2149.057,2151.313,20 until life?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2154.339,2156.761,"In 1962, yes."
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.761,2174.48,"Suppose he have been transferred from Sing Sing to Clinton and he had felt that Sing Sing was more congenial and he really didn't want to go to Clinton, would that entitle him to a due process hearing?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2174.48,2175.238,"No, it wouldn't Your Honor."
1974.74-107,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2235.247,2252.974,Is it your position basically that whenever there is a transfer to a more favorable level of institution that some sort of vested right accrues and that cannot be denied without a hearing?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2252.974,2255.03,"Yes -- well, it would depend."
1974.74-107,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2261.737,2272.568,Three levels of security institution is basically and I'm thinking in terms of a transfer to one that would be regarded is more favorable less security?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2272.568,2276.224,I see in terms of the gradation setup by the State of New York itself.
1974.74-107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2385.808,2392.546,"Mr. Pochoda, in answer to a question a moment ago from my brother Powell."
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2471.004,2471.565,"No, Your Honor."
1974.74-107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2471.589,2474.339,"Well, I think then you made a mistake in answer to my brother Powell?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2474.339,2475.964,I didn't realize at hand indicating that.
1974.74-107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2479.89,2481.034,"And only that, isn't it?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2484.194,2487.006,"Well, we feel that that it might well be argued that Mr. Newkirk had in fact --"
1974.74-107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2487.006,2489.199,"Well, it might be argued but what is your argument?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2489.199,2491.607,We would also argue that there was a property interest involved.
1974.74-107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2491.607,2493.607,"Now, what property interest?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2493.607,2503.216,That he had by meeting the criteria for placement at Wallkill and successfully being placed at Wallkill because of maintaining a good record a maximum security institutions.
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.775,2518.556,"Well, they do required vested interest --"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2518.556,2519.46,Yes.
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.46,2526.203,-- then you answered correctly even under your theory to Mr. Justice Powell and I was mistaken about your theory?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2526.203,2553.231,"I see, we believe that both interests were an inmate would be deprive to both interest by a move from Wallkill to maximum security institution that the liberty interest is more direct in terms of looking at the differences between Wallkill and Clinton but that it also acquired a state created benefit that he had reasonable expectation of maintaining that benefit until he's released from prison because that is the usual procedures that Wallkill that prison stayed there until release and very few people are transferred back."
1974.74-107,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2553.231,2568.004,"Well, the transfer from Wallkill to Clinton because of overcrowding that I asked you about earlier would I would think deprive him of that property interest if he has one."
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2568.004,2588.894,"Your Honor, we believe that in fact the transfer because of overcrowding would deprive him of a liberty and the property interest but that the due process would procedural due process would not be applicable to any situation where the deprivation was based on conclusions that had nothing to do about the inmate that it would be meaningless."
1974.74-107,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2601.066,2611.082,"Well, but why couldn't the inmates say, “Look, if you got to transfer 300 people out of the thousand there at Wallkill it shouldn't be me because I done so well here.”"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2611.082,2627.243,But I believe that the inmate might well but that would be sustentative for equal protection argument and this case we are concerned only the procedural due process in this case and the court below was only concerned and of course the record in the briefs is only concerned procedural due process.
1974.74-107,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2627.243,2641.21,"But the selection for transfer involves a value judgment that prisoners A, B, and C are going to be moved but D, E, and F are not going to moved."
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2647.994,2651.109,"Your Honor, we're not trying to take that judgment away from the warden."
1974.74-107,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2686.72,2703.519,"Well, may I sort out your answer and read it in light of the way I read the District Court's opinion and the Court of Appeals this means that potentially every one of these 500 transferees would be entitled to a hearing."
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2716.285,2719.926,If there was a need to transfer 500 prisoners?
1974.74-107,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2719.926,2721.51,"Yes, if he wanted a hearing."
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2721.51,2743.134,"Well, we would and we feel that it would necessarily that if was only on budgetary that there might be as I responded to Mr. Justice Rehnquist a separate question about a rational plan, a separate question of substantive due process question or an equal protection concern but that unless there was some finding about the individual that was involved."
1974.74-107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2744.814,2766.478,"In other words, if a sort of amount by saying that 300 people here who have been here the shortest time will be the ones or the three people here or 300 people who have been here the longest time or if we say we're going to take every tenth just at random, are none of those selections would you claim any right to a hearing, is that it?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2766.478,2767.227,That is right.
1974.74-107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2767.227,2785.716,But if on the other hand they said the following 300 people are going to be the ones to be transferred for budgetary reasons or capacity reasons because we think those of the 300 after evaluating all of our population.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2798.65,2808.87,"Yes -- no, the inmate I don't believe would be able to judge himself or compare himself to the other 399 other people but to the extent that it is based on some evaluation --"
1974.74-107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2808.87,2813.979,Which he found that he had pejoratively found against him.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2813.979,2815.68,Yes.
1974.74-107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2815.68,2829.794,"That he had -- was in the group that had at least potential for benefit of that institution and therefore he was going to be in that group that was transferred to the greater security institution would he then, have a right to a due process hearing?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2831.428,2835.445,"Yes, Your Honor and I think if the record in this case demonstrates why it is necessary."
1974.74-107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2878.618,2884.793,"Well, so are the random selectee suffer the same loss and yet you're not even claiming that he's entitled to due process."
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2884.793,2885.975,"Well, that's because --"
1974.74-107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2885.975,2886.663,And why?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2886.663,2888.694,Because procedural due process would not be relevant.
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2890.366,2894.523,"Well, what if they transfer just to look down to persons?"
1974.74-107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2894.523,2895.227,Yes.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2895.227,2902.43,"Again, we think that might well be a violation of substantive due process or an invidious discrimination based on the Equal Protection Clause."
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2902.43,2908.649,"Mr. Pochoda, have you ever been at – well I don't know whether you have ever been at the Federal Institution at Springfield, Missouri?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2908.649,2909.306,I haven't.
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2909.306,2915.246,But there and I suppose this is characteristics of some state institutions.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2940.435,2941.304,"Yes, I believe that might --"
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.304,2943.534,I'm not speaking of the whole something like this.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,2943.534,2951.013,I can't say with certainty Your Honor but I believe that that might well be the type of change that would affect liberty interest.
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3005.001,3028.748,"Lets suppose a prisoner violates the prison rules several times and then each occasion he's disciplined, he's given a hearing and he's some kind of discipline is imposed, he's loss good time or he spent some days in solitary or something."
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,3054.853,3055.77,"Yes, we would think that."
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3058.424,3061.348,"Well, what would he contribute, what would be the purpose of such a hearing?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,3061.348,3084.137,"Well, I was going to say that the requirements have been met in that case that the only transfer only concerns conduct that already has been after a due process hearing been found to in fact occurred and that it wouldn't have to if it focus the institution has a rule for example that six violations will lead to transfer."
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3108.078,3118.574,"Well, you don't really -- you aren't really urging your entitlement to a hearing in order to participate in the judgment of the administrator as to where he belongs?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,3118.574,3120.227,"No, we are not attempting to take that --"
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3120.227,3123.549,I just want to make sure he's operating on accurate facts.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,3123.549,3124.08,Exactly.
1974.74-107,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3157.507,3163.884,It seems to me when you answered Mr. Justice White you added another factor the complaint being critical.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,3209.644,3223.911,"No, I just used that as hypothetical in terms of the rule but again if all of the factors of that concerned the conduct that the inmate are already -- have already been the subject of procedural due process hearing another one is not necessary."
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3237.003,3240.942,Will you state -- I know we have to do it briefly your position on mootness.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,3240.942,3259.848,"Yes, we feel that in fact what has occurred in this case is at best a temporary voluntary secession that in fact it's a weaker case then others where the Court has ruled that a voluntary secession is not enough because petition has maintained their policy of this type of transfer."
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3281.93,3291.157,If Mr. Newkirk in any other is he in any different position in this respect from other prisoners?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,3291.157,3293.923,"Well, we believe he is because of the --"
1974.74-107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3293.923,3295.821,Threatened in anyway?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,3295.821,3301.476,"Well, we believe he is into the extent that he has already experienced this conduct."
1974.74-107,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3326.399,3332.786,When you say he is refraining from certain conduct which he might otherwise do because of this risks on his experience?
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,3335.234,3350.771,"Well, the same type of conduct that led to his initial transfer which his perfectly legal and proper conduct in terms of and being above and petitions which the petitioners themselves state are legal and it's only because of reactions of others that they decided to transfer five people in this case."
1974.74-107,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3370.491,3377.037,"Of course, I can say that you're speculating on what he is doing about in terms of his behavior?"
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,3377.037,3387.734,"Well, except that the policy depend -- does not depend on Mr. Newkirk given their transfer policy of the people can be transferred for any reason without any justifications offered."
1974.74-107,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3421.002,3423.24,That was a little puzzle by one of your responses.
1974.74-107,3,21353,daniel_pochoda,,3447.127,3453.586,"In the first place, I meant to say that it would be all right in terms of -- there would not be a necessity for procedural due process."
1974.74-107,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3508.629,3510.237,Very well.
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3511.717,3512.01,Yes.
1974.74-107,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3537.522,3540.011,Is that meant when he went to Clinton?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3540.011,3543.461,"When at the receiving, yes, at that the receiving institution."
1974.74-107,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3543.461,3544.855,Special housing would be --
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3544.855,3546.761,Would be the segregation unit.
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3558.894,3561.685,You just say he isn't in the cell all by himself?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3561.685,3563.323,"Well, there may be other inmates who were --"
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3563.323,3564.62,That's not segregation?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3564.62,3570.323,"No, because he's in with the rest of the prison population and there may be other incoming inmates on that gallery."
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3570.323,3572.85,"Well, all the other inmates in separate cell?"
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3572.85,3575.827,Each inmate is in his own cell and when he was on a reception --
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3575.827,3577.991,But how long is he there for a day?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3580.194,3584.706,"It depends, I think in this case the testimony it was there for approximately a month."
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3587.407,3589.631,What is it in the solitary take confinement?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3589.631,3595.645,"Well, in solitary confinement, he's completely removed from the population and there maybe no one else in the solitary confinement."
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3595.645,3598.804,"Well, isn't he completely removed for 23 hours a day?"
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3598.804,3603.121,"No, because there's a great deal of activity on these galleries and there were people would pass by the cell."
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3603.121,3605.603,But you say he's in the cell by himself?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3605.603,3606.765,"Yes, but he's not --"
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3606.765,3610.061,"Well, if by himself, he is in isolation?"
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3610.061,3614.392,"Well, a New York State inmate is always in the cell by himself."
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3614.646,3615.694,23 hours a day?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3615.694,3625.98,"No, not 23 hours a day but inmates are always confined in single cells in New York when he's in the reception status there are other inmates on the gallery and there were officers and guards and --"
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3625.98,3629.515,"Well, were they in separate cells in Wallkill?"
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3630.765,3632.554,"No, at Wallkill they didn't have cells."
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3632.586,3633.429,That's right I know.
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3633.429,3634.81,Yes.
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3634.81,3636.243,"So, it was different?"
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3636.243,3637.306,"Yes, it was different."
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3637.306,3639.64,But one month at least it was different?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3639.64,3644.497,"Yes, but he was treated in the same way that any incoming inmate would've been treated the same."
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3644.497,3646.821,Do they have solitary in Wallkill?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3646.821,3648.325,"No, they don't."
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3648.325,3649.889,They have isolation there?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3649.889,3655.841,They have a hospital unit where an emergency they can put someone for a day or two but they don't have a solitary confinement.
1974.74-107,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3655.841,3662.135,"So, if you do something at Wallkill that deserves isolation, the only way to do it, is transfer him to Clinton, is that right?"
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3662.135,3663.496,In many situations.
1974.74-107,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3793.861,3804.405,Under the prison rules or do the prison rules expressly say that for certain kinds of conduct a transfer is inappropriate sanction?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3804.405,3817.385,"No, they don't as a matter of fact the Court of Appeals struck out that requirement in the District Court's order because the Court of Appeals believed that it would be impossible to specify all of these situations that might lead to a transfer."
1974.74-107,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3817.385,3824.085,"Well, Justice White's question was about the prison rule it's not about the District Court judgment."
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3824.085,3825.653,"No, there's nothing in the prison rules."
1974.74-107,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3825.653,3826.855,Were there or was there ever?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3826.855,3828.252,"No, there was none."
1974.74-107,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3828.252,3834.191,But you didn't have prison rules as to defining what kind of sanctions would be imposed for certain kinds of conduct?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3834.191,3849.558,We have departmental regulations which list we have adjustment committee hearings and we have formal disciplinary hearings and they listed these positions that an inmate can receive as a result of those hearings.
1974.74-107,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3849.558,3861.31,"Well, does that suggest that transfer is not a type of punishment under the rules?"
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3861.31,3870.678,"Well, the rules do provide for a program change that could be interpreted as a transfer but the department's policy is not to use transfers as --"
1974.74-107,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3870.678,3871.896,But you told me that before.
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3871.896,3871.908,Yes.
1974.74-107,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3871.908,3889.476,"But again, the rules purport to say if you would engage in certain of kind of conduct here's what might happen to you and the rules don't say that a transfer is imposed for engaging in those kinds of conduct."
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3889.476,3890.298,That is correct.
1974.74-107,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3892.785,3901.336,"For once, I am still surprise you don't just say that there isn't any such thing as disciplinary transfer prisons in New York."
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3901.336,3901.525,"Well, we did --"
1974.74-107,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3901.525,3904.922,About these transfers they just are not for discipline.
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3904.922,3909.908,We did say that but the Court of Appeals very flatly rejected that assertion.
1974.74-107,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3909.908,3915.371,"Well, I thought you while ago said, “Yes, there are disciplinary transfers.”"
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3915.371,3915.519,No.
1974.74-107,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3915.519,3917.966,I'm trying to get away from them but you said there are some.
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3917.966,3929.058,"No, I said it was conceivable that if you interpret a program change is a transfer to another institution, there could be one but in that case, the man would have to be given formal notice of charges."
1974.74-107,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3937.539,3938.298,"Mr. Hoffman, --"
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3938.298,3939.427,Yes.
1974.74-107,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3939.427,3947.48,-- in New York when a judge sentenced a convicted person does he designate the prison to which he shall be sent?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3947.48,3957.051,"No, he is -- unless, it's a special case for example a juvenile offend or where he might go to reformatory but other than that he's merely remanded to the Department of Corrections."
1974.74-107,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3957.051,3961.268,And the Department of Corrections makes a judgment as to where he should be confined?
1974.74-107,4,27276,hillel_hoffman,,3961.268,3962.33,That is correct.
1974.74-107,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3998.904,3999.682,Thank you gentlemen.
