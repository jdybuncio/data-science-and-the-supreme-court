1982.81-1590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.071,We will hear arguments first this morning in Bolger against Youngs Drug Products Corporation.
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,16.882,25.799,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.81-1590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,342.03,360.272,"Of course, in the real world, I suppose that when you are asking for what is basically consent to receive junk mail, most people would say, no, I don't want to receive it, whereas if they could send it directly, there is some chance, I suppose, that the advertisement might sell them on getting the stuff."
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,360.272,373.065,"Well, that may be right, and I assume that is why Youngs Drug is so interested in sending unsolicited mailings, but there is no First Amendment interest in forcing publications or information on people who don't want to receive it."
1982.81-1590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,373.065,381.671,Do you think that Congress could prohibit the mailing of any kind of junk mail without the consent of the recipient?
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,384.23,386.543,All kinds of commercial mailings?
1982.81-1590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,386.543,387.526,Yes.
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,387.526,389.729,I think Congress may well have that power.
1982.81-1590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.412,410.75,"Now, in this instance there are other types of so-called potentially offensive material that could be mailed under this statute and aren't prohibited, right?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,410.75,416.421,--There are other... other materials that don't pertain to contraception that could be mailed under the statute.
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,559.084,572.81,"Your view is... I know the statute permits it, but supposing the statute prohibited the mailing of its promotional material by a charitable foundation or something like Planned Parenthood."
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,579.638,583.37,"That would depend on whether the mailings constituted commercial speech, which would be--"
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,583.37,589.976,"What I am really asking you is, if you get out of the commercial speech category, do you think the statute would stand?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,589.976,593.583,"--We don't claim that such a prohibition could be applied to non-commercial speech, no."
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.583,597.537,"In fact, you acquiesced in a holding in some other case."
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,597.537,599.581,"Yes, Associated Students, a District Court decision."
1982.81-1590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,603.768,617.073,"Could the legislative branch accomplish the same objective of the statute along the lines of the statute that we dealt with in the Rowan case, where they could put up a barrier and say, we don't want any mail from this company?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,619.604,627.54,"--That particular statute, of course, would not achieve this purpose, since people would have to certify that they found these advertisements sexually arousing."
1982.81-1590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,627.54,640.44,"Well, I don't mean to make a carbon copy of the statute, but to just give each householder the privilege of saying, I don't want any mail from Sears Roebuck Company, or from Montgomery Ward, or from anybody."
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,640.44,644.565,"Well, it wouldn't accomplish the legislature's purposes for a number of reasons."
1982.81-1590,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,701.697,704.945,"Mr. Strauss, you have advanced two goals, anyway."
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,713.426,716.691,"--Well, we have two pieces of evidence."
1982.81-1590,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,771.057,777.323,Maybe there are some physicians who don't want to receive it.
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,777.323,798.144,"Well, that may be right, although Congress apparently made a judgment that the importance of putting this information into the hands of physicians so that they could pass it on was great enough, and that physicians in their professional capacity would be less likely to be offended and less likely to have children who could--"
1982.81-1590,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,798.144,804.437,Is there anything in the record to the effect that these are offensive to recipients?
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,804.437,825.615,"--That was not an issue litigated below, but again, Justice Blackmun, on an issue like that, it is difficult to see what sort of evidence could be introduced in a trial court that would measure up to the judgment of Congress, which after all is in an excellent position to report on what its constituents find offensive."
1982.81-1590,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,825.615,829.472,"Well, all you have to do is bring in 100 people who say, it's offensive to me."
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,831.285,835.485,"Well, it might be possible for the other side to bring in 100 people... or a Gallup poll."
1982.81-1590,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,835.485,835.984,Of course.
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,835.984,868.958,"I think... I mean, I understand the point, Justice Blackmun, but I think the underlying question is that the underlying thing to keep in mind is that Congress is uniquely well positioned to express a judgment on a question like what are people likely to find offensive, and what sorts of materials do people want to keep out of the hands of their children, certainly at least as well positioned to express a judgment on an issue like that as it is to express a judgment on a technical factual issue on which this Court would unhesitatingly defer to it."
1982.81-1590,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,868.958,873.502,"Of course, an argument could be made it is rather underinclusive, isn't it?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,873.502,877.611,Because it excludes--
1982.81-1590,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,877.611,882.342,"Because it doesn't exclude a lot of other, much more offensive material."
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,882.342,887.575,"--Well, there are a couple of possible categories of material that appellees have argued about."
1982.81-1590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,948.395,975.052,"Mr. Strauss, would it arguably, at least, be less restrictive if Congress provided a means whereby any homeowner could say, don't mail to me or to deliver to my home anything related to contraceptive advertisements or other specific categories?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,978.523,979.771,I don't think it is.
1982.81-1590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1017.115,1030.172,"Well, but under this very scheme you are offering, they have to do something like that for anyone under the legislation that has already been approved in some areas."
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1033.967,1036.684,"Well, if they choose to acquire solicitations."
1982.81-1590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1065.034,1069.596,I don't know why you can argue that it would be less restrictive than a total ban.
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1072.766,1097.036,"--Well, it would be less... well, it would be more restrictive to the extent that it would not only keep people from receiving information about contraceptives, but also information about other products advertised by or manufactured by the same mailer, because that mailer might not find it useful to send out any... profitable to send out any... efficient to send out any advertisements at all to that recipient."
1982.81-1590,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1132.32,1141.377,Was there any testimony before Congress that it is a usual thing that children open their parents' mail?
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1141.377,1143.234,"Not that I know of, Justice Marshall, no."
1982.81-1590,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1143.234,1145.625,"That is what you are assuming, don't you?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1145.625,1146.405,"Well, that's right."
1982.81-1590,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1147.313,1148.811,But what is the basis for that?
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1148.811,1150.53,"--Well, I think that is a sort of--"
1982.81-1590,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1150.53,1153.638,I know what would happen if a child of mine opened my mail.
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1153.638,1155.545,"--Well, it is not even so much a matter of opening mail."
1982.81-1590,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1161.386,1166.07,I don't think a child has a right to look at mail that is not sealed.
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1166.07,1167.052,I think Congress--
1982.81-1590,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1167.052,1168.6,Is that normal?
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1168.6,1172.832,"--Well, I think Congress could reasonably conclude that it occurs in a high enough--"
1982.81-1590,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1172.832,1177.175,How could they reasonably conclude when there is no evidence whatsoever that I know of?
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1177.175,1186.156,"--Well, Congress frequently reaches conclusions as a basis for legislation without having hearings or... like an administrative agency."
1982.81-1590,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1186.156,1187.186,Or having any bases.
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1187.186,1188.515,"Well, no, it doesn't, at least--"
1982.81-1590,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1188.515,1189.373,"You are not going to say that, are you?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1189.373,1202.241,"--No, but without having a record comparable to an administrative agency, there is no requirement that Congress compile evidence, especially, Justice Marshall, on a common sense judgment about people's habits of living and mores like this."
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.681,1209.71,"Mr. Strauss, on the exhibits in the record, anyway, they were all inside envelopes, weren't they?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1209.71,1210.895,I believe--
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1210.895,1216.499,The pamphlets certainly couldn't have been just sent... the promotional materials.
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1220.079,1224.559,"--I actually don't know the answer to that, Justice Stevens, except I think the flier was a flier."
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1224.559,1226.295,The one with all the different products.
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1235.727,1244.536,"Well, that is one of the things the District Court required, but again, I don't think there is any assurance that after a sealed envelope is opened, it is not going to fall into the hands of a child, or even--"
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1244.536,1252.892,"But people who consider it offensive and are concerned about their children getting it are not the ones who are apt to put it on the dining room table in a prominent place, are they?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1252.892,1268.854,"--Well, if they know that it is contraceptive advertising, of course, if they don't want their children to get it, they will dispose of it promptly, but a lot of these materials come into the home in large quantity, advertisements of various kinds, mixed in with various other sorts of mail, and they may come into the home when the parents aren't there."
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1273.038,1274.601,Maybe most people get more mail than I do.
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1276.087,1285.426,"--Well, the District Court noted, as this Court did in Rowan, that this mail arrives in, I think the term is avalanche proportions."
1982.81-1590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1287.782,1297.624,"Mr. Strauss, to what extent is the least restrictive alternative analysis applicable to commercial speech?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1297.624,1300.67,I think in instances--
1982.81-1590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1300.67,1305.182,Is it sort of a relative of overbreadth?
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1305.182,1305.934,--I think--
1982.81-1590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.934,1308.352,"It reaches more, it reaches farther than it need to?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1308.352,1324.815,"--I think that's right, and I think for some of the same reasons that the Court has said overbreadth does not apply to... the overbreadth doctrine does not apply to commercial speech, there is good reason not to apply the less restrictive alternative approach as vigorously."
1982.81-1590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1324.815,1336.763,"Well, is the least restrictive approach, is that one of the rules applicable to commercial speech as you find these rules in our cases?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1336.763,1350.947,"The Court has said that on occasion, but always in the context of emphasizing that the basic question is whether the intrusion into First Amendment values is justified by the government interests at stake."
1982.81-1590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1350.947,1353.928,"Isn't that one of the central Hudson tests, in fact?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1353.928,1354.646,That's right.
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.566,1369.75,"Mr. Strauss, does the reason why the material is offensive bear on the issue at all?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1369.75,1370.657,I am sorry?
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1370.657,1375.091,Does the reason why the material is offensive bear on the issue at all?
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1393.24,1407.531,"I think when offensiveness is an asserted justification for a statute, the Court has to scrutinize what Congress has done to some degree to make sure that it is at least a common sense judgment."
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1407.531,1418.372,"Does it have to be a viewpoint neutral kind of offensiveness, or can the offensiveness lie in the fact that there are many people who as a matter of religious faith don't believe contraceptives should be used?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1426.386,1427.759,I don't know--
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1427.759,1428.898,Or permissively offensive?
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1428.898,1434.801,--I don't know if it's possible to distinguish among kinds of offensiveness on their psychological bases.
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1442.483,1444.655,"Well, we do have that history here, don't we?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1444.655,1446.169,"--No, I don't think we do."
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.169,1451.683,"Isn't the Comstock Act, the history of that that this gentleman was very much opposed to the use of these products?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1451.683,1453.106,"He certainly was, but most of--"
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.106,1455.134,"This is the survival of that statute, isn't it?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1455.134,1462.241,--It was survival after most of his handiwork and certainly the parts he would have considered vastly more important were repealed in 1971.
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1462.241,1467.678,"Well, but what is offensive about this material other than the aspects of it that Mr. Comstock thought were offensive?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1467.678,1471.55,"Well, there are a variety of things that might be offensive."
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1512.237,1516.859,"Well, but even what remains certainly restricts the flow of information on this subject, does it not?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1516.859,1520.544,"Well, it only restricts the flow of information to people who are unwilling to receive it."
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.044,1523.718,"Well, how?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1528.199,1531.385,"Well, if appellee is willing to seek a solicitation, yes."
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.385,1551.018,"Well, if this were not commercial mail, say it were, again, Planned Parenthood, do you think that if they sent out a flier saying, we would like to mail you a pamphlet about contraceptives if you send in and say you want to receive it, do you think there would be the same audience receiving it as if they just sent it out directly?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1551.018,1555.923,"Well, obviously, fewer people would receive it than if they sent it out directly."
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1555.923,1557.608,And do you think that would be a permissible restraint?
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1569.822,1578.694,"Out of the commercial area, it might well be, because out of the commercial area it is not only the informational value and the value to willing recipients that matters."
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1591.125,1593.531,"Where did we say that, that no First Amendment--"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1593.531,1602.449,"Well, the Court has said on many occasions that the importance of the protection of First Amendment... of commercial speech is based on its informational function."
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1604.153,1610.993,"--In Central Hudson, weren't there... those two cases that came down, weren't there people in the audience there who the Court assumed didn't particularly want the material."
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1615.743,1617.397,"Well, in Consolidated Edison--"
1982.81-1590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1617.397,1618.444,"Consolidated Edison, I guess."
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1623.943,1625.659,--I will save the--
1982.81-1590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1625.659,1634.233,"Mr. Strauss, do you concede that restrictions on commercial speech have to be content neutral?"
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1634.233,1645.074,--I think the application of that rule of Mosely and Carey against Brown and cases like that to commercial speech is different.
1982.81-1590,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1670.093,1676.153,"Well, when you say that, that almost implies to me that it is not content neutral."
1982.81-1590,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1676.153,1689.026,"There is a sense in which it distinguishes between speech of one content and speech of another, but it cannot be the case that that distinction requires a higher level of scrutiny or makes the statute suspect."
1982.81-1590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1703.488,1708.437,Mr. Solovy?
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1708.437,1715.405,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is our position that this is really a very simple case."
1982.81-1590,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1783.815,1794.152,"Do you think Congress could pass essentially a Rowan statute in this context, as I suggested to your friend?"
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1794.152,1811.631,"I am glad you asked the question, Mr. Chief Justice, because Congress passed the Rowan statute, and what the government overlooks is, this is part of the same title of the same section of the Post Office Reorganization Act of 1970."
1982.81-1590,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1846.614,1849.051,And you have no trouble with that on the First Amendment?
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1849.051,1850.143,None whatsoever.
1982.81-1590,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1888.537,1902.263,"Then are you suggesting that without any additional legislation, the addressee, any householder could operate under the Rowan section of the statute and stop the mailings?"
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1902.263,1903.313,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1982.81-1590,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1934.391,1938.689,"Well, the finding of a District Court in another case certainly isn't binding on the government in this case."
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1939.968,1942.671,"Justice Rehnquist, I don't contend otherwise."
1982.81-1590,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.338,1950.653,"Well, they do put it forth in this case."
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1952.743,1974.046,"The point I draw from it is that the legislative history that there is does not speak to Section 3001, but speaks to Section 3008, because that is where Congress said that people were offended by certain types of mail, and that the recipient should have the right to cut off that mail, and--"
1982.81-1590,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1974.046,1980.09,"You can certainly make that point without relying on the findings of a district judge in some other case, can't you?"
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1980.09,1992.635,"--I think a judge, be he a district judge, an appellate judge, or a Supreme Court judge, if there is reason to what he says, commends repetition."
1982.81-1590,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1994.305,2011.937,Can Congress go further and say that a homeowner can take his name off the mailing list for certain categories of items before having received any in that category?
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2011.937,2013.594,"Well, Congress has not done so."
1982.81-1590,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2014.905,2016.016,I realize that.
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2019.42,2036.71,"--I think that Congress, so long as it is content neutral and speaks across the board, Congress could say that no mailer can send any unsolicited mail of a commercial nature to any household."
1982.81-1590,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.528,2059.609,I wonder if that is true.
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2069.042,2076.521,"--Well, as a smoker I suppose I would have some hesitation, but they banned it from television."
1982.81-1590,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.223,2098.639,"Assuming that there was a legitimate governmental interest in discouraging smoking, it seems to me it would be proper, but I would suppose you would have suggested there is not such a legitimate governmental interest with regard to contraception."
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2098.639,2101.044,There is no such... It is quite the obverse.
1982.81-1590,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2192.691,2210.247,"This Court in cases such as Pacifica Foundation, though, has said that Congress can or the government can prohibit the intrusion of so-called offensive materials in the home."
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2218.288,2220.164,Yes.
1982.81-1590,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2241.31,2250.057,"Yes, but Congress has made the judgment with respect to the contraceptives that that is offensive as brought into the home."
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2250.057,2267.94,"--But the question is, did Congress make a judgment based upon any interest, or was it the vestige of the Comstock Act, and we submit that it was only the vestige of the Comstock Act."
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.955,2510.06,"Mr. Solovy, do you think the... Can you live with what the District Court did?"
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2510.06,2510.934,Yes.
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2510.934,2512.357,Do you think it is constitutional?
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2512.357,2517.2,"Well, Justice White, I am not sure that Judge Penn's--"
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2517.2,2522.336,"I would think you would think it was unconstitutional, in view of your argument you just made."
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2522.336,2534.522,"--Well, my partners and I, when we received the decision, said, this is not a perfect decision, but in this age of litigation and costs, we certainly could live with that decision, because Youngs is not in the--"
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2534.522,2535.973,But you didn't cross-petition?
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2535.973,2540.407,--We were quite satisfied with Judge Penn's solution.
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2540.407,2541.221,Let me ask you again.
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2542.657,2543.674,What he did?
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2549.387,2551.402,"Well, an unconstitutional burden on you?"
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2551.402,2552.607,Yes.
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.326,2677.384,Do you think you are free to challenge such restrictions in some other form?
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2677.384,2683.164,You mean the conditions he imposed?
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2699.421,2702.638,Why did the case come up in this jurisdiction?
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2702.638,2707.606,"Because my partner, Mr. Graham, said I had to sue here because this was the proper venue."
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2713.025,2720.162,If you mail... This is of nationwide application?
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2720.162,2720.773,Yes.
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.773,2725.083,"So if you mail something without complying with this injunction, you are in contempt, I take it."
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2725.083,2726.019,That's right.
1982.81-1590,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2831.211,2833.741,"Well, it was the moral judgment of Congress at that time, was it not?"
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2833.741,2836.646,"Yes, after one hour of debate--"
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2836.646,2840.878,"Well, maybe they thought it was quite a clear issue that didn't require any more debate."
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2840.878,2849.687,"--Well, interestingly enough, in my research, I found that Mr. Comstock had as his legislative assistant the Justice of the Supreme Court who drafted the statute."
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.687,2851.469,Who was that?
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2851.469,2852.81,I can't remember the name.
1982.81-1590,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2883.253,2883.519,I am sorry.
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2885.391,2887.5,The original Act?
1982.81-1590,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2887.5,2889.796,"No, the Act in which the Justice of this Court--"
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2889.796,2891.684,1873.
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.512,2899.511,--You weren't here then.
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2903.384,2907.914,"I meant no personal aspersion, Justice Brennan."
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.914,2910.585,Where was the Senator from?
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2910.585,2912.067,The Senator?
1982.81-1590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.067,2913.412,Comstock.
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2913.412,2915.518,He was from New York City.
1982.81-1590,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2989.538,2994.846,"And he was from Pennsylvania, as I recall, not New York."
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2994.846,2996.082,Pardon?
1982.81-1590,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2996.082,2998.344,"I think he was from Pennsylvania, not New York."
1982.81-1590,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,2998.344,3006.419,"Well, I think that is correct, Justice Brennan, but Mr. Comstock took his friends where he could find them."
1982.81-1590,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3501.813,3505.966,Mr. Strauss?
1982.81-1590,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3505.966,3507.546,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1590,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3550.997,3553.404,"Black letter law from what, Valentine against Christianson?"
1982.81-1590,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3553.404,3554.761,"--From Valentine against Christianson, the first--"
1982.81-1590,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3554.761,3555.884,Would you call that black letter law?
1982.81-1590,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3555.884,3558.302,"--Well, it was so considered in 1970."
1982.81-1590,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3558.302,3559.304,By whom?
1982.81-1590,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3559.304,3564.834,"Well, by all the lower courts, and presumably by Congress had it wanted to see it close to the line, Justice Blackmun."
1982.81-1590,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3673.568,3674.379,"Thank you, gentlemen."
