1965.594,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1808.17,1812.121,"You may have three minutes more, and counsel may have quite a few --"
1965.594,0,23848,frank_j_donner,,1812.121,1827.025,"I want to point out that before this hearing was held in the Fall of 1954, Congressman Walter made a statement that the accuracy of which is not in dispute."
1965.594,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1903.393,1909.341,Mr. Yeagley.

1965.594,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2019.879,2021.963,"Deutch was a student, wasn't he?"
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2021.963,2049.732,"Deutch, Mr. Justice Stewart, was in the UE, and they were, as I recall it, but there the question that he had been asked was relating to activity at Cornell and the -- apparently the authorization there was for the purpose was investigation of Communist infiltration on the labor and the student's point --"
1965.594,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2049.732,2051.007,He had a summer jobs under that work.
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2051.007,2064.114,"That's right, and the student point was -- the crucial issue there was underlain to the subject under inquiry."
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2263.492,2272.962,Was that the first notice that witnesses had to the scope of the Committee investigation that they're about to --
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2272.962,2290.515,"Yes that is the first advice to witnesses as to the scope of the -- the purpose of the hearing that appears in the record other than the course that the indictment, later on and before trial the indictment alleged --"
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2290.515,2292.459,Well the indictment didn't come before that.
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2292.459,2294.446,"No, no not before that."
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2299.627,2302.393,Are we dealing with -- are we dealing with the record.
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2302.393,2302.831,Yes.
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2302.831,2305.976,Only?
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2305.976,2309.114,Well other than newspaper cuttings or things of that kind.
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2309.114,2310.676,I beg your pardon?
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2310.676,2312.244,I'm not sure if I understood your question Chief --
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2312.244,2313.471,"Well, I say aren't we dealing with the record only?"
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2313.471,2315.815,"Yes indeed, yes."
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2315.815,2322.151,What are you talking about newspaper reports before?
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2324.24,2328.193,"Those were on the record, I'm sorry, those were in the record."
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2328.193,2329.207,What were in the record?
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2329.207,2330.581,"We're dealing with the record, right."
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2330.581,2331.262,I beg your pardon?
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2331.262,2333.586,"Yes, we are dealing with the record."
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2333.586,2338.853,"Yes and we have nothing -- that had nothing to do with newspaper, the propaganda of the Committee, does it?"
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2338.853,2340.549,"No, what I -- I misstate it."
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2369.222,2370.719,The union election?
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2370.719,2385.251,"Yes, the NLRB had called an election in Fort Wayne in which there are other unions interested and the Chairman had not known of this apparently."
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2386.542,2388.706,Does the record show he didn't know it -- know anything about it?
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2388.706,2390.722,"Yes, yes."
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2390.722,2392.906,Did he testify to that?
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2392.906,2396.444,He -- it's in the records Mr. Chief Justice I'm not sure that --
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2396.444,2398.228,In what manner?
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2398.228,2411.364,That he said -- the record contains testimony as to the meeting with the Washington representative for this reason.
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2617.485,2627.269,What do we look to here to see what the jurisdiction of the Committee was the scope of this investigation?
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2627.269,2628.734,The subject under inquiry Mr. Justice?
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2628.734,2633.266,"Yes, as of the time of the hearing."
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2633.266,2640.44,"As of the time of the hearing, it would be the opening statement of the Chairman, Mr. Chief Justice when he made the statement that I've just read to you."
1965.594,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2810.572,2850.854,"Mr. Yeagley, as I understand your adversary, his principal thrust of the argument that he made to us this morning is that the fault here lies in the delegation without specification as he put it the very key power in responsibility together, the responsibility being vested in the full Committee, the Committee -- The full Committee has a responsibility of specifically delineating the authority of the Subcommittee."
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,2868.834,2877.228,There is no formal statement in the Committee resolution to the Subcommittee of the subject of the inquiry.
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2981.94,2984.514,Mr. Yeagley may I ask you this question?
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3031.549,3034.472,I -- that poses a different situation I think that might have --
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3034.472,3043.073,"I don't think it does, except that this is one -- this is one Subcommittee and if it can do it with one, why can't they do it with all?"
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3043.073,3054.369,It strikes me Mr. Chief Justice that a Committee of three and its method of operation and function of the chairman is somewhat different than a Subcommittee of one.
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3054.369,3089.454,"Well let's change my question and divide the main Committee up into three instead of one, and just send them roaming around the country to pick out anything they want to investigate within the broad jurisdiction of the Committee without specifying what they want investigated or what the limitations, if any, are on the Committee leaving it to the Subcommittee to choose anything that it wants to choose that it might think bears upon the question of subversion."
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3089.454,3094.86,"No I don't think that should be done and I don't think that's the position either of the government or the Committee, but if --"
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3094.86,3102.087,"Well, if it can do it with this Committee, why can't it do it with all the members of the Committee?"
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3102.087,3110.797,I don't want to answer that such a ways to concede that it is done or has been done because I don't think it has been done and I don't think it would be proper I agree with you on that Mr. Chief Justice.
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3110.797,3114.09,What limitation then do they put upon this Committee?
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3114.09,3120.263,There is no formal language in any resolution limiting their area of operation.
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3120.263,3128.522,"Aren't we bound by that then, to the effect that there was no limitation put on them?"
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3128.522,3147.282,Other than Rule 11 of the Reorganization Act and of the Rule 5 of that particular Congress that passed this resolution as previously been questioned here in Watkins and Barenblatt which generally described their authority to investigate Communist propaganda.
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3181.572,3184.144,Is this a continuing Committee?
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3184.144,3185.22,No it is not.
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3185.22,3186.444,All American --
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3186.444,3197.336,"It's a permanent Committee, but Congress considerably could be defeated from -- in one Congress that has -- therefore not -- in one election not be back to be on the Committee the next time."
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3197.336,3200.475,Well let me put it to you a little more simply.
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3233.867,3243.958,I think that is permissible under the regulations -- of the rules of this Committee.
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3266.862,3267.966,"Yes, but your answer is yes."
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3267.966,3275.103,"My -- I wouldn't want to run a Committee in that manner myself, would not advocating that, but I think that is the law."
1965.594,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3275.103,3277.69,But do you think they have the power though to do that?
1965.594,1,33722,j_walter_yeagley,,3277.69,3282.787,"Yes, as it stands now, I do think they have that power."
