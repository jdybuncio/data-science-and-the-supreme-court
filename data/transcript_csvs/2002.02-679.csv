2002.02-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.003,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-679, the Desert Palace, doing business as Caesars Palace Hotel, v. Costa."
2002.02-679,0,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,59.446,60.445,"It's Ricciardi, sir."
2002.02-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,60.445,61.284,Mr. Ricciardi.
2002.02-679,0,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,61.284,66.265,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,181.953,185.6,"And what is your definition of direct evidence, Mr. Ricciardi?"
2002.02-679,0,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,185.6,191.795,"There's two definitions that we've briefed, Your Honor."
2002.02-679,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.228,258.659,"The first... the first of those three is... goes beyond what the... what the Government... the EEOC guideline would require, doesn't it?"
2002.02-679,0,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,266.19,268.806,"You're correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-679,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,277.01,282.336,"Although the fact that it has to bear upon the decision, it's hard to get there without--"
2002.02-679,0,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,282.336,283.654,"--Well, I think--"
2002.02-679,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.654,285.739,--pinning it on a decisionmaker somehow.
2002.02-679,0,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,285.739,291.258,"--What could be contemplated I guess is a respondent official, who's maybe even higher than the decisionmaker, makes the statement."
2002.02-679,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.258,291.712,Yes.
2002.02-679,0,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,291.712,304.798,"The Civil Rights Act of 1991 sets out a new section, and we've set it out in appendix A."
2002.02-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.798,306.596,Of your brief?
2002.02-679,0,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,306.596,308.208,"Of the brief, of the blue brief, Your Honor."
2002.02-679,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,394.744,403.073,"Mr. Ricciardi, would that demonstration by the defendant also have to be made by direct evidence?"
2002.02-679,0,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,414.267,424.58,"The word demonstrate is used twice, Your Honor, but I do not agree that the respondent or the defendant or the employer has any heightened standard."
2002.02-679,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,448.407,464.09,"Well, the question whether there is, you would be suggesting a rule that, as far as I know, is alien to our law, that is, to make a distinction between direct evidence and circumstantial evidence."
2002.02-679,0,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,478.882,488.374,"Your Honor, I believe the distinction is made because the shifting of the burden to the defendant in employment cases is an unusual thing."
2002.02-679,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,493.098,497.288,"It is... it is unquestionably... it was unquestionably made in Price Waterhouse, wasn't it?"
2002.02-679,0,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,497.288,498.438,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2002.02-679,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.438,499.503,"I mean, that's what it said."
2002.02-679,0,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,499.503,501.039,Price Waterhouse--
2002.02-679,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,501.039,504.804,What... what was it... the it that was said in Price Waterhouse?
2002.02-679,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,513.164,513.98,--Concurring opinion.
2002.02-679,0,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,513.98,514.361,--Well--
2002.02-679,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,514.361,519.092,"It came out of a concurring opinion that bore my name, did it not?"
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1155.071,1168.71,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-679,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1193.133,1197.784,How do we know that those amendments apply only to mixed-motive cases?
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1201.891,1202.618,--It... the--
2002.02-679,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1202.618,1206.001,"And in theory, it could apply across the board."
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1206.001,1217.922,"--The text that says, even though other factors also motivated the practice, make clear that the amendment only applies to mixed-motive cases."
2002.02-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.8,1239.431,"Well, the text makes clear that the exception does, but why does 2(m) not apply to all cases?"
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1239.431,1244.428,"--2(m) says, even though other factors also motivated the... the practice."
2002.02-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1249.74,1251.364,It says whether or not they... other factors motivate it.
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1251.364,1251.775,No.
2002.02-679,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1293.246,1302.658,"Do you say that because that's the way a lot of court of appeals determined, or do you think that was a necessity by virtue of the split in the opinions on this Court?"
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1302.658,1304.839,"Two sources for that, Justice Souter."
2002.02-679,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1316.551,1325.519,Were those... were those opinions based on the reading of this Court as depending upon Justice O'Connor's opinion where those words were used?
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1325.519,1326.33,--I... I would--
2002.02-679,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1326.33,1333.655,Or did the courts independently create a distinction between direct and substantial evidence?
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1333.655,1347.284,"--I think that those two... those cases, for the most part, were trying to reconcile this Court's decisions in McDonnell Douglas with Price Waterhouse, and that's exactly the first source for where we would get the background rule as well."
2002.02-679,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1347.284,1348.565,"Well, then would you tell me--"
2002.02-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1348.565,1349.053,--Why would you have that background?
2002.02-679,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1349.053,1375.971,"--why would the court... if that's what it was trying to do, why would it resort to something as extraordinary... now that we no longer have formal rules of evidence, like you need two witnesses to prove A and three witnesses to prove B, why would it resort to that kind of distinction between direct and circumstantial rather than a heightened burden expressed as clear and convincing?"
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1375.971,1381.728,Because it was trying to be... they were trying to be faithful to this Court's decisions in McDonnell Douglas and Price Waterhouse.
2002.02-679,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1400.904,1405.21,But only one stated that it was necessary as well as sufficient.
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1405.21,1406.075,That's correct.
2002.02-679,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1406.075,1409.659,So you had five that did not say it was necessary as well as sufficient.
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1409.659,1410.382,That's correct.
2002.02-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1465.524,1473.792,Are there cases in which a motivating factor is not but for causation when it's not a mixed-motive case?
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1473.792,1478.707,It... it's a mixed-motive case where it's not a but for factor.
2002.02-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1479.52,1479.805,No.
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1489.543,1489.735,No.
2002.02-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1494.994,1497.413,Would it also not be a violation of this statute?
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1497.413,1504.016,"--No, because 2000e-2(m) is designed just for cases where there's more than one motive."
2002.02-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1504.016,1510.381,"It's designed to create a special defense and a special remedy, but it doesn't say anything about what it takes to prove the case, does it?"
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1510.381,1512.894,It leaves that to background principles.
2002.02-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1540.619,1549.484,"But I... I still... maybe I'm just stupid, but I don't understand the difference between a but for cause and a motivating factor that is not part of a mixed-motive case."
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1549.484,1551.917,--If it's just--
2002.02-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1551.917,1558.485,"If... if the only motivating... if there's a motivating factor and there's nothing else, isn't that but for causation?"
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1558.485,1559.879,--It... certainly it is--
2002.02-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1559.879,1562.386,"And so is it if you have two, isn't it?"
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1562.386,1566.666,--2000e-2(a)(1) but not... it doesn't apply where cases where it's not a but for cause.
2002.02-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1567.433,1567.67,Why not?
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1586.73,1587.571,--Well--
2002.02-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1587.571,1592.219,"So I'm amazed that you're reading because, contrary to all tort law--"
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1592.219,1592.658,--No.
2002.02-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1592.658,1599.319,"--to mean that if you have the co-causal condition, which happens to be two motives here, not two hunters, that it wouldn't fall within the beginning."
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1599.319,1599.575,No.
2002.02-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1601.589,1602.093,"Yes, it is."
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1602.093,1608.356,"And... and the ordinary rule is that you have to show that it's but for cause, and the Court said as much in--"
2002.02-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1608.356,1613.699,"All right, but it's a special case we're dealing with where you have two hunters... I'm sorry... two motives."
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1627.279,1641.146,"--The... the key point that you're missing there is that if you interpret 2000e-2(m) in that way, you would be rendering superfluous 2000e-2(a)(1) which requires but for cause by virtue of the because of language."
2002.02-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1682.123,1688.031,"Would it be a radical change in our law if we said that instead of direct evidence, it's clear and convincing evidence?"
2002.02-679,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1688.031,1701.395,"That would be a very big change in this Court's law if... if this Court said that because this Court has already said, under Title VII, the background understanding is more likely than not, and that's what the plaintiff has to show."
2002.02-679,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.817,1761.653,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
2002.02-679,2,40143,robert_n_peccole,,1764.049,1773.449,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-679,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2061.569,2082.366,"And what do you... what do you respond to the argument made by the Government if... that if that is what it means and if it does not embody the understood requirement of direct evidence, it effectively supplants (a)(1)."
2002.02-679,2,40143,robert_n_peccole,,2092.638,2104.863,"In our brief, Your Honor, we... we actually took the position that the language in 703(m) does, in fact, supplant the language in 701(a)."
2002.02-679,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.863,2106.401,So you... you accept that argument.
2002.02-679,2,40143,robert_n_peccole,,2106.401,2106.778,703(a).
2002.02-679,3,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,2993.358,3001.428,"I'd like to call the Court's attention to the joint appendix, page 17, the middle of the page."
2002.02-679,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3036.361,3042.09,"You also should have said, I believe this is a mixed-motive case, not I believe this is not, shouldn't you?"
2002.02-679,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3047.562,3052.549,Did you think it was a mixed-motive case or not?
2002.02-679,3,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,3052.549,3053.005,No.
2002.02-679,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.459,3062.928,I see.
2002.02-679,3,36579,mark_j_ricciardi,,3063.574,3066.648,--It was not a Price Waterhouse case.
2002.02-679,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3133.04,3134.105,"Thank you, Mr. Ricciardi."
