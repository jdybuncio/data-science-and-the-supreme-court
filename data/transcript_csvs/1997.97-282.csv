1997.97-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.327,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97-282, Beth Ann Faragher v. the City of Boca Raton."
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,9.927,13.861,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.97-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,61.302,64.884,"That isn't precisely the two questions in your petition, is it?"
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,64.884,66.254,"--No, Your Honor."
1997.97-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,67.676,73.798,So the second question in your petition you see as basically Should the Court of Appeals have affirmed the District Court?
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,73.798,97.684,"Based on the factors I set forth in the petition, Mr. Chief Justice, that there was the pervasiveness that could give rise to constructive knowledge, and it should be re... clearly erroneous standard, that there was notice to an intermediate agent, Mr. Gordon, and that there was no dissemination of the sexual harassment policy."
1997.97-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,97.684,100.208,"Well, what... what do you mean by permit pervasiveness?"
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,100.208,111.114,"I mean, by pervasiveness, Mr. Chief Justice, that there were eight women who were sexually harassed by Mr. Terry and/or Mr. Silverman over a period of 4 years."
1997.97-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,115.916,119.549,"So pervasiveness means multiple victims, then?"
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,119.549,123.743,Pervasiveness can have more than one meaning.
1997.97-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,137.041,138.203,Secret pervasiveness.
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,139.172,143.916,"--A pervasiveness... a pervasiveness, Mr. Chief Justice, that would apply only to that person."
1997.97-282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.006,185.092,"--I don't know how... I mean, constructive notice, I can't imagine how secret pervasiveness could ever... could ever give rise to constructive notice."
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,185.092,186.192,Nor can I.--
1997.97-282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,186.192,186.903,Okay.
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,193.006,198.15,--Either must have known about it or was engaged in willful ignorance about it.
1997.97-282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.915,209.958,"The employer is downtown, in... in city hall."
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,221.787,223.108,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1997.97-282,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,270.578,272.568,He wasn't asked to do so.
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,283.167,284.328,"--No, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.97-282,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,315.747,318.43,"Well, let me ask you about the third... what you list under ""C""."
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,353.391,355.384,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there would be."
1997.97-282,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,367.491,376.647,"Well, then, what you make... you seem to make quite a thing out of this... there was no procedure that was... that was well known."
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,379.729,380.741,"--No, Your Honor."
1997.97-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,427.291,429.0,Is... is that... that sounds like strict liability to me.
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,429.731,432.323,"--No, it does not, Your Honor, with all due respect."
1997.97-282,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,451.567,464.146,"Well, but I... I inferred from your remarks... maybe improperly so... that the... they were aided, under the 219(d) formulation because of the subordinate/superior relation."
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,464.146,465.145,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-282,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,465.145,466.487,"Well, that's strict liability."
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,466.487,468.338,"No, it's not, Your Honor, respectfully."
1997.97-282,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,469.97,473.91,That's strict liability whenever there is a... a superior that harasses a subordinate.
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,473.91,490.981,"--Strict liability, Justice Kennedy, is in such instances as somebody convicted of shooting birds over a baited field, somebody who is shown to have made a profit on insider trading, in... in short swing investments under 16(b) of the Securities Act of 1934."
1997.97-282,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.642,500.678,"Well, could you give us some examples of situations in which the employer would not be liable under your hypothesis?"
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,500.678,501.139,"--Yes, I can, Justice O'Connor."
1997.97-282,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,501.8,502.461,"Well, would you?"
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,502.901,503.841,Yes.
1997.97-282,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,528.227,539.494,"Well, you have just informed Justice Ginsburg that if the employer had had a strong policy, fully communicated, that it wouldn't make any difference."
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,540.956,546.57,"--I am taking the position, Your Honor, that, number one, in this case, there was no policy."
1997.97-282,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,557.055,562.671,"Well, then your answer to Justice Ginsburg was incorrect... it would make a difference if the employer had a policy--"
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,562.671,563.61,"--Oh, it would certainly--"
1997.97-282,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,563.61,566.204,"--and that would be an excuse, so there would not be strict liability?"
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,566.204,567.343,--It would certainly make a difference.
1997.97-282,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,581.573,584.874,Is there any other example of when an employer would not be liable.
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,584.874,586.746,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor, there is."
1997.97-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,599.123,602.596,"Well, that's because he's not a direct supervisor, presumably."
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,602.596,603.547,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.97-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,603.547,607.801,I thought Justice O'Connor was asking for an example where there was a direct supervisor who would not be liable.
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,608.289,614.213,"Mr. Chief Justice, the... we can't envision every case."
1997.97-282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,625.273,627.713,You would at least say that all of these cases have to go to trial?
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,627.713,628.324,--Yes.
1997.97-282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,628.324,632.736,You would never be able to get... to get these cases disposed of before a full fledged trial--
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,632.736,633.397,Justice--
1997.97-282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.397,636.779,"--as to whether... whether the woman had a, quote, reasonable fear?"
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,636.779,640.47,"--Justice Scalia, I don't want to say ""never""."
1997.97-282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,644.393,647.767,"Well, when... when would it be, if all the woman has to do is say, I had a reasonable fear?"
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,647.767,651.78,--If it could be shown that her fear was unreasonable.
1997.97-282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.845,671.311,"Well, the company could have the clearest policy, and... and many other employees could have... could have used that policy to stop this kind of intimidation."
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,682.027,686.071,"If she had not used it, and if she could explain why she did not use it."
1997.97-282,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,692.295,697.278,"Well, incidentally, reasonable fear of what ridicule, retaliation, embarrassment?"
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,699.729,714.11,"Well, in the cases in the studies cited at, I believe, note 32 of our brief, there is widespread fear amongst women of retaliation if they complain about sexual harassment."
1997.97-282,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,714.11,714.869,"Okay, retaliation."
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,714.869,715.41,Retaliation.
1997.97-282,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,715.41,718.993,"That... that is to say, demotion and further bad treatment, et cetera?"
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,718.993,719.573,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.573,720.393,It's just women?
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,720.393,721.815,"No... no, Your Honor."
1997.97-282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.815,722.536,And is it just sexual harassment?
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,729.088,730.079,"Precisely not, Your Honor."
1997.97-282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.079,732.772,"Jumping over the chain of command, and crit... nobody is not afraid of that, is he?"
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,732.772,733.473,"I do... I do not, Your Honor."
1997.97-282,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,738.194,739.767,And that's... that's why there's an absolute liability.
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,744.139,747.21,"No, Justice Souter, there is not always going to be reasonable fear."
1997.97-282,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,764.474,766.995,"But let's go back to what you conceded, at least I thought."
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,775.17,780.656,--That case did not go to summary judgment.
1997.97-282,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,787.709,788.681,"Yes, but you said--"
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,788.681,789.822,I think... I think it's a--
1997.97-282,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,789.822,802.388,"--you said it could be mitigating, and it... I'm sort of fuzzy about... you give... on the one hand, you give have a clear policy, great prominence; but then it kind of drifts off into the wind."
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,802.388,808.332,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's going to depend on the... the factors of the work place."
1997.97-282,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,812.035,816.81,I really gave you an example of a policy that's included in the manual.
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,835.482,848.109,"--If the employee could demonstrate that, notwithstanding the policy, that she had a reasonable fear of retaliation if she came forward."
1997.97-282,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,849.962,852.023,This is an objective fear or subjective?
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,852.023,852.493,--No.
1997.97-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,891.021,892.27,"Very well, Mr. Amlong."
1997.97-282,0,43755,william_r_amlong,,892.27,893.121,"Thank you, Chief Justice."
1997.97-282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,893.121,894.781,"Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you."
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,894.781,906.089,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.97-282,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,928.314,932.565,"Now, you... you would say that, and that alone, is... is sufficient to impose liability?"
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,932.565,933.927,--That's correct.
1997.97-282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,947.175,949.188,You don't... this is not a negligence argument?
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,949.749,951.559,This is not an negligence argument.
1997.97-282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.853,973.873,--And that is negligence?
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,973.873,976.106,"That is a ""should have known"" standard."
1997.97-282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,978.206,979.448,Is it a negligence standard?
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,979.448,979.686,--Correct.
1997.97-282,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,981.238,987.233,But it's a... it's a negligence... it's a negligence standard that will always be satisfied if there is no policy?
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,987.233,988.084,--That's--
1997.97-282,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,988.084,990.845,"So, in effect, it's kind of an... an absolute policy standard?"
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,990.845,991.406,--No.
1997.97-282,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,996.021,1000.324,"Well, is there a causation issue... well, a causation issue on the first theory, too, then?"
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1000.324,1001.715,There... that... that's correct.
1997.97-282,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1001.715,1004.096,You say they made it possible because--
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1004.096,1004.857,That's correct.
1997.97-282,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1016.253,1020.807,--How will... how will we ever know that if they haven't distributed a policy?
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1025.869,1026.381,Yes.
1997.97-282,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1026.381,1031.153,So won't... won't the effect of your third prong always be liability when there's no policy?
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1031.153,1034.516,"Justice Souter, there is... there will be uncertainty in... in many cases."
1997.97-282,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1038.817,1039.828,And who is it going to be?
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1039.828,1047.285,"Well, I think a fair argument could be made that the employer of that situation... in that situation... should bear the risk--"
1997.97-282,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1047.285,1060.732,"Well, if that's... if that's the case, and... and what we're uncertain about is how a policy that was never promulgated would have worked in fact, then the practical effect of the third prong is always to make the employer liable if there's no policy."
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1060.732,1063.083,"--Well, if... if the... unless the employer can make that showing."
1997.97-282,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1064.355,1065.544,"Yes, but how can you ever do it?"
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1065.544,1069.368,"--Or if you reject the view that he should have the burden, and place the burden on the plaintiff."
1997.97-282,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1082.087,1083.697,That sounds like running around Robin Hood's barn.
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1090.883,1092.352,"Yes, Mr.... yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.97-282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1099.398,1101.328,Why do you need... why do you need a special policy?
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1115.868,1125.705,"--I... I think that the... the... the problem is difficult enough, that in most cases, if an employer does not adopt a policy, they would not be exercising reasonable care."
1997.97-282,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1134.9,1141.475,"Yes, but don't you think every employee in the country knows that if they're mistreated, they can complain to somebody higher up the ladder?"
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1146.759,1148.241,"Well, there are two... two problems."
1997.97-282,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1165.753,1167.803,"Well, it's obviously helpful to have."
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1189.387,1194.15,--But I think that returns me to the first potential line... liability here.
1997.97-282,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1215.013,1217.176,"But that... that's a form of strict liability, it seems to me."
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1235.787,1243.154,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that when there is an effective policy in place, it has the capacity to remove reasonable fear."
1997.97-282,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1274.436,1291.196,"--What would you do if you have the model employer, who does everything that they can, but he... there is one bad apple, a supervisor, and he offers a quid pro quo... promotion in exchange for sexual favors, et cetera... is that a completely different case, or is it governed by this same rule?"

1997.97-282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.254,1343.761,Right.
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1343.761,1346.385,--if it's an explicit threat of adverse employment consequences--
1997.97-282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.385,1346.644,Right.
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1346.644,1351.238,"--again, we would say that the employer is liable in that situation, where there's an invocation of power."
1997.97-282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.238,1352.17,"Now, I... I find that... why is that?"
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1364.046,1364.717,Yes.
1997.97-282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.717,1380.657,"You say, however, that if in this case one of the lifeguards had said, You know, unless you let me continue to abuse you in this fashion, I'm going to assign you to that tower, that life tower... lifesaving tower that doesn't have a screen on it--"

1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1384.96,1385.839,--That... that's correct.
1997.97-282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1386.44,1388.883,"And suddenly everything would transform, even though the employer knows nothing about it."
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1394.707,1395.196,--It does.
1997.97-282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1396.738,1397.668,I don't understand why.
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1397.668,1398.829,--the invocation of power is clear.
1997.97-282,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1408.947,1413.368,"Well, maybe because it's a little difficult to see where the line is between that kind of case and this kind of case."
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1423.676,1432.051,--But the question is Has the... that harassment been made possible by the delegation of power from the employer to the supervisor?
1997.97-282,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1461.47,1485.756,"Well, but in... in situations where the harassment is carried out by the supervisor, but there is no retaliation suggested or in fact imposed by the supervisor, he just does these gross things, but otherwise the... the employment relationship stays the same, why do you say the employer has aided the supervisor in doing it?"
1997.97-282,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1489.279,1502.398,"--Because, by the delegation of power itself, and by the absence of an effective policy providing the person a way around, there will... there can be a reasonable fear that adverse employment consequences will be imposed."

1997.97-282,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1555.242,1568.22,You... you had said that this kind of thing can't be within the scope of employment because no rational employer would sanction... would allow such a thing.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1586.693,1592.736,"No, that is... that is no longer a case of hostile environment sexual harassment, it is a case of disparate treatment."
1997.97-282,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1600.3,1600.801,Yes.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1609.096,1624.247,"When... when... when a supervisor takes what Justice Posner, in the Jansen case, called is a company act, the hiring somebody or not hiring somebody, that is an act that's separate from the motivation of the act."
1997.97-282,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1646.362,1646.963,I don't understand--
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1661.845,1669.43,"That is an unsettled question, since I believe the lower courts are wrestling at the present time as to what a quid pro quo violation is."
1997.97-282,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1670.131,1684.589,"So you think that... that should make the difference, the... the... the woman who is so intimidated that she yields is... does not get the advantage of the quid pro quo rule, whereas the one who... who is tougher and is fired does?"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1684.589,1692.984,"--Well, there is a... there is a... there are three categories of quid pro quo, one where the person is fired."
1997.97-282,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1700.889,1703.342,And you're not arguing that there should be a negligence test for that?
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1703.342,1703.681,No.
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1707.594,1709.134,"But, Mr. Rissetto, may I just ask this question?"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1726.825,1728.768,He is responsible for the conduct of... that occurs at the beach.
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1728.768,1730.338,Including how the employees deal with one another.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1730.338,1734.171,But when that supervisor departs from the scope of the employment--
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.171,1740.095,"Well, but didn't the personnel officer depart from the scope when he based it on race rather than merit?"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1740.095,1740.636,--No.
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1741.716,1750.901,"Well, here, this supervisor made a... a... employment decision in the sense it related to how people had to interact with one another under his supervision."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1752.294,1766.074,"But the... in... in... in the case of hostile environment, the... the effect of... on the terms and conditions of employment are as a result of an action that's outside the scope of the employment by the supervisor."
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1784.066,1784.845,"My question is, why is it a fundamental distinction?"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1785.916,1786.517,I'm sorry?
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1786.517,1788.358,"My question is, why is it a fundamental distinction?"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1789.51,1790.211,Because in--
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1790.211,1799.027,"Because in both cases, the... the supervisor is performing his... his or her general official responsibilities, but deviates from company policy."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1802.87,1809.285,--Because in one case there is an employment action that is... that is within the... the supervisor's authority.
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1812.005,1814.668,But so is the right to tell how people behave on the beach.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1814.668,1820.531,And this is a case where the supervisor his self... himself or herself... is departing from the scope of that authority.
1997.97-282,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1820.531,1833.24,"Well, but think of the situation where the employer tells the supervisor to run an errand, drive the car downtown to buy supplies for the beach."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1842.906,1843.767,But if--
1997.97-282,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1843.767,1847.68,So... so how do you relate what happened here to that concept?
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1847.68,1854.645,"--Because in this particular case, the activities of the supervisor in question were in pursuit of his own personal agenda."
1997.97-282,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1860.477,1863.301,"Well, his responsibilities included supervising the employees."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1863.301,1865.461,It included supervising the employees.
1997.97-282,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1865.461,1866.28,Yes.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1866.28,1868.433,And... and there is no question that Mr. Terry and Mr. Silverman--
1997.97-282,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1868.433,1872.284,And he carried it out in a grossly improper fashion.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1872.284,1887.124,"--Well, I would suggest that there's a distinction between his supervisory actions and the frolics, or improprieties and misconduct, that he committed outside his supervisory responsibilities."
1997.97-282,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1902.394,1903.415,"No, but I think you're--"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1922.687,1937.516,"Well, if... if he says, I'm going to have my way with you once a week, there is legitimately a negative implication in that statement that if I don't, you're going to be fired or something bad is going to happen to you."
1997.97-282,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1945.132,1950.376,"Well, why don't we just concentrate on the act rather than... he doesn't say, I'm going to fire you."

1997.97-282,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1970.469,1979.734,"In other words, if that... if that were a term and condition of her employment imposed by the supervisor, there would still be no liability on the part of the employer?"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1979.734,1987.849,"--Your Honor, at... at the point we're on in the hypothetical, we're only a threat that the employer... that the supervisor says to the--"
1997.97-282,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1987.849,1991.091,"I'm not talking about words, because there were deeds here, too."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1991.091,1991.642,--Okay.
1997.97-282,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1991.642,1992.884,They didn't go that far.

1997.97-282,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2022.593,2023.293,"Well, that's the problem."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2029.096,2040.325,"--Well, we know in this case that... that... that there was no evidence in the record that the activities that these... that Silverman and Terry engaged in was anything more than gratuitous."
1997.97-282,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2040.325,2050.661,"Well, I'm just trying to find out, as far as the employer's liability is concerned, which is the issue before us, whether these are differences in degrees or difference in kind, whether it makes any difference."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2050.661,2058.956,"Well, the degree of grossness or the degree of coarseness, or whether it's verbal or... or physical, ought not to make an operative difference in the outcome."
1997.97-282,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2073.594,2074.757,"Well... well, I'm not so sure."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2099.862,2107.99,"--Well, in this particular case... and it's difficult to extrapolate from an anecdote... as soon as Miss Ewanchew wrote... wrote the letter, something happened."
1997.97-282,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2130.854,2133.146,What is subtle about the behavior that's described here?
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2133.146,2141.98,"--Well, to the extent that you're in a room and... and someone grabs a part of your anatomy and... and... and does so secretly, it is difficult for an outsider--"
1997.97-282,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2141.98,2144.812,"But there was nothing here, as far as I can tell, that was secret."

1997.97-282,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2168.258,2183.007,"Is that the nub of your argument, that it is... that it is more difficult for the employer to... to become aware of this kind of harassment than it is for the employer to become aware of racially discriminatory hiring?"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2190.683,2191.352,"That's part of it, Justice Souter."
1997.97-282,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2192.053,2193.055,What's the other... what's the other part?
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2193.055,2204.943,"--The other part of it is that when the employee takes an employment action, hiring somebody or not hiring somebody in a discriminatory fashion, the person taking that ultimate action is acting within the scope of his or her work."

1997.97-282,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2320.921,2323.512,Why is the situation any different when we get to sex harassment?
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2323.512,2333.48,"--Because in this particular case, the activity that was engaged in by the individual supervisors had nothing to do with the exercise of their supervisory authority."

1997.97-282,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2372.444,2373.085,Okay.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2379.58,2388.305,"--Well, the difference is that, in... in the case when the supervisor departs from the scope of employment, he's acting on his own."
1997.97-282,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2388.966,2403.756,"Well, if... if... if IBM refuses to hire a woman, and thereby violates the prohibition against discrimination based on sex, you don't need vicarious liability on the part of a supervisor or on the part of the hiring manager."

1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2562.812,2572.817,"But if there was... it wasn't... it was not within the public health exception, but just a general dirty place, and squalid... I suppose most of these do come down to health, don't they?"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2572.817,2573.348,--Yes.
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2573.348,2578.852,"But if it's some... if it's just simply unpleasant, you'd say you would not... you would not attribute it to the employer in this case?"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2578.852,2581.562,"Well, if it's noisy, Your Honor... I mean, I... I think--"
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2581.562,2583.284,Unless which actually caused harm.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2584.825,2585.406,--Yes.
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2590.378,2597.354,What you're saying is the public interest in avoiding this kind of environment is not as strong as the public interest in protecting the health of the worker?
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2597.354,2603.729,"--Well, from the perspective of the City of Boca Raton, they do have a strong interest in... in... in avoiding this."
1997.97-282,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2608.591,2609.011,Sure.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2620.699,2626.813,"--Well, hostile environment because of race is a... is... is... is... I would analogize it to this situation."
1997.97-282,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2628.024,2629.133,So the standards are to be the same?
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2629.133,2631.126,"--It... yes, in a parallel situation."
1997.97-282,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2636.96,2638.52,Then why don't you lose?
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2638.52,2652.349,"--We don't... I'm... Your Honor, I'm suggesting that... that... that there is... at least the lower court decisions do not draw a distinction between a hostile environment situation involving race and one involving sex."
1997.97-282,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2652.349,2652.83,All right.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2661.606,2667.728,"Because in a hiring/firing decision because of race, there's a company action made for which the company is responsible."
1997.97-282,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2667.728,2668.359,Yes.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2669.301,2670.142,Why?
1997.97-282,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2670.871,2676.145,Why do you say it's not vicarious liability in the one case but it is vicarious liability in the other case?
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2693.826,2697.059,"--I'm embarrassed to give you the same answer that I... I gave you before, Your Honor."
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2705.603,2718.042,"May... may I be sure I understood your answer to the comparative, two different kinds of hostile environment, one caused by the kind of situation we have here, and the other caused by a supervisor who doesn't like African Americans and he puts them all in the corner."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2723.157,2724.487,"--Yes, that would be the position--"
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2724.487,2724.968,I see.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2724.968,2731.291,--that negligence... the... the employer... in... in a case where the supervisor is not exercising--
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2731.291,2732.27,Have we ever--
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2732.27,2733.722,--and your hypothetical is slightly off--
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2733.722,2734.213,--Yes.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2734.213,2738.405,--but assuming that it... it was not within the scope of employment and he was not--
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2738.405,2744.779,"Well, the company has a policy in both cases against sexual harassment on the one kind, and against treating blacks differently than whites."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2753.935,2754.546,--They should be.
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2760.401,2761.722,"Well, the supervisor does it."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2763.963,2767.713,--But... but the act of making assignments down in the beach was in the scope of Terry's employment.
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2768.484,2770.965,"Well, but the same is true of my... the same is true of my... my black/white case, too."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2770.965,2771.596,--They would be parallel.
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2772.257,2772.878,"Yes, they would be parallel."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2772.878,2773.667,--they would be parallel.
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2781.664,2782.395,"No, no, no, not a gratuitous comment."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2786.297,2792.14,"--Well, but now... that... that's... I think in the case of the lifeguard and in the case of the... of the secretary--"
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2792.14,2792.621,Right.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2792.621,2794.221,"--race and sex, you would have the same outcome."
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2796.905,2800.365,"Oh, but if you say liable in both cases... but you're saying in this case your client is not liable."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2800.365,2804.079,"--Because the distinction is when I make assignments on a discriminatory basis, I'm liable."
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2813.904,2815.417,But... but you--
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2815.417,2815.897,And that is the fundamental distinction.
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2815.897,2825.804,"--Well, suppose... so you'd say, in my case, if the hostile environment for the black secretary was partly the assignment, but consisted mostly of racial epithets and the like, then it would be the same case?"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2825.804,2827.995,Then it would be the same case.
1997.97-282,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2827.995,2828.754,Okay.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2890.536,2892.357,We believe the objectives of Title VII would be hurt.
1997.97-282,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2892.357,2894.627,--And that's because of your policy argument.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2909.948,2910.629,I--
1997.97-282,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2910.629,2916.923,"That is, if you have a tough substantive standard, you risk, let's say, creating too much tension in the work place."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2933.794,2936.976,"--I... I think it's related to the problem of liability, as a practical matter."
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2978.714,2980.554,Then you sue and you recover $1.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2981.104,2982.484,"Well, we--"
1997.97-282,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2982.484,2983.055,That's what happened here.
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,2983.055,2989.081,"--this... unfortunate... or fortunately for the City of Boca Raton, this was prior to the amendments in 1991."
1997.97-282,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2994.996,3004.389,"We are going to have to address at... I think, at some point in this case, the constructive notice by reason of... of Gordon's involvement, and by his failure to report."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,3008.362,3008.773,Yes.
1997.97-282,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3025.733,3030.057,Is... is one standard whether or not he would have been disciplined for failure to make the report?
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,3030.057,3032.278,"Well, I think that the standard is whether he had a duty."
1997.97-282,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3041.254,3055.173,"It seem... it seemed to me that the... the counsel, in the Petitioner's brief, made the point, if he had... if Gordon had known that... I think Terry... was stealing money, I assume he probably would have been disciplined by the City for failure to report that."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,3056.475,3062.289,"--Well, Mr. Bender, when he testified, thought that the lifeguards themselves should have reported it to him that this was going on."
1997.97-282,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3073.415,3082.141,"Well, suppose I... suppose I knew that Gordon would be disciplined for failure to report theft by Terry, even though Gordon is not Terry's supervisor."
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,3082.141,3082.601,--Yes.
1997.97-282,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3082.601,3085.883,Would that mean that he should also report this?
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,3088.364,3089.146,No.
1997.97-282,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3092.419,3096.139,"So if he has the obligation to report theft, he'd also have the obligation to report sexual harassment?"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,3096.139,3100.033,--I would assume that there would be a presumption that that was correct.
1997.97-282,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3107.859,3108.457,What... what are the duties of supervisors?
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,3116.612,3118.775,"--Well, there's an expectation and a hope."
1997.97-282,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3129.692,3134.765,"Well, didn't Mr. Bender... wasn't he the witness who admitted that Gordon had an obligation to report this?"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,3134.765,3138.608,"--Yes, he said, in the same sentence, he said he also though the lifeguards had an obligation to report it, too."
1997.97-282,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3147.463,3160.342,"Mr. Rissetto, what difference does it make in your view, legally, whether the employer has a clear policy about sexual harassment and where to complain and so on, or the lack thereof?"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,3161.872,3164.134,--I... I think it is relevant to the question of negligence.
1997.97-282,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3170.618,3176.082,"Well, today, if an employer has such a policy, then... then is the employer protected or not?"
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,3176.082,3178.635,"--I... no, I don't believe the employer is protected."
1997.97-282,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3178.635,3179.124,How does it--
1997.97-282,2,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,3179.124,3181.846,I think the... the question in all cases is whether he knew or should have known.
1997.97-282,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3196.484,3197.065,"--Thank you, Mr. Rissetto."
1997.97-282,3,43755,william_r_amlong,,3199.296,3199.967,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1997.97-282,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3261.868,3266.633,"But your position was, even if there was a policy, it would make no difference; there would still be a trial."
1997.97-282,3,43755,william_r_amlong,,3266.633,3278.73,"Justice Ginsburg, my position is that if there was a policy, it would not make an automatic difference, that... but it would be a factor to be considered."
1997.97-282,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3357.935,3361.077,"Well, your brother... your brother says there would be no liability there."
1997.97-282,3,43755,william_r_amlong,,3386.232,3392.927,"Justice Souter, there is no principal distinction between that kind of discrimination and this kind of discrimination."
1997.97-282,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3392.927,3407.816,"Well, what about the claim that it's harder to find out... it's harder for the upper level employees, the management, to find out about hostile environments than it is for them to find out about discriminatory hiring and firing?"
1997.97-282,3,43755,william_r_amlong,,3407.816,3412.889,"It's especially hard to find out if there is no policy, and if Robert Gordon does not report it up, number one."
1997.97-282,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3412.889,3413.37,All right.
1997.97-282,3,43755,william_r_amlong,,3414.051,3423.535,"The... it is... I do not expect that a Klansman personnel manager is going to announce Mr. Smith, I'm not hiring you because you're black."
1997.97-282,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3439.878,3441.128,"Thank you, Mr. Amlong."
