2004.03-407,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.675,"We'll hear argument next in No. 03-407, John F. Kowalski v. John C. Tesmer."
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,66.009,70.383,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,105.677,108.855,--there is an injury in fact.
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,124.049,124.287,Yes.
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,132.76,141.592,"But you... you said now you were going on to the prudential factors, and so I asked were you recognizing that there was an injury in fact, and you said no."
2004.03-407,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,148.114,150.343,I take it you're reserving it for... in your... in your brief.
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,150.343,151.64,I... I am not waiving the argument.
2004.03-407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,228.156,231.128,May I clarify something about this case?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,248.673,251.273,Yes.
2004.03-407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.443,269.523,I'm asking if there are any individuals now before this Court in this case--
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,269.523,270.016,No.
2004.03-407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,271.956,277.901,--who would be available and who would have remedies or standing to bring their claims.
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,280.38,283.928,"--In this facial challenge, we're talking about pure hypotheticals."
2004.03-407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,286.241,288.675,There were three named indigents.
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,288.675,289.501,--Correct.
2004.03-407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,289.501,290.161,They were?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,290.161,291.73,They were denied counsel.
2004.03-407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,291.73,297.758,"Denied counsel, and they were also dismissed at some point down the line?"
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,297.758,297.841,Yes.
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,312.952,315.591,"--Mr. Casey, was it a Younger abstention--"
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,315.591,316.128,Yes.
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,316.128,317.077,--with respect to the--
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,317.077,326.326,"The... the Sixth Circuit en banc held that under Younger v. Harris, the Federal court should abstain from deciding the claims of the three indigent defendants."
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,326.326,332.681,--So that means that the defendants could never bring this 1983 suit.
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,334.789,335.026,No.
2004.03-407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,353.736,353.736,"Why didn't these lawyers instead of... instead of trying to sue on their own, why didn't they just offer their services to... to these defendants through the State courts?"
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,353.736,362.653,"--Your Honor, perhaps opposing counsel could answer that better than I."
2004.03-407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.187,374.049,"I mean, that's what I don't understand about... about the fact that they won't... won't have the right to counsel."
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,382.405,385.749,"--That is our point on the standing issue precisely, Your Honor."
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,385.749,399.002,"Didn't... didn't the Michigan Supreme Court already rule on this issue and said that the statute was constitutional, that there was no right to counsel, therefore no possibility of appointing counsel, paid counsel?"
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,399.002,399.457,That's correct.
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,429.428,440.695,"So going through the State system, there's no possibility that these lawyers or the defendants could successfully assert a right to paid counsel--"
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,440.695,442.06,That is correct.
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,442.06,444.184,--because that's already been decided by the Michigan Supreme Court.
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,444.184,447.799,"As... as a matter of jurisprudence by the State supreme court, yes."
2004.03-407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,449.656,455.906,"There... there's an appeal from... they could request certiorari from the State supreme court to this Court, I assume."
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,455.906,459.483,"--There are, in fact, two cases pending, the Harris case that I just mentioned."
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,468.316,470.628,Was there... was there a cert petition in Bulger itself?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,470.628,471.909,--There was a petition in Bulger.
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.909,472.214,And it was denied.
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,472.214,472.857,It was denied.
2004.03-407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,475.252,479.506,But there... there is a cert petition filed in what case?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,481.568,487.678,--In the... the case is pending in this Court as Melody Harris v. Michigan.
2004.03-407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,518.059,532.549,So your point is that there are petitions filed here that would enable this Court to decide whether the Michigan Supreme Court was correct in holding the statute constitutional.
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,532.549,533.004,That's correct.
2004.03-407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,538.122,542.292,Do you acknowledge there is a good Federal question there at least?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,542.292,542.952,"Oh, yes."
2004.03-407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,544.438,545.181,Yes.
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,545.181,552.573,"We... we... in the Bulger case, I opposed certiorari, saying that yes, it's an important question, but it was correctly decided."
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,564.666,570.239,"That's the position you've taken in... in the Halbert case, that the Court should take the case?"
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,570.239,583.242,"What I said in the Halbert case is that the Court need not grant this petition now because, although it's an important question, the issue is pending in... in this Tesmer, the current case, Kowalski v. Tesmer."
2004.03-407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.985,602.933,Do they have lawyers in those cases?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,602.933,605.533,"Now, the Halbert petition is pro se."
2004.03-407,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,616.845,634.595,"May I ask you if in exercising prudential judgment on whether to accord prudential standing, because I guess there's article III standing here, is it appropriate to take into consideration as one fact that it's already been argued in this case and it's now ripe for decision, or should we just totally ignore that aspect of the case?"
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,634.595,642.89,"As a matter of judicial economy, there is a point to be made that it... the issue has been briefed and argued."
2004.03-407,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,652.14,656.97,"No, but in that case there was a conflict between the interests of the third party and the interests of the litigant or a potential client."
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,659.57,660.314,--That's true.
2004.03-407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.223,672.74,"Of course, also bearing upon our prudential judgment, I... I suppose, would be that in order to reach the merits, we have to do what you assert to be an end run around the Younger abstention."
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,673.938,675.629,That's... that's correct.
2004.03-407,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,689.624,693.877,But... but why isn't the Younger abstention problem just like the mootness problem in Craig against Boren?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,704.485,715.796,"Well, in determining prudential standing, there are several criteria that should be examined in deciding whether there's an exception to the general rule where a litigant cannot argue the rights of third parties."
2004.03-407,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.376,753.32,"No, but they have the same interest that the bartenders had because they won't make some... sell their services and the bartenders wouldn't sell the booze."
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,754.601,761.743,"--Well, in... in Craig v. Boren, the... if the bartenders did not comply with the statute, they'd be subject to criminal penalties."
2004.03-407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,764.715,764.948,"Well, why--"
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,764.948,773.26,That wasn't true... that wasn't true in the Pierce v. Society of Sisters case and it wasn't true in the Singleton case.
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,785.753,787.544,That's... that's true.
2004.03-407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,797.946,804.346,--But isn't... isn't the biggest distinguishing factor the one that you raised in response to Justice Scalia's question?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,815.508,816.772,That... precisely.
2004.03-407,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,848.927,855.243,"Well, is it correct as a factual matter that these particular lawyers do have clients that they could be representing--"
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,855.243,857.184,That is not in--
2004.03-407,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,857.184,857.638,--on direct appeal?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,857.638,858.465,--that is not in the record.
2004.03-407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,885.048,886.163,But the... the claim that... I'm sorry.
2004.03-407,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,886.163,899.703,"Well, it just would seem to me that the lawyers who are advancing this claim may or may not be representing individuals who want to make the same claim, but there... there must be some lawyers who want to make these claims who don't have any clients, and the question is whether they have standing."
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,903.418,911.797,"--In our view, as a general proposition, lawyers should not be given independent standing to raise claims of their clients."
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,920.963,926.286,Is that different from Caplin & Drysdale where the lawyers didn't raise the interest of the client and--
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,926.286,931.942,"--Again, there was an actual client in that case and there was significant money at stake."
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,939.555,941.601,"--But as far as the actual client, you moved to dismiss."
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,950.684,951.51,--That... that's correct.
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,951.51,953.534,--in favor of the opponent of the motion.
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,953.534,954.377,That's correct.
2004.03-407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,964.308,976.363,"But if... if you assume... you assume the correctness of the allegations, which you... you have to do at this point, the allegation is that they would get clients and would be paid but for this bar to payment."
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,987.22,987.714,--Correct.
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1051.15,1055.003,How could an indigent bring a 1983 case?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1058.718,1062.766,"--If they had a pending prosecution, it would be barred by Younger."
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1067.817,1068.339,Could they?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1078.203,1089.449,"Under Heck v. Humphrey, if the outcome of the 1983 case would necessarily imply that the conviction or sentence is invalid, you cannot bring the 1983 case."
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1105.241,1113.953,"Well, if that... that... that's... you're saying that the defendants themselves could not sue now under 1983?"
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1113.953,1122.869,--A... a defendant who is currently in the State system on direct appeal is barred by the abstention doctrine from filing a 1983 action.
2004.03-407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1130.549,1132.118,"--And presumably up to this Court, if they want to come that far."
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1132.118,1132.657,"--Oh, certainly."
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1191.893,1192.925,And do you... do you agree that that's right?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1198.952,1203.494,--We are not filing a petition for certiorari from that decision.
2004.03-407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.528,1228.468,"Of course, what the other side says is, well, yes, maybe they can bring these suits, but in all of those suits, they don't have counsel, what they... what they--"
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1228.468,1230.903,That's true.
2004.03-407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1259.138,1263.391,What... what do we look to in order to verify what... what you've just said?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1270.7,1277.016,The court rules concerning applications for leave do not set out specific standards.
2004.03-407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1283.582,1285.189,But what are the standards they use?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1288.533,1294.272,"To the best of my knowledge, there are no published standards in court rule or statute on that."
2004.03-407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1301.868,1311.239,"Can you give me an example of where they grant leave to appeal, and if not... and it's not one of the exceptions listed in the statute such as incorrect--"
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1311.239,1311.611,If... if--
2004.03-407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1311.611,1312.521,--such as incorrect sentencing?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1312.521,1318.481,"--Well, if... under the statute, if the court of appeals grants leave, counsel is automatically appointed."
2004.03-407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1318.481,1319.329,Right.
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1326.182,1327.918,They're... most often they are sentencing issues.
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1360.285,1369.284,Do we... do we know whether any of those were cases that didn't fall under the four categories where you a... a right to?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1369.284,1373.742,"In every case where there was an opinion, counsel was appointed."
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1375.024,1387.2,"But one of the problems, I thought, for the indigent is the rulings... am I correct... in Michigan, that they're not required... say, there's an objection."
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1397.437,1400.659,"I believe you're incorrect on that, Your Honor."
2004.03-407,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1477.58,1488.232,"Well, now, your... your opponents quote some language from the... one of the Michigan court of appeals which suggests that the reason that an appeal was denied was it had no merit."
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1488.232,1499.515,"--A... a typical order that the court of appeals issues when it denies an application for leave to appeal says, denied for lack of merit on the grounds presented."
2004.03-407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1522.245,1524.286,What... what are they getting at when they say merit?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1533.657,1537.911,--I... I do not know why the court of appeals uses that language.
2004.03-407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1539.647,1544.393,Isn't the reasonable thing to assume that they use it as we would normally expect it to--
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1544.393,1544.97,"--Well, the--"
2004.03-407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1544.97,1546.706,--to mean by the words they use?
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1546.706,1552.029,"--On its face, that would be the first impression that is given from those words."
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1587.695,1598.552,"Is it true that Michigan is the only State in the Union so far that denies counsel on a first appeal, whether discretionary or mandatory?"
2004.03-407,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1598.552,1599.916,I believe that is incorrect.
2004.03-407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1624.37,1625.484,Not... not the right of appeal.

2004.03-407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1671.143,1677.376,"Well, Mr. Moran, this is a very important question, whether the Michigan law can survive."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,1705.073,1708.499,"It is, of course, possible, Justice O'Connor, that this Court could do that."
2004.03-407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1708.499,1720.471,"And if we were to grant you standing here, wouldn't we have sort of expanded our existing holdings on who has standing?"
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,1720.471,1721.214,"Not at all, Justice O'Connor."
2004.03-407,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1763.363,1766.046,"Well, it doesn't really disentitle the client to representation."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,1771.043,1778.473,"--Mr. Chief Justice, that wouldn't be practical, and that raises a point that Justice Souter also raised in the argument."
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1800.309,1807.656,"But isn't the answer that all they have to do is to say, okay, I will represent him but I am representing him with a claim for funds?"

2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1830.115,1830.608,Right.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,1830.608,1831.517,--or those would be lost forever--
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1831.517,1831.988,Absolutely.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,1831.988,1833.291,--because the time would fly.
2004.03-407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1845.923,1853.436,"Well, which... which indigent defendants are the attorney plaintiffs asserting claims on behalf of here?"
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,1856.037,1863.346,"This was... this was... for Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler, they were challenging both the prestatutory practice of the three defendant judges."

2004.03-407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1871.064,1879.404,"Well, I'm trying to find out what indigent criminal defendants are these attorneys attempting to represent here."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,1879.404,1880.64,--They routinely take appointments.
2004.03-407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1881.672,1883.036,Future defendants?
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,1883.036,1885.115,--Presently and future defendants.
2004.03-407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1885.115,1886.502,Past defendants?

2004.03-407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1888.154,1899.505,"Well, if it's past defendants who were convicted and didn't have counsel, how is it consistent with Heck v. Humphrey that they could be here, these attorneys?"
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,1899.505,1900.703,--I think I... I think I misspoke.
2004.03-407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1914.988,1922.539,"Well, are you asserting then that these attorney respondents are here trying to represent future defendants?"
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,1922.539,1924.458,Present and future defendants.
2004.03-407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1924.458,1929.598,"And if it's present defendants, how is that consistent with Younger?"
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,1932.365,1934.223,"Well, they're not representing any named defendants."
2004.03-407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1941.282,1945.74,"Well, if it's future people, how is it consistent with Los Angeles v. Lyons?"
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,1951.85,1958.166,"--Well, they're in exactly the same position as the bartender in... or the beer vendor in... in Craig v. Boren."
2004.03-407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2000.065,2003.576,"Well, of course, in Triplett, the attorneys themselves were subject to discipline."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2010.55,2011.088,--That's--
2004.03-407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.088,2012.202,And the same thing in the bar case.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2027.64,2036.556,"--But Justice Scalia, this Court has never held that such a restriction is a condition precedent or required in order for a person to assert third party rights."
2004.03-407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.556,2050.674,"That's so, but we've never held what you want us to hold either, that... that when the law does not bear upon you personally, you have the right to raise the claim of a prospective client."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2051.955,2060.007,"Well, in... Singleton is a case in which there was no direct sanction against the doctors who provided Medicaid abortions."
2004.03-407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2060.007,2065.951,"Well, just as... as to Triplett and Boren, you can't cite those two cases and say those are controlling and then say, well, we've never held it."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2065.951,2067.437,I'm sorry.
2004.03-407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2068.755,2074.579,"Well, we've said that Triplett and... and Boren are... are distinguishable, and you said, well, we've never ruled on this point."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2077.013,2093.36,"Well, I think you have ruled on this Court... point by many times recognizing that even persons against whom the statute or law would not directly affect... for example, all the way back to 1925 with Pierce v. Society of Sisters, there was no legal prohibition against the school."
2004.03-407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2101.45,2105.537,It was... a prohibition was on the parents and there were no parents as plaintiffs in that case--
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2105.537,2105.992,--That's right.
2004.03-407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2105.992,2106.53,--only the schools.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2106.53,2107.766,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2123.081,2138.025,"But there was a problem, wasn't there, in Singleton that... that the part that said that the doctors could raise the patients' right as opposed to the doctor's own right to practice or whatever, that that was only a plurality?"
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2138.025,2140.254,That was a plurality portion of the opinion.
2004.03-407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.254,2141.369,"Well, it shouldn't be cited then."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2144.425,2153.917,"Well, actually we've cited it in our brief only for the article III proposition which this Court unanimously agreed that the doctors had article III standing because there was an economic energy--"
2004.03-407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.917,2161.143,You... I thought you were citing it here for the quite different proposition that... that you can raise third party rights.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2161.143,2167.088,--But ultimately this Court in Singleton allowed the doctors' claim on behalf of the patients to proceed.
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2170.431,2183.517,I... I could accept... I guess I probably would accept your position if I did not think there... there was another equally workable alternative here.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2225.416,2227.745,"I think I might have misunderstood your question, Justice Souter."
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2236.606,2236.811,"Oh, no."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2257.328,2267.813,"--If that attempt... if that method were attempted, Mr. Casey would undoubtedly argue that the attorney would not be entitled to any funding because the attorney was never appointed."
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2273.18,2275.243,"Well, except that that's a very formalistic answer."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2300.385,2308.763,"The problem is is that the way the Michigan system works, it works on a strict rotation system, and so there's no... there's no line-jumping here."
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2318.051,2319.62,"Okay, but these... these lawyers are in the rotation."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2324.45,2325.072,"--No, not at all."
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2325.238,2325.694,Okay.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2325.694,2326.149,--They routinely--
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2326.149,2332.464,"I mean, your... your claim is that they are going to get clients in the future and they... they ought to have a right to be paid when the time comes."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2349.926,2360.412,--I think it's clear that the Michigan courts would unquestionably hold that a lawyer who simply inserts himself into a relationship without formal court appointment is not entitled to be paid.
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2360.412,2363.922,"Sure they would, and that's what will get brought to this Court."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2365.324,2370.238,"But the problem is, Justice Souter, we would then have an issue of Michigan law inserted as to whether--"
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2370.238,2378.987,"No, because the claim is that they have a right under Federal law to an effective procedure whereby paid counsel can be supplied to them."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2381.505,2384.106,"--That part is a Federal issue, but what Michigan--"
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2384.106,2385.403,That's all you've got to get up here.
2004.03-407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.403,2386.418,It's at least an argument.
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2386.418,2387.328,It's an argument.
2004.03-407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.328,2394.32,"And even if they lose on it, they still will have... would have raised the issue that you are most concerned about getting raised."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2408.133,2412.441,"--And they will have to do so without any prospect of being paid, and that's... that's the problem."
2004.03-407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2412.441,2413.827,Who's paying them for this lawsuit?
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2413.827,2415.685,They're not being paid for this lawsuit.
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2415.685,2415.951,Right.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2430.706,2433.595,"Because Justice Souter, they would have to represent them on all of their issues."
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2438.947,2440.843,Without being paid if they lose--
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2440.843,2441.586,--in this litigation.
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2441.586,2443.072,--being paid if they win.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2450.214,2451.04,And--
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2451.04,2453.558,And they'd be better off to represent a real client.
2004.03-407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2453.558,2454.096,That's right.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2457.19,2467.221,"--In... in this lawsuit, if we win on the merits, they will then get far more appointments on the rotation system and then they will get paid for those appointments."
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2467.221,2468.973,Why will they get more appointments?
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2468.973,2469.822,Because--
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2469.822,2471.929,I thought you said there's a strict rotation system.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2475.911,2480.762,"--Because the statute, which is now in effect... and this goes, by the way, back to the issue of prudential standing--"
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2480.762,2484.643,"Oh, you're just saying there... there's going to be a further class of clients to be represented on the rotation."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2484.643,2484.743,--Correct.
2004.03-407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2485.386,2487.698,"Okay, but that's... that's true."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2487.698,2494.84,"And... and while this Court considers these issues of prudential standing, thousands of Michigan defendants will be denied the right to counsel--"
2004.03-407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2494.84,2507.927,"And while this suit is being brought, we can't do the simple thing, which is to take a case from an indigent who's raising it that we happen to have on our docket and face it directly because everybody is tied up in these knots on standing."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2518.823,2522.788,--Because there... there was no person in position at the time.
2004.03-407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2538.392,2539.794,I see... I see that.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2561.714,2562.086,--No.
2004.03-407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2562.086,2562.64,All right.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2596.72,2597.091,Your--
2004.03-407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2597.091,2598.373,That's the question I'd like answered.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2598.373,2618.351,"--Your Honor, the only kind of case to which this applies is a case exactly like Triplett, a case exactly like Caplin & Drysdale where the claim is that the underlying change in the law or the underlying law disenfranchises or disentitles the indigent or the criminal defendant or the defendant to representation."
2004.03-407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2618.351,2619.094,Because?
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2619.094,2628.587,"Because, first of all, if the indigent or the client still has representation, then there is no hindrance to the third party raising it themselves."
2004.03-407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2628.587,2629.33,Why is that?
2004.03-407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2631.271,2631.454,"No, no."
2004.03-407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2631.659,2632.197,--have the same result?
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2667.658,2670.796,"Because the client could raise it directly, represented by the attorney."
2004.03-407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2674.612,2675.255,--No.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2703.656,2711.791,"But this Court's precedents indicate, Justice Breyer, that the indigents do have a significant hindrance to filing their claims themselves."
2004.03-407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2711.791,2711.929,"Oh, okay."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2741.157,2741.611,But I think--
2004.03-407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2741.611,2742.81,But everything comes down to that.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2743.182,2751.355,--I think an answer I need to give to... to cut through all of this is that third party standing is never predicated on the impossible.
2004.03-407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2775.42,2777.937,It was altogether possible there had been a young man.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2784.253,2792.965,"Right, but this Court never suggested that it was... showing that it was impossible for someone to quickly get his claim before the court was--"
2004.03-407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2792.965,2793.996,I think I agree with you on that.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2810.527,2816.121,"--Well, the problem is is that in the meantime thousands of Michigan indigents are going to be denied counsel."
2004.03-407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2816.121,2821.322,May I ask you a practical question about what is currently before the Court?
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2850.301,2854.387,"That may well be a wise course of action... action, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2882.873,2888.157,But he said now he's not taking that position in the Halbert case.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2888.157,2897.195,"But I can be confident that if there are any procedural hurdles to this Court's exercise of jurisdiction in any of the State cases, Mr. Casey will alert this Court of them."
2004.03-407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2957.464,2976.579,"But... but no facts... no additional facts would... would affect the central point that... that we've been devoting most of this discussion to, which is whether there is an impediment or not to... to the... the actual individuals whose rights your clients are asserting raising their own rights."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2980.377,2981.613,"I agree with you on that, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2981.613,2984.752,Then what case holds that there must be an impediment for the third party?
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,2996.928,2998.293,"I agree with you, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.293,3001.841,What is the source of the requirement there must be an impediment to the third party suit?
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,3001.841,3006.299,"Well, this Court has said so many times, and Powers v. Ohio, for example, noted the impediment to the--"
2004.03-407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3006.299,3007.375,That... where they granted standing.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,3007.375,3008.368,--That's right.
2004.03-407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3008.368,3013.031,Have they ever denied standing on the ground that there was no impediment to the third party suit?
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,3015.055,3022.03,I don't believe in all of the cases that both parties cited that there are any cases in which this Court has said that there was no impediment to the third party.
2004.03-407,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3024.093,3026.505,"Well, do you think that was just idle observation then?"
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,3026.505,3027.975,"--Not at all, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.03-407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3029.173,3031.895,"It doesn't have to be idle to be dicta, though, does it?"
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,3031.895,3042.276,"There... we... we fully concede there need to be an impediment, but what it does not require is the showing that it is impossible for someone to get here."
2004.03-407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3054.186,3058.152,Do you fully concede there must be an impediment even though the Court has never so held?
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,3058.152,3088.124,"I'm willing to concede that because it is so clear to me that there is, that there is an impediment that trying to get into Federal court, trying to get here, for that matter, trying to get into Federal district court... for an indigent, a typical person who is very likely... someone like Mr. Carter, functionally illiterate, poorly educated, completely unaware of his rights, to try and navigate the... the procedural hurdles of the Michigan system to get all the way through the Michigan system and then into Federal court, that is a daunting hurdle."
2004.03-407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3143.396,3157.802,"Could... could you give me an example, just from your experience in practice, where there's an important issue raised after a guilty plea that requires an appeal where it's not one of the statutory exceptions?"
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,3157.802,3158.545,"Many, many."
2004.03-407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3158.545,3160.486,Most... what are... what are those cases?
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,3160.486,3164.368,"Improper denial of jail credit, making... improper denial of jail credit."
2004.03-407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3164.368,3165.111,That's not sentencing?
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,3165.111,3167.118,That is a sentencing error.
2004.03-407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3167.118,3168.454,"Okay, but that's covered by the statute."
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,3168.454,3169.031,"No, it's not."
2004.03-407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3174.398,3174.975,Okay.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,3174.975,3184.718,"--and for... and then if the indigent gets the appeal granted, but that's putting... that's after the indigent has had to file an application identifying his or her own issues without any assistance of counsel."
2004.03-407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3199.019,3203.582,Are there instances where Michigan has denied the right to appeal when those claims are raised?
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,3203.582,3210.807,"--The problem, Your Honor, is that an indigent can't raise... a typical indigent would be completely incapable of identifying this... these sorts of issues."
2004.03-407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3210.807,3213.202,His counsel will have raised them.
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,3218.199,3224.16,"Your Honor, Michigan requires that ineffective assistance of counsel claims be raised on direct appeal."
2004.03-407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3342.203,3344.637,Are you familiar with the Halbert case?
2004.03-407,1,21199,david_a_moran,,3348.352,3350.127,"I'm not familiar with that case, Your Honor."
2004.03-407,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3377.802,3379.81,"Thank you, Mr. Moran."
2004.03-407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3381.956,3387.862,Did you waive the objection to prudential standing--
2004.03-407,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3387.862,3389.636,We did not waive any of the standing claims in this case.
2004.03-407,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3409.343,3412.049,Did you file a brief in opposition in Halbert?
2004.03-407,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3412.049,3413.33,"Yes, I did."
2004.03-407,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3415.104,3417.416,And does that have any procedural impediments?
2004.03-407,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3417.416,3419.108,Not to my knowledge.
2004.03-407,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3437.562,3439.67,So what was the basis for your opposition to cert?
2004.03-407,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3439.67,3446.479,--That the Court need not grant cert in that case because the issue is pending in this case.
2004.03-407,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3547.409,3549.101,"Thank you, Mr. Casey."
