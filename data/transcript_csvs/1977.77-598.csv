1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,16.646,We will hear arguments first this morning in Greyhound Corp. against Mt. Hood Stages
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,23.116,25.493,Mr. Chief Justice and May I please the Court.
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,75.452,77.225,Give me that last figure again.
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,77.225,82.919,Approximately $8 million.
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,220.356,226.64,"What do you say was the purpose of the government's intervention in this case, Mr. Reese?"
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,226.64,242.938,"The purpose of the government's intervention in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, was to assure that the Interstate Commerce Commission took into account competitive policies as it is required to do under Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act."
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,242.938,248.767,"Just to pursue that, what would be the consequences of its participation?"
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,259.391,268.233,"No, Your Honor, there would not be and as we understand the law, as announced by this Court in McLean Trucking Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway, that could not follow."
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,268.233,273.705,Then what was the real impact of their being there?
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,281.611,298.295,"Well, that is pretty accurate, I think, Mr. Chief Justice. One of the duties of the Anti-Trust Division of the Justice Department is to participate before administrative agencies that are required to take into consideration competitive policies in their regulatory decision making."
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,298.295,304.965,Do you say an intervention by the United States could never toll the statute?
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,304.965,310.58,"Mr. Chief Justice, we do not want to take such an extreme position as to say it could never toll the statute."
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,342.398,351.433,"Of course, the Department of Justice Anti-Trust Division itself does not punish or restrain, does it?"
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,358.8,362.135,"That is absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.77-598,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,469.893,478.665,Did the government or the Anti-Trust Division have an absolute right of intervention in the ICC proceedings?
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,478.665,480.054,"No, it did not, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1977.77-598,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,488.453,495.32,Did its petition recite the purpose of its intervention or of its motion for leave to intervene?
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,495.32,499.782,The petition recited that only the United States was an interested party in the proceeding.
1977.77-598,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,507.253,524.722,Is there any need in the light of the broader enforcement procedures of the anti-trust laws for the Anti-Trust Division to intervene in these administrative proceedings as a predicate to later bringing suit under the anti-trust laws?
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,529.943,532.861,"None, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1977.77-598,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,534.998,539.725,"Anytime, with or without any motion for leave to intervene in these ICC proceedings?"
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,539.725,543.83,That is correct.
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,712.445,735.421,"Does the judgment which you are challenging now depend in any parts, in whole or in part, using the language of the statute now on any matter complained of in the said proceeding, that is, in the ICC proceeding in which the government intervened?"
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,735.421,740.291,The judgment we are currently attacking is not based upon any matter complained of by the government in the ICC proceeding.
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,740.291,748.56,"Not complained of by the government, complained of by Mt. Hood, that is my question."
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,748.56,760.313,"The charges in the Interstate Commerce Commission proceeding as to acts and practices are very similar to the charges of acts and practices, or at least some of them, in the anti-trust case."
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,760.313,770.918,"Well, then why does this case not within that language which I believe is your brief?"
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,820.451,826.665,There are similar basis for the charges in the anti-trust case and in the ICC proceeding.
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,844.515,851.043,"In other words, it must be the United States that is making the anti-trust complaint in your view?"
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,851.043,852.023,"Yes, it is."
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,852.023,855.363,Not the injured party.
1977.77-598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,855.363,860.037,"That certainly was Congress' view too, do you not think, in enacting 1969?"
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,860.037,875.802,"I think, certainly, the statute contemplates that the action upon which the private plaintiff awaits to take advantage of is a government action in which the government makes a complaint against an alleged anti-trust violator."
1977.77-598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,877.784,894.184,"Is the reason for that not that the superior resources at the disposal of the government may unravel a lot of things that private plaintiffs by themselves could not unravel, and therefore, it is reasonable to let private plaintiffs ride on a tail of an action that was brought by the government?"
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,894.184,903.039,That is the way we understand the purpose to have been conceived by Congress in 1914.
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,903.039,915.121,Why do you think it makes any difference whether the private litigant rides on the government or whether the government rides on the private litigant's proceeding?
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,915.121,923.624,"It seems to me, Mr. Chief Justice, that that is what the statute says and that is what the statute was designed to accomplish."
1977.77-598,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,923.624,940.806,"But you also say, I take it, in your brief that even if the intervention could be thought of as an instituting the case, the government did not complain of anything in that suit?"
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,940.806,941.972,"That is right, Mr. Justice White."
1977.77-598,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,946.668,952.011,So it did not complain of anything in that suit that the petitioner in that suit may have complained of?
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,952.011,953.34,That is right.
1977.77-598,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.34,956.415,Why did it intervene?
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,956.415,973.391,"I believe, in answer to the Chief Justice's question earlier, I indicated that it does have a duty under its mission to participate before administrative agencies, which agencies are required by law to take into account policies of competition."
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,974.805,986.774,"Was it just an interested spectator and if so, could not the government do this from the bleachers without joining in the action?"
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,986.774,991.71,"Your Honor, the record really does not show much about what the government did."
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1005.001,1011.371,"Well, that could be because they thought that the private party was doing well enough without them."
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,1011.371,1012.079,That may be.
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1020.058,1030.337,"But your focus, I take it, is that the government as such did not institute any proceeding either to prevent, to restrain, or to punish."
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,1030.337,1033.387,That is right.
1977.77-598,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1033.387,1039.064,Is it on that basis that you distinguish the Minnesota Mining case?
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,1039.064,1049.679,"The Minnesota Mining case, I believe, is related to a point that is almost not involved in this case."
1977.77-598,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1072.018,1076.476,"Well, that is the point of my inquiry, that it was government instituted."
1977.77-598,0,32529,john_r_reese,,1076.476,1084.155,"I was a little slow on the uptake there, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1977.77-598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1438.868,1449.31,"Thank you, Mr. Reese."
1977.77-598,1,22067,eugene_c_crew,,1450.804,1459.17,Mr. Chief Justice and May I please the Court.
1977.77-598,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1550.631,1568.181,"Where do you say that the intervention of the United States fits into the language of the statute as a proceeding instituted by the United States to prevent, restrain, or punish?"
1977.77-598,1,22067,eugene_c_crew,,1581.525,1600.592,"Mr. Chief Justice, the government and I would point out that it was the Anti-Trust Division of the Justice Department, not another division such as the Tax Division or the Civil Rights Division, but it was the Anti-Trust Division of the Justice Department that petitioned for leave to intervene in December 1964."
1977.77-598,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1628.044,1630.829,What relief did they ask for?
1977.77-598,1,22067,eugene_c_crew,,1630.829,1631.666,Mr. Justice Marshall.
1977.77-598,2,32529,john_r_reese,,3476.625,3481.616,I only wanted to take up about two points.
