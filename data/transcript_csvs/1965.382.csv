1965.382,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,41.887,"Number 382, Frank J. Pate, Warden, petitioner versus Theodore Robinson."
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,50.811,54.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,119.831,130.122,"In Illinois, this is for a matter of information, is it always the jury which makes the determination of whether or not a defendant is insane at the time of trial?"
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,130.122,131.589,At the time of trial Your Honor?
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,131.589,131.9,Yes.
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,131.9,133.02,Yes.
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,137.616,143.027,"I suppose the prosecution if the question is raised could -- could say yes, he is, and then there would be no issue."
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,143.027,143.883,"That would be, I assume so, Your Honor."
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,143.883,150.195,"But if -- but if -- if the matter has put an issue, that's for a jury to determine is it under the Illinois practice?"
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,150.195,154.696,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,538.314,544.651,What you're telling us is all the -- is -- is the evidence that was adduced on behalf of the defendant --
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,544.651,545.024,On the --
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,545.024,546.487,-- at the state criminal trial.
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,546.487,549.579,Your -- that's correct Your Honor.
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,549.579,550.486,Before the jury?
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,550.486,551.784,Before -- well before the judge.
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.956,553.025,That's right --
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,553.025,553.828,-- and collected this --
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,553.828,555.246,-- before the trial.
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,555.246,560.093,That's right Your Honor.
1965.382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.066,722.733,Was there any [Inaudible]
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,722.733,730.746,Only what can be inferred from the testimony of Dr. Haines Your Honor which of course directly relates to his insanity at the time of the trial.
1965.382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.381,736.206,[Inaudible]
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,736.206,738.035,Yes it is Your Honor.
1965.382,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,738.035,742.874,"Does Illin -- Illinois law does make a distinction between those two, doesn't it?"
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,742.874,754.428,"Oh yes, Your Honor, insanity at the time of the -- of the trial, the test is whether you are insane at the -- whether you are able to understand the nature of the charges against you and aid your own defense."
1965.382,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,767.977,769.879,So that the standards aren't different under --
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,769.879,770.847,Yes they are Your Honor.
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,770.847,772.505,And of course the results are different --
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,772.505,772.874,They -- well maybe --
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,772.874,773.911,-- insanity as well.
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,776.901,777.874,That's correct Your Honor.
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,777.874,780.059,And then I suppose he is committed.
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,780.059,782.349,He -- he is institutionalized until he either regain insanity.
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,782.349,784.368,But he regained insanity then he can be tried.
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,784.368,785.387,Right Your Honor.
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,785.387,798.565,"And if its insanity applying to what Mr. Justice Fortas said (Voice Overlap) the different test of its insanity at the time of the -- of the conduct for which he's being prosecuted, it's not a crime if he was insane so he is --"
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,798.565,799.893,He's acquitted and that's double jeopardy --
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,799.893,803.298,"-- he's acquitted and I suppose also institutionalized, is that right?"
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,803.298,807.646,I don't think there is any required institutionalization in that regard.
1965.382,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,810.128,811.77,"Right, right."
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,817.388,822.181,Right Your Honor.
1965.382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,885.257,896.939,[Inaudible] of not that you stated but the -- but the question of whether he was denied the procedural due process.
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,896.939,902.596,He was denied the procedural -- I'm not quite sure what you mean by the --
1965.382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,902.596,913.272,Certainly he wanted to call â€“ let's just assume that he wanted to call some witnesses on an issue that was critical to the case and the state refused to hear his witnesses.
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,922.371,930.456,"Well of course Your Honor, if there was a violation of -- of one -- of a right guaranteed by the Constitution, of course that is cognizable."
1965.382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,930.456,933.45,"Well, isn't that what the (Voice Overlap)"
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,933.45,933.567,Well the (Voice Overlap)
1965.382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.567,942.845,"Well at least the Court of Appeals in a different way as I suppose, but didn't they come pretty close to deciding that there was a denial of procedural due process?"
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,942.845,944.041,I think not Your Honor.
1965.382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,944.344,950.773,Let's assume they did then this matter is cognizable on habeas corpus?
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,950.773,960.284,"If -- if there is a -- found to be a violation of what this Court has held to be procedural due process, clearly, the -- it is within the scope of federal habeas corpus."
1965.382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.284,977.91,But the -- the argument you are making was simply that a federal court of habeas corpus will not review or go through the same routine again if the only claim is that this fellow was really insane although the State held he wasn't.
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,978.906,982.752,The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Your Honor remanded the case rehearing of two issues.
1965.382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.752,984.719,I know but I am just asking what your argument is.
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,984.719,989.991,"Yes, that is -- that is my contention Your Honor."
1965.382,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1013.352,1022.578,Well was the issue of insanity at the time of the offense presented and ruled on by the trial judge?
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,1022.578,1033.837,The issue of insanity at the time of the crime as a defense constituted the entire defense asserted by the defendant to the charge of criminal activity Your Honor.
1965.382,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1033.837,1048.26,And are you telling us that the only testimony in the record is the testimony of -- is the statement of the psychiatrist with respect to mental condition at the time of the trial?
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,1048.26,1049.265,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1965.382,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1057.529,1077.33,Was there any request on the part of the respondent's counsel to -- or process or other procedures by which they could produce psychiatric testimony on the defendant's behalf?
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,1077.33,1082.686,"If Your Honor, I will refer you to the record first to page 30."
1965.382,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1082.686,1084.618,Does that relate to Moore?
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,1084.618,1096.888,"No, this is not related to Moore Your Honor."
1965.382,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1254.048,1259.296,I'm very grateful to you.
1965.382,0,39845,richard_a_michael,,1259.296,1279.651,"We contend that the issue that the -- of insanity at the time of the -- that the holding of the Seventh Circuit, the issue of insanity at the time of crime is cognizable on federal habeas corpus is contrary with the decision of the five Courts of Appeal that ruled in the case and the decision of this case and Leland versus Oregon and Bishop versus United States."
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,3188.371,3192.452,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.382,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3294.957,3323.262,"But I -- I thought the Court of Appeals, is that 176, isn't that where the Court of Appeals stated the Illinois rule as being that there is nothing in the way of a requirement of affirmative proofs from the state on an insanity defense unless there's sufficient evidence to counter the presumption, is that correct?"
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,3323.262,3334.392,"Your Honor, the law in Illinois is very clear that the presumption of sanity as it is called is not an evidentiary presumption."
1965.382,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3349.781,3360.429,"Well, I'm looking at 171 of the Court of Appeals' opinion where the rule is stated, the state must prove the sanity of the defendant at the time of the alleged crime."
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,3378.809,3380.9,"No Your Honor, I don't believe that is."
1965.382,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3448.849,3461.499,"Yes, by which you mean, you feel you're entitled to a judgment requiring the state within x days or something to give him a new trial or else discharged, is that it?"
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,3461.499,3481.442,"I believe that we are entitled to such an order and I believe even beyond that that with respect to this issue that we've just been discussing, the failure to -- the failure to afford the defendant -- pardon me, the failure of the state to introduce any evidence to prove an essential element of its case would require an unconditional writ of habeas corpus."
1965.382,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3481.442,3483.968,Well except I thought Mr. Michael said this.
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,3505.964,3535.353,"Your Honor, the Supreme Court of Illinois held that there was no evidence in this record that was sufficient to overcome the presumption of sanity because the Illinois Supreme Court held that there was no evidence that the mental illness that had resulted in Robinson's commitment to a mental institution was of a continuing or permanent nature."
1965.382,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3559.532,3574.092,"But what I'm confused about is if the Illinois Supreme Court has said on the record here, no affirmative evidence was required from the state, where does that leave us?"
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,3574.092,3588.037,"Well, Your Honor, we think number one, it leads you in a position to say first that the record clearly does not clearly -- the record taken as a whole clearly does not fairly support that finding."
1965.382,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3607.493,3617.677,I don't see -- I don't see that what you say is so and we should agree with you that that should lead us to say that this fellow should be discharged rather than to get a new trial.
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,3617.677,3621.484,"Well Your Honor, there are two separate questions here."
1965.382,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3704.226,3708.796,Tell me in -- this was a psychiatrist he wanted (Voice Overlap)
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,3708.796,3710.208,"No, this is a different witness Your Honor."
1965.382,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3710.208,3712.3,I see.
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,3720.67,3734.081,"I think there is no question about the fact that a subpoena if issued and served, I suppose could be enforced as a practical matter at least it can be enforced within a reason."
1965.382,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3746.202,3748.519,It wouldn't be as much of that as interest?
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,3748.519,3749.563,I think that's correct.
1965.382,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3842.238,3843.294,We'll recess now.
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,3843.294,3854.072,Thank you.
1965.382,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3854.072,3857.423,"Mr. Tucker, you may continue your argument."
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,3857.423,3860.933,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.382,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4092.669,4121.296,"So far as the facts of this case go, how do you deal with the language in the record Mr. Dermott's statement in the record, page 167 which was referred to by Mr. Michael that he had got in touch with many psychiatrists or at least made two or three dozen telephone calls to psychiatrists and then he decided not to subpoena any of them."
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4121.296,4146.1,"Well, I think Your Honor that all that Mr. McDermott is saying at this point is during the trial he had told the court that he had an expert witness that he wanted to call the next day and Your Honor will recall, the court said well if you subpoenaed him, alright, but if you didn't, we're not going to continue this case for two hours, you've got to prepare your case in advance."
1965.382,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4232.286,4235.893,Because he also -- he also explained why he hadn't subpoenaed Mr. and Mrs. Moore at the same time.
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4235.893,4237.424,That -- that's correct.
1965.382,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4306.681,4309.323,Was this court appointed counsel?
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4309.323,4311.303,It was Your Honor.
1965.382,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4311.303,4312.307,"Two of them, were they?"
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4312.307,4330.705,"That's correct, two of them. Now the state as I understand it concedes that due process prohibits the trial of an insane man and if they don't concede that this Court has certainly held it in Bishop versus United States and [Inaudible]."
1965.382,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4434.656,4437.703,Is that the right to a jury trial on the issue?
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4437.703,4439.097,That is correct Your Honor.
1965.382,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4439.097,4446.091,The Illinois law is to the effect that that -- that the right to a jury trial on the sanity issue cannot be waived.
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4446.091,4446.957,That is correct.
1965.382,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4479.083,4482.351,Did I understand you to say that Bishop held that?
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4482.351,4483.508,"No, Your Honor."
1965.382,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4494.844,4498.272,"But did you say Bishop held that, I have it before me?"
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4498.272,4501.161,"United States versus Bishop, Your Honor."
1965.382,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4522.86,4526.503,But it didn't say anything about the constitutional question?
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4526.503,4529.346,"Well, I think that by inference Your Honor, if -- if it were not --"
1965.382,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4529.346,4535.027,It would not have been on supervisory power or something else?
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4535.027,4539.289,I think that the issues framed in the opinion of the court below --
1965.382,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4539.289,4543.699,I'm not joining issue with your own fact as to whether that is the rule or should be the rule?
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4543.699,4544.339,I understand that.
1965.382,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4544.339,4548.461,But is there any other case besides the Bishop case that you say it held that?
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4548.461,4549.104,"Well, I -- I would --"
1965.382,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4549.104,4551.737,I dissented in one or two.
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4555.092,4566.322,"No, I -- I would -- I would say that Bishop probably is as close as the opinions of this Court come to my knowledge on that issue."
1965.382,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4570.991,4572.371,I just read that one.
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4572.371,4595.467,"I believe that that case certainly the opinion of both the majority and the dissenting opinion of Justice Frankfurter in that case indicate that sanity at the time of trial, that -- that -- that due process would prohibit if in fact it occurred the trial of a man while he was insane and the Illinois Supreme Court incidentally clearly holds."
1965.382,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4595.467,4601.072,"Did the Court ever held that a man can be tried in absence, fits into due process?"
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4601.072,4609.775,"I -- I believe Your Honor and I can't recall the cases, I believe the Court has held that he cannot be tried in the event and of course it would be the same thing."
1965.382,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4612.49,4615.216,I have a vague recollection.
1965.382,1,33305,john_c_tucker,,4633.437,4635.498,"I'm sorry Justice Black, I don't know that case."
1965.382,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4635.498,4637.973,Blackman I believe was the name.
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7430.947,7435.31,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1965.382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7516.062,7519.912,Not even hypothetical question?
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7519.912,7522.897,I believe he might be able to answer hypothetical question Your Honor.
1965.382,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7527.664,7538.917,"Well there is the conflict I know in my home state, you can't compel an expert to give opinion evidence unless paying for it?"
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7538.917,7540.35,That was my understanding on the law Your Honor.
1965.382,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7540.35,7541.803,Is that in Illinois too?
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7541.803,7544.94,I don't think Illinois has a direct rule on that question Your Honor.
1965.382,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7544.94,7573.521,"Mr. Michael I -- as I read this record on page 161, the prosecuting attorney suggested to the court that a psychiatrist ought to be called that is to say that Dr. Haines and the court declined to do so, is that correct?"
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7573.521,7574.598,Yes Your Honor.
1965.382,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7574.598,7589.811,So that there is no doubt or do you as the state taking the position that the court's attention was not at all in need for -- to the possibility of the psychiatric issue in this case.
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7589.811,7593.756,I think that that -- that the state -- let me put it this way Your Honor.
1965.382,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7620.908,7640.821,"It's a little stranger than that on page 161, the attorney said, the defense raised here by which he means insanity as such that I think we should have Dr. Haines testimony as to his opinion whether this man is sane or insane."
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7667.816,7673.009,"Your Honor, on that position generally of course, it was the state that wanted to call Dr. Haines."
1965.382,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7691.763,7719.831,"No but it's relevant to the issue of -- it's not determinative by any means of course but it's relevant to the issue of whether in this record, there -- the presumption of sanity was brought in to the extent that the countervailing evidence was necessary or whether the burden shifted to the state to prove sanity."
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7719.831,7735.543,"I believe that at least -- I don't know that the evidence goes that far Your Honor, but at least it goes so far as to say that I don't -- no [Inaudible] at least the states attorney wanted to have this additional evidence in the record, the court thought that it was not necessary in this case."
1965.382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7735.543,7741.974,Well wasn't Haines' testimony though relevant to competency to stand trial?
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7741.974,7745.232,As far as the stipulated testimony that is the record yet it was only that he was sane (Voice Overlap)
1965.382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7745.232,7766.434,"[Inaudible] said that we think Dr. Haines ought to be here, â€“ he ought to be here and testify in regard to competency to stand trial because that's all he would have testified, and that's what stipulation was?"
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7766.434,7767.83,I don't read the record that way Your Honor.
1965.382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7773.785,7779.079,That's all Dr. Haines' testimony in full.
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7779.079,7785.305,"Your Honor, they already had his full testimony in respect to the issue of insanity at the time of the trial."
1965.382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7791.013,7794.585,Yes but that's just my stipulation.
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7794.585,7795.943,"Well, it was stipulated --"
1965.382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7795.943,7798.518,[Inaudible] to testify.
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7798.518,7799.515,"No, he did not."
1965.382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7799.515,7801.213,They just think that if he were there --
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7801.213,7802.91,He would so testify.
1965.382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7802.91,7803.452,Right.
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7803.452,7804.056,Yes sir.
1965.382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7804.056,7824.182,"And the defense counsel -- the defense counsel said, well in order to save further delay, they would stipulate that the defendant Robinson knows the nature of the charge pending against him and if they cooperate with this counsel [Inaudible]"
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7824.182,7827.93,Correct Your Honor.
1965.382,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7827.93,7835.623,"Well, is Haines the doctor, the psychiatrist that we've talking about, the psychiatrist for the defense (Voice Overlap)"
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7835.623,7838.03,"No Your Honor, Haines was the --"
1965.382,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7838.03,7838.547,Yes.
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7838.547,7842.952,The head director of the state department there --
1965.382,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7842.952,7843.866,I see.
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7843.866,7844.382,-- of the psychiatric department.
1965.382,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7844.382,7845.754,"Well, may I ask this question."
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7856.406,7857.487,I think not Your Honor.
1965.382,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7866.539,7872.112,Do you think the court tried the issue of his sanity during the trial?
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7872.112,7878.427,"I think Your Honor that they did -- that the court did try the issue of his insanity at the time of the crime during the trial, yes sir."
1965.382,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7886.976,7906.05,"So what was meant by the statement of the lawyer here that the two issues were as he said insanity at the time of the crime conduct charged, insanity at the time of the trial?"
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7906.05,7906.837,What does that record represent?
1965.382,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7906.837,7912.869,Page 162.
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7912.869,7915.5,I'm not positive of what he meant by that Your Honor.
1965.382,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7943.59,7959.676,"But I would suppose that if the judge is trying a man without a jury, if some question is raised about insanity, he would want to know something about it, wouldn't he?"
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7959.676,7962.922,"Well by this time Your Honor, he had all the evidence in the record before him."
1965.382,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7965.163,7973.057,He had before him but that's -- that's why I ask if he tried that -- to determine that issue.
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7973.057,7975.306,"As far as I can tell you Your Honor, he did not."
1965.382,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7977.315,7979.603,Although the counsel told him that --
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7979.603,7982.113,He did say that that is an issue raised.
1965.382,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7982.113,7984.269,Was that denied by the state?
1965.382,2,39845,richard_a_michael,,7984.269,7988.648,No it was not Your Honor.
1965.382,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7990.52,8002.221,"Mr. Tucker before we pass to the next case, the Court understands that you're appointed by the Court of Appeals to represent this indigent defendant."
1965.382,3,33305,john_c_tucker,,8002.221,8002.99,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1965.382,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8002.99,8021.866,"And it's very apparent, the time and energy you have devoted to that cause and we consider it a great public service for lawyers to do what you have done in this case and we thank you and congratulate you on your presentation."
1965.382,4,39845,richard_a_michael,,8031.429,8032.805,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1965.382,5,33305,john_c_tucker,,8032.805,8036.62,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
