1995.94-1039,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.446,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94 1039, Roy Romer v. Richard G. Evans."
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,9.026,12.208,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
1995.94-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,67.876,68.806,"Well, Mr. Tymkovich--"
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,102.429,122.871,"Your Honor, in James v. Valtierra the Court was presented with a question involving a State constitutional amendment that also identified a classification... in that case, low income persons... and in analyzing the question there, the Court fundamentally looked at whether Hunter v. Erickson should extend beyond the specific racial context in which it was decided."
1995.94-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,122.871,136.4,"But the whole point in James was that we knew that it was low income housing, and we could measure the need, the importance, the objectives of the legislature to control low cost housing against the classification that was adopted."
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,143.685,152.25,"The classification in James did involve a reference to a specific subset of persons, an identifiable group under the theory of the Colorado supreme court."
1995.94-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,152.25,159.434,"I know it adopted a theory of a group, but it was with reference to a specific legislative objective... low cost housing."
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,169.662,178.478,"Your Honor, the objective here was to resolve an issue of whether or not to extend special protections to homosexuals and bisexuals, so the issue resolved here--"
1995.94-1039,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.478,186.331,"Well, Mr. Tymkovich, the language of the amendment I guess has never been actually interpreted by the Colorado courts."
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,186.331,188.465,--The Colorado--
1995.94-1039,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,188.465,191.767,"Has it been construed or interpreted as yet, in your view?"
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,191.767,194.81,"--Your Honor, this is a facial challenge, and the provision was enjoined before it ever went into effect."
1995.94-1039,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,194.81,195.077,Right.
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,195.077,205.146,"For bases of this appeal, the Colorado court did make an interpretation that at least to the extent that it preempted local laws and State provisions, that's all the farther it went."
1995.94-1039,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.146,214.031,"Well, does it mean that homosexuals are not covered by Colorado's laws of general applicability?"
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,214.031,214.943,"No, it does not."
1995.94-1039,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,215.782,216.703,How do we know that?
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,234.874,235.786,--There are a couple of reasons.
1995.94-1039,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,251.485,254.727,Does it displace courts in Colorado?
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,258.14,258.47,--Absolutely.
1995.94-1039,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.47,260.781,--dealing with discrimination--
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,260.781,262.264,"Yes, it may."
1995.94-1039,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,262.644,264.355,--if there's a homosexual plaintiff?
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,264.355,273.54,"--It absolutely changes no provisions under Federal law in access to the court or vindication of one's equal protection rights, nor does it affect the State--"
1995.94-1039,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,273.54,274.401,"Well, how do we know that?"
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,279.333,286.588,--The construction that we have offered is well supported by the legislative history and the intent of the proponents.
1995.94-1039,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,312.566,318.019,"Mr. Tymkovich, even focusing on State law alone, Federal law is of course supreme."
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,318.019,318.57,--Yes.
1995.94-1039,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,318.57,326.355,"And as Justice Kennedy pointed out, James v. Valtierra dealt with one issue, low cost housing."
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,368.903,373.886,"Your Honor, it's not unprecedented in the sense that it's a preemptive law."
1995.94-1039,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.872,394.779,"Mr. Tymkovich, what about laws prohibiting bigamy, or prohibiting homosexuality, or homosexual conduct?"
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,408.688,412.18,It's unclear from this text.
1995.94-1039,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,427.391,449.454,"I want to know what you mean by... what is meant by... if all orientation means is someone who engages in homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual acts, then you have plenty of precedent in response to your question, namely State laws that absolutely criminalize such activity... bigamy, homosexuality--"
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,449.454,452.176,"--That's right, the--"
1995.94-1039,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,452.176,460.871,--Colorado has no law that prohibits consensual homosexual conduct.
1995.94-1039,0,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,460.871,461.051,--No.
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1654.867,1664.592,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-1039,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.144,1703.147,"Well, when you say all levels of government in Colorado, Ms. Dubofsky, you don't include the people by referendum, I take it, or the people by initiative."
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1703.147,1703.868,"No, we do not."
1995.94-1039,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1703.868,1707.16,And I have one more very specific question.
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1718.437,1721.86,The--
1995.94-1039,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1721.86,1723.392,--deals with the rights of gay people?
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1723.392,1733.778,--The State has conceded that Amendment 2 is unconstitutional to the degree it would prohibit such a claim based upon Federal law since 1983.
1995.94-1039,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1733.778,1736.059,"No, no, no, I meant State courts interpreting State public accommodation laws."
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1736.059,1750.318,"Our theory is that Amendment 2 on its face prohibits a State court from recognizing such a claim, but that particular interpretation of the amendment is not necessary for this Court to find that Amendment 2 is unconstitutional."
1995.94-1039,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1750.318,1754.4,"Thank you, and that particular interpretation has not been given by the supreme court of Colorado."
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1754.4,1754.721,That's right.
1995.94-1039,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1754.721,1755.141,It has not.
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1755.141,1755.593,That's right.
1995.94-1039,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1792.667,1801.833,"What do we do about, counsel for the other side said, no, it doesn't forbid the police department from having a rule saying don't discriminate against gays."
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1804.434,1813.099,"The Colorado supreme court interpretation of this amendment is authoritative for purposes of this argument, I believe, and the Colorado supreme court--"
1995.94-1039,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.099,1816.942,Where does it say that in the Colorado supreme court's opinion?
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1816.942,1821.475,"--It says that on page B 3, D 24--"
1995.94-1039,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.475,1823.328,"Of the white appendix, or the--"
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1823.328,1824.276,"--Yes, in the white appendix."
1995.94-1039,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.301,1830.231,--D as in does?
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1830.231,1832.133,"D as in David, or does, yes."
1995.94-1039,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1832.133,1832.394,"David, yes."
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1832.394,1853.585,"And the way in which the Colorado supreme court says that is by giving examples of the types of provisions that would be repealed by the amendment, or precluded from enactment in the future."
1995.94-1039,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1853.585,1856.439,B 3?
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1864.584,1865.045,B as in boy.
1995.94-1039,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1865.045,1865.573,--Boy.
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1874.479,1877.3,"Yes, and it refers back to the first sentence."
1995.94-1039,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.229,1892.002,"Wait, that barred discrimination based on sexual orientation."
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1898.765,1899.927,--Well--
1995.94-1039,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1899.927,1908.212,"--as opposed to a general law that says you have to, not just accept homosexuals, but all citizens have to be accommodated at hotels."
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1908.212,1909.982,--That's correct.
1995.94-1039,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1912.095,1923.852,"As opposed to a special law that says a private homeowner who wants to rent a room... you know, the mom and a family that wants to do bed and breakfast cannot discriminate in the people it accepts."
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1934.419,1936.62,--The Colorado supreme court is referring to?
1995.94-1039,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1936.62,1936.84,Yes.
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1936.84,1938.042,"No, I don't think so."
1995.94-1039,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.604,1961.697,You mean no general laws can be applied to homosexuals now?
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1965.69,1972.694,"--We think it can mean that, but we don't think the Colorado supreme court found it necessary to go that far in its interpretation--"
1995.94-1039,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.694,1973.034,I--
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1973.034,1979.409,--and we're not arguing that it needs to be interpreted that broadly in order to find Amendment 2 unconstitutional.
1995.94-1039,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.409,1981.51,--I don't think the Colorado supreme court did interpret it that broadly.
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,1986.543,1992.228,I think we're having trouble a little bit with semantics.
1995.94-1039,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2007.346,2018.595,"No, but if I go and ask a homeowner to take me in on bed and breakfast and the homeowner says, I don't like Italians, that's my tough luck, unless there's a law against it."
1995.94-1039,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2044.861,2050.715,At D 24 and D 25 there's some particular examples.
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,2051.126,2052.766,"That's right, D 24--"
1995.94-1039,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2052.766,2054.527,"--Colleges, State colleges, the insurance example."
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,2054.527,2055.328,--That's right.
1995.94-1039,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2081.915,2090.741,"Yes, but you... but they are laws that provide special protection for that particular category of person, which they don't provide to people at large."
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,2111.235,2112.126,"Well, in Colorado--"
1995.94-1039,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2112.126,2112.757,Is that not special?
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,2112.757,2123.051,"--In Colorado, there is a law which says one cannot be terminated from employment for any legal off duty conduct, and gives one the basis for a claim."
1995.94-1039,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2131.086,2139.074,Does a State college... can a State university decide not to admit a student under generally applicable law because it doesn't like the way he combs his hair?
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,2139.074,2144.316,"That's a question I'm not sure I know the answer to, but I think--"
1995.94-1039,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2144.316,2145.957,"I mean, can State universities discriminate arbitrarily?"
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,2151.86,2155.103,"--I don't think they can discriminate arbitrarily, no."
1995.94-1039,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2156.465,2158.125,--Let me put it to you this way.
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,2184.822,2188.124,"I think a court could find that, yes."
1995.94-1039,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2188.124,2194.94,Despite the provision under the Constitution that says no preferences should be given?
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,2194.94,2201.064,"Well, it depends upon whether the court is referring to more general equal protection law on a Federal level."
1995.94-1039,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2201.064,2201.314,"No, no."
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,2211.119,2221.477,"If that criteria in the particular case is because the person who was denied that benefit is a gay person, then I think under Amendment 2 the court would not be able to provide relief."
1995.94-1039,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2234.574,2259.141,"But isn't the very purpose of this ordinance to say, it's not arbitrary to leave out of a catalog of protection against discrimination, it's not arbitrary to leave out homosexual, lesbian... persons of homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation?"
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,2259.141,2264.033,Amendment 2 if interpreted at its broadest would authorize that type of discrimination.
1995.94-1039,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2264.033,2285.157,"But even on a narrower interpretation, even for example if Amendment 2 didn't touch courts, wouldn't it be very difficult for the courts of Colorado to say that that was an irrational or an arbitrary basis for discrimination with Amendment 2 on the books, even if Amendment 2 was narrowly construed?"
1995.94-1039,1,29863,jean_e_dubofsky,,2285.157,2286.318,"Yes, it would be, I believe--"
1995.94-1039,2,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,3375.423,3383.337,"Your Honor, the Colorado supreme court rule basically holds that preemption is unconstitutional."
1995.94-1039,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3392.333,3401.45,"Well, excuse me, I don't see where it said preemption was unconstitutional, as distinct from saying, preemption for one identifiable group was unconstitutional."
1995.94-1039,2,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,3401.45,3405.53,"--It's preemption of this issue that affects a group, and in James the Court told us it's permissible--"
1995.94-1039,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3405.53,3413.707,"Well, it doesn't... it doesn't... the ordinance speaks both in terms of issue, i.e., basis for claim, and group."
1995.94-1039,2,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,3418.22,3423.223,"--It's an issue that affects a group, like in James, and like in Gregory v. Ashcroft, where we had an age restriction in the State."
1995.94-1039,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3423.223,3435.161,"--Well, isn't in effect defined in terms of the group under traditional equal protection analysis, which looks to the intent of the enacting body?"
1995.94-1039,2,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,3435.161,3436.182,"Right, and then there would be the question--"
1995.94-1039,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3436.182,3436.442,Okay.
1995.94-1039,2,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,3436.442,3437.915,--of whether a rational basis supports that.
1995.94-1039,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3437.915,3438.866,"Thank you, Mr.--"
1995.94-1039,2,43404,timothy_m_tymkovich,,3438.866,3439.267,In this case--
1995.94-1039,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3439.267,3440.188,"--Thank you, Mr. Tymkovich."
