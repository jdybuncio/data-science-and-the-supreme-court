1973.72-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,41.776,We’ll hear arguments next in Old Dominion Branch of the Letter Carriers against Austin.
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,43.859,49.551,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,148.792,156.5,Was that definition furnished along with the other definition in this publication?
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,156.5,178.791,"That definition was not printed, but the record is unequivocally clear that all of the plaintiffs and everyone else knew that the reason they were being called scabs was that they had been importuned and pleaded with and begged to join the union and they refused willfully and deliberately to do so."
1973.72-1180,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,178.791,182.095,"Mr. Ratner, that’s twice you’ve used the word “willfully.”"
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,182.095,182.235,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1180,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,182.235,185.245,"Normally, this connotes guilt."
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,188.216,204.455,"No, I have no meaning, no implication in that word in that context other than “they were not newly on the job and not had a chance not be approached, had not had the chance to consider the problem.”"
1973.72-1180,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,208.565,211.14,"Well, I think that is not the correct use of the word “willfully.”"
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,211.513,214.899,I beg your pardon. I will change it.
1973.72-1180,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,219.331,234.764,"Mr. Ratner, I don’t suppose you found in the dictionary any definition of scab and here I quote from page 72, I think, of the Appendix, “as a traitor to his God, his country, his family, and his class.”"
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,234.764,237.64,"Well, I was coming to that."
1973.72-1180,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,237.756,241.48,"My questions was, is it in the dictionary?"
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,241.48,249.962,"Well, I don’t suppose that the dictionaries go on and print Jack London’s definition as being part of the commonly accepted definition of a scab."
1973.72-1180,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,357.658,367.56,"The dictionary definition, as I understood it to say, is that a scab is a low or contemptible person, isn't that correct?"
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,367.56,369.687,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,504.968,512.833,Of course those are somewhat temperate definitions that you’re giving.
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,538.232,559.131,"Your Honor, I take it that there is no line that can be drawn constitutionally between the vividness of the hyperbole which can be protected and that which is not."
1973.72-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,650.462,651.324,Mr. Ratner.
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,651.324,651.977,"Yes, sir?"
1973.72-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,651.977,662.933,"As I read Linn, and my reading is kind of reinforced by the quote you just read, it did arise in the context of a representational proceeding, a dispute between management and labor."
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,666.998,680.044,This arose out of the efforts of the union to bring into membership the remaining non-members who were employed in the postal career services.
1973.72-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,685.916,689.683,"Well, was there any dispute between labor and management?"
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,689.683,691.416,"No, as far as we know."
1973.72-1180,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,723.213,734.556,"Mr. Ratner, I take it that as far as the use of the word “scab” is concerned, it certainly is a true appellation here, is it not?"
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,734.556,736.845,"Yes, Your Honor, and it’s absolutely true."
1973.72-1180,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,736.845,749.18,"In any definition of the term, and it’s your position, is it, that the rest of the material in this publication has just rhetorical hyperboles?"
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,749.18,780.458,"It is precisely that, it is precisely that and we say that it is rhetorical hyperbole not because we say so, but because under the teachings of Greenbelt against Bresler, it must be so-held as a matter of constitutional fact and that the lower Court’s attempt without any rationale whatsoever, the District Court I mean, attempt without rationale whatsoever, to say that Bresler is completely different from this case is simply utterly intemperate."
1973.72-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,780.458,781.719,"We’ll resume there after lunch, Mr. Ratner."
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,781.719,782.253,Thank you.
1973.72-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,794.689,797.837,"Mr. Mozart, you may resume."
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,797.837,801.104,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,876.981,879.686,"It’s sort of a two-handed statement, isn’t it?"
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,879.686,896.666,"Your Honor, I -- to me, the only hand that counts is the last four words, “known to be false,” versus the common law test, embodies the New York Times test, and lays down the boundary of State Court jurisdiction."
1973.72-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,925.452,930.688,"I mean, I take it what you’re saying is that opinions would fall on the one side of that line and factual statements on the other."
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,930.688,935.04,"I’m inclined to believe they would, unless opinions were matters of fact which, conceivably, they might be."
1973.72-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,935.04,936.305,They might be.
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,936.305,944.381,"In other words, I might have an opinion of Your Honor and state the contrary, one falsely and maliciously, and that, I think, might be actionable."
1973.72-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1043.23,1046.348,"That was a prior restraint case, wasn’t it?"
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1046.348,1047.473,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1051.317,1055.448,So that is right within the Doctrine of the Near against Minnesota.
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1055.448,1060.254,I understand that the general framework of Austin was Near versus Minnesota and the prior restraint.
1973.72-1180,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1292.188,1296.861,May I inquire what the circulation of the monthly newsletter was?
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1296.861,1304.737,"525, 420 of whom are active members of the letter carriers, the balance being retired letter carriers."
1973.72-1180,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1304.737,1315.134,And it’s your position that this is a news media entitled to the same principles that protect the New York Times?
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1315.134,1316.011,Absolutely.
1973.72-1180,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1316.011,1316.689,Right.
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1316.689,1327.695,"Precisely as if this were a chemical society whose members are all chemists, and whose publication was devoted exclusively to the interest of chemists, it would have no less protection than the New York Times."
1973.72-1180,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1327.695,1329.497,Is any limit on this?
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1346.481,1352.432,"I see no reason why the New York Times rule should not apply for the publisher of that publication, none whatsoever."
1973.72-1180,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1389.471,1408.079,"Assume there was no publication whatever and the manager of the apartment falsely accused the tenant of misconduct, would that be subject to the same protection as the principle annunciated in New York Times, gives people in the press?"
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1408.079,1415.38,I see nothing in the rationale of New York Times or the First Amendment that warrants extension to that case.
1973.72-1180,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1415.38,1424.625,"In other words, you draw the line between media as broadly defined by you on the one hand and what an individual may say in his individual capacity?"
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1424.625,1443.614,"I think that freedom of speech and freedom of the press have a quite different meaning when they are involved in matters of concern to more than two disputants of the two individuals who may be considering something, yes."
1973.72-1180,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1443.614,1454.321,"Well, suppose he -- suppose the slander were heard in a stomp speech on a corner of a public street."
1973.72-1180,0,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,1457.832,1461.668,"It depends of what he’s talking about, what the interest of his audience is."
1973.72-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1585.121,1588.634,"Very well, Mr. Ratner."
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,1595.41,1599.414,Mr. Chief Justice Burger and members of the Honorable Court.
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.601,1878.748,Is there a statutory question in this case at all under the Labor Relations Law?
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,1878.748,1880.477,"A preemption question, Your Honor?"
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.477,1880.956,Yes.
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,1880.956,1882.052,"Well, there is a question."
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1882.782,1886.598,"Well, don’t you think you should deal with that first before getting to the --"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,1886.598,1888.793,"Yes, Your Honor, I’m prepared to deal with that."
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.793,1888.978,Isn’t that Linn?
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,1888.978,1891.394,"It’s Linn versus Plant Guard Workers, that’s correct."
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.394,1902.892,How do you -- I don’t suppose we reach the constitutional question or Metromedia or all those cases if Linn controls this case?
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,1902.892,1907.181,"Well, Your Honor, the Linn case, of course, dealt with the extent to which --"
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.181,1909.567,Linn wasn’t a New York Times case?
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,1909.567,1923.711,"That’s correct, but Linn dealt to what extent the New York -- to what extent the states are preempted by the National Labor Relations Act in the libel -- to suit for libel involving a labor dispute."
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.355,1929.72,"And if the Linn test applies, this judgment shouldn’t have been entered, should it?"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,1929.72,1931.717,"I would respectfully dispute it, Your Honor."
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1931.717,1931.896,Oh!
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,1934.564,1935.74,"In some respects, it was."
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.522,1938.377,"In some respects, it was inconsistent?"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,1938.377,1952.904,"The Court -- Your Honor, the Court stated in Linn that in matters of merely peripheral concern such as the fact of the case indicated here that in a situation like that the states had jurisdiction."
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.904,1962.09,"Well states had jurisdiction to it provided that the viable was proved to have been committed with malice, as defined in the case?"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,1962.09,1969.866,"Of course, there, we get into the situation -- of course, the Court said in the Linn case that the New York Times rule was adopted by --"
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1969.866,1970.523,That’s right.
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,1970.523,1971.31,Analogy.
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.31,1971.956,That’s right.
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,1971.956,1976.598,And it gets down to the situation what does the term “analogy” actually mean.
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.199,1988.294,"Well, anyway, what is your position with respect to the applicability of Linn, whatever Linn means?"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,1988.294,2001.877,"My position, Your Honor, is that in the Linn case the Court meant the -- Supreme Court of Virginia stated that in the Linn case the states were not -- of course, this Court stated -- excuse me, the states are not preempted by National Labor Relations Act."
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.877,2003.088,Why is that?
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2004.639,2008.011,I would go to say it’s not a labor dispute.
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.016,2030.259,"Well, if -- I suppose it’s arguably an unfair labor practice to coerce employees to join a labor union, isn’t it?"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2030.259,2033.125,"Well, Your Honor, there again the appellants --"
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2033.125,2038.331,"Well, isn’t that as plain 8 (b) (3)?"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2038.331,2045.779,"If you would term hyperbolic -- as they would say, this is mere hyperbolic venting of emotions, so therefore, it didn’t come into --"
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2045.779,2048.318,"Yes, but you say it’s more than that?"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2048.318,2050.945,"I say, Your Honor, it’s questionable whether really the --"
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.945,2053.293,"If you can’t have this both ways, neither can they?"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2053.293,2055.614,I realize that.
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.614,2058.897,"Well, what is your position then as to why Linn doesn’t apply?"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2072.098,2075.327,"I think it’s a question whether there is a labor dispute or not, yes."
1973.72-1180,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2089.542,2098.7,"What law does the determination whether it’s a labor dispute turn on, the federal or state law?"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2098.7,2101.088,"Well, the National Labor Relations Act, Your Honor."
1973.72-1180,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2101.088,2101.771,Federal law?
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2101.771,2103.861,Federal law.
1973.72-1180,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2103.861,2120.152,"Well, is the explanation you’ve just given us about Linn, the one that the Virginia Court adopted or did they say Linn wasn’t applicable because there’s malice here?"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2120.152,2123.432,"I believe, Your Honor, that was their holding."
1973.72-1180,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2124.863,2129.201,And you’re not trying to explain Linn away on that basis?
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2129.201,2131.35,"I wasn’t, Your Honor, no."
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.35,2136.677,"So the reason the Virginia Court gave, you don’t defend?"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2136.677,2137.433,Pardon?
1973.72-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2137.433,2139.688,You don’t defend the reason of the Virginia Court?
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2139.688,2140.176,I do.
1973.72-1180,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2147.95,2148.67,"Well, let’s see."
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2161.078,2163.628,"Yes, and malice was shown."
1973.72-1180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2163.628,2181.709,"Do you contend at all, Mr. Kapral that the fact situation which Linn arose being a labor management dispute, anything that the Linn case said as to the any broader sweep of the preemption would be dictum and be opened to reexamination?"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2181.709,2195.047,"Well, Your Honor, of course the Linn case was more of a classic example of a labor dispute, there was labor and management being involved and not only that, Mr. Linn of course was the head of a large national detective agency."
1973.72-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2231.234,2235.015,"You don’t have to go so far as to say they must do it in a diplomatic way, do you?"
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2235.015,2236.138,"Well, maybe not diplomatic but --"
1973.72-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2236.138,2239.173,All you have to do is say it in a non-libelous?
1973.72-1180,1,41614,stephen_m_kapral,,2239.173,2240.683,In a non-libelous way.
1973.72-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2493.13,2494.362,Mr. Cherry.
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,2494.362,2506.307,Mr. Chief Justice and may the Court please.
1973.72-1180,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2884.142,2886.785,Didn’t this violate the Labor Act?
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,2886.785,2888.378,"Yes, sir, it violates that."
1973.72-1180,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2889.256,2890.196,It does violate the Labor Act.
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,2890.196,2896.266,"It does violate that, but the right to union in here is under the Executive Order."
1973.72-1180,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2901.107,2906.97,But you admit that it was a violation of the National Labor Relations Act?
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,2906.97,2909.587,"Yes, I don’t think -- I think, yes, I have to say that that’s what they said."
1973.72-1180,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2918.645,2939.227,"Well, would the labor -- would the National Labor Relations Board have a jurisdiction over a labor management dispute between mail carriers and the head of the postal corporation?"
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,2939.227,2940.281,I do not believe so.
1973.72-1180,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2940.836,2945.172,"Well, have they exercised any jurisdiction over the --"
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,2945.172,2946.547,No jurisdiction was ever exercised.
1973.72-1180,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2946.547,2948.485,I took your answer to mean that --
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,2948.485,2948.635,"No, I’m not --"
1973.72-1180,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2948.635,2962.187,"-- if this was a case within the National Labor Relations Act, the conduct that constitutes the coercion that is forbidden by that Act in relation to the constituents covered by it."
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,2962.187,2970.436,"That’s right, but not within the form that we’re dealing with matters between the employer and the union and whatnot."
1973.72-1180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2970.436,2979.626,"Well, the Virginia Supreme Court said the effect of the Executive Order 11491, which is essentially equivalent in both content and purpose with the National Labor Relations Act?"
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,2979.626,2980.945,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2980.945,2989.083,"Now, if it’s essentially equivalent, there must be some authority that adjudicates what’s called unfair practices."
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,2989.083,2992.894,"Well, the Executive Order does say that they shall not coerce workers."
1973.72-1180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2992.894,2995.099,"Alright, now who adjudicates that?"
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,2995.099,3004.839,I believe the -- because there is in that provision that the Postmaster General in the area has the obligation of seeing that that is imposed.
1973.72-1180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3004.839,3007.051,But Linn is a preempted case.
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,3007.051,3007.186,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3007.186,3019.09,"And it’s a non-preempted case and this Executive Order referred to has no preemptive effect whatsoever while Linn is beside the point, then you do reach the constitution as provided in Linn."
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,3019.09,3020.897,"Yes, I think so."
1973.72-1180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.897,3022.895,"Well, what do you say?"
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,3022.895,3026.911,I say that -- you mean as to the New York Times rule?
1973.72-1180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3026.911,3028.885,As to preemption or not.
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,3028.885,3032.883,I think that they had not preempted the state jurisdiction in this case.
1973.72-1180,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3034.084,3042.947,"Now, I understood your colleague to say differently in answer to my question or at least I think so."
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,3042.947,3045.915,"I did not so -- but, I’ll say it."
1973.72-1180,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3080.126,3097.74,"Mr. Cherry, would you say the same thing about the American Medical Association Journal as not being of any public interest to the public general generally, or the ABA Journal?"
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,3097.74,3129.962,"I think it is -- I think they are probably couched in such terms that they are of interest to a limited authorization and I think perhaps if we read the medical journal, it would deal with probably complex medical terms would not be a general interest for the public but would be of interest to medical members of that kind."
1973.72-1180,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3210.29,3211.419,"Excuse me, Mr. Cherry."
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,3262.42,3262.767,The National Labor --
1973.72-1180,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3262.767,3265.197,"What the National Labor Relations Board does, doesn’t it?"
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,3265.197,3266.031,Perhaps.
1973.72-1180,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3266.031,3268.674,Have you ever heard this being used?
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,3268.674,3270.826,"No, sir."
1973.72-1180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3271.588,3277.704,"Well, if you say that if he -- what you’re saying is that the union tried to coerce these people to be members."
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,3277.704,3282.459,That’s right.
1973.72-1180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3282.459,3298.19,"8 (b) (3) -- No, 8 (b) (1) interfered with restrain of coerced employee in exercise of his rights assured by this order."
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,3301.466,3303.628,"That’s clear, yes."
1973.72-1180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.628,3314.646,"So wouldn’t you think this argue -- at least arguably then that what the union was doing here, you say it was coercing to be a member, at least arguably it was an unfair labor practice under this Executive Order."
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,3314.646,3319.471,"Yes, but in the periphery of concern they are not in the direction, sir."
1973.72-1180,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3319.471,3340.57,"Well, I’m -- that may be so, but Linn takes hold, I would suppose, when arguably something is an unfair practice within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB or some comfortable agency."
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,3340.57,3342.494,"Yes, Linn does so."
1973.72-1180,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3346.722,3348.38,"Now, you are and your colleague seem to be --"
1973.72-1180,2,37776,parker_e_cherry,,3348.38,3349.891,It was not preempted.
1973.72-1180,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3399.568,3401.158,"Mr. Ratner, you have about four minutes left."
1973.72-1180,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3401.158,3405.241,"Mr. Ratner, is this procedure used very often?"
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3405.241,3405.801,You’re right.
1973.72-1180,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3407.965,3409.957,And what -- is it an Assistant Secretary of Labor?
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3409.957,3414.318,The Deputy is the one who actually makes the decision.
1973.72-1180,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3414.318,3415.374,"Deputy, what?"
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3415.374,3416.739,Assistant Secretary of Labor.
1973.72-1180,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3420.119,3423.056,And whether the formality is comparable to what goes on before the Board?
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3423.056,3425.523,"Precisely, they should probably examine these reports everyday."
1973.72-1180,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3439.426,3442.085,"Well, apart from that, on the preemption question."
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3442.085,3445.382,"On the preemption question, there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever."
1973.72-1180,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3445.382,3452.771,Does the National Labor Relations Act govern labor management relations between this union and this management?
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3452.771,3455.434,"It does now, but it didn’t at the time this case arose."
1973.72-1180,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3475.933,3477.915,"But were they based on, say, 8 (b) (1)?"
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3477.915,3485.922,"Yes, they were based on exactly the provisions of the Executive Order which incorporate almost in hyperbole the terms of the national -- the prohibitions of the National Labor Relations Act."
1973.72-1180,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3485.922,3487.701,But it’s by virtue of the Executive Order.
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3487.701,3503.783,"By virtue of the Executive Order, that is your question, yes, and the Court below held that the Executive Order following decisions on matter this Court with three unanimous circuits held that the Executive Order had the force of law and, therefore, for preemption purposes was the equivalent of the National Labor Relations Act."
1973.72-1180,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3503.783,3506.952,What now brings these relations under the National Labor Relations Act?
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3506.952,3508.424,The Postal Reorganization Act.
1973.72-1180,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3508.424,3508.63,Of the --
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3508.63,3512.915,Which has changed the picture and brought postal labor relations --
1973.72-1180,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3512.915,3513.64,By explicit provisions?
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3513.64,3518.089,By explicit provisions under the terms of the National Labor Relations Act.
1973.72-1180,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3558.938,3569.148,"Tell me, Mr. Ratner, if the opinion of the Virginia Supreme Court was to be read as same, yes, there is a preemption, but the Linn standard was satisfied."
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3571.026,3572.714,That that Linn standard was satisfied?
1973.72-1180,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3582.069,3582.767,"Well, wait a minute."
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3593.944,3593.982,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1180,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3593.982,3598.13,"When, in fact, what this Court held was that only New York Time malice was satisfied."
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3598.689,3599.227,That ends it.
1973.72-1180,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3599.227,3600.565,Alright.
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3600.565,3618.473,"They are wrong exactly the same way and for exactly the same reason in another respect when they sustained the Virginia statute for insulting workmen because they said we now come within the scope of what’s constitutionally immune, that is constitutionally not protected."
1973.72-1180,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3627.722,3631.406,"Now, Mr. Ratner, let me interrupt you too."
1973.72-1180,3,36527,mozart_g_ratner,,3643.79,3658.16,"The only conceivable difference is that you don’t have to unless you wish to reach my special audience: argued, my public issue, argued."
1973.72-1180,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3709.3,3709.955,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
