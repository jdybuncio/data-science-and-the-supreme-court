1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2288.233,2289.983,I may be in error with respect to the two years.

1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2308.099,2309.137,Right.
1964.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2309.137,2316.584,But of course the theory here (Inaudible) this type of determination (Inaudible)
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2316.584,2316.789,Right.
1964.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2316.789,2322.46,"I mean, they are and I thought they're definitely not (Inaudible)"

1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2326.73,2342.571,They received letters telling them that they had appeared at time but I remember its being two years in which they could -- will remain on the employment roles and could go in according to the seniority to other jobs and other parts of the mines or plains.
1964.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2342.571,2346.734,"Well, the company must treated this as a lay off?"
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2346.734,2347.964,I'm not sure about that.
1964.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2384.052,2386.03,My argument was there or not (Inaudible)
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2386.03,2386.487,Right.

1964.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2398.711,2399.072,(Inaudible)
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2399.072,2408.646,"But the importance of the complete severance is this that once he has elected to take severance pay, once he's made his claim for severance pay, then he has completely severe it."
1964.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2421.935,2431.893,I read the context that there was one difficulty because the context having (Inaudible) employment relationship even though there has (Inaudible)

1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2436.533,2437.378,As I read it.
1964.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2437.378,2438.954,Well --
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2438.954,2446.246,"In other words, he had no employment rights upon exercising his options to take this severance pay."
1964.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2446.246,2447.546,I just thought it would be a quasi (Inaudible)
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2447.546,2447.934,Alright sir.
1964.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2447.934,2448.999,But I maybe wrong.

1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2457.173,2466.484,"Well, the very letter which they got made that clear, that if you take -- in those cases where they say that we have closed and they agreed its close, they get a letter, they sign and send back."
1964.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2478.905,2483.081,"I find several references here in the record of this being a test case, what does that mean?"
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2483.081,2484.698,I don't know sir.
1964.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2493.37,2499.296,What about the basic issue of whether the -- does your right to recover depend on whether the mine was permanently closed?
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2499.296,2500.742,Yes sir.
1964.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2500.742,2503.675,Has that ever been litigated?
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2503.675,2507.184,"Not in this case, not in this case."
1964.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2511.011,2511.264,I understand --

1964.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2511.774,2516.365,-- but it seems that that was not litigated and --
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2516.365,2516.603,No sir.
1964.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2516.603,2517.553,-- but they stipulated --
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2517.553,2518.158,They stipulated too.
1964.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2518.158,2521.676,-- and agree on something to get this case tried.
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2521.676,2522.293,Yes sir.
1964.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2522.293,2524.175,And that's the way it's tried.
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2524.175,2525.01,Yes sir.
1964.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2525.01,2526.718,They never litigated the basic issues?

1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2703.104,2703.687,I'm glad you asked that.
1964.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2703.687,2704.436,Alright.

1964.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2740.235,2740.599,Yes.
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2740.599,2745.744,It is the exception of the general rule that applies federal substantive law in the first place.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.28,2837.543,Let's assume that the union here had asked the employer to arbitrate this claim of your client and the company said this isn't an argument for the reasons at all.
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2839.591,2841.427,"Yes sir, on our theory I think they could."

1964.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2856.231,2858.335,"Well, why couldn't the company get away with that?"
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2858.335,2860.745,Because it -- I think was good for (Inaudible) --

1964.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2886.622,2888.482,You invoke state law for this?
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2888.482,2890.78,"Well, here's what we're saying."
1964.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2907.404,2911.672,Concurrently expressly accommodate state law when it wants to.
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,2911.672,2919.168,"Well, it can take from a state law those things that are consistent with the federal policy and merge it into federal substantive law, yes."

1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3220.436,3221.463,"Oh, excuse me."
1964.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3222.151,3231.702,I'm talking about -- supposed that the (Inaudible)
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3231.702,3232.992,"Oh no, oh no."
1964.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3232.992,3236.447,(Inaudible) no longer an employee.
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3236.447,3239.141,"No sir, no sir."
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3328.894,3334.281,Don't you think Central Airlines have anything to do with that question or no?
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3334.281,3335.303,I think it does.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.23,3338.491,What does it have to do with them?
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3338.491,3349.957,"Well, I think it's talking about the same public policy about -- I think he's talking about the public policy of arbitration."
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3368.095,3370.953,Not on the -- you mean not on the applicability of federal law?
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3370.953,3372.314,That's right.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3372.314,3377.373,I thought that's what you said in the -- with the -- was different between the two lines of cases.
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3377.373,3381.447,Because I don't think there's going to be any difference.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3404.866,3410.753,So the two cases could be -- two lines of cases -- there shouldn't be two lines of cases --
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3410.753,3411.816,And I don't think there are.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3411.816,3414.126,We would create one if we decided to get through here.
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3414.126,3415.593,That's right.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3530.617,3531.282,But if the --
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3531.282,3534.511,-- one thought.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3534.511,3539.491,"What about the wrongful discharge case, I supposed you would say that is an arbritable matter."
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3545.598,3550.549,Only if he accepts -- only if he accepts and that's the distinction on one of the cases that he mentions.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3561.365,3568.168,"If he wants severance pay and the company says he isn't entitled to it, he can go to court?"
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3568.168,3569.481,He can go to court.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3613.349,3623.11,What about the correlative policies not only of a case but of uniformity?
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3623.11,3624.645,"Well, I think the Court certainly had that --"
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3624.645,3627.184,To get payment at the same time (Inaudible)
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3627.184,3627.733,Yes sir.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3627.733,3631.078,-- adjudicated under state law and the federal law was --
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3631.078,3631.467,I think --
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3631.467,3633.206,-- possibly different at all.
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3633.206,3643.448,I think the Court had to deal with that in another set of facts but the same basic question in Erie Railraod where the old case that Justice Holmes had dissented in --
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3643.448,3648.113,This happens to deal with a -- this happens to deal with the collective bargaining agreement.
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3648.113,3648.459,Yes sir.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3648.459,3652.291,And you have to rely on the collective bargaining agreement as (Inaudible) your right to severance pay.
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3652.291,3654.156,"That's right, that's right."
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3654.156,3657.153,Your source is in that collective contract.
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3657.153,3657.305,That is true.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3657.305,3658.764,That isn't part of that issue here --
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3658.764,3659.102,That's right.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3659.102,3661.459,-- even in one collective contract.
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3661.459,3661.78,That's right.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3661.78,3666.94,"In several courts, the -- they adjudicate it as I -- on the different standards --"
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3666.94,3667.079,But --
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3667.079,3667.667,(Inaudible)
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3667.667,3674.012,But we would look back and say what within the labor contract was Taft-Hartley dealing with?
1964.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3684.206,3686.039,"Well, on that ground you say it's no (Inaudible)"
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3689.724,3690.129,That's right.
1964.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3697.585,3703.755,"And therefore, you have to say that this is not an arbitrable matter, the union has got no business in it at all."
1964.43,1,39615,richard_l_jones,,3704.052,3715.38,"If he wants it that way, and I've got a selfish interest involved in that because I won't -- my right to sit and (Inaudible) walk in my door for me to represent him if he so chooses to do so."
