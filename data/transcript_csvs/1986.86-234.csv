1986.86-234,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,53.718,"Mr. Phillips, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,53.718,61.455,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-234,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,140.841,143.776,Why is that worse than ordinary party patronage?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,144.525,146.627,I don't know that it is worse than ordinary party patronage.
1986.86-234,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.262,153.048,All of it is fraud as far as you're concerned?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,153.048,154.0,As far as the government's concerned.
1986.86-234,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,154.0,154.616,Right.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,154.616,156.2,"Yes, I think that's correct."
1986.86-234,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,156.2,158.385,Does it include box seats to the Derby?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,160.904,162.539,I suspect the government would say so.
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.134,189.454,Was there no violation of state law for these people to get commissions for having done no work?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,189.454,194.508,"--No, absolutely not a violation of state law to receive commissions for doing no work."
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,196.225,198.993,How about if you're not a licensed agent?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,198.993,200.929,That would be a violation of the state law.
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.929,203.297,"And that was involved here as well, wasn't it?"
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,203.297,217.374,"No, at the time that all the commissions were received, the individuals receiving them were licensed agents, or had a licensed agent affiliated with the company involved, or the recipient of the commission."
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.374,225.045,"So, it's your position that at no time was any Kentucky state law violated here by either of your clients?"
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,225.045,227.329,"I would say two things about that, Justice O'Connor."
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,380.211,399.708,"Well, Mr. Phillips, I thought the government is now telling us that the jury was instructed that for mail fraud, the government had to prove a scheme to defraud the citizens of their right to honest performance of public business and to obtain money or property by false pretenses."
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,403.51,409.147,"Well, the first part, the government is clearly, I mean, the government is clearly making that argument and there is a statement in re-reading--"
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,409.147,410.497,And there is such an instruction?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,410.497,414.384,"--Well, the indictment was read to the jury and that is in the indictment."
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,427.109,436.614,"So you think, the position you take is that the instructions as a whole do not bear out that argument."
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,436.614,437.164,Absolutely.
1986.86-234,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.766,471.385,The theory being these commissions would have been paid to somebody anyway.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,471.385,472.301,That's absolutely correct.
1986.86-234,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.301,472.587,So--
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,472.587,477.122,"The commissions, the size of the commissions were outside of the state's control."
1986.86-234,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,491.399,503.106,"--The theory is that so much commission was going to be paid to Wombwell, what by the company or by the Kentucky government?"
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,503.106,505.808,It is paid by the underwriter.
1986.86-234,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,505.808,508.426,By the under--
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,508.426,510.643,It's a commission paid back by the underwriter.
1986.86-234,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,516.664,517.265,--When you say xxx.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,517.265,518.966,--have insurance was set.
1986.86-234,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,520.568,525.103,"When you say it's a commission paid back by the underwriter, who is the underwriter in this case?"
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,525.103,528.388,"Well, there were two underwriters and they're just large insurance companies."
1986.86-234,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,528.388,528.757,And they're--
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,528.757,529.29,xxx.
1986.86-234,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,529.29,531.274,--It's basically a discount?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,531.274,536.844,"No, it's just the method of recompense for the activities of the agent and so--"
1986.86-234,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,536.844,539.296,So they're paying the agent for having gotten the business?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,539.296,539.662,--Right.
1986.86-234,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,539.662,541.981,The way other insurance commissioners would.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,541.981,542.697,Absolutely.
1986.86-234,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,542.697,551.253,And they were going to pay a specified amount to Wombwell and these people's theory is if Wombwell wanted to split it up with other people that was a private arrangement.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,551.253,556.991,"That is precisely our position, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-234,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.359,565.263,"Although I suppose you can say if Wombwell's willing to split it with other people, Wombwell would also be willing to charge less."
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,565.263,566.43,--Might of been willing to charge less.
1986.86-234,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.43,569.882,Which would mean that the state would probably be able to buy its insurance for less.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,569.882,570.951,"Well, except that there's--"
1986.86-234,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.951,571.367,xxx.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,571.367,573.286,--no evidence to that effect in the record in this case.
1986.86-234,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.153,576.319,"Well, but that's common sense isn't it?"
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,582.073,589.376,"--Well, I mean, my guess is that Wombwell would prefer to share it with other insurance agents if for no other reason than to develop good will."
1986.86-234,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,589.376,592.864,That the whole reason for the scheme?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,594.414,595.982,"Yes, it was a patronage device."
1986.86-234,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,600.518,602.903,They weren't handing anything back to the state.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,602.903,605.505,"No, no one ever suggested that anything could be granted back to the state."
1986.86-234,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,605.505,608.724,That wasn't patronage to hand it back to the state.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,608.724,610.909,"No, that would be sort of anti-patronage, I suppose."
1986.86-234,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,610.909,611.292,Yeah.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,613.392,629.151,"In light of the jury instructions in this case, it seems to us quite remarkable that the government has all, I think, but conceded that the Mail Fraud Statute as applied to a political party leader is wholly inapplicable."
1986.86-234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.866,704.266,"You mean a state official, you mean?"
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,704.266,705.918,"--Yes, he was a state official."
1986.86-234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,708.353,710.653,He was part of the scheme?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,710.653,715.773,--He was found guilty under the government's theory of aiding and abetting Hunt.
1986.86-234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.748,729.183,Did he have any duty to disclose?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,729.183,733.402,"--I don't believe he would of had a duty to disclose, although the jury wasn't required to find that he would."
1986.86-234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,733.402,734.421,"But, he was a state official."
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,734.421,735.021,He was a state official.
1986.86-234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.021,737.539,He certainly is in a different position than Hunt.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,737.539,746.812,He would be in a different position and this case would be somewhat different if the jury had been instructed only that it had to find the Mr. Gray had violated his duties.
1986.86-234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.563,751.096,Did Mr. Gray get any money?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,751.096,751.646,--I'm sorry?
1986.86-234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.646,753.298,Did Mr. Gray get any money?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,753.298,754.565,"No, Mr. Gray did not receive any money."
1986.86-234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,754.565,756.5,He didn't get any benefit?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,756.5,763.838,"The government attempted to prove that he may of gained some benefit, but the jury was not asked to make any findings as to whether he had gained any benefit."
1986.86-234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,768.692,772.879,You answered while ago that this scheme didn't involve any violation of state law.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,777.348,781.818,--I don't believe that Mr. Gray violated any state law as a consequence of his conduct.
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,781.818,792.273,Even if he did in fact receive benefits in the form of condominium usage and vehicle usage and so forth and so on in Florida and elsewhere?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,792.273,811.421,"Well, I'm not frankly completely familiar with bribery laws in the state of Kentucky, but my sense is that those benefits are so far removed from any public actions that Mr. Gray would have undertaken that I doubt seriously there would have been a violation of state law."
1986.86-234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,811.421,813.187,"Well, he was the insurance commissioner, wasn't he?"
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,813.187,813.654,"No, no."
1986.86-234,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,814.873,815.389,xxx.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,815.389,817.408,He was the Secretary of the Cabinet.
1986.86-234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,817.408,818.175,"Yeah, that's right."
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,823.062,832.584,"Well, I hesitate to speak on it, for Mr. Hunt, but I think the answer is they were friends and I don't think it is a scheme, frankly."
1986.86-234,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,867.508,869.174,Who again was Mr. Hunt?
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,869.174,871.642,Mr. Hunt was the head of the Democratic Party.
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,877.363,886.969,"But, he was empowered by the governor to direct the receipt of these insurance commissions?"
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,886.969,890.873,He was placed in charge of basic patronage recommendations.
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,890.873,897.277,He was given some kind of defacto duty to perform on behalf of the state.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,897.277,901.395,"Well, the jury instruction didn't ask for that."
1986.86-234,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.287,940.854,Mr.--
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,940.854,942.256,--on the basis for creating that duty.
1986.86-234,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,946.758,948.86,"--Mr. Phillips, may I just be sure I understand something?"
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,961.969,969.373,"--Well, on that issue, just on that one issue as to whether they're might be a state law duty to disclose the issue would be different."
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1011.133,1022.341,"Mr. Phillips, I don't think our cases are at common law that it was ever an element of fraud that you had to prove pecuniary gain to the defendant."
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1022.341,1033.348,This Court's decisions in both Fasulo and Hammerschmidt state that what is involved with respect to fraud is injury and injury defined in terms of property.
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1033.348,1039.051,"Maybe economic injury to the victim, but never a requirement of gain to the perpetrator."
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1039.051,1039.469,Okay.
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1040.452,1041.503,And that's what you keep arguing--
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1041.503,1041.82,"Well,--"
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1041.82,1042.404,--is missing.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1044.455,1047.325,"--No, Justice O'Connor, I don't mean to imply that."
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1063.435,1063.801,That just isn't an element.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1064.251,1073.274,"You know, our position remains that injury to money or property is a condition required for mail fraud."
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1073.274,1080.129,"Well, there's been a lot of cases haven't there in which that has not been required under this Mail Fraud Statute."
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1086.866,1087.8,"Well, no decisions--"
1986.86-234,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1087.8,1097.591,"Without proof of some kind of, much more than an intangible right kind of an argument."
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1097.591,1105.412,"--Well, none of those decisions were by this Court and the government freely concedes that this Court has never decided the validity of the intangible rights theory."
1986.86-234,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.245,1110.499,"But your position is squarely inconsistent with the Kerner case, or Isaacs case rather, isn't it?"
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1110.499,1111.232,--I'm sorry?
1986.86-234,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1111.966,1120.937,"I know it's not been decided by this Court, but the decision Governor Kerner's case, you would require that one, your position is inconsistent with the holding in that case."
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1120.937,1126.325,"--Well, I think the evidence is slightly different in that case because there really was bribery and--"
1986.86-234,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.325,1127.027,But no injury to the--
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1127.027,1133.014,"--and closeness, the nexus in terms of the duty and the creation of duty--"
1986.86-234,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.014,1136.549,"--I don't think there was any injury, any pecuniary injury to the state of Illinois."
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1136.549,1138.299,"--No, on that issue it's the same."
1986.86-234,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.299,1139.001,It's the same.
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1139.001,1139.551,"But,--"
1986.86-234,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1139.551,1142.703,"But, then where did the duty to disclose come from there?"
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1145.339,1149.707,"--Well, there was more to Kerner actually than simply a duty to disclose."
1986.86-234,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1157.046,1159.296,"In other accounts, but just on the mail fraud is all I'm talking--"
1986.86-234,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1159.296,1160.081,--Just on the mail fraud.

1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1671.056,1671.673,Right.

1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1844.434,1851.957,"--Well, the fact that most have been found is that Gray aided and abetted the scheme that Hunt was carrying out."
1986.86-234,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1851.957,1852.307,Right.

1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2039.76,2052.568,"Well, they probably foresaw situations like it, given the existence of this kind of a patronage system in Kentucky, and given the acceptability under another provision, of splitting of commissions."
1986.86-234,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.353,2058.389,"Still waiting to see who's been done out of money, you know?"
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2058.389,2079.485,"Well, who has been done out of money, number one, we would dispute and there is evidence I think in the record that supports the dispute that there was simply no way for Kentucky to do anything other than pay the money that it paid and to have the premiums that were paid, I'm sorry, the commissions that were paid back to Wombwell paid in a certain amount."
1986.86-234,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.418,2110.023,"That certainly isn't a crime to fail to get the lowest possible price you can for the state in dealing with insurance people, or auto people, or anything else."

1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2164.308,2164.741,--Okay.
1986.86-234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.741,2165.108,Is that fraud?
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2167.593,2168.229,No.
1986.86-234,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2169.862,2177.085,But I take it you are arguing that simply receiving premium payments in the mail is different from getting paid for a job that you perform.

1986.86-234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2190.725,2199.848,I thought you were arguing that it wasn't necessary at all for Kentucky to be cheated out of any money.
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2199.848,2200.314,That's correct.
1986.86-234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.314,2204.235,It's just that somebody was receiving money under false pretenses and--
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2204.235,2204.602,That's correct.

1986.86-234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2344.159,2351.831,So whoever would have gotten the insurance commissions were done out of them?
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2360.187,2367.508,"I think, well the whole idea was to take this pot full of money which amounted $850,000 over four years and spread it around."
1986.86-234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.508,2368.091,Someone else would have kept the money.

1986.86-234,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.136,2386.27,And so that's the person who is economically injured?
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2391.639,2397.377,"Well, our theory is that, well, I don't think it's just our theory."

1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2440.639,2441.039,"--Well, the--"

1986.86-234,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.197,2505.663,Right.

1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2508.682,2509.099,--Okay.

1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2950.081,2950.331,--Okay.
1986.86-234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2950.331,2951.281,A jury xxx find that.
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2971.245,2971.961,With regard to Hunt?
1986.86-234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2971.961,2972.861,Yeah.
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2972.861,2977.149,"I think with regard to Hunt, if you have to reach that, and we submit you don't,--"
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2977.149,2980.184,That's mainly what the Court of Appeals relied on as I remember their opinion.
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2980.184,2980.684,"--Well, that's right."
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2986.038,2991.207,"xxx you said there's sufficient evidence as to the Hunt charge, but they didn't really reach the other, so we'd have to send it back to find out."
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2991.207,2991.658,--Right.
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3008.184,3009.953,"What is the criminal act, you mean as a matter of federal law?"
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3009.953,3011.586,Yes.
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3012.003,3013.355,"Well, this kind of xxx."
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3013.355,3016.124,"--That the whole, as I indicated before, the whole scheme--"
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3016.124,3020.309,The duty is a duty not to violate the Mail Fraud Statute.
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3020.309,3020.928,--That's right.
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3021.744,3025.213,If you prove a violation of the Mail Fraud Statute by proving you violated the xxx.
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3025.213,3026.08,--Well--
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3026.08,3027.848,I have difficulty following that.
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3027.848,3028.432,--Okay.
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3038.537,3043.424,"Of course, the jury was not required to find they were phony companies, as I read the instructions."
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3049.828,3055.582,"Well, they were required to find a scheme for obtaining property by false pretenses."
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3055.582,3056.115,All right.
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3056.115,3058.051,There's got to be some false pretenses.
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3060.053,3064.005,The false pretenses are not disclosing the ownership interest.
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3067.39,3074.813,"--Well they certainly could also be the, and the bulk of the evidence in the case certainly dealt with the channeling of money to Seton."
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3074.813,3075.196,Right.
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3075.196,3077.765,That's what the case was about.
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3082.882,3086.501,"I understand, but you argued at some length the fact that Seton was a sort of a shell."
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3086.501,3087.186,Right.
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3087.186,3090.655,But the jury wasn't instructed to find that.
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3090.655,3095.476,I don't believe that there's anything in the jury instructions that says the jury had to find specifically that Seton was a shell.
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3097.959,3103.48,"So, then don't we have to assume the case would be the same for legal purposes even if Seton were not a shell?"
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3123.476,3131.315,"Well, I think what is critical is that there be a linkage between the duty that's breached, which we are arguing is--"
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3131.315,3133.182,But you're not saying that's the duty to disclose.
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3135.351,3135.767,"--Well, I--"
1986.86-234,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3135.767,3137.969,--The duty to this breach is the duty not to violate the Mail Fraud Statute.
1986.86-234,1,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3137.969,3140.005,--I think there is a duty to disclose.
1986.86-234,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3173.059,3173.959,"Thank you, Mr. Ayer."
1986.86-234,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3176.761,3177.861,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
