1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,11.622,23.37,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,435.794,439.332,In -- in the House that -- that word was “section”?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,439.332,446.642,"It was, first, “section” and then it was changed -- it was, first, “Act” and then it was changed to “section” in the House."
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,455.8,457.008,No discussion of it at all?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,457.008,458.176,No.
1956.97,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,481.252,488.527,"Does that mean then, in the case of mineral lands, there shall not be any place lands taken from the mineral lands?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,488.527,506.108,"We construe it as meaning that not only should there be no mineral lands in any place lands that were granted under the Act, but that there could be no mineral lands involved or mineral rights involved in the right of way which was part of the same Act."
1956.97,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,506.108,508.563,Isn't there a distinction between mineral lands and mineral rights?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,508.563,522.416,"There is, and in the history of Congress dealing with this subject, it did, in time, get around to the consideration of mineral rights as distinguished from mineral lands."
1956.97,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,529.169,533.89,"It would be necessary, wouldn't it, for the right of way to go straight ahead, whether there are any mineral lands there or not."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,533.89,561.325,"Yes, that's true, but we think that the -- the action of Congress in the history of the time was such that Congress want to make as clear as it possibly could still making it possible for the railroad to go through to withhold minerals and that was the fundamental purpose that Congress was trying to carry out by this action in the proviso and also the history of the period at the times."
1956.97,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,561.325,564.077,It said nothing in Act about mineral rights in that question.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,564.077,565.624,"No, there is not."
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,701.308,705.767,Could you tell us the date of those granting Acts?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,705.767,708.28,The granting Acts of the --
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,708.28,709.017,California and Utah.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,709.017,714.265,-- California and Utah were before 1862.
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,721.936,738.641,Is there a body of the Act in other -- other than those two grants to the states from which you are arguing a pattern and -- withholding it did not require explicit as to the expression of the parties?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,738.641,780.094,"Well, there was a pattern that was followed that's described in the mining company case by this Court in which it dealt with the California lands school grants in which it -- the Court described the history and said that it was the purpose of the Congress for the period from about 1849 or 1850 onto 1866 to withhold all mineral lands from any grants and that, during that period, the Congress was trying to decide and determine upon a program for the handling of mineral lands and how they could be acquired."
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,780.094,790.472,"By withholding, did that mean by a specific -- by exquisite reservation or that reservation was implied merely by what is granted?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,790.472,810.85,"Very largely, by the way it was granted and by virtue of other provisions where they would not even permits the lands -- the mineral lands to be surveyed, so that there couldn't be any preemption or entries or other action in accordance with the homestead and other special law."
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,810.85,812.784,It would involve it indicated it.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,812.784,817.265,"Well, it seems to us that it indicated how clearly Congress wanted to do that."
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,817.265,824.209,"That's how such a statute, where you quickly prevail, raise and unfold on the reservation."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,827.357,828.133,That's right.
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,828.133,838.061,"And, here, you derive the reservation from your facts that the land, the mineral will grow, if they would, and the grant would merely do."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,843.097,843.886,Yes.
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,875.588,879.818,"But, your argument is that there wasn't an implied conveyance of a fee."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,879.818,880.377,That's right.
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,880.377,881.455,"That's what it gets down to, isn't it?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,881.455,895.623,"Now, the -- the Court has said, in several cases that we have to deal with, that there was a limited fee in connection with -- with grants under this very Act of the right of way."
1956.97,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1080.417,1086.802,We'll recess now.
1956.97,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1086.802,1090.822,"Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1090.822,1097.655,Mr. Justice Burton asked me about the -- the date of the grant to California and also to Utah.
1956.97,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1120.186,1129.015,"Do you happen to know anything about the mineral -- if there was a method of getting mineral lands, was it not about this time?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1129.015,1136.104,There was very largely under the local regulations of the various areas and they -- the miners --
1956.97,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1136.104,1139.206,"But there is congressional enactment for it, wasn't there?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1139.206,1160.988,"There were some congressional enactments, too, that provided for leases and that the Government should have royalties covering some areas in Indiana and Missouri and some others, and then, the Congress had recognized the local mining laws that had been established by the miners."
1956.97,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1288.956,1301.907,"But, even in 1862, the phrase “mineral land” as it appears in the statute wasn't just a way of saying land that might have minerals under them, was it?It was -- it was a legal phrase that had a meaning of its own."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1305.45,1326.644,"It was generally contemplated as lands that would have minerals and the Government would then -- it was provided that the Government would, through the Department of Interior, determine whether the lands did have minerals and they would then be opened up after that determination for preemption and entry, and so forth."
1956.97,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1326.644,1337.799,"When they said except mineral lands, they meant except those kinds of lands that the Government had designated in -- in some manner as mineral lands, not all lands that might possibly have minerals under them."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1337.799,1348.97,All that the Government would designate either then or at some future date prior to the time that the title was acquired to them.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1407.703,1411.703,"Well, there must have been some of that done at this time."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1411.703,1412.312,Some of it had been done.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1412.312,1424.165,"It's a regular, I suppose, regulations of the Department of Interior in response to the legislation of Congress that identified the mineral land."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1437.801,1437.989,Yes.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1437.989,1447.674,"If anyone got that piece of property and, later, the whole vane was discovered on it or coal or whatever it was."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1449.898,1450.555,No.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1450.555,1457.659,"Or did their -- their title didn't right them until that particular section had been passed on, is that what you're saying?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1457.659,1467.248,"Well, in part, it was the practice to try to -- for the Government to try to determine whether they were mineral lands as rapidly as they could."
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1570.105,1580.87,"Yes, but the railroad had either within its power or subject to the approval of the Government to locate its railroad, and then, it did have a choice within 10 miles of -- of that mine."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1580.87,1582.138,That's right.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1582.138,1587.625,It had a choice of everything except mineral lands.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1587.625,1588.114,That's right.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1588.114,1590.834,"And, that was at the time that the Act was passed?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1599.595,1600.601,"Well, the practice was --"
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1600.601,1602.964,Was it the legislation of Congress that fixed it?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1602.964,1630.927,"The practice was for the Department of Interior to proceed to ascertain insofar as they could and, of course, as a matter of fact, they did not and that gave rise to some disputes later on where they discovered minerals after the time that the railroad had taken them as place lands and settlers claimed that they were entitled to them against the interest of the railroad."
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1652.452,1659.276,"Mr. Solicitor General, are there other grants, in addition to this one, which raises the question who would get it?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1659.276,1671.021,"Yes, probably the one that the Court would be familiar with is the one involving the Great Northern, which was in 1875."
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2172.398,2178.107,"Tell me, what -- what title interest did the railroad get under this grant, as you see?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2178.107,2190.719,"Well, they claim that, under some decisions of this Court, they have a limited fee or a base fee, a fee of simple title except for the right of the fees."
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2190.719,2192.294,They're feasible if they don't do certain things.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2192.294,2197.911,If they didn't complete the railroad and they have to also maintain it under the grant.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2197.911,2200.065,"Well, what was the Government's position as to the interest?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2200.065,2211.07,"Well, the Government contends that the Congress isn't bound by any such conveyancing rules as to the form of the state under general principles of conveyancing."
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2260.985,2289.062,"If I -- if I can quote correctly some of the answers you gave Mr. Justice Reed, you suggested that, as to a given piece of land, what ultimately might be the interest might depend upon when, if at all, this determination whether there were minerals in the land had been made, when, if at all, the line of the right of way had been established and agreed upon, and when, if at all, certain other things had been accomplished."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2289.651,2290.769,Yes.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2291.326,2296.653,"Well, that certainly strikes me as meaning they got no interest at all until all these things are done."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2296.653,2314.086,"Well, they probably wouldn't because the difficulty is that you see they were to start out in Omaha and go the best route they could to the West, straight West as possible, in general terms."
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2322.289,2325.121,But that right of way was going to be surveyed.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2332.508,2333.686,That's right.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2334.253,2340.938,"And, once they had determined where that was, wasn't there some provision that it had to be approved by the Government or something?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2343.78,2346.445,"Well, they had a very large --"
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2346.445,2346.952,Discretion.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2346.952,2353.337,-- discretion about putting it because the grant was just not as explicit as later grants.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2353.337,2360.411,"It's very explicit, to me at least, if you want to say where the -- where the mines would run."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2360.411,2363.665,"Well, it became more explicit, it seems to me, Mr. Justice."
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2376.54,2377.935,"So, they did do that?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2378.025,2379.073,Yes.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2379.073,2380.887,-- set that out and they defined it.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2380.887,2381.307,Yes.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2382.782,2386.395,They -- did they have to accept that or approve it or something?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2386.395,2393.39,"Well, they were to advise the Government of it and, I presume, it was implicit that there would be a general approval."
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2393.39,2395.803,Their -- it was their choice rather than the Government's?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2395.803,2397.16,Yes.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2414.559,2420.257,"Well, now, did -- did the Government ever determine whether some of these lands was mineral lands with implication here?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2420.257,2422.522,"Well, this is just the right of way itself."
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2422.522,2423.511,"Well, that's what I'm talking about."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2423.511,2424.238,"And so, the --"
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2424.238,2428.338,Did they ever determine that any part of the right of way was mineral land?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2428.338,2430.422,Not that I know of.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2432.805,2435.61,"Do you -- you -- what's the argument then, that you --"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2435.61,2435.778,That the --
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2435.778,2439.499,-- the Government can now determine that it's mineral lands and take it back?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2439.499,2448.376,"No, that there was never any intention that mineral lands on the railroad be granted and has any kind of a --"
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2448.376,2448.476,From the right of way.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2448.476,2449.514,-- fee right --
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2449.514,2450.43,From the right of way.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2450.43,2451.488,That's right.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2474.792,2477.422,"Well, do I get that to mean distance?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2482.729,2482.837,Right of way.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2482.837,2483.933,-- right of way itself.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2483.933,2484.939,That's right.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2484.939,2498.721,"Your point is that all was given was the right of way without any of the underlying mineral rights, whether or not there ever was a determination by the Government that they were mineral lands, is that it?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2498.721,2500.068,"Yes, except for one thing."
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2532.517,2540.02,"Well, I'm -- the thing that confuses me, I think, is -- I gather now, you're making a distinction between place lands and the right of way."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2540.02,2540.457,Yes.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2540.457,2553.133,That there may have been interest in the place lands which depended upon and were determined by Government decisions whether or not some of those place lands were or were not mineral lands.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2553.133,2553.423,That's right.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2553.423,2554.12,Is that true?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2554.12,2554.547,Yes.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2554.547,2556.364,That's not so as to the right of way.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2568.812,2569.152,Yes.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2569.152,2569.948,Is that it?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2569.948,2578.986,The only further thing would be that there would have to be support on -- support for the railroad that they would get that much right in the -- under surface.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2578.986,2579.882,Yes.
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2579.882,2592.775,"Is it proper to add that -- is it appropriate to add, in addition to what you said, that what they got -- what mineral lands were conveyed was determined, as a matter of fact, by the landowners and the Interior Department?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2592.775,2593.324,That's right.
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2593.324,2602.735,"Whether it was or wasn't mineral land, it was an administrative determination on Section 3 of the Act."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2602.735,2602.913,That's correct.
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2602.913,2622.661,"The statute itself neither defined nor limited what mineral -- what was conveyed by mineral lands, either technical or whatever you call them, technological matters that left to be assumed, just as it would assume knowledge of the Department of the Interior as the landowners upon such land, is that right?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2622.661,2624.256,That's correct.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2624.256,2632.636,But the -- as I understand that the Department of the Interior has never determined that these were mineral lands?
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2632.636,2633.712,"It would come before it, wouldn't it?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2633.712,2648.519,"So far as I know, it never had the -- the question presented to it as far as whether or not these are mineral lands as such because that didn't apply, according to the Government's position, to the right of way."
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2687.072,2690.536,Where -- is the 1866 Act printed in here?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2690.536,2693.139,The 1866 Act is not.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2739.722,2742.796,We still have the same problem of what is a mineral land.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2742.796,2745.251,"Yes, but --"
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2745.251,2760.195,"Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask finally whether it's necessary to the position the Government takes that we accept your construction of that proviso that all mineral lands shall be excepted from the operation of this Act?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2760.195,2760.205,No.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2760.205,2761.413,Is that necessary to your --
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2761.413,2764.016,"No, I think that is a guide to the --"
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2764.016,2764.962,To make weight?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2764.962,2768.315,-- to the intention of Congress in connection with the matter.
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2783.004,2787.814,"Well, now, where are we going to get that, from legislative history or what?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2787.814,2819.259,"Well, I think the legislative history and also the history of the times which is treated in the Great Northern and also in a number of the cases we cite indicating that -- including the Mining Company case by this Court in which the Court recognized that there was no purpose on the part of Congress to make conveyance of these mineral lands and transfer them, that there was a purpose to withhold for the protection of the interest of the country."
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2819.259,2819.379,Do you agree?
1956.97,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2819.379,2828.989,"I gather, then, that the change from “section” to “act” in the proviso you think is reflective of the general concept that that's all the Government intended to give at the time."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2828.989,2830.125,That's right.
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2831.939,2836.081,Would you agree that a good way to start is to read Section 2 and 3?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2836.081,2836.52,I didn't get --
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2836.52,2842.806,"Would you agree that a good way to start with this problem is to read Section 2 and 3, and see what they direct themselves to?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2842.806,2843.842,That's right.
1956.97,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2861.232,2863.725,You mentioned something about administrative interpretations.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2865.911,2869.482,That's right and that's because nobody asked for it.
1956.97,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2879.698,2885.865,But there is no interpretation that carries out your point of view from the administrative end of it for many years.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2885.865,2886.512,That's right.
1956.97,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2893.227,2896.099,Because they've learned a lot in those 50 years.
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2896.099,2900.92,"Well, I don't think it's that so much, although that could contribute to it."
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2920.695,2926.554,What territory is involved by the issue that is now before us?
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2929.356,2930.514,"Well, the --"
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2930.514,2931.911,"I mean, in this case alone."
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2931.911,2932.36,No.
1956.97,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2947.233,2957.672,"Are you saying that the claim that is now before us, as been recognized below, was not made until this suit was started?"
1956.97,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2957.672,2961.455,That's my understanding.
1956.97,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2962.643,2968.03,"You may, Mr. Solicitor General."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,2968.819,2971.112,May it please the Court.
1956.97,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3022.269,3023.604,That's on the right of way land?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3023.604,3024.932,On the right of way land.
1956.97,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3027.096,3028.192,Where is this --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3028.192,3032.182,"It's on page 13 of the record, finding number 8."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3061.377,3065.901,"Mr. Clary, am I correct that right of way is uniformly 400 feet in width, isn't it?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3065.901,3073.833,"It is a strip of land, Your Honor, 400 feet in width, as so defined in Section 2 of the Act."
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3073.833,3073.903,In places --
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3073.903,3080.455,"And where first towns have grown up along the right of way, I suppose you sometimes conveyed."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3080.455,3089.567,"In the early days, conveyances were made and they were held invalid in some of the early cases, and there have been congressional statutes validating those."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3108.939,3110.727,Have there been leases?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3110.727,3111.896,Yes.
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3111.896,3112.825,For industrial --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3112.825,3113.214,It's a --
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3113.214,3113.343,-- sites?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3113.343,3119.975,"-- common practice, the matter, I might say, I think I may safely say of common knowledge."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3171.705,3173.882,"It's down the existing main line right of way, I believe --"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3173.882,3174.071,"Yes, sir."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3174.071,3174.609,That the possible grant --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3174.609,3175.337,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3177.345,3178.864,There are no branch lines.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3178.864,3180.182,"Well, there are many branch lines."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3180.182,3181.68,But not -- but none involved here.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3181.68,3194.305,"But, the question that's involved here, in a strictly technical sense, is -- is only 80 acres."
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3244.658,3246.765,Any production in the right of way?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3246.765,3247.553,I beg your pardon?
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3247.553,3250.231,Any production of oil and minerals?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3250.231,3255.055,"So far as I know, there is none at this time on the Union Pacific right of way."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3259.381,3260.999,"They never drilled out of wells, did they?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3260.999,3269.529,"The Union Pacific, as far as I know, has never drilled any -- or any oil on its right of way until this attempt."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3420.367,3422.615,When -- when did they issue these patents?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3422.615,3426.221,"Well, they've been issued over a period of many years, Your Honor."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3426.221,3431.894,There must have been some -- something that caused the issuance of the patent.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3431.894,3446.437,"Well, the first thing that was done was that the railroad laid out its line of track and then, answering your question, there were no specific restriction as to where it might go, except there were termini."
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3541.09,3552.179,"Would the -- Mr. Clary, would the -- if the right of way -- if the road has to go through mineral lands that wasn't, and crosses the injunction, would the minerals that meets the right of way also go to the railroad?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3552.179,3557.473,"Well, our position is, and I -- I'm coming to that now --"
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3557.473,3557.772,Take your time.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3557.772,3565.813,"-- that the grant of the right of way was a grant of a fee and, therefore, the minerals in the right of way pass with the fee."
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3565.813,3566.431,I understand that.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3589.053,3590.841,"We think it would, Your Honor, very definitely and --"
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3590.841,3592.372,Whether it's mineral land or not?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3592.372,3597.636,"We think whether it was mineral or not, and we think the decisions clearly support that."
1956.97,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3597.636,3598.194,"Excuse me, Mr. Clary."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3598.324,3600.452,I don't understand.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3600.452,3601.261,I beg your pardon?
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3601.261,3608.823,I don't understand yet when the acquisition or what triggered the issue of the patent.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3608.823,3648.958,"When the Act was passed, the railroad, and this was amended in 1864 in order to increase the place lands, it was provided that, in Section 4 of the Act, that if it should appear that 40 consecutive miles of said railroad and telegraph line had been -- had been completed and equipped in all respects as required by the Act, then upon the certificate of the Commissioners who are appointed for the Government, happens -- should issue conveying the right and title to the said land to said company."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3658.367,3658.726,"Yes, but --"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3658.726,3664.429,-- because of the determination of whether it was mineral or homestead or whether there were exceptions or reservations --
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3664.429,3665.828,But that was what gave --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3665.828,3667.375,-- but that is the factor.
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3667.375,3676.419,"-- the authority for the issuance of it and, before they were issued, I understand you to say that there was a decision as to whether there were any mineral lands within that area."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3676.419,3683.335,"Well, there was supposed to have been a decision before the patent was issued as to whether it was mineral land."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3684.373,3687.149,What -- what shows us that that was a part of the regulation?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3689.537,3691.434,"Well, the --"
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3691.434,3692.983,Or is the record clear on that?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3695.16,3700.294,The decisions -- the --
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3700.294,3702.561,There must have been a declaration made by --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3702.561,3702.73,Nothing --
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3702.73,3706.605,-- the Secretary of the Interior to someone as to what was mineral land sometime --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3706.605,3707.394,When --
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3707.394,3708.383,-- before the patent.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3708.383,3732.156,"When the railroad applied for a patent under the clause which I read, it was the duty of the Secretary under the law to determine whether the land was of the kind to which a patent should issue, whether it was mineral or non-mineral, or whether it was reserved."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3769.434,3772.781,"Mr. Clary, getting back to the right of way for a moment."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3780.993,3797.605,"The railroad it's -- of course, there had been three surveys of transcontinental routes made during the 1950s, but they're -- the -- after the Act was passed, the railroad had to survey and actually locate the precise line, and it did so."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3797.605,3799.184,That's the 400 feet.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3799.184,3800.272,That was the 400 feet.
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3800.272,3800.491,Now --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3800.491,3802.818,They located the center line of that.
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3802.818,3806.433,"Now, how long was it after the grant that that was completed?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3806.433,3808.092,"About two years, if I --"
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3808.092,3819.629,And when is it in -- what is your position as to when in point of time you acquired what you say was a fee?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3819.629,3831.034,There are decisions of the Courts on that which hold that we acquired it either at the date of the grant or at the date of the filing of that exact line.
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3873.053,3883.081,"Now, all -- all the discussion you've been having with Mr. Justice Reed on the matter of patents is -- is not pertinent at all to the interest you acquired or settled, --"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3883.081,3883.669,I don't --
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3883.669,3883.688,-- alleging and claiming or acquiring it from --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3883.688,3885.176,"-- I think it is, Your Honor."
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3898.921,3902.646,"May I comment in for one or two more decisions, Mr. Clary."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3915.293,3916.281,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3916.281,3919.468,Did he grant formally a formal document?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3919.468,3921.615,The grant itself conveyed the title.
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3921.615,3925.62,"Yes, but where -- is the grant expressed in a formal document?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3926.648,3928.305,There is no formal document here.
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3928.305,3930.124,All you do is you draw the line and that's the --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3930.124,3939.682,"The decisions of the Courts, which I would like to cite in a few minutes, hold that the grant itself was the conveyance."
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3941.281,3943.807,"When you say grant, do you mean what the statute gave you?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3943.807,3945.456,"Yes, I mean Section 2."
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3945.456,3946.004,All right.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3946.004,3946.144,That's the grant.
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3946.144,3947.593,It has become --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3947.593,3948.841,That is a --
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3948.841,3950.798,That becomes a section as soon as you drew the line.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3950.798,3951.707,That is right.
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3951.707,3952.227,Is that it?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3952.227,3952.825,It's a --
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3952.825,3954.354,There are no legal documents at all.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3954.354,3955.192,None whatever.
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3968.467,3968.586,And that may --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3968.586,3969.364,As soon --
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3969.364,3977.141,"-- and that may include land which, in another connection, the Secretary of the Interior has found to be mineral land."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3977.141,3979.368,That's certainly true because the --
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3979.368,3980.526,I follow.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3980.526,3980.595,-- the land in the other connection --
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3980.595,3981.863,All right.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3981.863,3982.891,-- is in the place lands.
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3982.891,3983.659,In place lands.
1956.97,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3983.659,3988.573,"When you complete your survey, you must file a certified map of some kind."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,3988.573,3989.192,That is right.
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3998.964,4001.063,Where is it filed out?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4001.063,4003.49,That was filed with the Secretary of the Interior.
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4008.884,4011.011,Does he have to approve of the land?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4011.011,4013.767,The law didn't require him to approve it.
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4013.877,4021.9,"So that, what it really means is this is what Congress has written in Section 2 and you're the master of turning it into reality, is that right?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4021.9,4023.069,I don't know if I understand your question.
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4023.069,4033.209,"Well, section -- Congress granted this Act in 1862 and gave you whatever rights regarding the Section 2, and you determine what those rights are, typically speaking."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4033.209,4033.578,"Well, we --"
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4033.578,4035.315,"This is -- I mean, you determine where they are."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4035.315,4037.853,We determine where they are by --
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4037.853,4038.292,All right.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4038.292,4041.388,"-- but the termini, as I said, are fixed."
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4041.388,4042.676,"Well, fixed by what then?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4042.676,4062.259,"By the statute, so that there couldn't be -- and the general route had to follow -- it had to go from a point on the 100th meridian somewhere near Omaha to San Francisco and -- so that there wasn't so much leeway as they might think, but --"
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4062.259,4075.095,"So that our question, the problem before the Court, and this is a fair statement, the problem before the Court is to construe Section 2 with such aids to construction as are appropriate for the Court in determining what the statute means."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4075.095,4084.344,"I think that is right; whether Section 2, as we maintain, granted the fee or limited fee which included the minerals."
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4085.863,4101.702,"Well, Mr. Clary, your position is then that the grant under Section 2, so far as mineral rights is concerned, is -- is broader than the -- than the same right granted under Section 3."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4101.702,4110.515,"Yes, Your Honor, in the sense that there was a specific exception of mineral lands in Section 3."
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4110.515,4113.761,"And you -- in Section 2, you take without reservation --"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4113.761,4114.18,Without any --
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4114.18,4115.028,-- of any kind.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4115.028,4119.97,"-- without any exception or reservations, and that is what this Court has held."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4122.337,4135.032,"Then, the provision in Section 4 that it had to be approved as having been properly constructed, and so forth, and -- and then authorizing the patent."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4139.645,4143.161,"No, no patent was ever issued with the right of way lands."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4143.161,4156.957,"But, you didn't have a right of way granted to you, actually located, until you had built your 40 miles and had it approved by the Commissioners appointed by the President."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4156.957,4161.68,"Well, we -- it was located by the survey but the --"
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4161.68,4162.979,"But, it had to be approved."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4162.979,4165.117,It had to be approved before the patent was issued.
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4165.117,4172.768,"So, you -- you really did not know where your alliance were until you had the approval under Section 4, didn't you?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4172.768,4177.499,"Well, I might have to -- had to prove them, but they were built each 40 miles."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4177.499,4178.296,Yes.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4178.296,4183.212,We didn't know whether the Secretary would -- would approve that.
1956.97,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4192.497,4194.076,And that's what marked your lines.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4194.076,4198.391,"And that's what made it finally definite, yes, sir."
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4198.391,4214.87,"Would it disturb the plain order of your argument if you went straight to the point that they said you were coming and, in answer to Chief Justice's question, you gave us an ambiguous answer and said, “and the decisions of this Court so held.”"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4217.277,4218.545,I'd be very glad to.
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4218.545,4221.511,"But don't, if your order of argument suggests another."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4221.511,4225.186,Well --
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4225.186,4237.384,"Of course, if that's so, then it's the property that matters, we often observe what we previously held of our other decisions."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,4237.384,4250.01,The -- we based that conclusion on -- on three different arguments.
1956.97,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5009.478,5011.616,What was the controversy?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5011.616,5026.854,The controversy was the question whether the -- a person arrested on a train of the Northern Pacific was within Indian country or not within Indian country.
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5168.583,5173.947,"Incidentally, do either of those grants have anything comparable to this proviso of Section 3?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5173.947,5186.023,"Yes, Your Honor, both the Northern Pacific and the Atlantic Pacific grant had exceptions of mineral lands in -- in the place land grant."
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5186.023,5187.572,By a phrase this is --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5187.572,5188.021,I think the phrase is --
1956.97,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5188.021,5190.258,-- subject to the operation of this Act?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5190.258,5191.066,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5197.04,5205.302,"Is that the language that you just read in the Townsend case and others in Northern Pacific, was that essential to the decision?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5205.302,5206.601,"Well, we think it was."
1956.97,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5222.995,5226.141,What do you call the Atlantic and Pacific case?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5226.969,5239.536,"That is New Mexico versus United States Trust Company, 172 U.S."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5280.908,5284.254,Which case was that?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5284.254,5286.76,That was this present case.
1956.97,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5304.661,5306.578,Did you cite any other cases on that?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5306.578,5338.135,"Well, we have cited a number of cases in our brief and I would like to read one right now.A -- a sample case, a very typical case, a state case is Davis versus Skipper 125 Texas 364, where the plaintiffs who held a possibility of reverter in lands which had been granted for church purposes and they were not permitted to enjoin the search from billing for all."
1956.97,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5430.837,5433.633,Are you saying that -- I don't know what section is that.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5436.879,5439.206,I say that's a general authority --
1956.97,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5439.206,5441.962,-- when a right of way is conveyed --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5441.962,5442.002,I say --
1956.97,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5442.002,5445.409,-- it gives the railroad the right to export the oil?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5445.409,5467.552,"I say that when a limited fee is conveyed to anybody, a railroad or anyone else, and the grantor reserves only a right of reverter in the event of abandonment that the right to take the minerals belongs to the owner of the limited fee and not to the holder of the reverter or --"
1956.97,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5467.552,5470.709,Is there a right of reverter stated here in this section?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5470.709,5471.657,Is what?
1956.97,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5471.657,5475.233,Is there a right of reverter stated in this section?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5475.233,5493.272,"There is no right of reverter in this section, Your Honor, but the Court in the Townsend and other cases have held that under the grant of Section 2, there is an implied condition of reverter if the railroad ceases to use the land for a railroad."
1956.97,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5493.272,5495.97,"But that's less than a fee, isn't it?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5495.97,5496.518,"Well, certainly."
1956.97,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5539.15,5555.683,"I rather thought, or maybe I'm wrong about it but, generally, a fee is recognized that the transfer of land completely, immediately, all the interest in perpetuity."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5555.683,5563.021,"Well, there -- that is a fee -- what Your Honor has described would be commonly called a fee simple absolute, --"
1956.97,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5563.021,5563.899,Yes.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5563.899,5569.643,-- but there are -- there are qualified determinable or diffusible fees.
1956.97,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5569.643,5570.992,Less than that?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5570.992,5571.732,"Well, they're --"
1956.97,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5571.732,5572.132,Well --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5572.132,5581.441,"They're less than fee simple absolute, but my point is that the difference is in the duration of the estate, not in the quantity of it."
1956.97,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5618.985,5628.394,"Do those decisions say whether, in the event of abandonment, title is reacquired only upon reentry or automatically?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5628.394,5631.99,"Your Honor, as far as I know, there's never been a decision on that, but --"
1956.97,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5631.99,5633.069,But there are distinctions.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5638.853,5656.302,"That is true, but that has to do with the remedy which the holder of the reversion would apply, namely, whether the reverter would be automatic or whether the holder of the possibility of reverter would have to do something affirmative."
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5886.88,5887.849,Mr. Clary.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5887.849,5888.588,"And, --"
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5888.588,5892.452,"May I ask you a question, I hope I'm not pressing too much."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5906.308,5909.444,In certain portions of the 400-foot step.
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5909.444,5921.57,"And, now, in the Townsend case, which I've know read for the first time and it's been uncommonly short opinion by Mr. Justice White, they might be a little short."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5937.137,5940.424,"I intended to cover that point, Your Honor, if I get to it."
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5940.424,5941.852,All right.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5941.852,5945.757,I don't think the Townsend case prohibits the railroad itself.
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5945.757,5946.786,From selling?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5946.786,5949.196,"Well, it prohibits them from selling but it doesn't prohibit it --"
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5949.196,5950.863,Not in 99 years.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5950.863,5965.668,"I think it would prohibit it from making any alienation -- I don't -- of its land for any long period, but I don't think it prohibits it from, itself, making other uses which do not interfere with the operation of the railroad."
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5965.668,5970.778,"And, if these other uses to which you referred earlier are its own businesses?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5970.778,5971.966,"No, they may not be."
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5973.833,5975.25,"Well, if they may be anything --"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5975.25,5975.32,But in --
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5975.32,5976.128,That would be --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5976.128,5976.808,-- in every instance --
1956.97,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5976.808,5978.414,That would be the case that troubles them.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,5978.414,5989.916,"In every instance, Your Honor, the railroad would reserve the right to repossess that land the moment it needed it for railroad purposes."
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6008.948,6015.011,Could the railroad sell the land in this right of way subject to the reversionary right of the Government?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6015.011,6017.268,"I don't think, Your Honor, it could sell it at all."
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6018.156,6023.411,Why couldn't it -- if it has the fee subject to this reversionary right?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6023.411,6023.57,The Court --
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6023.57,6027.555,Why couldn't it sell what it had -- what it owns if it has the fee?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6027.555,6033.272,The Court held in the Townsend case that it could not alienate that right of way.
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6033.272,6036.468,"Well, isn't that inconsistent with the fee?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6036.468,6045.041,It's not inconsistent with a limited fee for the use granted for the purposes of the railroad.
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6045.041,6045.22,Well --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6045.22,6047.227,"That would, in effect, be an abandonment, yes."
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6047.227,6050.413,Is mining for the purposes of the railroad?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6050.413,6051.271,I beg your pardon?
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6051.271,6056.536,Is mining or developing for oil for the purposes of the railroad?
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6056.536,6071.919,But -- developing the grant does not limit the railroad from the use of the land so long as it operates the railroad for other purposes which are not inconsistent.
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6071.919,6081.174,"But, what is or what would there be to prevent them from selling the land subject to the reversionary right of the Government in -- in the event that --"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6081.174,6082.023,The only --
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6082.023,6083.212,-- in the event that the railroad was --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6083.212,6085.2,"One time, I thought they could do that."
1956.97,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6160.388,6163.316,"Then it could lease, apparently, to oil companies to do this?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6163.316,6176.751,"It could lease providing it always preserved the right to repossess the land if needed for railroad purposes, and that --"
1956.97,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6176.751,6177.86,"Well, suppose that -- suppose --"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6177.86,6182.624,In every lease the railroad has ever made is the right to repossess when it's needed.
1956.97,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6182.624,6193.346,"Well, suppose an issue of interference with a proper conduct for the railroad should be raised merely from the fact that you made the lease, and the Government part by the extent of the operations --"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6193.346,6193.455,After --
1956.97,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6193.455,6196.161,"-- by the oil company under the lease, then, what happens?"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6196.161,6212.43,"That issue was raised in the trial court here, but the Court found that the proposed operations would not interfere with the operations of the railroad and, in the court of appeals, that finding was not challenged."
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6485.997,6493.61,"Mr. Clary, before you finish, may I ask just one question about the wording in this Act that the Solicitor General commented on."
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6498.434,6499.223,"Yes, sir."
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6499.223,6504.447,"No, first, as to the “Act,” then, they changed it in the House to the “section.”"
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6514.196,6515.324,In the Act.
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6515.324,6516.462,-- in the Act.
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6516.462,6516.851,That's --
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6516.851,6516.91,What --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6516.91,6517.339,-- true.
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6517.339,6518.647,What --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6518.647,6519.096,Well --
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6519.096,6519.904,Since you're next in that --
1956.97,1,44299,william_w_clary,,6519.904,6534.949,"That is the correct statement of what happened, but it seems to us that it's immaterial because counsel himself concedes that the exception, even though it says in this Act, cannot apply to the right of way."
1956.97,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6603.885,6605.903,Mr. Solicitor General.
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6605.903,6607.74,Mr. Chief Justice.
1956.97,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6607.74,6626.661,What do you say to the argument that the exception in Section 3 and Section 2 says the exception means all mineral lands shall be excepted but the right of way must go through whether there are mineral underlying the land?
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6626.661,6644.889,"I think it could apply to the subsurface without any question and I think that Congress intended, in view of the history of the period, to reserve the minerals and was trying to do it in every way possible and that's why they made the change from “Section” to “Act.”"
1956.97,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6644.889,6648.884,Do you think mineral lands mean mineral rights?
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6648.884,6672.989,I think that it was so considered by Congress at that time and that the history of the later development in which they distinguished between surface rights and mineral rights was due to the entirely different factor of trying to make the surface available to settlers and that they were trying to make every protection they could for the minerals of this country.
1956.97,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6672.989,6676.045,"The preservation then would apply, too, wouldn't it?"
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6676.045,6679.391,It -- it would apply as far as subsurface rights are concerned.
1956.97,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6679.391,6682.157,"It's all you've got coming in here, isn't it?"
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6682.157,6683.306,Yes.
1956.97,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6684.435,6688.28,"Excuse me, may I -- may I get this clear now, Mr. Solicitor General."
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6696.832,6703.524,"Well, I'm not -- I thought your question, Mr. Justice, was whether or not that was our sole reliance."
1956.97,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6703.634,6705.213,I guess that's the way I phrased it.
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6705.213,6706.77,It is not our sole reliance.
1956.97,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6710.457,6720.056,But one of your arguments and one of the propositions upon which you do rely is that that proviso is to be read into two as if it appeared there?
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6720.056,6721.324,Yes.
1956.97,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7084.439,7087.986,"May I ask you one more question before you sit down, Mr. Solicitor."
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,7103.155,7103.755,That's right.
1956.97,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7103.755,7136.416,"But I'm also impressed by the fact, in reading your assertion, that various judges, various members of this Court, and at least one or two Congresses, with land problems more particularly on mind, so that this particular problem did characterize this, what was different in Section 2 has a grant which is, in scope, very different from a mere right of passage."
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,7179.993,7212.761,"Well, I think it is, insofar as it was necessary to the holding in a particular case, but it seems to me that the Court was trying to solve that problem and it -- and then, went back to the general law or language of conveyance instead of directing its attention to what the intent of the Congress was in the specific Act and what they were trying to accomplish, as this Court has done over the years in trying to construe Congressional Acts."
1956.97,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7226.177,7226.227,Would you say that --
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,7226.227,7227.205,"And, I argue that --"
1956.97,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7227.205,7236.865,"Would you say that, Mr. Solicitor General, even though, as I understand it, two of those cases involved grants where this proviso in haec verba appears?"
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,7236.865,7249.95,"Well, one of them was a case of adverse possession question and the other was whether or not the United States could convey part of the right of way."
1956.97,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7249.95,7260.659,"But, suppose -- I understand -- as I understand Mr. Clary, in two of those cases, two -- involved two grants with the precise proviso that we have before us here."
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,7260.659,7271.417,"Well, but they didn't involve the question of whether these minerals are oil and gas rights or mineral rights were passed or to be with -- or reserved by the Congress."
1956.97,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7271.417,7280.187,"So, you say then we ought to pay no significance to the fact that the grants did have that provision since the issue of mineral rights was not involved either case."
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,7280.187,7298.953,"No, and I point to the Great Northern case as one which this Court did do the very thing of looking to see what the intentions -- intention of Congress was, what the history of the moment was, the history of the whole period was, and whether, under all of that, it was intended to pass oil and gas rights."
1956.97,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7300.72,7303.697,"Anything could do, 36 in number there."
1956.97,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,7303.697,7308.142,"Yes, that's right."
1956.97,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7308.142,7322.944,Very well.
