1961.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,30.26,"Number 15, Western Union Telegraph Company, Appellant, versus Pennsylvania, by Sidney Gottlieb, Escheator."
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,33.231,37.413,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.15,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,214.806,217.352,"And who's the drawee of the draft, who is he?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,217.352,233.053,The drafts are drawn on banks called fiscal agents and sub-fiscal agents of Western Union but they're just banks in various cities throughout the United States but none of those cities are in Pennsylvania.
1961.15,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,233.053,235.697,Western Union is drawer?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,235.697,238.861,Western Union draws against its account at those banks --
1961.15,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,238.861,242.241,"But yet, what are -- one of those fiscal agencies?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,242.241,244.87,One of those fiscal agencies?
1961.15,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,244.87,249.277,And the sendee is the -- is the payee of the draft?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,249.277,252.301,The sendee is named as the payee --
1961.15,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,252.301,252.725,Normally --
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,252.725,254.529,But of course these are negotiable.
1961.15,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,259.223,262.13,"Doesn't really fit differ much with check, does it?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,262.13,264.397,It's a check.
1961.15,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,264.397,269.427,"If it's a draft in any event, it's accepted before it's delivered."
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,272.133,274.85,It is an absolute obligation of Western Union.
1961.15,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,274.85,278.42,It's not drawn on the bank but it's drawn on Western Union --
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,278.42,278.427,No --
1961.15,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,278.427,279.588,-- available at the bank?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,279.588,281.504,"No I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1961.15,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,293.463,295.183,"It's an effective check, right?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,295.183,297.893,It's a check.
1961.15,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,319.401,331.613,"Are you in effect, send a Western Union here is -- is your client is a stakeholder and you don't care to whom you're paid as long as you're protected?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,331.613,342.283,"We do want to be protected, Your Honor, and in our position in this case is this Pennsylvania decree cannot protect us."
1961.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,394.508,399.587,Does any other state ever brought any actions to escheat this money?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,399.587,424.035,"Other states have brought actions or made claims, some of them under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act don't bring actions, they just say give us a return, give a report and pay the money in, and as I will show later, some of those are quite duplicative as of the same moment of escheat."
1961.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,428.891,436.73,"Of course, well do you -- do you concede that -- in these circumstances, some state couldn't cheat the money?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,436.73,438.339,Yes Your Honor as I will indicate --
1961.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,438.339,439.537,What state is that?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,439.537,443.012,"As I will indicate, New York here has the strongest claim --"
1961.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,443.012,444.512,Did you ever done it?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,444.512,447.472,Oh we send regular reports to New York --
1961.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,447.472,449.665,Have they ever escheated the money?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,449.665,451.615,"Oh yes, they regularly, yes."
1961.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,451.615,452.067,All of it?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,452.067,452.531,Money --
1961.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,452.531,452.536,Or --
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,452.536,452.761,-- money permits.
1961.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,452.761,455.24,-- probably your whole system?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,455.24,458.03,They only escheat after 15 years.
1961.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,458.03,459.011,"Yes, but I mean --"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,459.011,462.141,"Therefore, they're sometimes too late."
1961.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,464.89,477.317,But has New York attempted to escheat the money on all of your -- all your transactions throughout the country because you are incorporated in New York?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,477.317,480.162,"No it does not appear in the record, but that is the fact, Your Honor."
1961.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,480.162,480.88,That is the fact.
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,480.88,481.896,That is the fact.
1961.15,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,522.722,526.998,Why can you not distinguish?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,526.998,545.426,Because Pennsylvania has no provision for New York for instance which has already brought suit for at least part of the particular funds back of the particular drafts involved in this Pennsylvania case.
1961.15,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,589.976,616.084,"Well, I think this raise was to the Pennsylvania Court and would substitute service was then had upon the creditor, would that not bind New York?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,616.084,629.983,"With good seizure of the raise and good fair notice, an opportunity to come into courts, it would bind New York."
1961.15,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,649.034,654.849,"You made one statement that I'm not sure I quite understood, maybe I understood it wrong."
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,664.054,669.154,The very nature of escheat is that it takes 100% of funds.
1961.15,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,702.06,721.243,"Well I'm not take -- talking about making you pay it, two or three or four or five, did I understand you to say that's under the law, one state is entitled in every dollar of this fund, one or another state is entitled to every dollar of this fund."
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,721.243,722.552,"Every dollar of this fund, Your Honor."
1961.15,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,722.552,726.17,With no distinction possibly would be drawn in your judgment?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,726.17,736.646,"No, some of these funds might be proven to be new to the State of Nevada or I don't think they have a current escheat statute or say, California."
1961.15,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,736.646,739.077,You mean there's a state that doesn't have escheat statute?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,739.077,743.103,It's up 22 and it's going strong.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,743.103,749.18,"Well Mr. Buchanan, analytically, what's the relationship between Western Union and these deposits?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,749.18,753.429,"The relationship, it is just a creditor-debtor."
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,753.429,758.232,"So that -- it was a property, it's a debt owing by Western Union to somebody?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,758.232,760.864,A debt owing by Western Union to somebody in most --
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,760.864,765.806,Somebody -- to somebody is the depositor as creditor.
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,765.806,767.726,"No, not a depositor Your Honor."
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,768.317,769.224,"Not as depositor, the fellow --"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,769.224,769.617,No.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,769.617,774.09,-- who buys -- gives you the money and gets his draft.
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,774.09,782.691,"In very few other cases is the fellow that gave us the money, the one who is the obligee because --"
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,782.691,786.533,How much -- or is this a combination?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,807.001,815.014,If we don't deliver within 72 hours and that is -- is the next step in the procedure.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,823.832,828.155,That's by reason of agreement between us at the time I purchase the draft.
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,828.155,831.184,Agreement as set up by the filed tariffs.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,831.184,839.569,"Right, now is -- as to the funds that are involved here, what do they represent?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,851.852,871.313,"Though I wondered whether Your Honor's son would give you the opportunity with refund, the majority -- the great majority of the monies involved here are cases of outstanding negotiable drafts payable to the sendees."
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,871.313,871.768,So that in --
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,871.768,872.877,The son at college.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,872.877,878.97,"So that in that sense the father no longer has any right to fund, does he?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,878.97,880.317,No.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,882.065,882.146,Yes.
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,882.146,885.538,-- cases where the whole idea is to put money and to come out at the same place.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,885.538,901.146,"Whether the relationship is between you -- the Western Union and the father by reason the father's right to refund or between Western Union and the son by reason of the outstanding draft, where it be the son will be to holder of that I guess it's negotiable draft."
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,906.092,912.136,"Debtor to creditor, evidenced by draft in almost all the cases -- in some of the cases."
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,912.136,914.898,So what's escheated here is what?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,917.722,920.415,It's the interest of the creditor.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,920.415,921.869,And not of Western Union?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,921.869,930.246,No it's -- it's an obligation of Western Union but it's the interest in that obligation which is escheated.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,930.246,935.497,I guess that's negotiable (Inaudible)
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,935.497,950.991,The typical case you might say of those that are involved here is an out of state sendee or is endorsee where there is a negotiable draft outstanding.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,950.991,960.394,So that in that sense the property interest in the sense of the creditor is owned not by anybody in Pennsylvania but outside of Pennsylvania.
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,960.394,965.982,And it's payable outside Pennsylvania under the negotiable instrument --
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,965.982,980.111,"Now is there any -- is there any Pennsylvania's statute of limitations which makes the claim, whether it's claim for refund or the claim presented by the draft barred by that."
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,980.111,986.645,The Pennsylvania in its escheat does not recognize the statute of limitations.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1003.736,1006.049,"Well, what about the New Jersey case?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1009.264,1009.613,In New Jersey --
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1009.613,1013.482,We've turned it on the fact that the statute of limitation --
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1013.482,1013.769,In New Jersey.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1013.769,1015.871,-- is not escheatable under the New Jersey statute.
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1015.871,1020.791,"In New Jersey Your Honor, avoided coming to the constitutional question --"
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1020.791,1020.964,Well did I --
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1020.964,1026.903,"-- because under New Jersey law, the statute of limitations has barred it."
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1031.978,1034.259,"Well, that opinion dealt with a constitutional question."
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1034.259,1041.762,New Jersey has tried to get around that by passing a five-year escheat or custodial.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1047.549,1054.286,"Well, but to the extent of which the Western Union is protected by a statute of limitations."
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1062.419,1062.895,No.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1062.988,1065.031,Do you believe that the obligation is that?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1065.031,1070.826,"Western Union as a matter of fact pays stale drafts, old obligations."
1961.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1121.929,1128.993,"I take it, you're starting you -- your contention from where the decision of this Court have left you, is that right?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1128.993,1130.121,"That is exactly right, Your Honor."
1961.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1130.121,1140.379,Now where did -- where do the decisions of this Court leave you to -- and leave you open to make whatever contention you are planning to make?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1140.379,1146.048,The decisions of this Court leave us a fairly narrow scope.
1961.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1231.204,1239.516,If there's -- if there has been no change of residence prior to maturity of policy by debt.
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1239.516,1248.811,"Exactly, that has to be the situation at the date of the escheat or the date maturity of the policy."
1961.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1248.811,1257.385,"But in the New York in the insurance case we couldn't tell that is -- that's what bothers some of us, we couldn't tell what -- what the domicile of the beneficiaries."
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1257.385,1266.671,"It bothers me as to whether that case decided at anything Your Honor, but at least we know what it didn't decide in part."
1961.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1266.671,1280.607,"But I thought you said the cases lead you, rather narrow maneuvering ground, what is open to you to argue the different case, this case from the Standard Oil and the Insurance case?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1280.607,1288.227,"The domiciliary hold, Standard Oil of course, that's the most recent; it was a case of domiciliary corporation."
1961.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1315.659,1319.825,And you just indicated there you already had a (Inaudible).
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1328.282,1330.682,A mere legal obligation.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1330.682,1345.271,"Well Mr. Buchanan will this be it, if Pennsylvania may despise the interest of the creditor and in that way require you to pay your obligation owing the creditor to the State of Pennsylvania."
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1350.558,1351.256,Exactly.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1351.256,1365.86,"Tell me you're saying well now that property -- Pennsylvania can't displace a New Jersey creditor by just picking up Western Union's obligation to New Jersey, if anyone may do that, New Jersey's got to be it or --"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1365.86,1365.977,New York --
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1365.977,1367.019,New York?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1367.019,1369.693,"-- or New York, yes."
1961.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1498.202,1509.91,"You don't have to do anymore, I take it Mr. Buchanan, and to find vulnerability in your statute in relation to your case."
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1519.218,1519.267,I believe --
1961.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1519.267,1520.207,-- just put a conundrum.
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1538.047,1538.797,Theoretically you have --
1961.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1538.797,1540.931,With his (Voice Overlap) --
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1540.931,1541.02,Yes.
1961.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1541.02,1544.649,Have you address to yourself to what you think is the --

1961.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1546.089,1546.848,-- (Voice Overlap) -- with problem?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1546.848,1558.9,"I think Your Honor in this case, the state of domicile is the only one which should take under any wise decision."
1961.15,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1558.9,1560.289,State of domicile of what?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1560.289,1572.884,The state of domicile and that is New York -- the state of domicile of Western Union because that is the only domiciliary fact that is known this whole complex business.
1961.15,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1572.884,1584.046,But Western Union's supplies so far as I've heard from you so far is that one question that might be understood in this through is -- has no interest dollar can't get it.
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1584.046,1593.189,"But at least the domiciliary state has the tie, the control -- real control over this corporation."
1961.15,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1593.189,1605.001,It probably belongs to somebody else and you say that the -- maybe it's right that the one state should have a right to take this property as its own.
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1614.976,1620.246,The interest of corporation Your Honor is not the important thing.
1961.15,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1620.249,1621.506,But that's what I suppose --
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1621.506,1628.37,"New York has the ties and to control the contacts, sufficient contacts in the language of the cases."

1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1632.162,1632.81,No.

1961.15,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1644.807,1648.555,That's my reason for asking in this question.
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1655.424,1656.649,The situs.
1961.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1656.649,1658.375,Alright that depends on situs.
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1658.375,1659.459,(Inaudible) -- it's too right.
1961.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1659.459,1681.927,"Alright now what's the matter with the new rule that deviates maybe a little old about the old rule, that situs of the intangible credit is the domicile of the debtor and make it perhaps if that what it requires, the domicile of the principal office or chief place of business of the debtor, would that be alright?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1681.927,1689.124,That certainly would be alright Your Honor.Situs is perhaps an old fashioned word but I think it's a wise word in case like this.
1961.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1689.124,1696.822,"Did it got to have some rule by which to determine situs, haven't you, in order to determine presence of the raise?"
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1696.822,1703.626,"Right Your Honor, and domicile in this case, I submit that it's very easy to find the situs."
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1718.722,1720.879,Suppose you were at Delaware corporation.

1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1721.809,1723.574,I say suppose you were.
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1723.574,1725.712,And we had our principal office in New York.
1961.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1725.712,1727.179,That's everything as it is now?
1961.15,0,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,1727.179,1729.623,That would be a little harder question.
1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,2604.035,2608.94,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2958.79,2960.587,"Ms. Kessler Toch, I wonder if --"
1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,2960.587,2961.921,Yes.
1961.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2961.921,2974.917,"If we don't use contacts in different senses here now, when we're determining what the dominant contacts should be, what contacts are we talking about?"
1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,2985.971,2993.107,I think we're talking about the contacts with the obligation.
1961.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2993.107,3019.609,"Well, now that's -- that's just what I want to ask and why -- why should it be that way in this escheat matter, I can see if there was contest between the person to whom the money was to be paid and the person who is to pay, that perhaps the contacts of the person who is to pay would be the appropriate one, but here we're not doing that."
1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,3033.682,3035.72,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1961.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3056.59,3077.978,"Well, I'm not so sure -- I could agree to that because the -- if the Western Union and takes money in Pennsylvania to send to a person in another part of Pennsylvania, I don't know that we necessarily need to say that -- that they hold it in New York."
1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,3077.978,3086.252,"Except that eventually it -- they don't hold it in Pennsylvania, they don't hold it in Pennsylvania."
1961.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3086.252,3088.237,"Well, it don't, as a matter of fact it's because they wanted to do business --"
1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,3088.237,3089.884,That is quite right.
1961.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3089.884,3100.863,"-- do all their business, say can in New York, but the fact is that the money was paid in Pennsylvania and it was supposed to be paid out in Pennsylvania."
1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,3106.057,3116.465,"No, Mr. Justice -- Chief Justice, it was not paid out in Pennsylvania and it wasn't supposed to be paid out in Pennsylvania except in the -- in a small proportion of the cases."
1961.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3116.465,3118.256,"Well, in some -- some of the cases --"
1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,3118.256,3119.239,But very few.
1961.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3128.18,3140.011,"Well, but you aren't in overall rule that will -- will govern in all cases.Now, certainly you have to be bound by some of the cases that you bring before us here."
1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,3140.011,3141.429,"Yes, I am."
1961.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3154.905,3159.467,May I -- may I tell you one other thing troubling then I won't -- won't bother you anymore.

1961.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3196.225,3198.3,And he's the really -- the person who's --
1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,3198.3,3198.437,That's right.
1961.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3198.437,3199.372,-- who's involved here.
1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,3199.372,3200.891,That's right.
1961.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3242.922,3245.628,But that's merely because New York has a (Voice Overlap) --

1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,3291.467,3297.113,It's substantial but as I say they are always ready and they --
1961.15,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3297.113,3298.061,Yes I understand that.

1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,3469.152,3481.17,I -- I think without giving it a thought that I would say the principal place of business and none of which is domesticated.
1961.15,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3481.17,3481.253,I beg your pardon?
1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,3481.253,3485.756,"But I still say is the site of obligation, yes."
1961.15,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3508.568,3516.746,"What would that -- that's the theory, due to the court's holding in Standard Oil against New Jersey."
1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,3516.746,3524.81,"I think we're dealing there with securities which have their situs, I think, going way back and the home of the company"

1961.15,1,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,3578.993,3582.997,I know.

1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,3608.468,3611.457,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3790.558,3812.476,"Let me ask you before this last statement the special point involved.Using this Court, can you suggest that this Court could affirm the judgment of your Supreme Court by just citing the insurance cases in the case?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,3812.476,3825.019,"No I wouldn't come go completely that far for the simple reason that there has been raised in this case by the appellant, the question of this threats that were issued."
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3839.114,3859.897,"Yes, but the fact in the -- do you think the fact -- the fact that are now before us common within the -- in the decision, I don't mean the rationale, I don't mean the philosophy but I mean the circumstances which were relied on in the opinions of the Court for sustaining the claim of escheat by state."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,3859.897,3860.615,I do indeed.
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3875.22,3880.444,"Well, wasn't that a great emphasis on the domiciliary place of the business?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,3880.444,3888.119,"Not in the Connecticut case, there was emphasis of it but the Court departed from the significance domicile."
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3888.119,3890.238,I know that talk about the contacts.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,3890.238,3936.247,"It talked about substantial contacts and in my opinion, may I say that there was a lot to the theory of substantial contacts and when we examined what contacts we are talking about as the Chief Justice started to inquire, we can perhaps clarify just what the substantial contacts is and what the affirmable contacts are that other states might touch upon a fund and then this point let me say that I can't conceive of any single escheat situation where any of that more than two states can possibly be involved and probably when a situation is analyzed in each particular case just one state is surely involved."
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3959.695,3968.117,"Is that proof that it's that -- that (Inaudible) -- no, I'm sure that that involved -- the implication is, if they had it, they wouldn't have gone after it."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,3980.617,4006.29,"I think not for the following reasons because I think that what we're talking about here, the most substantial contact of all can only be in the state where the raise, when the obligation was created, now I can conceive of the shifting locale of that obligation once created and that obligation that's being escheated --"
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4006.29,4013.367,-- (Voice Overlap) -- I don't follow the necessity of such monistic doctrine.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4028.496,4037.792,No I said when you judge this substantiality of contacts that give a state and perhaps the only other state a right to proceed.
1961.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4087.615,4108.957,"Well, may I suggest though Mr. Creskoff isn't there at least has difference that the sender comes into a Pennsylvania office of Western Union as an agreement from the Western Union, that if show order its office in Connecticut make a payment of X dollars to somebody in Connecticut."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4158.149,4158.83,No as i recall --
1961.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4158.83,4160.011,By the check rather.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4160.011,4163.804,"That situation, those checks were drawn on banks in New York."
1961.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4163.804,4167.376,They were drawn on but were they drawn by?

1961.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4172.531,4173.819,"Well now, you made it right about that."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4173.819,4175.868,-- for the payment of dividends that special --
1961.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4175.868,4177.354,You may be right about that.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4181.692,4182.094,But let me --
1961.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4182.094,4184.069,-- that checks originated in New Jersey --
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4184.069,4192.316,"Let me follow up your question there a bit, in another direction, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1961.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4310.781,4318.797,"Well, Mr. Creskoff, I might suggest that I don't think you don't get to the point that troubles me."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4360.569,4364.918,May I try to answer that this way.
1961.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4382.516,4406.982,"But only then but I as understand what Mr. Buchanan answered us earlier, I haven't look at this record to know the actual facts, I thought what he told us was, that the bulk of sum escheated is represented by drafts, issued by sendee offices which have never been presented for payment, am I wrong in part of it?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4406.982,4417.147,"No, that's -- I'm in agreement with that generally but perhaps, this more approaches our are reasoning in answer to your question."
1961.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4441.339,4457.931,But isn't this -- this -- isn't this involved us with a tariff of requirements and whatever may have been the words in the understanding between the clerk and the sender is not the whole transaction as defined in the tariff.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4457.931,4476.817,"I don't -- I don't think that the sender is bound, nor anyone is bound unless under the Pennsylvania law, there's a specific agreement that the issuance of a draft is in fact payment and of course the draft is evidence of the obligation."
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4502.463,4504.313,It's the course of business isn't it?
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4504.313,4505.034,In the course business.
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4505.034,4508.959,Well is that -- it is the course of business to have a draft.
1961.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4508.959,4511.02,"Well, this is required by the tariff?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4511.02,4511.651,No sir.
1961.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4511.651,4512.336,"No, it's not?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4512.336,4540.922,"The very -- the record will show that these are exhibits of the respondent that is was a matter of convenience whether in a given case, either making refund to the sender or giving the money to the payee whether a draft was or was not issued was a pure matter of convenience, to one or the other of a party, now in any case, the sender could come in, and walk out with the cash if that's what he prefer."
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4565.784,4596.071,"But if we're going to talk reality, I think I would have to say that to show us in actual that the applicant for a money order in Pennsylvania established and if that shows that he's actually residing, a legal resident of Pennsylvania then the notification of the payee in Connecticut or New York that he may come up and turn up at the office of Connecticut and New York, he got a showing and that would make it suable into courts of that state against the Western Union in there, doesn't it?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4596.071,4605.575,He may on certain cases where not these drafts are dated (Voice Overlap) where not the statute of limitations available as a defense.
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4605.575,4606.279,I follow that.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4631.612,4643.766,"Well I remember this too about that draft we're talking about that it wasn't an unconditional draft in every case, it was a draft that have to be accepted at the bank in which drawn."
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4643.766,4647.785,"Well, that's to identify himself that he'd have to accept it."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4648.58,4658.124,"It's not the identification of the end of the sendee, I'm talking when it reaches the bank on which it's withdrawn, the draft have to be accepted."
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4658.124,4675.847,"Let me ask you this Mr. Creskoff, suppose needless saying the decree of Pennsylvania, and suppose in the next litigation to come before this Court, one of this Greyhound Lines where they got these escheats."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4706.714,4717.597,"I think, that Minnesota would be bound in that case to give full faith and credit to that that finally adjudicated here."
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4717.597,4726.066,"Yes, if I assumed that as supposed it gives full paid in credit to that decree but these are due moneys that are accumulated since the decree."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4726.066,4726.285,Oh yes.
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4726.285,4747.271,"And it said that our claim, the basis of our plane, the contact we have for the unsatisfied money orders, claim within Minnesota, is that $22,000 that shows in action not redeemed and not satisfied in Minnesota and that issue was never contested."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4747.271,4748.432,I would the --
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4748.432,4754.568,The decree in Western Union against Commonwealth merely covered the funds up to that time.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4758.359,4759.624,I would think not sir.
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4770.372,4787.453,"Well is it one or the other when you say superior and reading as implied in a situation where there are multiple interests, what compulsion is there in law, in the Constitution in good sense that is only one state that is superior to all the others?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4787.453,4791.26,"Well, I have never argued that one state of necessity because it's a state --"
1961.15,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4791.26,4794.776,I thought your argument was that the one who got it first was the one entitled.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4794.776,4800.667,"No, I do not at all attach any importance that time and may I say upon."
1961.15,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4800.667,4811.921,"Well if then -- if you and Minnesota were locked into an argument like here over Justice Frankfurter's $12,000 who would win it or who should win it?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4811.921,4825.114,"Well I -- I would say, I would like to know first what Minnesota was asserting as it rights to the fund as compared to what Pennsylvania on that hypothetical case was saying its rights were into those specific funds."
1961.15,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4825.793,4842.212,"The residents of Pennsylvania had been taking money orders to be delivered in Minnesota and Minnesota office of Western Union never could bind the people so they had in Minnesota $12,000."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4842.212,4866.233,"I would say I would like to examine all of those facts and to show that that's a consistent position, may I say that Pennsylvania has very scrupulously avoided attempting to include as escheatable property any moneys that other residence of the other 48 states may have sent or residents in Pennsylvania under similar circumstances."
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4898.734,4910.593,"But Mr. Creskoff, is it really a question of which state has the better or more equitable claims?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4926.686,4931.956,I think that's the ultimate question.
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4931.956,4941.115,"We're not here -- now, isn't it true that before you could -- first of all, do you agree this is an action in rem?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4941.115,4943.607,"Yes, sir."
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4943.607,4949.661,And you had no personal service on these persons whose credits you took?
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4949.661,4952.273,"No, I want the personal service was on the debtor."
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4952.273,4968.982,"Right, now then in order to substantiate the substituted service on these unknown persons whose credits you took, did you not have to first have a raise in Court?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4971.517,4972.58,"Yes, sir."
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4972.58,4974.101,"And how did you get it, that's the --"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4974.101,4974.142,Our --
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4974.142,4974.453,-- question for me.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,4974.453,4983.39,-- position is that the obligation created at the time of the sending was the raise that is here attached the obligation of Western Union.
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5079.269,5092.1,I still don't see (Inaudible) basis of state claim the presence of drafts in Pennsylvania.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5092.1,5095.319,When one raises the obligation by Western Union.
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5095.319,5096.518,But it's -- that it's the question --
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5096.518,5098.915,Pennsylvania has seized that raise.
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5098.915,5099.819,How did they seize it?
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5099.819,5105.519,By the service of the process by the service of the complaint of escheat by this complainant.
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5105.519,5108.801,By the service of a -- of a summon on Western Union --
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5108.801,5112.888,Actually a certified copy of the petition escheat.
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5112.888,5117.664,Could that not have been served in any one in the 48 states in the same way?
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5117.664,5129.865,"No because as far as Pennsylvania is concerned, it has jurisdiction over Western Union, Western Union is operated in Pennsylvania through hundreds of offices for many years."
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5141.492,5143.908,You don't have to be in Missouri.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5143.908,5148.366,"But not on these funds, Your Honor."
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5158.148,5165.334,"Well, could this raise only found in any one of the 48 states of the claim, am I right?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5165.334,5168.381,It has been so indicated here but I don't think you can.
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5168.381,5169.281,Do you think it could?
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5169.281,5170.435,I don't think it can.
1961.15,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5170.435,5176.513,"That was some place, (Inaudible) that takes the place of the physical raise in that statute."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5176.513,5187.553,"We take that position right or wrong.When you think it's right, but whether be right or wrong, that's our position, that the raise does not float around, the obligation does not float around."
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5187.553,5206.374,"Has there been in the proposals so far as you know, that Congress by its power, under the Commerce Clause or any clause to enact some legislation to prevent confusion as a result of the claims of the various states to escheat?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5206.374,5210.959,I don't think that -- I've never heard of such a proposal.
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5241.586,5245.858,"Because of prior procedure, that's putting a greater emphasis on who gets there first."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5245.858,5270.959,"No, because the case was depending, because it's recognize that ones a competent court has taken jurisdiction of the subject matter properly or coordinate courts will recognize that jurisdiction, recognize that possession and to waive the orderly disposition of that case."
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5276.317,5282.558,Well there has been a bunch of good activity in the last few years in the (Inaudible)?
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5282.558,5284.758,"Not that I am aware of that, Your Honor."
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5285.803,5291.722,I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out some of it in one of his previous opinion.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5291.722,5302.832,"Well, since that opinion was retained have we heard, of any unseemly raises between the states and the unseemly litigation between states."
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5302.832,5309.482,This may not be unseemly but despite of dispute between you and New York here.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5309.482,5313.924,There is no despute in the sense that New York is a party here.
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5316.533,5318.936,New York is here raising questions.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5321.372,5321.768,"Well, I --"
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5321.768,5330.052,"I assume that the state who are headed to an escheat would never get together in the way and that the Congress passed the law, I don't know what it could or not, I'm not saying."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5330.052,5333.355,"They might, it just so happens I'm not in their company."
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5341.465,5351.709,"Well, the former case as all of them have pointed in one opinion or another, the difficulties of reaching the decision, the decision have been better now, haven't you?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5363.968,5374.984,Well it's always appeared to me that others have been more concerned upon that about the possible existence of other claimants than the immediate parties have ever been.
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5374.984,5379.494,"Well, if we're confronted with this contest that vague between you and New York --"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5379.494,5379.804,Well --
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5379.804,5388.115,-- and the other states may find out their responsibilities that I have no doubt the Courts will have far better more contest than your case.
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5388.115,5393.77,"This is a relatively new field with all the said and done, these laws didn't get on the way until the late 30's."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5393.77,5399.67,"Yes, I agree with that Your Honor, this is wrong as far as the law goes a new field."
1961.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5404.922,5411.355,You mean the honeypot is getting entry?
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5411.355,5440.032,"Our essential position in the situation is of course this, that Pennsylvania have jurisdiction over the subject matter that the raise as we see it was seized, that the case proceeded to unnoticed to hearing that the lower court adjudicated the case, that exceptions were heard."
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5504.423,5506.655,As I understand your argument.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5516.949,5517.274,As to any of these --
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5517.274,5518.019,To adjust funds.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5518.019,5521.074,-- these funds.
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5521.074,5539.538,So that it gives one state which the power to determine as you say in the lawsuit of its own in its own state to make a final determination of who's entitled to funds that maybe the 40 states has potential claim?
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5539.538,5560.631,Except Your Honor that we don't conceive that any single fund can there be 40 states in having the potential claim or that's the question of domicile is eliminated more than one fact as to a specific fund as to a specific single item we're talking about.
1961.15,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5594.302,5616.241,"Well now, how about the situation of money sent to Pennsylvania to Missouri and a draft drawn to Missouri and given to the sendee and the sendee never cashes and does in testing whether that draft is interstate."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5622.097,5627.757,Maybe but not in particular case with those particular fact shown that Missouri would prevail.
1961.15,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5627.757,5629.478,But you'll see -- I'm -- I'm just --
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5629.478,5630.242,But then we say --
1961.15,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5630.242,5635.549,Suggesting an answer to your statement that you couldn't conceive of a situation where that would be to the state.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5636.475,5636.684,No.
1961.15,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5640.902,5646.485,"Now, how can Missouri succeed if Pennsylvania had already cheated the money under this decree?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5646.485,5655.496,"Well, it couldn't under this decree but I think that it's only fair to assume that there are many situation of hardship as the cases have shown."
1961.15,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5694.374,5709.507,"But that was a matter of service of process here I'm just suggesting that I understand that you know the fact that in this hypothetical case I gave you, Missouri would have a greater right to escheat than Pennsylvania."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5709.507,5710.185,If it proceed --
1961.15,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5710.185,5714.61,"And get under this decree, the money's already been escheated to Pennsylvania."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5714.61,5734.091,"Well, let me point out as far as Pennsylvania's concerned of escheat statute still provide a term of years and which then a proper person, that could include that term could include another state, could include anybody that might come in and recover the fund that had showed superior title."
1961.15,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5760.686,5761.583,A what?
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5761.583,5762.635,Mixed.
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5791.596,5800.257,"Let me ask you, does it appear in the record if it's an allowable statement that you can make outside the record?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5814.75,5818.637,"I don't know, that's not in the position."
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5819.435,5819.57,But --
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5819.57,5820.697,-- ever attacked.
1961.15,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5820.697,5823.035,Do you know the answer to that question?
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5823.035,5826.39,You didn't put in the briefs?
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5826.39,5828.322,There is nothing in the record on that --
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5828.322,5851.081,"So, if there are -- but my point of view or the point of view of contact as I understand it carrying out a procedure that this been an outline if in fact the local office in the various states and were to this payee or that they're waiting for the check or whatnot."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5865.891,5866.127,I'm --
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5866.127,5885.55,"If they -- and if they each, if they each had a shorter statute of limitation of a period of installation than yours and each ran for their own you'll have the X state going after their local fund."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5885.55,5901.548,"You would have this X states but I still point out that each state if it were entitled under this theory would not be proceeding for the same transaction, for the same dollar that was sent."
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5904.621,5934.124,"No, because from my point of view Pennsylvania as sender the state would be out because I think the receiving state would ever get a claim because that's where a new obligation either in a piece of paper or in the creation of a new shows and action, that was the -- as it was the domicile of the grieving states and all of these and I'm afraid play either than most of writing my own acts."
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,5951.402,5953.413,"I am offering that, Your Honor."
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5953.413,5958.053,In the Standard Oil Case though several opinion.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,6009.386,6010.565,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6019.389,6021.442,The Constitution of the United States does that.
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6021.442,6029.842,It says that this Court -- of course we have said that in some instances a matter of that between states that you began in the District Courts.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,6029.842,6030.854,Well I know further.
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6047.899,6056.801,Can you say the way we can dispose of this particular judgment that either holding absolutely that you're entitled to in New York or not.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,6065.266,6073.197,I would have no difficulty at all with the proposition that this Court can properly affirm the Pennsylvania decree.
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6085.608,6089.644,"But your argument would rule New York out completely, wouldn't it?"
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,6089.644,6094.777,I would rule them out because Your Honor I think they have ruled themselves out.
1961.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6098.465,6100.112,You mean by not claiming there yet?
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,6100.112,6106.224,"No sir, because they specifically accepted cases in which other states were already proceeding."
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6123.267,6125.22,Why do you mean to -- to --
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,6125.22,6126.157,That -- and this Court --
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6126.157,6127.309,I didn't mean to --
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,6127.309,6127.58,This Court --
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6127.58,6129.044,-- compare it in your way
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,6129.044,6164.956,This thought occurs to me beyond the portend of your question sir that perhaps Pennsylvanians would benefit more than his -- than we're aware of if the rule or the other way because I have no doubt that the number of sendees in Pennsylvania if that were -- those funds were regard as escheatable in Pennsylvania would exceed by far the funds that are escheatable under this decree because the funds were originated and that sent out from Pennsylvania.
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6165.1,6165.183,You mean --
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,6165.183,6168.955,"-- certain -- that moving the other way, Pennsylvania was the proper forum."
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6168.955,6173.06,Either the sendees -- called it the sendee's state where your property was?
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,6173.06,6174.796,Pennsylvania was the sendee's state.
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6174.796,6179.614,I asked you that because Pennsylvania is so rich that people don't make claims.
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,6179.614,6182.74,I think because more money is sent in to Pennsylvania (Voice Overlap) --
1961.15,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6182.74,6187.222,(Inaudible) interest rates high in there?
1961.15,2,15655,a_jere_creskoff,,6187.222,6207.188,"I'm not aware of that part, Your Honor."
1961.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6207.188,6209.095,Mr. Buchanan.
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6209.095,6215.894,"In the three minutes which you Mr. Chief Justice have graciously awarded me, I would like to point out --"
1961.15,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6215.894,6216.985,What about five minutes.
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6217.95,6224.616,I'd like to point out just a couple of things from the record in answer to the two various questions that have been asked.
1961.15,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6233.748,6234.918,What page Mr. Buchanan?
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6234.918,6235.694,57.
1961.15,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6235.694,6236.194,Thank you.
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6236.194,6250.17,"It shows the $23,590 were found to be originating elsewhere not taken by Pennsylvania and about $40,000 to some of two other figures without Pennsylvania."
1961.15,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6264.469,6268.906,"When you say went out of Pennsylvania, you mean that literally outside of Pennsylvania?"
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6268.906,6271.019,"Well, originated in Pennsylvania, excuse me."
1961.15,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6271.019,6274.057,We -- but we don't know though how many of them.Were the sendees in Pennsylvania?
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6274.057,6281.133,"Yes, we do know approximately five-sixth went out of Pennsylvania, five-sixth of the total."
1961.15,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6281.133,6283.068,"The amount is almost $35,000?"
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6283.068,6293.87,"That same page shows that $31,500 was destined out of Pennsylvania, $6,000 within Pennsylvania, $23,000 coming in from out of state."
1961.15,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6293.87,6295.433,Oh I see.
1961.15,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,6295.433,6295.721,How many of --

1961.15,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,6295.979,6301.048,-- the -- when send out to return in Pennsylvania fund can be?
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6301.048,6318.2,"That the record does not show but the record does show that all drafts issued less than 1% are refund drafts, that was a sample which shown at the page -- I don't remember the name in the page in the records."
1961.15,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,6319.53,6322.326,One-seventh of the drafts for intra --
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6322.326,6324.462,One-sixth for intrastate.
1961.15,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6324.462,6334.268,I don't want to eat into your time Mr. Buchanan but I know there's something about destruction of your records under SEC regulations after a particular period.
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6343.431,6344.125,Yes.
1961.15,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6344.125,6351.297,But not of course drafts issued by an office outside of Pennsylvania where that is you have no idea?
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6351.297,6351.642,No.
1961.15,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6358.038,6368.703,"Well I -- but they would show, wouldn't they, the sender, sendee's office have issued a draft, the sendee office that issued the draft?"
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6368.703,6378.326,"Yes, with some reservation I say that the records weren't so good some earlier years."
1961.15,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6479.477,6492.981,"Did you try to urge a breakdown for those with escheatable claim of Pennsylvania in order to differentiate, in order to take care of the point you've just made?"
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6492.981,6494.92,The amount that has gone out?
1961.15,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6494.92,6495.762,Yes.
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6495.762,6503.746,Is held by -- this record was made up from our records by us at the request of the escheator.
1961.15,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6503.746,6504.975,Yes.
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6504.975,6510.07,The arrangements the proofs were within his control that we did it for him.
1961.15,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6510.07,6516.39,"Yes but -- but I understand that, but this must have started in the lower court, didn't it, in a litigation?"
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6518.039,6520.678,"No, it started in the Common Pleas Court in Dauphin County."
1961.15,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6520.678,6521.137,Right.
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6539.507,6544.684,I understand from my partner who tried the case there that this was urged.
1961.15,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6544.684,6546.062,It wasn't and that was rejected.
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6546.062,6547.514,Hence not followed.
1961.15,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6547.514,6548.166,Pardon me?
1961.15,3,29085,john_g_buchanan_jr,,6548.166,6553.59,"And our suggestion was not followed, we were told we take everything that originates in Pennsylvania."
1961.15,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6553.59,6566.613,"So that the total, the decree to be escheated by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania includes the sender's claim what might be sender's claim or return of the unclaimed deposit."
