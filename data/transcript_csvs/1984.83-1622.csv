1984.83-1622,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.895,We will hear arguments next in Brandon against Holt.
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,79.634,87.028,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented by this case is neither complex nor novel."
1984.83-1622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,130.307,136.432,"Well, something would depend, wouldn't it, Mr. Schnapper, on how the case was tried, the theory on which he was tried?"
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,136.432,141.955,"Well, I think there are... that would be a somewhat different question."
1984.83-1622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.368,169.584,"Well, particularly when the case was tried before Monell was decided, or rather, the complaint was filed before Monell was decided, so you have a fairly ambiguous situation, it seems to me."
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,169.584,176.139,"Well, I don't think we have an ambiguous situation as of the time the case went to trial or even as of 19 months before that."
1984.83-1622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,194.17,196.703,Why didn't you move to amend your complaint?
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,196.703,205.298,"Well, on our reading of the federal rules, no such amendment was necessary."
1984.83-1622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,218.925,229.103,"But ordinarily a prudent lawyer wanting a judgment against a city would be fairly certain to make sure the city was named defendant if the city were suable, I would think."
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,237.98,242.912,"Well, Your Honor, the Supreme Court had decided the issue twice by 1979, both in our favor."
1984.83-1622,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,263.966,269.159,"Mr. Schnapper, is this anything more than a lesson in pleading?"
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,269.159,273.942,"Well, I think it may more reasonably be cast as a lesson about--"
1984.83-1622,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,273.942,276.783,"Because if so, we have more important things to do."
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,276.783,294.817,"--Well, I think that the federal rules don't require the notice at issue to have been in any particular form as long as the defendants had actual notices to the entity against which the judgment would run, and they certainly had that."
1984.83-1622,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,294.817,294.955,Who did?
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,295.416,296.247,The city.
1984.83-1622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,296.247,300.688,How do you know they knew?
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,300.688,304.782,We filed a memorandum in February of 1979.
1984.83-1622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,304.782,305.603,In court.
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,305.603,306.843,In court.
1984.83-1622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,308.174,308.785,Was the city a party?
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,309.504,314.079,--The city's lawyer was representing the defendant at that point.
1984.83-1622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,314.079,330.648,"But except for this rule, except for this rule you rely on, which... except for that rule, the city would not have been bound by the judgment?"
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,334.932,346.87,"Well, prior to the existence of Rule 25(d) and its predecessor under the 1937 Rules of Federal Civil Procedure, there were lawsuits against officials in their official capacity."
1984.83-1622,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,373.608,375.279,--Mr. Schnapper--
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,375.279,375.83,Yes.
1984.83-1622,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,375.83,394.061,"--when this action went to trial, it apparently was tried and liability was found on the basis of whether Officer Chapman knew or should have known of the dangerous propensities of the other officer."
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,395.301,396.523,"Well, I think that--"
1984.83-1622,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,396.523,398.243,Is that the theory?
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,398.243,400.696,--That is not the only theory of liability.
1984.83-1622,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,401.565,406.09,Is that what the District Court found as the basis for liability?
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,406.09,408.911,"--Well, that is one of the findings it made."
1984.83-1622,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,413.035,423.01,Do you think that that finding alone is even appropriate under the Monell standard for liability in an official capacity suit?
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,423.01,427.915,"I think, Your Honor, it would depend on who the official was that knew or should have known."
1984.83-1622,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,429.174,432.747,I just didn't see anything at all in Monell to that effect.
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,442.421,462.036,"--I think that's correct, and I think there are a number of specific findings with regard to practices that I would like to come back to in a second, but with regard to the question of whether a finding that an official knew or should have known about the sort of aberrant policeman at issue here, Monell refers not merely to policies but to acts."
1984.83-1622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,469.751,473.523,But that doesn't necessarily mean that their actions are official policies.
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,477.875,482.429,--I think that Monell refers to actions and decisions as well as policies.
1984.83-1622,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,490.254,507.886,"Well, if it turns out that we disagree with you and think that what has to be established for an official capacity suit is whether it was an official policy or practice of the department or city, would it have to be sent back then for a new trial?"
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,507.886,509.418,"Well, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1984.83-1622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,582.455,589.461,"Well, the Court of Appeals didn't reach the issue of policy."
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,589.461,590.492,That's correct.
1984.83-1622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.492,596.825,"So that you could still lose this case back in the Court of Appeals, even if we agreed with you now."
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,596.825,604.051,"Yes, and I don't mean by my response to Justice O'Connor's question to suggest that that is an issue that ought to be addressed here."
1984.83-1622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.848,706.567,"Mr. Schnapper, is it not correct that those policies in the District Court's finding merely were to establish the proposition that Chapman should have known about this officer's propensities, rather than saying that the policies were what actually caused the injury."
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,710.42,716.804,"--That is a possible reading of it, but that, I think, only puts an additional wrinkle in the causation claim."
1984.83-1622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,730.152,732.873,"Well, I am not sure... well, you say and the lack of knowledge caused the assault?"
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,745.863,749.385,--We don't read the District Court's opinion like that.
1984.83-1622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.201,770.859,"Well, he certainly didn't articulate any... articulate his ruling in terms of the city's liability under Monell."
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,770.859,778.514,"Well, let me answer that question in... with before and after the point which I broke it up with my interruption."
1984.83-1622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,800.347,805.222,"Yes, but he didn't say, now, I am going to identify a city policy."
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,815.627,816.608,Well--
1984.83-1622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,816.608,818.088,"They didn't train them to do it, for example."
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,818.088,822.713,--Let me answer those questions in reverse order.
1984.83-1622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,886.984,893.459,"Well, at the very least, you do pose a question of what does ""policy"" mean under Monell."
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,893.459,900.113,--I think there are interesting questions like that raised by this case but not at this time.
1984.83-1622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,919.085,924.609,Did the District Court say exactly what the constitutional violation was here?
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,924.609,925.941,"--No, it did not."
1984.83-1622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,925.941,928.061,"It is kind of hard to find one, isn't it?"
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,928.061,933.084,I think that your characterization of it is a very strained one.
1984.83-1622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1090.518,1094.381,To say that the same standard applies doesn't mean that the two are the same thing.
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1094.381,1110.722,"--Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, there may be circumstances, none of which come to mind at this point, where there might be some difference."
1984.83-1622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1119.857,1135.458,"I thought you were citing cases to say that we have already decided precisely this question, and you say that in the first case we said that the same standard would apply in a suit against a city as in a suit against an officer in his official capacity."
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1143.844,1147.407,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I perhaps understated the language in Monell."
1984.83-1622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1329.113,1338.48,Does the committee language indicate any thought that the rule applies beyond injunctive suits?
1984.83-1622,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1338.48,1355.841,"I am not sure about that, but I would say that certainly must have been its intent, because the problems which arose that Justice Frankfurter referred to in 1951 about official capacity lawsuits were mostly lawsuits against government officials for money."
1984.83-1622,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1386.863,1398.75,Mr. Klein.
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1398.75,1419.424,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question really involved in this case is whether or not this is in reality an official capacity lawsuit or a lawsuit against an individual, and it is the position of the respondent that this is actually an individual capacity case."
1984.83-1622,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1445.45,1447.162,That's what the Court of Appeals said.
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1448.923,1466.684,"--The District Court said that in dealing with the question, and as they commented, the sole issue is whether Director Chapman should have known about the dangerous propensities of the officer in question, that in dealing with that, they concluded--"
1984.83-1622,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.684,1469.115,Excuse me.
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1469.866,1471.348,"--If Your Honor please, this in the--"
1984.83-1622,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.348,1472.378,Petition?
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1472.378,1475.27,"--petition for writ of certiorari, on Page 20A."
1984.83-1622,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1524.961,1527.325,"Of course, you didn't read the next sentence, did you?"
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1527.325,1537.731,"--Because Mr. Chapman as police director should have known of Officer Allen's dangerous propensities, the courts find that he must be held liable in his official capacity to the complainants."
1984.83-1622,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1621.457,1624.289,"Well, whether it is obvious or not, that's the issue here."
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1624.289,1625.908,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1622,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1625.908,1627.3,Mr. Klein--
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1627.3,1627.951,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1622,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1627.951,1634.744,--was Officer Chapman represented in the District Court by the city attorney?
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1634.744,1636.757,"He was represented by me, Your Honor."
1984.83-1622,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1636.757,1642.219,And would that be the normal procedure in an individual capacity suit?
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1642.219,1642.92,"Yes, it would."
1984.83-1622,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1642.92,1646.501,Would the city step in and representing the officer?
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1646.501,1647.032,"Yes, it would, Your Honor."
1984.83-1622,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1658.679,1674.1,Do you think there normally would be an automatic substitution of parties in an individual capacity suit wherein Officer Holt was substituted for officer Chapman if it is an individual action?
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1674.1,1675.281,"--No, I do not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1622,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1675.281,1676.972,"Well, how did that come about?"
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1676.972,1688.86,"Well, that came about, the plaintiffs, and if my memory serves me correctly, that came about after the case was up on appeal, and before the Court of Appeals."
1984.83-1622,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1690.893,1693.243,Did you object to that substitution--
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1693.243,1694.253,"No, I did not--"
1984.83-1622,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1694.253,1697.295,"--and why not, if you thought it was an individual capacity suit?"
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1697.295,1727.304,"--Well, if Your Honor please, we in our... when we got to the Court of Appeals, of course, our whole argument was based on the fact that this was an individual capacity lawsuit, and we felt like we made it clear to the Court of Appeals at that time that it was only being treated in this way, and that we were entitled to good faith immunity, and also the question about the standard which was to be imposed, but we did not officially object to that, and the Court of Appeals in its opinion is--"
1984.83-1622,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1727.304,1731.358,"That is a bit inconsistent with your theory, is it not?"
1984.83-1622,1,27396,henry_l_klein,,1731.358,1733.058,--The fact that we did not object?
1984.83-1622,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,3042.017,3042.685,Personally?
1984.83-1622,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3042.685,3043.096,Yes.
1984.83-1622,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,3043.096,3043.897,No.
1984.83-1622,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3043.897,3045.836,That's what I understood.
1984.83-1622,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,3045.836,3050.13,A couple of quick things.
1984.83-1622,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3199.438,3202.711,"Thank you, gentlemen."
