1988.87-1168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.887,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1168, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Donald E. Clark."
1988.87-1168,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,10.448,13.811,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1168,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,169.472,172.845,"If the first alternative had been chosen, then what?"
1988.87-1168,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,173.886,174.654,No.
1988.87-1168,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,207.737,212.311,"Mr. Horowitz, is that the basic principle of boot, really?"
1988.87-1168,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,218.095,236.214,"--Well, the idea is that... the idea of not recognizing gain in the reorganization is that it's kind of paper profits, and that the... since the taxpayer is continuing his operation of the same corporation in a different form, as long as he keeps it in stock, it's the same as if his own stock had appreciated."
1988.87-1168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.113,336.52,"Mr. Horowitz, it seems to me that possibly the Government's approach in this case divorces the boot payment from the context of the reorganization in which it occurred."
1988.87-1168,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,336.52,338.843,"Well, I--"
1988.87-1168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,338.843,346.066,"I think you need to keep in mind, don't you, that this whole thing arose out of a reorganization."
1988.87-1168,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,346.066,348.808,"--Well, we certainly don't dispute that, Justice O'Connor."
1988.87-1168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,387.353,390.545,How much of a... how much of a split of opinion is there on this question?
1988.87-1168,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,396.149,402.854,"--Well, it was... it was a review decision of the Tax Court, so... Judge Tannenwald wrote an opinion which was circulated to the other judges and no one dissented."
1988.87-1168,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,402.854,405.135,"I missed what you said there, Mr. Horowitz."
1988.87-1168,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,407.546,411.26,"I said it was a review decision, so there was--"
1988.87-1168,1,46100,walter_b_slocombe,,1546.926,1550.839,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1582.368,1583.74,"But, Mr. Slocombe, let me interrupt right there."
1988.87-1168,1,46100,walter_b_slocombe,,1599.889,1601.842,"No, it doesn't depend on there having been an option."
1988.87-1168,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3105.675,3112.039,Mr. Slocombe is now taking the position that the Court should basically ignore Section 356(a)(2).
1988.87-1168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3294.179,3303.583,"Yes, but you keep giving the example that if they had done it a little different... if you had also solo 30 percent of the stock for cash, and then two weeks later entered into a statutory reorganization, you would get capital gain."
1988.87-1168,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3308.558,3312.8,"Well, if you do it only two weeks later... I mean, there's a question, when you have--"
1988.87-1168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3312.8,3315.954,"--Well, whatever the period would be to get you, get the IRS off your back."
1988.87-1168,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3315.954,3316.123,"--Well, he didn't do it that way."
1988.87-1168,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3322.787,3323.908,"Thank you, Mr. Horowitz."
