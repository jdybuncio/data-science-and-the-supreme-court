1974.73-662,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.573,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in number 73-662, Schlesinger against Councilman."
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,13.524,15.965,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,173.678,178.532,Is your argument on this branch of the case identical to the arguments you made?
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,178.532,200.383,"Virtually so, Mr. Justice Stewart, except for one point and that is that I wish to distinguish the line of cases Billings against Truesdale and Toth against Quarles and so forth because of the nature of the trial that is required on a service-connection issue and I will just-- I will not repeat the argument about Younger against Harris or Gusik against Schilder in the ordinary consideration."
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,200.383,203.109,But you're incorporating that by reference.
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,203.109,204.364,"I am, yes."
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,204.364,206.317,"And then you have one additional argument, is that it?"
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,206.317,209.249,That is the nature of a trial required on the service-connection issue.
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,209.249,215.264,"Or at least something additional you need to say in view of those cases, is that it?"
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,215.264,216.799,Yes.
1974.73-662,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,216.799,220.793,"But isn't there a difference that, here, the claim is that they can't try him at all?"
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,220.793,222.278,That is correct.
1974.73-662,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,315.082,324.636,Do you consider it a particular importance that this was a transaction between a captain and an enlisted man who is under his command?
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,324.636,329.181,"I consider that of crucial importance on the service-connection issue, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-662,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,333.444,336.852,Even though they were off base and out of uniform?
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,336.852,351.92,"Well, I-- by the jurisdictional issue, I meant initially whether a District Court ought ever to entertain a claim like this before the military process has run its course and I think, on a service-connection issue, it ought not."
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,605.452,631.293,"In speaking of the differences between this kind of an offense in military society contrasted to what it would be in civilian society, are you concentrating on the military's attitude toward the possession and use of marijuana or are you concentrating on the-- emphasizing on the traditions in the military that officers and enlisted men do not fraternize?"
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,631.293,637.617,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, those two rationales correspond to the different charges."
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,651.358,657.003,"Well, shared behavior of any kind, unless times have changed since I was in the military."
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,657.003,659.612,"Well, I wouldn't say shared behavior of any kind, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,659.612,660.995,"Off duty, except in the military mission."
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,660.995,662.36,"Socializing or, yes--"
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,662.36,664.376,Except in the military mission.
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,664.376,667.222,That's true.
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,705.875,707.78,"So, there are two distinct differences."
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,707.78,715.896,"Two distinct rationales, both of which I think apply to this case and both which I think uphold service-connection."
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,792.727,798.429,"Though, if this had been alcohol as to the matter, I mean alcoholic beverage instead of marijuana?"
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,798.429,804.518,If it had been-- I think fraternizing with an enlisted man might have called for disciplinary activity by the military.
1974.73-662,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,830.117,838.328,"Well, you were drawing the difference between the drunkenness and grass."
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,838.328,871.002,"A distinction-- no, I think the distinction between alcohol and drugs is simply that if we're talking about the use rather than the relationship between the two men is simply that the military, as civilian society, chooses to regard only over use of alcohol as an offense where they tend to regard any use of drugs as an offense, and that's a judgment which I think is essentially a legislative judgment and I think an allowable one."
1974.73-662,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,871.002,879.781,"Well, you mentioned just a moment ago that we might be in a jurisdiction where the use of marijuana was not a crime."
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,879.781,880.459,That is correct.
1974.73-662,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,925.103,943.204,"But do I understand you, however, to say that if the captain here had gone off base, off duty, and spent the evening in an apartment with an enlisted man and they both hang one on, that this would not be service-connected?"
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,943.204,945.776,"No, I didn't suggest that, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1974.73-662,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,990.906,998.822,"Because, in this case, if the captain had a bottle of whisky, nothing would have happened to him but if he had marijuana he would have been prosecuted."
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,998.822,998.889,You--
1974.73-662,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,998.889,1001.383,But now that he associates with anybody.
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1001.383,1005.392,"If we're talking about the possession issue alone, that is correct, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1974.73-662,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1012.15,1015.035,Whether not with anybody else or not.
1974.73-662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1015.035,1020.012,"Well, is fraternization itself a crime under the UCMJ?"
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1020.012,1026.201,"No, I think the-- only if it reaches a level where it does become destructive of discipline."
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1126.228,1128.188,"So, wouldn't alcohol also?"
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1128.188,1129.468,"It will if overused, yes."
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1129.468,1132.572,"And this is off based, wasn't it?"
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1132.572,1142.786,"That is true, Mr. Justice Stewart, but I suspect that the-- I'm sure that the impact of the drug on personal wellbeing is the same whether you're in uniform, out of uniform, or on base, or off base."
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1142.786,1145.091,"Well, same is true with alcohol, isn't it?"
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1145.091,1145.448,That's true.
1974.73-662,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1152.843,1173.745,"Then do you not have the related factor that comes into this picture somewhere, if enlisted men generally get the impression that the officers tolerate the use of marijuana or other drugs which would go to your broad-based argument about maintenance of discipline, would it not?"
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1173.745,1174.288,That's right.
1974.73-662,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1256.141,1259.7,"Mr. Bork, I noticed you have consistently referred to drug use."
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1261.855,1264.423,"I'm-- yes, it's a marijuana case."
1974.73-662,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1295.279,1299.971,"Well, there's some thinking that alcohol also does the same thing."
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1299.971,1344.188,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I think that's correct but I think it's fundamentally a mistake for us to think that if a society has learned to tolerate alcohol over a period of years and punish only its severe abuse in the military, that it then becomes somehow unconstitutional or illegal for that society to make a different judgment about marijuana, whose effects in some respects may be similar and in some respects may be different, but I think it's an allowable legislative judgment that, on a basis of present knowledge and on a basis of the experience we have, marijuana may be regarded by any jurisdiction, civilian or military, as a more serious threat."
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1395.438,1397.283,The alcohol problem must be a part also.
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1398.731,1400.007,"Yes, it is a drug, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1400.007,1409.86,"And, in your brief on pages 17 and 18 the two are linked, I noticed, at least by the title of the hearing."
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1409.86,1412.604,"Well, the mili-- I'm not quite--"
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1412.604,1415.574,On the-- on review of military drug and alcohol programs.
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1415.574,1417.196,Yes.
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1430.409,1442.548,"Well, the-- unless, again, times have changed in the one branch of the military, i.e. the United States Navy, has concerned itself not only with the abuse of alcohol, with any possession of any kind of alcohol--"
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1442.548,1442.658,Aboard ship.
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1442.658,1444.246,"On any ship of the United States Navy, yes?"
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1444.246,1458.336,"Aboard ship, that's certainly true, Mr. Justice Stewart, but I think the Navy would take the position that drug possession off base, out of uniform is service-connected, whereas alcohol possession off base, out of uniform they would not regard as service-connected."
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1509.251,1510.906,Is Toth against Quarles an injunction?
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1512.708,1514.65,I believe so.
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1514.65,1517.127,"It's difficult to tell from the opinion, isn't it?"
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1517.127,1518.27,I read that.
1974.73-662,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1522.413,1526.244,Footnote number 2 or 3 or somewhere indicates it was habeas corpus.
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1526.244,1530.777,It was.
1974.73-662,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1530.777,1532.947,"Mr. Bork, can I ask you one other question."
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1541.987,1545.649,"A civilian-- I don't know of a-- one of hand, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1974.73-662,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1548.969,1549.402,And do you know of any--
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1549.402,1550.747,The Civilian Courts--
1974.73-662,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1550.747,1555.57,Any military case holding that marijuana possession is not service-connected?
1974.73-662,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1555.57,1556.978,"No, I don't."
1974.73-662,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1563.902,1570.995,No?
1974.73-662,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1570.995,1576.0,Mr. Garrett.
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,1576.0,1581.528,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the members of the Court.
1974.73-662,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1808.696,1813.104,"Mr. Garrett, I'm not sure that I understand."
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,1823.279,1823.892,"Yes, that is--"
1974.73-662,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1823.892,1831.265,"Now, would it make any difference to your case if he'd been a lieutenant, first-lieutenant, second-lieutenant instead of a clerk typist?"
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,1831.265,1831.582,"No, I don't--"
1974.73-662,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1831.582,1832.469,Or just a man?
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,1832.469,1834.45,"Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-662,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1904.082,1909.354,"Mr. Garrett, are you or is your colleague going to address the jurisdictional question?"
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,1909.354,1911.746,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-662,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1963.487,1983.206,"Do you think it might make a difference if a captain gave a party and then invited a dozen enlisted men and they all made very excessive use of alcohol and, ultimately, the party went public and you had a public count in this criminal act you're talking about."
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,1989.893,2011.677,"I think if the party reached such proportions as according to this where they spew out into the street and there are off post, then I think that then we would apply the Relford test to see if perhaps, there, there was service-connection in your fact situation and there may be, in that instance, and again depending on the facts, there may be service-connection enough where they bring them up on Court-Martial."
1974.73-662,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2011.677,2018.924,"Possession of marijuana does not need to be in public in order to be a criminal act, does it?"
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2018.924,2019.637,"No, it does not."
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2056.543,2056.723,Is that in this case?
1974.73-662,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2056.723,2070.775,"How many times in your experience have the Civilian Courts in your state taken over a case of drunkenness of a military person, public drunkenness, many times?"
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2070.775,2071.271,"Yes, it's--"
1974.73-662,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2071.271,2074.068,Why don't they always turn it over to the military authorities?
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2074.068,2075.275,"No, they do not."
1974.73-662,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2100.925,2104.427,He'd be sentenced for 10 days to the county jail?
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2104.427,2111.216,"Actually, it's a practical matter and in accordance of $25-50 fine in the civilian community for public drunkenness."
1974.73-662,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2111.216,2112.558,Where was the order?
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2112.558,2114.769,Fort Sill community is a lot in Oklahoma.
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2115.474,2118.988,Does that prevent the Army from moving in afterwards?
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2118.988,2120.602,"Yes, it does, if there is a conviction in the Civilian Court."
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2120.602,2122.152,It does?
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2122.152,2124.867,"Other than administratively, they make a note in a man's file."
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2124.867,2128.138,You've got an agreement or something with the law?
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2128.138,2130.861,"No, sir."
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2138.735,2139.757,After he's tried?
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2139.757,2140.694,After he's tried or after he pleads guilty.
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2140.694,2144.358,"But the military could take him, couldn't they, before trial?"
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2144.358,2146.636,"Yes, they could, but they never have."
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2146.636,2149.988,They just waive that they still have the right.
1974.73-662,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2149.988,2151.799,You better not concede that they could.
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2151.799,2152.353,I don't think that they--
1974.73-662,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2152.353,2153.567,They'll take away your case.
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2153.567,2156.417,"Yes, but I'm not sure that they could just come in and take him and try him."
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2165.08,2170.916,"Is the possession of the marijuana at all closed, is that an offense?"
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2173.891,2174.694,What?
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2174.694,2180.443,"The possession of marijuana, while a member of the military took in any place?"
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2180.443,2183.759,"No, only if it takes place within the confines of the base."
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2183.759,2186.106,And where do you get that from?
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2186.106,2193.776,"Well, it seems to me that-- I mean, I'm limiting-- I can say, definitely, if he possesses marijuana on base that is a military offense."
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2214.263,2222.095,If we weren't dealing with a drug in any of the other cases.
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2222.095,2222.47,I'm sorry.
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2223.101,2227.257,"We weren't dealing with drugs in any of the other cases, were we?"
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2227.257,2229.563,"In the other cases, Relford and O'Callahan?"
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2231.558,2246.56,"We weren't dealing with drugs, but now we're dealing with drugs which the military decided as just that, unlawful and should be stopped."
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2246.56,2261.758,"I'm not sure that the military-- I'm not sure that the use of drugs or that the military can say that this crime, marijuana, is a different type of crime than any other crime."
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2267.267,2273.047,"The possession of money is no crime, but possession of marijuana is."
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2273.047,2273.096,Yes.
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2273.096,2276.285,"Of course it's true, if it's your own money."
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2276.285,2277.294,Yes.[Laughter]
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2277.294,2288.749,"So they couldn't make possession of certain substances a crime and dope is one, narcotics is one, and marijuana is one."
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2300.832,2305.652,"No, it's a crime to possess marijuana in the military."
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2320.453,2324.222,Like what something else could it be?
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2324.222,2327.792,"Captain Councilman, in this case, had mere possession off post."
1974.73-662,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2327.792,2333.643,He picks an enlisted man and makes a deal to sell him marijuana.
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2357.551,2360.529,Not in terms of the factual situation in this case.
1974.73-662,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2398.163,2399.735,Your colleague is going to deal with the jurisdictional question?
1974.73-662,1,37110,nicholas_d_garrett,,2399.735,2402.992,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-662,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2402.992,2404.331,Mr. Meyers.
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2404.331,2406.717,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2470.904,2474.008,"Mr. Meyers, we're not talking about the merits of the case."
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2498.566,2501.944,"I did intend to reach that, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2584.219,2587.381,"Well, it's-- is that the only way to put it?"
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2604.694,2618.017,I think that whether the Civilian Court has jurisdiction at all and when the jurisdiction of the Civilian Court arises depends upon whether or not the Military Court has jurisdiction.
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2624.733,2632.516,"But it's up to the Civilian Court in an injunctive-- in an action for an injunction to determine the question, you say, up to the Federal--"
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2632.516,2632.65,I say that--
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2632.65,2634.139,To a Federal District Court?
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2634.139,2634.725,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2635.484,2652.697,"This would mean that in every single case where there's a threat in Court-Martial the defendant could come into a Federal District Court and try this question out in the Federal District Court in an action for an injunction to enjoin the Military Court-Martial, is that right?"
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2652.697,2667.773,"I think that's not correct, although I would say that, certainly, an individual always maintains his constitutional rights and always the Civilian Courts stand ready to protect these constitutional rights that they're infringed."
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2667.773,2669.158,What cases do you have where--
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2669.158,2670.997,I-- in Toth versus Quarles which is--
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2670.997,2673.418,Is that an injunctive proceeding?
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2673.418,2674.806,That was a habeas corpus proceeding.
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2674.806,2676.326,That's what I thought.
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2676.326,2680.572,"And, in Toth versus Quarles, a man who, as you recall it, been discharged in the Army."
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2680.572,2680.948,Right.
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2680.948,2684.539,He has retired his carrier and was charged for murder.
1974.73-662,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2704.581,2706.681,But that was after he had been tried.
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2709.314,2710.464,It had taken him up to--
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2710.464,2715.59,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the man was taken from Pennsylvania, I believe, back to Korea."
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2715.59,2717.068,Back to Korea.
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2717.068,2726.473,"To stand trial for murder and, before the military could proceed with the murder trial, the matter was raised by habeas corpus."
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2726.473,2727.265,I think that's correct.
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2729.43,2731.809,I believe you're referring to the facts in Gusik.
1974.73-662,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2731.809,2734.176,"Well, I was thinking of Reid against Covert and Schilder."
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2734.176,2737.016,"Right, those were post convictions."
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2737.016,2747.644,Reid against Covert was a situation where a military dependent was-- stood accused of murdering her serviceman husband.
1974.73-662,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2764.339,2768.365,"But, there in Reid the trial had taken place, hadn't it, in the military--"
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2768.365,2769.184,I believe not.
1974.73-662,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2775.323,2781.51,"But, well-- at any rate, in both-- in Reid, the person was a civilian, were they not?"
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2781.51,2787.076,"In Reid, the person was a civilian, the wife of the serviceman whom she murdered."
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2787.076,2789.086,And the action was one for habeas corpus.
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2789.086,2790.923,That's correct.
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2813.951,2814.089,Was that an injunction?
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2814.089,2814.14,Habeas--
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2814.14,2814.769,Was that an action?
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2814.769,2815.116,"No, sir."
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2818.475,2824.502,Except for the case that we heard yesterday in Avrech.
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2825.9,2830.966,"I do have a file, a case."
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2834.798,2836.063,"This isn't in your brief, is it?"
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2836.063,2836.448,Sir?
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2836.448,2837.689,It's not in your brief.
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2837.689,2843.677,"Dooley versus Ploger, I believe, is cited in the government's brief and also in the amici brief."
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2843.677,2844.72,Dooley?
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2844.72,2850.867,Dooley versus Ploger.
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2896.666,2900.831,"The way you explain it, it was sort of a decision on the merits."
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2908.015,2908.421,The--
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2908.421,2909.935,"But just denied the injunction, is that it?"
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2909.935,2914.418,The Cir-- the District Court allowed an inju-- enjoined the Court-Martial proceedings.
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2917.757,2918.665,On the merits.
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2918.665,2923.779,"On the merits, because the military did not have a chance to develop the facts in that particular case."
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2923.779,2930.827,"But didn't-- but the Court of Appeals did not say, as you explained it to us, that the District Court was without jurisdiction to consider the matter, did it?"
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2930.827,2932.693,That is my understanding of the case.
1974.73-662,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2932.693,2939.876,"Well, I just simply think so."
1974.73-662,2,37523,orin_christopher_meyers,,2939.876,2948.514,I'd like to continue the line that I had started-- continue on the two-step inquiry.
1974.73-662,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,3433.143,3437.826,"Mr. Chief Justice, I just wish to respond more fully to Mr. Justice Blackmun's question about the cases."
1974.73-662,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3487.172,3487.902,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
