1975.74-1033,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.951,"We will hear arguments next in Dann, the Commissioner of Patents against Johnston."
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,49.919,53.469,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,691.563,693.769,"He does not think much of Benson, does he?"
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,693.769,695.051,No he does not.
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.768,704.653,(Inaudible) had he not in Benson?
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,704.653,705.878,"He had written Benson, yes."
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.878,707.239,But he was reversed?
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,707.239,709.156,"He was, yes."
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,711.151,719.068,"What was the (Inaudible), had he ever expressed how it was held, how he would have held prior to Benson ---"
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,719.068,734.292,"I believe he joined the decision in Bernhardt and a decision subsequent to Benson which were decided on records completed before the Benson case, which continued to adhere to the CCPA’s Bernhardt rule."
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,734.292,749.703,(Inaudible) that the government should be allowed to bring here?
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,749.703,757.305,"Yes, there is an argument that the commissioner is -- is barred jurisdictionally from contesting --"
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.305,762.668,Because he is the Board or the Board is -- he may not challenge the Board’s -- the Board's decision?
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,762.668,763.17,That is correct.
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,763.17,764.387,Alright.
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,769.364,769.963,That is right.
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,788.269,793.743,But you are taking issue with the the decision of the -- of the Board?
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,793.743,803.168,"In the light of what has happened in Benson, the issue came before the CCPA."
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,820.334,823.813,Was not Benson after the Board’s decision in this case?
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,823.813,825.526,"Yes, that is correct."
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.526,830.814,"So, you think Benson bore heavily on the -- one the issues of this case?"
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,830.814,832.303,Yes.
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,832.303,841.891,"And -- so you say that you should at least have a chance to represent your arguments to the Board of -- to the Board, at the very least?"
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,841.891,843.322,"At the very least, Your Honor."
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.321,868.772,"Does anyone know -- there has been any subsequent cases or other cases that you know what the, how the Board would decide its case after Benson?"
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,868.772,877.924,"I think since Benson, the -- the Board I think is taking position that Benson is controlling as the commissioner argued in this case."
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,877.924,884.368,"You mean the Board has since taken a position, that its position in this case is wrong?"
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,884.368,889.235,"I would have to -- well, its decision in this case was a rejection of the applications under 101."
1975.74-1033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,959.742,961.438,As a process path?
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,961.438,971.515,"As a process, but the thrust of Benson is that abstract concepts like accounting systems are also unpatentable when expressed as computer programs."
1975.74-1033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1007.126,1031.136,"Well, certainly Mr. Shapiro, that is far beyond the holding of Benson and it seems to me that it would require more technological ability than I posses and I would suspect perhaps than you posses to say flatly that nothing that might subsequently be done with a computer in the way of programming could ever be patented?"
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1031.136,1047.651,We have -- we have tried to reserve the possibility which we have no technological force as you recognized that there maybe some sort of combination or use of program and computer that -- that operates in some synergistic way.
1975.74-1033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1050.457,1055.453,"No, but you probably would have anticipated the telegraph or the telephone either any more than I would have?"
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1055.453,1098.404,"Which is why, which is precisely why in using those cases, the Court’s decisions involving those inventions, the telegraph and the -- the telephone, have always been limited in such a way that the results achieved as distinguished from the machinery themselves cannot be patented and what is happening here in this case is that the -- the simple idea of using a general purpose computer to carry out an accounting program, without being embodied or limited to any particular apparatus, is getting -- is being patented and that is part of the objectionable aspect of this -- this -- of this application."
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.005,1142.484,"But did the Board not say this was just a new use, it is a new machine?"
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1142.484,1144.06,The Board did not say it is a new machine.
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1166.024,1167.958,You do not think it said it was a new machine?
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1167.958,1168.883,No.
1975.74-1033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1168.883,1170.879,But nevertheless not patentable?
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1170.879,1180.031,"They said it was not patentable because it found no structural change, no enhancement of a function of the machine, those were his words, enhancement of the function of the machine."
1975.74-1033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1229.178,1232.163,What if you have the analog computer?
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1232.163,1239.134,"I think the argument would be the same, although we do not have an analog computer here and the technology is somewhat different."
1975.74-1033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1239.134,1247.513,"I mean, there you do not have it just for an instant, you have, once it is wired I take it, it -- it is -- is set in place the way any other machine is?"
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1247.513,1269.821,"Well, with this difference I do not fully -- this record that has not told us enough about the -- the operation of what are called general purpose analogs, and I really cannot describe them for you, but I think as in Benson I would have to say that the issue of analog computers is not before us here, but with -- at least with the general purpose computer, about which we can talk with --"
1975.74-1033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1269.821,1272.598,"Is that a digital, basically a general purpose?"
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1272.598,1279.006,This calls for a -- a general purpose digital computer.
1975.74-1033,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1471.364,1473.212,"Mr. Shapiro, you usually have six minutes."
1975.74-1033,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1473.212,1476.398,"I should like -- I should like to reserve the remainder of my time, Your Honor."
1975.74-1033,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1476.398,1492.106,"Very well, Mr. Jacobs?"
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,1511.245,1523.408,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Honorable Court.
1975.74-1033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1712.298,1730.828,"(oice Overlap) this programming be just as much available and just as useful to the ordinary taxpayer to separate his checks that went out for contributions to his church, the contribution or the payments to his doctor, to taxes, to other detectable expenses or not?"
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,1730.828,1747.037,"Yes it would, Mr. Chief Justice and that is contemplated by use of the program that -- that this machine is implemented in, that precisely those benefits would be derived."
1975.74-1033,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1904.651,1913.948,"Well but you can say that about a record player too, but that does not mean you get a patent for a new record?"
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,1913.948,1918.618,"That is true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1975.74-1033,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1934.205,1948.807,"But the physical machine is already well developed, is it not, and then perhaps patented it separately?"
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,1948.807,1961.06,"The answer to your question is a complicated one, Mr. Justice Rehnquist and I -- I would like to give you an answer."
1975.74-1033,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2032.859,2034.48,"May I ask, Mr. Jacobs?"
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2034.48,2036.071,Yes sir.
1975.74-1033,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2036.071,2039.44,Is what appears on that chart precisely is the same thing as it appears on page 30 of your brief?
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2039.44,2040.068,Yes sir.
1975.74-1033,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2040.068,2043.267,It is because that chart is going to be gone after this oral argument?
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2043.267,2044.193,Yes sir.
1975.74-1033,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2047.633,2048.181,Alright.
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2048.181,2051.136,Commits me to point to the items so that I can communicate with you.
1975.74-1033,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2051.136,2051.87,Thank you.
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2051.87,2056.915,"Thank you, sir."
1975.74-1033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2222.986,2232.03,What is it that you contribute to all of that or is this all yours?
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2236.732,2241.271,"We are talking about the IBM machine, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1975.74-1033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2241.271,2244.183,What does this do to the IBM machine?
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2244.183,2256.919,"The IBM machine consists of electrical components, logic circuits and functional circuits and it also consists of another device called a “function sequencer.”"
1975.74-1033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2256.919,2259.092,What do you put in there in addition?
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2259.092,2265.513,What we put in there in addition is the software program which is the circuit configuration.
1975.74-1033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2265.513,2268.596,And where is that coming at?
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2268.596,2274.63,Here it is the software programs which are stored in the memory states of a computer.
1975.74-1033,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.577,2476.669,But it is one thing to say that a -- a pro the fact that you require rely on a program should not make it unpatentable.
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2482.883,2489.315,"Almost, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, almost, but let me clarify what the word program is."
1975.74-1033,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2625.051,2648.825,"Let me (Voice Overlap) in the taking of you example of a change from a manual choke to an automatic choke, presumably there is only one or at the most patents that are available on --- on that kind of change, but if your theory is right, there is a patent available for every conceivable configuration of this computer programming?"
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2648.825,2659.634,"I would say yes and no to the first part of your comment, your premise, but I would say yes to the last part, and let me explain that."
1975.74-1033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2864.075,2874.383,"And they would hold any -- as any general purpose computer that has a new program designed for it to be a new machine, I -- I suppose?"
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2874.383,2874.625,There has been no --
1975.74-1033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2874.625,2877.265,May not hold it patentable but they would hold it to be a new machine?
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2877.265,2881.107,There has been no change in the Board of Appeals' position in this regard.
1975.74-1033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2904.972,2910.811,Did the Board required to follow the court in other cases?
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2910.811,2915.983,"As a general rule it does, but we are talking basically here about what is a factual issue."
1975.74-1033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2939.539,2942.373,Did the Board say it was a new machine?
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2942.373,2950.905,"That was their holding because the examiner below said it was not a new machine, that it was merely a new use, and they were reversed -- that rejection was reversed."
1975.74-1033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2950.905,2951.67,And they rejected it --
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2951.67,2953.051,And they said it -- may I read?
1975.74-1033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2953.051,2954.945,They rejected it for some other reason?
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2954.945,2955.334,Yes.
1975.74-1033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2995.72,2998.47,"[Laughter] time is short, is it not?"
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,2998.47,3003.215,"It races, Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-1033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3135.468,3165.972,"So if a -- if a holding company, if a conglomerate had a lots of units around the country and it wanted to keep track of it -- of the -- of the bookkeeping and the profits of the various units and it used this very machine to -- to give it ready information about the operations of its various units, would that, would that infringe this patent?"
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,3165.972,3174.121,"Yes it would if they use the same configuration of controls that which infringed this patent, but they would have no reason to --"
1975.74-1033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.121,3181.039,Is your -- but you would not say in order to infringe they would have to have the identical circuitry?
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,3181.039,3186.382,"No, our claims are not limited to any particular program, software or hardware and not limited to various ways of --"
1975.74-1033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3186.382,3190.829,So your very claims of generality of this -- of this way of doing things?
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,3190.829,3197.395,We are -- we are claiming the generality of circuit configurations whereby these set of controls is achieved.
1975.74-1033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3197.395,3199.821,"So you are not just claiming something like a copyright, I mean- --"
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,3199.821,3200.855,"No, we are not."
1975.74-1033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3200.855,3208.149,"You are claiming -- you are -- there could be a lot of machines to do the same function, but differently hooked up that would violate your patent?"
1975.74-1033,1,36084,morton_c_jacobs,,3208.149,3211.313,"That is right, Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-1033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3302.103,3303.942,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Shapiro?"
1975.74-1033,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3303.942,3311.898,"Yes, Your Honor, briefly."
1975.74-1033,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3507.373,3508.074,Gentleman.
