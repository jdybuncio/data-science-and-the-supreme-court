2003.02-1315,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.339,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-1315, Gary Locke v. Joshua Davey."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,9.743,13.337,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1315,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,28.28,36.62,"Do you think the fact that that provision is in Washington's constitution makes it different than, say, if it were in a...  simply in a statute?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,36.62,47.478,"Mr. Chief Justice, the recognition that this Court has given to a state constitution, as opposed to a statute, is that it is adopted by all of the voters of the state."
2003.02-1315,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,55.074,64.818,Is...  is it a program at issue here that provides basically money to the student to be spent as the student wishes?
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,68.094,79.761,"Justice O'Connor, the Promise Scholarship is to be provided to the student for purposes of educational expenses and they're required to use it for certain educational expenses."
2003.02-1315,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,91.028,98.913,"Well, I'm just trying to find out how it works, whether it's like a voucher program, you give the money to the student and the student decides how to use it."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,98.913,103.91,It...  it works like a voucher program to the extent that it's for educational expenses.
2003.02-1315,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.717,135.71,How...  how many states have similar provisions in their constitutions or laws?
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,135.71,139.78,"It varies, Justice O'Connor, according to the particular provisions."
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,162.898,167.318,"They were all adopted at about the same time, weren't these so-called Blaine Amendments?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,167.318,170.866,"Your Honor, this is not the Blaine Amendment."
2003.02-1315,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,194.106,194.849,And was that...
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,198.564,206.16,"No, Your...  Mr. Chief Justice, I'm sorry...  it was at the same time of adoption, but it was not the provision that was required by the..."
2003.02-1315,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.16,206.41,The enabling.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,206.41,206.782,enabling act.
2003.02-1315,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.086,259.37,But what if...  what if a state prohibited only the study of theology from a Catholic perspective?
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,261.849,264.2,"No, Your Honor, we don't believe it would."
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,272.168,272.706,Wait.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,318.486,320.798,"No, Justice Scalia..."
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,320.798,321.187,Why not?
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,321.187,321.913,I don't believe that follows.
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,354.446,355.022,It's...  it's treating...
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,355.022,355.765,of protecting religious freedom.
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.765,358.532,it's treating religion differently from non-religion.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,366.911,376.653,It is treating religion different from a realm in which religion...  religious belief or non-belief does not enter what we refer to as secular studies.
2003.02-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,377.479,399.044,"You're making the...  are you...  are you making the...  or is Washington making the distinction between training in how to be religious, training as it were in the practice of some...  of a religion that leads to the truth, on the one hand, and study about what people believe on the other hand."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,406.086,406.829,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1315,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.829,407.284,Okay.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,407.284,409.12,And that was the distinction I meant to articulate.
2003.02-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,409.12,423.509,"So, I take it, then, if it that's the distinction, you would...  you would agree that if Washington funded a school of atheism, but wouldn't fund a school like this one, that there would be a violation of one or both of the clauses?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,423.509,438.12,"Yes, Justice Souter, because whenever you enter into the realm of faith or belief, 0010 whenever you try to affect someone's belief in that realm, that has been a particularly protected realm of individual conscience, that becomes religious, whether it's non-belief or belief."
2003.02-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,439.113,442.828,But it's the difference between being religious and studying religion.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,444.109,446.626,"Yes, Your Honor, and I believe that's the Court's line."
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,451.167,456.574,Can...  can you not study atheism under this statute?
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,471.025,480.23,"Justice Scalia, I think when the statute is read in conjunction with Washington case law, and particularly the Calvary Bible Presbyterian Church case, that the definition..."
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.23,481.177,What does the statute say?
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,483.945,489.312,"Well, the statute says that no aid shall be awarded to any student pursuing a degree in theology."
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.312,490.138,In theology.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,490.138,490.388,But...
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.388,494.846,"Now, is...  is a degree in atheism a degree in theology?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,494.846,498.811,I believe it would be under the interpretation...
2003.02-1315,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,498.811,502.36,"That would be a question, would it not, for the state supreme court to decide?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,508.858,509.501,I...
2003.02-1315,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,509.501,516.932,"And I think that certainly the Free Exercise Clause answers the question, can you give it to the Catholics but not to the Jews."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,518.623,535.425,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that the Washington Supreme Court would interpret it that way, not only to be consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, but to be consistent with its own state constitutional provision and its purposes, which is to not use public funds for instruction in the realm of faith and belief and..."
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.425,553.175,What cases do you cite for the proposition that you're asserting that the...  that the Free Exercise Clause or the Establishment Clause applies differently to discrimination between different religions than it does to discrimination between religion in general and non-religion?
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,555.654,565.063,"What we cite, Your Honor, is that line between the secular and the religious activity."
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.067,583.805,"No, but that doesn't...  that...  the issue there was whether you were discriminating against religion or not."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,628.927,656.252,"Well, Your Honor, in the context of this Court's aid to education under the Establishment Clause, and Mitchell v. Helms is a classic example, there's a distinction between providing materials, educational materials that are to be used in secular education, as opposed to those materials that might be diverted to religious, ideological education and..."
2003.02-1315,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,656.252,660.977,"But that's...  that's the Establishment Clause, isn't it, in Mitchell against Helms?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,660.977,668.019,"Yes, it is, Your Honor, and...  and we believe the same...  many of the same values underlie the Washington constitution."
2003.02-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,675.821,677.473,"Well, I wanted to ask you about these values."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,710.744,715.74,"Well, the statute focuses on whether a student is pursuing a degree in theology and...  and..."
2003.02-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,715.74,724.573,"If...  suppose that he pursued a degree in business administration and yet, ancillary to that or as options, took all of these other courses."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,727.341,730.851,"Yes, Your Honor, we think that could have happened, but it's an unlikely..."
2003.02-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,730.851,731.056,All right.
2003.02-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,731.056,737.084,What is the state's interest in denying him aid simply because he declares a double major?
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,737.084,748.989,"I believe the reason the legislature has focused on the nature of the degree program is because it's an inherently religious program, and if they were to..."
2003.02-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.989,760.894,"What is the state's interest in denying him funds simply because of the way he labels the major he chooses, if all the other instructions, all the other elements of the case are the same?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,774.418,780.447,"Justice Kennedy, I think the state's interest is not in that particular student, but in how you administer it overall."
2003.02-1315,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,796.255,797.37,"Ms. Pierce, I thought that the..."
2003.02-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,797.37,802.178,"Well, what is the state's interest in...  in denying aid for programs that are inherently religious?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,804.594,807.029,"Yes, Your Honor, we believe it is."
2003.02-1315,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,807.938,824.285,"May I ask you just to clarify what I thought was the purpose of this, was that the state has decided it does not want to fund the training of clergymen, and it cites a long history of that."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,844.552,852.066,Justice Ginsburg...  excuse me...  the focus is on the religious nature of the instruction.
2003.02-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,889.468,895.124,But we've decided in Witters that it's unnecessary to do that to conform to the Establishment Clause.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,895.124,896.693,"Yes, Justice Kennedy..."
2003.02-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,896.693,899.954,"So, after...  after that, then what is the state's interest at this point?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,899.954,901.401,"Well, the state's..."
2003.02-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,901.401,904.123,Is the state's interest in redefining the Establishment Clause?
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,904.123,920.182,"No, Your Honor, but the state has a different, although somewhat concurrent, scheme for religious freedom, and that involves not just avoiding a government endorsement of religion, which is what the Establishment Clause primarily turns and focuses on..."
2003.02-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,920.182,921.668,But Witters said there is no endorsement.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,921.668,922.616,And...  and...
2003.02-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,922.616,923.914,So you can't use that.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,923.914,925.195,"No, and I'm not trying to."
2003.02-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,925.195,930.396,"I still don't see what your interest is, and once you do define it, I want you to tell me if it's compelling, rational basis."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,930.396,931.844,Okay.
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,948.19,954.339,Does that mean that the state can decline to provide fire protection to churches and synagogues?
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,954.339,958.016,"No, Your Honor, and that distinction has been made."
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,958.016,960.012,"And Washington doesn't do that, does it?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,960.012,962.324,"It does not decline that, and there's..."
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,962.324,971.984,"So that...  that general public benefit is extended to both religious and non-religious institutions equivalently, and people don't get upset about that, do they?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,971.984,973.841,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,982.264,993.31,"Well, Washington's position, I take it, is that, although it...  it will certainly put out the fire in the church, it won't spend money for the purpose of persuading people that they ought to be inside the church."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,995.911,996.077,"Yes, Justice Souter."
2003.02-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1000.164,1018.163,"And you're saying that even though it would not offend the Establishment Clause if the state did provide this sort of funding, there is still, I think your point is, there is still an area within which it has a choice, even though that choice may not be determined by the Establishment Clause?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1018.163,1035.252,"Yes, Your Honor, because the purpose of the state constitution, which of course, when it was adopted in 1889, was not viewed as greater than the Establishment Clause, it was viewed as the only protection for religious freedom at the state level, since it wasn't until 1947 that the Establishment Clause was held to apply to the states."
2003.02-1315,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1064.685,1066.914,"Well, isn't that an Establishment Clause issue?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1066.914,1069.886,In that particular...
2003.02-1315,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1069.886,1073.191,"It's been litigated under the Establishment Clause, right?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1073.191,1075.253,The provision of the...  the aid...
2003.02-1315,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1075.253,1078.309,Providing textbooks or other aid to religious schools.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1095.315,1102.58,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, and that's because under the Establishment Clause, the question is, is the government endorsing religion?"
2003.02-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1114.923,1116.947,But do you...  do you think that...
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1154.304,1158.185,"Justice Souter, there's a distinction in our state constitution..."
2003.02-1315,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1158.185,1161.984,"No, but isn't the answer, there is nothing that forbids that?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1181.508,1182.994,That's true at the higher education level.
2003.02-1315,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1182.994,1183.449,Okay.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1190.136,1208.136,"Your Honor, we...  the statute says pursuing a degree in theology, so I think it should be properly read and is properly read by Northwest College as a student who is, during the academic terms that are funded, working toward that degree in theology."
2003.02-1315,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1208.136,1212.716,But I...  I just want to be sure I understand how it works in response to Justice Kennedy's inquiry.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1222.747,1225.697,I believe he...
2003.02-1315,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.697,1226.999,Which has a double aspect.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1240.913,1242.565,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1315,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1242.771,1252.596,"And...  and I just want to know, am I correct that he could have taken either all or substantially all of the religion...  religious courses and qualified for the scholarship if he just declared a different major?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1252.596,1254.909,"You're partially correct, Justice Stevens."
2003.02-1315,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1266.138,1269.398,Wasn't he counseled...  wasn't he counseled specifically by the school to be honest?
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1269.398,1270.801,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-1315,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1270.801,1275.714,"And not try to hide what his purpose was, which he was perfectly open about?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1275.714,1276.79,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-1315,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1276.79,1285.539,"And, of course, if...  if you take a whole bunch of religious courses, it may be they can't be counted for some other major other than the...  the theology."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1285.539,1303.206,"Well, the theology degree, Your Honor, does require, I believe at Northwest, 125 credits, and 79 of those credits are required to be in various Bible and theological courses, so I think it is...  it would be possible, but unusual, for another student to have those same courses and not being pursuing a degree in theology."
2003.02-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1303.206,1307.915,"Could we go back to Justice Kennedy's second part of what he was asking, because it's bothering me, too."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1390.392,1403.767,"Justice Breyer, I believe it is a rational basis test, that is, it is a neutral line, it's a recognized line between the secular that does not involve the realm of belief and faith, and a religious that does."
2003.02-1315,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1403.767,1407.193,I didn't think this was an Equal Protection Clause case at all.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1410.082,1412.245,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it is, and..."
2003.02-1315,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1412.245,1415.2,The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment?
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1415.2,1417.613,"That is the question on which cert was granted, and..."
2003.02-1315,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1417.613,1418.006,Right.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1418.006,1419.203,because it is a neutral line...
2003.02-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1419.203,1429.112,"Well, I'm thinking of free exercise, but I'm thinking this is a discrimination case, so maybe it's totally different under free exercise, but you see the question."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1429.112,1430.105,"Yes, and Justice Breyer..."
2003.02-1315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1430.105,1431.341,And your answer's rational basis.
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1431.341,1432.084,Yes.
2003.02-1315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1432.084,1448.803,"Rational...  you...  you think there's a difference in free exercise if what the state says is, we are burdening the free exercise of all religions, as opposed to, we are burdening the free exercise of one particular religion."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1455.118,1473.406,"Justice Scalia, in the first instance, this case involves application of public funds in a funding program, and we believe that the principle that a state's decision not to fund the exercise of a fundamental right is not a burden on that right, it's not an infringement on that right."
2003.02-1315,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1478.979,1489.177,"Certainly in our...  in our Rosenberger case there was a rational basis for what the University of Virginia did, but we held it violated the Free Exercise Clause."
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1489.177,1499.041,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and the purpose of the public forum principles that were applied in Rosenberger are to protect the open public forum."
2003.02-1315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1527.359,1539.082,You think there is a...  a rational basis suffices for the state to prohibit this student from declaring one of his legitimate majors?
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1539.082,1549.651,"We believe...  yes, Your Honor, we believe there is a rational basis to not fund religious instruction wherever it occurs, including a theology course."
2003.02-1315,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1549.651,1563.852,"Is it essentially your position that not everything that is compatible with the Establishment Clause, not everything that the state could do under the Establishment Clause, it must do under the Free Exercise?"
2003.02-1315,0,37248,narda_pierce,,1569.797,1571.67,That is our position.
2003.02-1315,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1598.32,1600.177,"Thank you, Ms. Pierce."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1603.167,1618.216,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the free exercise context, this Court has held that the minimum requirement of neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face"
2003.02-1315,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1702.429,1709.942,"So it wouldn't violate the Establishment Clause, but I guess what we're addressing is whether there's a free exercise violation."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1709.942,1710.125,Right.
2003.02-1315,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1710.125,1716.341,How does this violate the student's right to free exercise of religion?
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1726.218,1731.036,"Joshua Davey, and the state has acknowledged this, of course, has the free exercise right to pursue a degree in theology."
2003.02-1315,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1748.087,1748.83,"Well, let me ask you this."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1748.83,1749.196,Sure.
2003.02-1315,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1749.196,1760.597,Suppose a state has a school voucher program such as the Court indicated could be upheld in the Zelman case.
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1781.978,1782.228,"No, I think..."
2003.02-1315,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1782.228,1782.971,Is that your position?
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1782.971,1783.409,No.
2003.02-1315,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1783.864,1784.485,"Well, why not?"
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1788.117,1788.776,For this reason.
2003.02-1315,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1806.155,1807.352,I...  I don't know what you mean.
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1822.502,1823.04,That...
2003.02-1315,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1823.04,1829.189,Can they refrain from making that program available for use in religious schools?
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1829.189,1829.849,I...  I would think not.
2003.02-1315,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1833.359,1840.789,"So what you're urging here would have a major impact, then, would it not, on...  on voucher programs?"
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1840.789,1841.699,"Well, it would."
2003.02-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1855.734,1857.424,"Well, but the only criteria that they have..."
2003.02-1315,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1857.424,1863.33,"Sure...  surely, the state can decide to fund only public schools."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1863.33,1864.111,Absolutely.
2003.02-1315,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1864.111,1869.191,And it's only when it starts funding some private schools that you get into the religious question.
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1869.191,1869.646,That's correct.
2003.02-1315,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1869.646,1871.382,But I'm...  I'm concerned...
2003.02-1315,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1871.382,1875.923,But you say if they publish any private school they must publish...  they must support all religious schools as well.
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1875.923,1876.516,No.
2003.02-1315,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1879.843,1884.18,But they could not just say we...  we will publish all private schools except sectarian schools.
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1884.18,1884.923,I don't think they could do that.
2003.02-1315,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.409,1887.047,"That's the issue here, yeah."
2003.02-1315,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1887.047,1894.665,"Even though there...  there are quite a few state laws and constitutional provisions around the country that...  that provide just that, aren't there?"
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1894.665,1895.326,There are.
2003.02-1315,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1896.773,1897.028,Yeah.
2003.02-1315,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1897.028,1900.981,"So the decision here could have very broad impact, I assume."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1900.981,1909.815,"Interesting, Justice O'Connor, and admittedly, this is a bit of a moving target because state policies change, but there are approximately 37 states that have this type of amendment."
2003.02-1315,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1916.397,1916.697,Mr. Sekulow?
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1916.697,1916.863,Yes.
2003.02-1315,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1916.863,1922.52,"May I ask you the question that I asked Ms. Pierce, because I think this is really what the case turns on."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1947.782,1948.238,Yes.
2003.02-1315,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1948.238,1963.22,"Suppose the...  the state would say, we are going to fund professional education, lawyers, doctors, architects, engineers, but we're not going to fund people who are...  who are in a divinity program."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1966.814,1973.994,"Well, I think a program that were to just limit it to specific professions would not necessarily have to go towards theology."
2003.02-1315,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1984.897,1990.486,"No, but it would include...  my program includes all professions, save one, and...  and that is ministry."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,1990.486,1996.33,"Well, if it was as you described it, I would be here arguing the same point in this context."
2003.02-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2008.59,2029.684,"As I...  as I understand your answer to Justice O'Connor, if we decide in your favor, we necessarily commit ourselves to the proposition that an elementary and secondary school voucher program must include religious schools if it includes any other private schools."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2072.862,2074.926,"Well, I don't think...  I agree, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-1315,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2076.784,2078.436,But why isn't...
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2084.464,2085.04,If...
2003.02-1315,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2085.04,2099.697,"Now, have we...  have we, in looking at funding issues, have we dealt differently with the requirement of funding something out of public funds than for other purposes?"
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2099.697,2111.707,"Well...  well, certainly in the...  in the direct aid cases and in the Establishment Clause context, but this is very similar to the Witters program, so there is not the countervailing Establishment Clause issue, and that's what I was going to address, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2124.338,2124.96,Okay.
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2180.992,2186.837,"Justice Souter, in this particular...  using that example, here the school is a qualified school."
2003.02-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2191.257,2191.445,Sure.
2003.02-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2191.445,2191.528,That's a wash.
2003.02-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2191.528,2191.933,Everybody agrees.
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2191.933,2192.842,It's their major.
2003.02-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2192.842,2201.758,"Everybody...  the only criterion is, will we fund religious training in how to be religion...  religious...  or will we not?"
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2213.376,2225.741,"In this context, the way the program is implemented within that hypothetical and within the facts here, here students can take these very same courses in religion that Josh Davey..."
2003.02-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2225.741,2229.335,"Well, that may show that the state draws a kind of a funny line."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2261.945,2274.827,"If in fact the programs were put forward this way with the accreditation as you suggested, and there is no countervailing Establishment Clause issue and the eligibility issue of the school is met, yes, I wouldn't see the..."
2003.02-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2274.827,2275.031,All right.
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2275.031,2280.604,"justification to exclude a particular major here in this particular case, a submajor from a religious viewpoint."
2003.02-1315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.604,2281.226,Mr. Sekulow...
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2295.055,2303.821,"Twenty-five states have voucher-type programs that have no restrictions at all as long as it's an accredited institution, so that's the...  usually the standard."
2003.02-1315,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2336.581,2342.814,But I suppose he could have changed his mind and taken another major in most of the courses and then postponed that decision.
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2344.383,2345.209,It...  it was a matter of conscience.
2003.02-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2369.442,2370.451,But wouldn't it be...
2003.02-1315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2387.791,2387.791,Yes.
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2460.609,2463.952,"Well, the reason that I want...  let me address the latter, if I might, Justice Breyer."
2003.02-1315,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2502.84,2514.273,"Mr. Sekulow, I think that Justice Breyer is getting at the same point I tried to get at, and it's in part the other flip side of what Justice Kennedy asked you."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2534.995,2538.051,"Well, two responses."
2003.02-1315,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2568.599,2575.37,"Wouldn't be any better if they said, you can go to any school except a...  a church school."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2575.37,2575.946,No.
2003.02-1315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2591.716,2600.383,You...  you don't know of any case that says that the less significant the interest the state has is the more latitude it has in discriminating against religion.
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2601.581,2601.814,No.
2003.02-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2602.269,2603.384,"I hope you don't, yeah."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2603.384,2603.839,No.
2003.02-1315,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2605.896,2607.382,May I ask...  ask you a broader question?
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2618.2,2619.892,The play in the joints as it's referred to.
2003.02-1315,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2619.892,2620.513,Yeah.
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2620.513,2636.86,"I...  I think the play in the joints gives the state broad flexibility in establishing the programs and...  or not establishing a program at all, but to use the play in the joints to not accommodate religion but rather to target religion as an exclusion I think is a misuse in my view of what the Court has at this point..."
2003.02-1315,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2636.86,2637.603,"Give me an example, any example."
2003.02-1315,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.603,2646.148,"But do you go so far as to contend that any violation, any time there is no violation of the Establishment Clause that then the Free Exercise Clause would necessarily kick in?"
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2646.148,2647.345,"No, absolutely not."
2003.02-1315,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2648.254,2649.535,But that's what I was looking for.
2003.02-1315,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2649.535,2651.969,"Do you want to reserve the rest of your time, Mr. Sekulow?"
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2651.969,2657.17,"I don't have...  I only have 20 minutes, so I cannot reserve any more time."
2003.02-1315,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2659.628,2669.992,"If...  if you can give me an example of a case where the state can say we know we can give this funding to religious schools if we want to, but we don't want to?"
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2674.533,2674.988,Sure.
2003.02-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2699.303,2708.963,"No, but if they opened it up at all, there was no play in the joints between the religion clauses that said you can't open it up to this particular religious presentation."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2710.782,2711.442,"No, I think that..."
2003.02-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2711.442,2712.723,So I think...  let me just...
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2712.723,2713.178,Please.
2003.02-1315,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2713.178,2725.56,"say what I think your position is and then you...  I think your position is that, although certain religious funding may not violate the Establishment Clause, it does not follow that the state must fund it."
2003.02-1315,1,32911,jay_sekulow,,2738.896,2761.969,"Under the latter hypothetical, that...  that would be our position, that once you have gone into the private schools and the school meets the neutral secular criteria, our view would be at that point the state should be equal and not target out religion for an exclusion, which is precisely the viewpoint neutrality issue that we think should apply and, of course, within the free exercise context, the minimum requirement of neutrality is law not discriminate on its face."
2003.02-1315,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2764.652,2766.51,"Thank you, Mr. Sekulow."
2003.02-1315,3,37248,narda_pierce,,3383.591,3389.535,I would like to return to three points.
2003.02-1315,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3416.496,3422.152,But we've held in Witters that there is no problem with that...  with that kind...  with that kind of subsidy.
2003.02-1315,3,37248,narda_pierce,,3422.152,3424.465,For purposes of the Establishment Clause.
2003.02-1315,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3558.788,3560.274,It...  it...  it will fund religious instruction.
