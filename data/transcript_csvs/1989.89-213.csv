1989.89-213,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.67,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-213, Pennsylvania v. Muniz."
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,65.025,67.977,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1989.89-213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,144.81,149.112,"Mr. Eakin, may I ask you, are these regular... is this the routine that's followed with everyone?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,149.112,149.762,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,149.762,153.916,"Is it pursuant to regulation, or is it just this particular police department that does this?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,153.916,162.522,"Well, this is the county, which encompasses probably State Police, several military installations and 20-odd local departments."
1989.89-213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,175.346,180.631,"You said they always do it the same just by custom, not by... no written regulation requires this procedure?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,180.631,182.583,"--No, sir, not by law or regulation."
1989.89-213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,182.583,186.635,What would happen if a... if an individual said I won't do it?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,186.635,199.211,"Well, the law, we feel, would allow the police to compel them to do it, but practically speaking there is no way you can compel a person to walk a line and get any useful information."
1989.89-213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,199.211,204.496,Does he... does he... does he violate any law if he says I will not recite the alphabet or I will not tell you my sixth birthday?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,204.496,205.531,"No, sir."
1989.89-213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,214.304,214.937,Right.
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,214.937,224.91,"But there's no penalty, excepting the breath test, which is the... the stage of the process that follows these sobriety tests is the breath test."
1989.89-213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.035,301.76,"Well, now one of... one of the questions asked at the processing stage was, I believe, what was the date of your sixth birthday."
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,301.76,302.779,"Yes, that's correct."
1989.89-213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,302.779,310.199,"Now, is that some kind of a routine question that's asked whenever the police think someone might have been drinking?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,310.199,313.885,It was asked routinely in Cumberland County at the time.
1989.89-213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,327.477,339.052,"Well, wouldn't the... the information given in the response be relevant on the question of whether the person had been drinking or not?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,339.052,339.452,Yes.
1989.89-213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,341.904,343.789,So it could be testimonial?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,343.789,349.224,"--No, no, ma'am, I don't believe it... it... it would be testimonial."
1989.89-213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,357.914,363.083,But whether he responds accurately or not is relevant?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,363.083,364.352,--That's correct.
1989.89-213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,364.352,368.471,And you would propose to offer it and use that against him?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,368.471,369.937,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1989.89-213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,383.747,386.616,Why isn't that a form of interrogation?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,386.616,389.718,--Because the goal is not to achieve testimonial evidence.
1989.89-213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,391.087,398.407,"Well, it certainly is to get evidence to use against the person to establish whether they've been drinking or not."
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,398.407,400.359,"--That's correct, just as walking the line--"
1989.89-213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,400.359,408.28,It's quite unlike asking the person for an address and a driver's license.
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,408.28,413.766,"--That's correct, but it is also unlike asking him how much did you have to drink."
1989.89-213,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,422.189,425.491,"Well, would he have a right to refuse to answer that question?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,426.926,432.914,"I suggest he probably would, just as he can refuse to answer any question."
1989.89-213,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,432.914,438.734,"Well, could you then put in evidence the fact that he refused to do the birthday calculation?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,438.734,442.52,"We would submit you can, because it is not aimed at testimonial--"
1989.89-213,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,442.52,448.507,"Well, so then he doesn't have the right to... to... to refuse to decline on Fifth Amendment grounds, at least."
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,448.507,455.51,--What he has... he has no right to be warned of the consequences of refusal.
1989.89-213,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,455.51,467.651,"No, he has... under your view he has no self-incrimination right not to answer that question, because if you say that he does then you can't introduce his refusal into evidence."
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,467.651,478.443,"As a practical... perhaps I'm speaking more as a practical matter than anything else, because to... to compel someone in that circumstance is... is practically impossible without intervention--"
1989.89-213,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,478.443,478.959,No.
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,486.465,490.084,--We would suggest he does not have a Fifth Amendment right not to answer the question.
1989.89-213,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,490.084,495.587,"Just as he doesn't, I suppose, in your view, to refuse to walk a line?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,495.587,496.154,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-213,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,496.154,499.606,Although neither one can actually be compelled in a police station.
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,499.606,499.939,Right.
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,504.676,511.83,Is there any challenge in this case to... I... I guess there is... to the introducing the videotape of the physical tests?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,511.83,517.083,"In this case, the Pennsylvania Supreme... Superior Court merely suppressed the audio portion."
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.709,530.161,"Well, how about in this case, in this case?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,530.161,532.228,--In this case it was merely the audio that was suppressed.
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.228,548.289,"Well, in... in... so the... the... the demonstration that he couldn't walk a straight line, that shows what the effect of alcohol is on his physical coordination, I suppose?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,548.289,551.591,"Well, to a degree it does."
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,579.642,581.075,What about this eye test?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,585.545,586.445,"--You can, yes."
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,591.449,593.132,And is that what happened in this case?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,593.132,593.882,--Yes.
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.734,597.186,And what does that show?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,597.186,603.09,"--It shows the eye tracking a stimulus, which in this case was a pencil, from side to side slowly--"
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.09,605.407,And is that supposed to show that he was drinking?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,605.407,605.84,"--Yes, sir."
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,605.84,606.209,Had been drinking?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,606.209,606.742,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.742,611.177,"So it shows... shows the alcohol, the effect of alcohol on his eye movement?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,611.177,612.613,That's correct.
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.613,619.35,Just like you... you say the... the birthday question shows the effect of alcohol on his mind?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,619.35,620.5,That's correct.
1989.89-213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,657.824,659.341,May I just ask this question?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,677.352,700.635,"It may be, Your Honor, but the goal of the testing is to establish a routine that gives the best possible evidence to the finder of fact, and the three standard tests developed by the Highway Safety Council are ones that have statistically been shown to correlate to a very high degree to persons over the legal limit."
1989.89-213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.635,718.429,"May I ask this question, too: if the issue were not whether the man was intoxicated, but say it was in a different kind of criminal proceeding and the issue were whether he was mentally competent to stand trial, or mentally competent to receive the death penalty, or something like that, would you say you could perform these tests without giving him warning?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,718.429,720.881,I think that would have to be on a case by case basis.
1989.89-213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,720.881,721.231,Why?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,735.308,752.935,"The case I think of is the Estelle case, where the psychiatrist in that case was using the substance of what was related to him rather than forming conclusions without regard to the substance of it."
1989.89-213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,763.827,773.933,"Sometimes that's true, but you could also have a case where you just want to find out how his mind works when he's asked to recite the alphabet and when he's asked about his sixth birthday and that sort of thing, I would think."
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,774.383,780.77,"--I think in those cases, Your Honor, it would be proper, because again, it's not testimonial in nature, it's demonstrative in nature."
1989.89-213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.77,791.81,"Suppose... suppose the issue is whether or not... or one of the issues in the case is whether or not he can speak Spanish, and the police officers start talking to him in Spanish to see if he responds."
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,796.112,804.785,"In that case, I believe it would be proper because you're not asking for a specific fact in his mind, but merely a--"
1989.89-213,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,804.785,811.224,"And his answer, in your view, is not used to incriminate him, based on his knowledge?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,811.224,817.628,"--It would be to incriminate him, but not because of the contents of his mind, just as in the Dionisio case, where--"
1989.89-213,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,817.628,819.128,How do you know Spanish?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,824.716,841.827,"--The ability to speak Spanish certainly is contained in the mind, but if the court, as you have, have allowed us to take voice exemplars, or to speak at a line-up, the language in which you speak is equally as nonintrusive."
1989.89-213,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,841.827,861.241,"Suppose this defendant is very nervous, and he... what he does is, he takes his existing age and he subtracts six, and then he takes that number and subtracts it from today's date, and he comes out wrong either because he doesn't quite do it right, or because he misses a month."
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,865.993,871.029,"I'd suggest it's admissible, but certainly the weight of it is something that is always--"
1989.89-213,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,871.029,874.214,Would he have to get onto the stand to explain how he did it and why he made the mistake?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,874.214,883.004,"--The same as he can get on the stand to explain why he didn't walk the line properly or balance properly, or anything else, he can get on to explain why--"
1989.89-213,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,883.004,895.045,"Well, it seems to me it's qualitatively different, because you're asking him to perform a mental feat that requires verbal articulation, and that's what the Fifth Amendment is designed to protect against."
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,895.045,927.23,"--Well, the cases have clearly stated that if the purpose is to get the contents of the mind, that's one thing, but the processes of the brain in being able to do basic math or recite the alphabet or things that are not in and of themselves indicative of the contents of the mind of an individual relative to what they're looking for, that is different and ought to be maintained as different."
1989.89-213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,934.336,940.324,That's because the Fifth Amendment is concerned with testimonial communication.
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,944.376,945.311,--There might be a--
1989.89-213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,945.311,958.701,Don't you think the question is one that the police would reasonably expect would result in an incriminating response under these circumstances?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,958.701,962.57,--Only in the same level as they would expect it--
1989.89-213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,962.57,965.891,There was every indication this person had been drinking.
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,977.865,984.436,"--Just as they knew when he would walk the line he was likely to incriminate himself in that manner, but not in a testimonial sense."
1989.89-213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,984.436,986.888,But that's not an interrogation.
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,986.888,987.905,It's not an interrogation--
1989.89-213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,987.905,988.738,And this is.
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,988.738,993.642,--It's not because it's not testimonial; it is physical.
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1020.692,1023.978,Was he asked to recite the alphabet?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1023.978,1026.363,"No, not in this case."
1989.89-213,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1035.952,1042.807,"Mr. Eakin, there is this difference between this case and the other nontestimonial cases that you talk about."
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1079.814,1081.516,"No, I don't--"
1989.89-213,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.516,1082.499,You don't acknowledge that?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1087.336,1088.07,"--No, sir."
1989.89-213,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1095.04,1095.776,How do you show it?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1108.25,1109.817,--I'd suggest it is the same.
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.817,1111.536,Doesn't it come from the brain?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1111.536,1126.211,"It all comes from the brain, and what we're trying to show is not how old he was, what year he was six... that's the content of the mind... but it's the inability to arrive at that conclusion, which is a process of the brain, that is affected by alcohol."
1989.89-213,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.221,1147.923,I don't consider walking a line the content of the mind.
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1156.213,1156.613,That's correct.
1989.89-213,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1157.129,1173.74,"This is the only kind of a situation I know of in which you are... to be sure, you don't want the content for its own sake, but you do want the content of the mind as a means of showing something else, and that differs from all these other testimonial situations, it seems to me, or nontestimonial situations."
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1173.74,1179.144,"Well, I certainly respect that distinction if you see one, Your Honor, but I--"
1989.89-213,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1179.144,1188.6,You can give me another case where we have used the content of the mind in the sense of ideas.
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1188.6,1202.009,"--Again, I fall back, as Justice White says, that taking nine steps physically, taking nine steps mentally, neither discloses facts that that individual knows."
1989.89-213,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1226.792,1228.744,That's his ability to move his lips.
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1250.824,1270.321,"Well, it is different in that sense, I agree, but I would suggest that the mere fact that the test is an oral one rather than a physical one, strictly physical, is not the basis for the Court's distinction between testimonial and demonstrative evidence... it never has been, I'd suggest never should be."
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.293,1335.812,Didn't they explain the test to him?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1338.031,1340.816,"--They explained every test to him, and his responses--"
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1340.816,1342.584,"And they say, do you understand?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1342.584,1343.084,--That's correct.
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1343.084,1349.571,"And he says no, I don't understand, and they have a big long talk about it?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1349.571,1350.288,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1350.288,1354.475,"Now, you say that that is all just spontaneous?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1354.475,1358.177,"Well, it is not the result of interrogation, even if it is his testimony."
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1358.177,1359.277,"Well, it says, do you understand?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1359.277,1359.796,That's correct.
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.796,1362.062,"Well, isn't that interrogation?"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1362.062,1381.143,"Well, I suppose it's... if it is interrogation, it is certainly fairer interrogation than having the test run and then having him complain that he did not understand and that's why he didn't do it, particularly in this case, where Spanish is in fact the gentleman's first language, English his second language."
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1385.927,1386.363,That may be.
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1390.565,1395.802,"--No, it is not aimed at gaining testimonial evidence, again."
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.802,1398.171,But it was testimonial evidence.
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1398.171,1399.971,"Well, the result... if it is--"
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.971,1404.075,Wasn't it?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1404.075,1406.508,--If he expressed confusion--
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1406.508,1407.877,Wasn't it... the result testimonial?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1407.877,1409.41,--The result was testimonial.
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.81,1460.328,What words do they use when they ask them to walk the line?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1465.33,1471.1,"--It's... well, they ask them to come to the end, and say, I'm going to indicate to you now how I want you to do this."
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1483.075,1486.627,He kept saying the reason I can't is because I've had too much to drink?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1486.627,1504.44,"No, he didn't say that."
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.783,1523.568,"Well, you don't need to forego the physical evidence."
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1528.822,1529.439,--That's correct.
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.687,1563.729,What is the... how much damage do you suppose that would... would be done to the program if you had to give Miranda warnings as soon as you got him to... to the station house?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1563.729,1577.037,"--I think the damage is shown by the Thompson case in Pennsylvania, one of the superior court's line of cases, where they did, in response to the decision in this case, give Miranda warnings at the outset."
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.95,1602.62,"Well, is that... that... is... is that all... is that... you just have that one instance, or is there... is there some--"
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1602.62,1604.972,That's one instance that's found its way to the appellate courts.
1989.89-213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1632.623,1642.995,--Is the... is the... is the experience... is it the experience in your state that... that successful prosecution of drunk driving cases is really difficult... very difficult?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1642.995,1645.514,--Not with the booking cases.
1989.89-213,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1668.177,1671.395,How much relies upon the breathalyzer?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1671.395,1675.616,Pennsylvania has a per se rule if the test is over a.10.
1989.89-213,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1685.305,1686.855,But it was found to be effective?
1989.89-213,0,30195,j_michael_eakin,,1686.855,1687.257,"Oh, yes."
1989.89-213,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1693.328,1694.711,"Very well, Mr. Eakin."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1701.832,1704.284,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1989.89-213,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1757.65,1760.952,"How do you define ""testimonial""?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1760.952,1771.577,"I would define ""testimonial"" as anything that would disclose the contents of someone's mind either directly... either a direct confession or the inferences... inferences from the words themselves."
1989.89-213,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1771.577,1776.898,"Well, how about asking the person the name and address?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1776.898,1782.283,"Well, in some circumstances the name and address may not be testimonial."
1989.89-213,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1812.071,1825.045,"So you think here every single question that was put to this... to your client was interrogation, and Miranda warnings were required before even asking the name and address?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1825.045,1835.936,"Especially under the facts of this case, Your Honor, because not only had the police officer obtained this information at roadside, but the booking officer had obtained this information before they went on videotape."
1989.89-213,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1835.936,1843.856,"Well, but you would take the position that it was required at roadside as well, that nothing could be asked--"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1843.856,1844.506,"Well, at roadside--"
1989.89-213,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1844.506,1846.192,--before giving Miranda warning.
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1846.192,1854.898,"--At roadside he would not yet be in custody, and the very first thing the officer normally does as he begins his investigation would be your name, address, driver's license--"
1989.89-213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1854.898,1856.6,"He stopped him, didn't he?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1856.6,1856.949,--Excuse me?
1989.89-213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.949,1858.532,"He stopped him, didn't he?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1858.532,1862.503,"The man was at the side of the road, and the police officer stopped, and then he pulled off and the officer stopped him."
1989.89-213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.503,1863.236,So they stopped him?
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1863.236,1863.886,Yes.
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.886,1868.138,"Well, what about if after he stopped they asked him to walk a line?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1868.138,1874.477,"If he has not yet been arrested, he wouldn't be in custody, and this Court's decision in Berkemer would control and--"
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1874.477,1883.25,Supposing he was in custody or he had been arrested and they then ask him to walk a line?
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1883.25,1885.383,--Is that permissible?
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1885.383,1885.783,Yes.
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1892.439,1894.289,"That's not the issue in this case, Your Honor."
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1894.289,1897.825,"It may not be, but I'm very interested in your answer to the question."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1897.825,1906.478,"I think... I think that under some circumstances that could also be testimonial; if, for example, it discloses the man's inability to follow instructions."
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1926.475,1931.296,Because it discloses what you refer to as the contents of his mind?
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1931.296,1931.729,Yes.
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1937.616,1944.286,"Do you... do you regard that as a satisfactorily precise phrase, disclosing the contents of one's mind?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1944.286,1950.423,"Well, not exactly, and it's... it's hard to come up with a precise phrase because the other cases don't deal exactly with this issue."
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1960.748,1965.719,How about the voice exemplar cases and the handwriting sample cases?
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1970.254,1985.613,"In those cases, the person who is giving the sample is not trying to communicate anything to the person he's giving the sample to, nor are the... are the law enforcement authorities attempting to get communication."
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1992.869,1997.071,But it does take brain activity to produce that.
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,1997.071,1998.19,It takes some brain activity.
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2012.414,2017.735,"Well, there's certainly an intention to convey an idea."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2018.937,2019.404,--Convey.
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.542,2033.946,"--Well, what if... what if... what if you ask me to give a writing sample, and I write"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2039.683,2049.956,"That's right, and I do not think that, under my understanding of this Court's past decisions, that that would not be permissible because that discloses rather than you giving me a sentence,"
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2062.197,2077.356,"So the handwriting sample cases depend upon whether or not the defendant is told what to write, which is all right, or said write anything you want, which is not all right?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2077.356,2078.408,I would submit that's correct.
1989.89-213,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2091.033,2098.722,So would it be all right here to ask the defendant to recite the alphabet?
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2098.722,2106.209,"It would not because it would involve his intellectual capacity to put the letters together, to remember what comes after B."
1989.89-213,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2106.209,2106.575,No.
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2109.411,2115.331,"Except that if he forgets how to write the sentence, he can look on the paper and see it to write it."
1989.89-213,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2155.808,2157.594,"May I... may I question that, Mr. Maffett?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2191.565,2196.867,"The... but the function of the mind is an element of... of this offense, and by asking the man to--"
1989.89-213,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2196.867,2200.837,"Well, sure, but it might be a function of... but I don't know how that advances the argument."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2200.837,2213.078,"--Well, but by asking the man to calculate the date of his sixth birthday, unlike walking the straight line, he then is disclosing information that incriminates him from his mouth, from his thought process as opposed to his--"
1989.89-213,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2213.078,2216.513,"Well, it's from his mind but he's showing how his mind works."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2219.882,2225.202,"--That's correct, and I would argue that that is protected by the Fifth Amendment."
1989.89-213,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2239.046,2246.716,That conclusion rested in part on how the mind worked and in part on the facts that were revealed during the discussion with the psychiatrist.
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2248.735,2249.185,--Yes.
1989.89-213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2264.427,2292.097,"Well, on that basis I... I would suppose that if you ask him what's his... what's your age and he answers and he slurs, you could use... you could use the information he gave you, how old you are, but you couldn't show on videotape or have the... have the audio part showing that he slurred because that shows how he's speaking, how his mind is letting his tongue work."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2292.097,2298.417,"I would agree, Your Honor, and part of the problem is that sometimes you have a combination of testimonial--"
1989.89-213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.417,2302.969,So you could get a voice exemplar except that it couldn't include a slurring?
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2302.969,2316.129,"--Well, part of the problem particularly in a situation where the intoxication is the crime, you get a situation where you have a mixture of physical and testimonial in the same thing."
1989.89-213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.554,2332.572,"So the slurring is inadmissible, in your view?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2338.476,2340.609,"I would submit that it is, Your Honor."
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2340.609,2341.511,And... and--
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2341.511,2343.844,"Again, that's not the situation here, but--"
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.844,2351.134,--For the same reason that walking... that an ability to walk a line would be inadmissible in your view?
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2351.134,2358.603,"--Well, again, inability to walk a line... the problem becomes that there are both physical and testimonial aspects."
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2365.043,2373.447,"But let's just take the typical situation where he's told to walk a line, shown how, and in the view of the police, doesn't succeed."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2379.351,2379.667,That's--
1989.89-213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2379.667,2384.785,"Is that admissible, in your view, how... how he walked that line?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2385.737,2388.121,"--Is... is his inability to do it, that he doesn't follow the--"
1989.89-213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2388.121,2388.939,"Well, use the video."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2388.939,2390.623,"--does it perfect, but falls off the line."
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2390.623,2397.379,You're doing... he's... the police simply say you didn't walk a straight line.
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2400.83,2405.032,"That would be much closer to strictly physical, and so, would be... would be permitted."
1989.89-213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2411.619,2415.423,"It's not... I mean, it's physical, but a mind is a physical thing."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2423.427,2424.362,That... that's true.
1989.89-213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2432.802,2434.402,It means the inability of his mind.
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2436.087,2437.387,--That... that's correct.
1989.89-213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2437.387,2453.113,"But you... you... you wouldn't limit your... your... you know, the Constitution, just to mention it, does... does say that... that what we're talking about here is compelling a person in a criminal case to be a witness against himself."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2470.341,2473.61,Yes and... and ideas are involved in this case.
1989.89-213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2487.186,2490.304,"Yeah, but you're now saying that might have been a mistake."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2504.231,2507.016,I think that you... you'd have to go on a case-by-case basis.
1989.89-213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2507.716,2508.466,I'm sure.
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2508.466,2520.074,"--Well, if... because, if it's... you get the combination of the physical and testimonial and unless... if I think of a specific instance, then I can say, well, I... I believe this to be physical or testimonial."
1989.89-213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2557.616,2559.466,And I... I don't know that that's right.
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2559.466,2560.418,Well--
1989.89-213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2560.418,2567.388,"I mean, I guess in the same way you can say when you give a voice exemplar, you're trying to communicate my voice sounds like this."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2572.375,2581.581,"--But with the voice... with the voice exemplar, again, the individual is merely asked to... to repeat a... a phrase or a sentence, or whatever it is."
1989.89-213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2581.581,2588.385,"Communicating my voice sounds like this as much as your client would be communicating, you know, I can control my feet."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2588.385,2595.658,"Well, the exemplar cases have always been for the identity of the person, rather than the... the elements of the crime itself."
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2595.658,2602.912,"Why should that make any difference, when we're talking about the availability of the privilege against self-incrimination?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2602.912,2619.023,"Because identification is not... the... the physical identification... as Justice Scalia said, the Fifth Amendment... the Fifth Amendment protects the person from being a witness against themselves."
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2623.908,2630.295,"Well, but that's because the cases have said identification in this sense is not testimonial."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2634.783,2638.401,"But... but if you identify me, that doesn't help you to convict me."
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2650.959,2669.937,"Well, but if... if we know that a person with a certain kind of handwriting forged this check, and it turns out that you have... required by the grand jury to give a handwriting example, or have that kind of handwriting, that is very obviously a link in the prosecution's case against you."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2669.937,2670.206,It--
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2670.206,2675.991,"So that if... if it were testimonial, you would surely have a right to object."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2675.991,2678.893,"--It... it is a link in the case, but... but it's not the case."
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2682.097,2688.501,You... you say the difference in it is whether it's just a link in the case as opposed to the case?
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2688.501,2698.439,"--Well... and a person's identity is always a link in the case, because even if you have really strong proof, if you don't have the... who the... if you can't prove who it was, you don't have a case."
1989.89-213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2809.197,2826.372,"You really... you really think that there was a finding that these were actually compelled, or just that there was... it was equivalent to in... in-custody interrogation that would demand Miranda warnings?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2826.372,2828.491,There was a finding that his--
1989.89-213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2828.491,2836.264,"All of... all the... all the... all that would needed to have happened, as I understand it, was that the Miranda warnings should have been given first?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2836.264,2837.297,"--That... that's right, Your Honor."
1989.89-213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2965.13,2971.284,Did you object to introducing what happened at the roadside?
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2971.284,2973.251,"No, I did not, Your Honor."
1989.89-213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2973.251,2978.855,"So, anything that... any of the tests there were admissable?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,2978.855,2979.807,That... that's correct.
1989.89-213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.078,3150.082,"xxx statements during the testing, the so-called voluntary statements during the testing?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,3154.219,3162.306,"Well, I think most of the statements during the testing were... again, he was trying to show, to communicate that he was not intoxicated, because he said things like,"
1989.89-213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3178.985,3183.738,"The audio of all of that was excluded, wasn't it?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,3183.738,3185.305,"--Yes, it was."
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3209.037,3215.358,"Well, he didn't think that the tests he was given had some bearing on whether he would be held?"
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,3215.358,3220.429,"--He may have, but as far as his words, I can't tell you."
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3233.069,3241.658,"Well, it could just as well have meant he thought the police would not distort the results, they would be even-handed, not that they weren't doing anything to build a case against him."
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,3241.658,3246.479,I suppose that's another fair inference.
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3289.306,3294.191,Is Cumberland County just to the west of Dauphin County?
1989.89-213,1,40063,richard_f_maffett_jr,,3299.328,3299.995,They're very close.
1989.89-213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3389.755,3390.921,"Thank you, Mr. Maffett."
