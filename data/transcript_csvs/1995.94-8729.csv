1995.94-8729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.719,We'll hear argument next in Number 94-8729... the spectators are admonished not to talk until you get out of the courtroom.
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,19.214,20.586,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,51.254,61.303,"Mr. Herpel, will you tell us what the record shows was the nature of the ownership in the automobile in question?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,61.303,65.843,The record shows that the vehicle was co-owned.
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,67.095,75.971,"What kind of ownership under State law, joint with right of survivorship, cotenants, what was it?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,75.971,76.521,"--Your Honor, I--"
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,76.521,76.93,Do we know?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,76.93,87.349,--It's a heavily regulated area and I attempted to ascertain which common law joint property interest this most closely resembled.
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,90.31,90.871,You can't tell us?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,90.871,93.142,--I believe it's close to a tenant in common.
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,93.142,95.684,How was the automobile titled?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,95.684,98.817,"The automobile was titled in their name, but there's no--"
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.817,99.748,In both names--
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,99.748,100.068,--Yes.
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.068,100.426,--or one name?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,100.426,101.748,In both names.
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,101.748,108.232,"In Michigan law, can one co-owner dispose of good title to the automobile?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,108.232,113.214,"I believe that that is true, Your Honor, that... not for the entire automobile."
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.995,114.686,The entire automobile.
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,114.686,114.987,--No.
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.006,117.548,Could one owner dispose of it?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,117.548,120.19,"--I do not believe so, Justice O'Connor."
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,120.19,127.043,"But you can't give us any citations or anything like that, or any place in the record where we could ascertain the nature of the ownership."
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,127.043,129.356,"I'm sorry, I cannot, Your Honor, but--"
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,129.356,140.333,"Well, it makes it very difficult, doesn't it, to decide this case when we don't know the nature of the ownership or what rights a single co-owner would have."
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,140.333,150.45,"--Well, I think it... I'm quite certain that the sole co-owner does not have the right to sell the entire vehicle."
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,156.743,160.916,You can't give us a case or a statute or anything of that sort?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,160.916,161.657,--I cannot.
1995.94-8729,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,161.657,162.258,No.
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,192.078,194.999,"That much I'm quite sure of, Your Honor."
1995.94-8729,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,194.999,196.221,So what kind of an assumption should we make?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,198.242,206.189,"Well, I think that they clearly made an assumption that she had a separately protectable interest in this car, for which--"
1995.94-8729,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,206.189,217.408,"So you're saying even if she had, it was just like totally separate property under Michigan law, she has under Michigan law something that's a 50-percent separate interest, whatever that might mean--"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,217.408,219.228,"--Yes, I would say--"
1995.94-8729,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,219.228,220.3,"--Well, I'm looking for the same thing."
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,221.931,224.262,"--Again, I would analogize it to a tenancy in common."
1995.94-8729,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,224.262,225.924,Like a tenancy in common.
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,225.924,231.707,"She had the interest that one joint owner in a tenancy in common would have, or one tenant."
1995.94-8729,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,231.707,235.36,Does one usually hold cars by tenancy in common?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,265.378,271.391,"No, Justice Ginsburg, we're not contending that the State has no power to forfeit the vehicle."
1995.94-8729,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,279.759,287.594,"Well then, why can't... but you're not saying it would be enough to give her whatever pittance was left from this sale after administrative expenses."
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,287.594,311.77,"Well, I would... we would contend, Your Honor, that so-called administrative expenses, attorney's fees, prosecutorial attorney fees and court costs, Detroit police costs, are not properly assessable against her interest, that that... as a matter of constitutional law that it is improper to assess those costs against her--"
1995.94-8729,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,311.77,317.875,Is it all right for the State to say this vehicle is a public nuisance because of its use?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,317.875,326.45,"--Well, the court... the court certainly exceeded traditional notions of what constitutes a public nuisance."
1995.94-8729,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,326.45,334.116,"But didn't it... suppose it had been his car entirely, couldn't they have... would there have been anything unconstitutional about the forfeiture?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,334.116,339.369,"I don't think the Court has to find that in this case, Your Honor."
1995.94-8729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,339.369,346.743,"We've held in any number of cases that there's not, that something that's used in the course of committing a felony can be forfeited."
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,346.743,366.698,"I agree, Your Honor, and I only hesitated because the Michigan supreme court applied an extremely novel interpretation of nuisance law, but I don't want to be sidetracked on that issue, because the focus here is on the forfeitability of her interest in the car."
1995.94-8729,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,366.698,379.725,"Just before we get too far away from the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, if the State can forfeit the husband's interest and in your position it has to remit to the wife her interest... I take it that's your position."
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,379.725,381.468,"Yes, it is, Justice Kennedy."
1995.94-8729,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,381.468,393.124,"Does the State have to compensate the wife for the loss of use of the property, her portion of the property while the forfeiture proceedings are being conducted?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,393.124,404.912,"Your Honor, I guess that gest into the issue of whether pre-hearing seizure is appropriate, which is not presented in this case."
1995.94-8729,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,419.952,425.586,But doesn't that indicate the necessity of having a forfeiture provision such as this?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,425.586,429.758,"I'm afraid I don't understand your question, Justice Kennedy."
1995.94-8729,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,429.758,450.361,"Well, if the most efficient way, if the only efficient way for the State to enforce its laws, let's say, is to forfeit the offending vehicle, then the forfeiture system is adequate, and all you're asking for is that the wife's financial interest in the automobile represented by her half of the equity be returned to her, is that your position?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,450.361,453.383,"That's the position that we're taking in this case, Your Honor."
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,453.383,457.626,And in this case it's a 1977 automobile?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,457.626,459.037,"That is correct, Justice--"
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,459.037,460.389,What kind of automobile?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,460.389,462.058,--It was a Pontiac sedan.
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,462.058,467.053,"And so her interest would be about what, would you say?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,467.053,475.547,"Well, presumptively it would be 50 percent of the resale value of the car."
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,490.608,492.959,And how much was paid for it?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,494.311,495.04,--$600.
1995.94-8729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,495.04,498.984,So we're talking about a claim of $300 for her.
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,498.984,501.014,"Yes, at least $300."
1995.94-8729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,501.014,509.69,"Mr. Herpel, you referred to your client as an innocent owner, and how do you define innocent owner for these purposes?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,509.69,527.261,"Well, Your Honor, there are... we propose a standard for defining innocence that we term the negligent entrustment standard, which focuses on whether the owner knew or should have known of the impending illegal use."
1995.94-8729,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,546.405,559.422,"Well, let's assume the standard is negligence, what could she have done... what if she knew in this case that her husband was likely to resort to prostitutes using the car, would she have had a right to stop him from using it?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,559.422,562.343,"Well, I think the standard that we advocate--"
1995.94-8729,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,562.343,564.537,"Well, would she have had a right to stop him from using it?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,564.537,568.059,"--Not post entrustment, Your Honor."
1995.94-8729,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,568.059,569.699,"Well, she didn't have to entrust it."
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,570.671,574.474,But if the time of entrustment is deemed to be the time--
1995.94-8729,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,574.474,575.773,Why is there an entrustment?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,577.025,582.932,--I agree that after the creation of the joint property interest there formally can be no entrustment.
1995.94-8729,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,582.932,583.379,Okay.
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,591.945,593.086,That's correct.
1995.94-8729,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,593.086,596.669,What should she have done in order to satisfy a negligence standard?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,604.974,605.555,Are we assuming--
1995.94-8729,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,605.555,610.169,"--I... if we're going to have a negligence standard, does... how would it be applied here?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,610.169,615.272,"--Well, Your Honor, if I may, I'd just like to digress briefly that the focus--"
1995.94-8729,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,615.272,615.713,Briefly.
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,615.713,623.109,"--is on the time of entrustment, which in a joint ownership situation I think would be deemed the time the joint property interest is created."
1995.94-8729,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,623.817,628.872,"If she should have known at that time that he was a scoundrel, that would suffice?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,629.731,630.322,--Yes.
1995.94-8729,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,634.035,637.387,Specifically the impending illegal use.
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,644.143,648.434,"--Justice Scalia, I think it should be specific to the illegal use--"
1995.94-8729,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,648.434,648.985,Wow.
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,648.985,650.455,--that gives rise to the forfeiture under the statute.
1995.94-8729,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,650.455,659.872,"All right, but in any case, in this case is there any evidence in the record that she knew at the time the purchase... the car was purchased that he might use it in this fashion?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,659.872,661.692,"No, to the contrary."
1995.94-8729,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,661.692,678.885,"So your position is going to be, if you win this case, that that's the end of the case, that there's no evidence of negligence at that time, and therefore what she may have learned, even if she had known post purchase, would be irrelevant, and that that's the end of the case."
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,680.284,681.877,Certainly that's true in this case--
1995.94-8729,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,681.877,682.635,Yes.
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,682.635,692.953,"--because the record shows that there is no knowledge at any time up until the time of illegal use, but I... you know, the Court could pose cases, hypotheticals--"
1995.94-8729,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,692.953,693.234,Right.
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,693.234,695.815,--that if somebody acquired knowledge after entrustment--
1995.94-8729,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,695.815,697.416,May I ask you a different question?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,731.048,734.241,--I would think it can be taken.
1995.94-8729,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,741.805,734.241,What should she have done?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,742.947,746.73,"Well, if she had--"
1995.94-8729,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.73,748.899,"Easy come, easy go is your answer to that one, I think, isn't it?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,749.75,751.761,"--It could well be, Justice Scalia."
1995.94-8729,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,753.153,754.613,You answered the question.
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,777.468,786.804,"--Well, I guess it depends on how good a bargain they struck initially, Your Honor, but certainly that $600 is evidence of its value."
1995.94-8729,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,789.766,796.15,"So when you said at least $600, or at least $300, that means you're assuming they made a good... a very good bargain."
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,796.15,805.747,"--Well, I guess what I was referring to there, Your Honor, is I think in a tenancy in common situation, which I analogize this to, there's a presumption--"
1995.94-8729,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,805.747,806.497,Why don't you say joint tenancy?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,808.68,817.575,--Because I don't believe there are rights of survivorship that attach under the Michigan automobile registration statute.
1995.94-8729,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,817.575,837.167,"Suppose that a State had a statute which said that any registered owner of an automobile is absolutely liable for damages that the automobile does in a collision, and the husband gets in a collision, is the wife subject to liability consistently with the Constitution?"
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,837.167,847.595,"Well, I think the Court has taken for granted the constitutionality of the co-called civil liability statutes for automobile owners."
1995.94-8729,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,847.595,849.846,Why should this case be different?
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,849.846,853.118,"It's different in two critical respects, Justice Kennedy."
1995.94-8729,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,884.117,885.949,"Well, the State's the one that passed the statute."
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,899.717,915.158,"The liability is greater, Your Honor, and there is State action, the kind recognized in Shelley v. Kraemer and New York Times v. Sullivan, but I think that that is really a... this type of State action is quite a bit different."
1995.94-8729,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,924.006,926.318,We're asking about the validity of the statute.
1995.94-8729,0,41458,stefan_b_herpel,,945.418,952.494,"--Well, again, I'd emphasize, Your Honor, that that statute does not impose punishment, and more importantly--"
1995.94-8729,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,952.494,953.853,"Ah, so it's punishment."

1995.94-8729,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1916.699,1922.573,"If she is simply a common owner as against the other common owner, I assume she does not have any right to control."
1995.94-8729,1,35013,larry_l_roberts,,1922.573,1923.094,That's correct.
1995.94-8729,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1923.094,1925.024,So control is irrelevant on your theory.
1995.94-8729,1,35013,larry_l_roberts,,1925.024,1928.867,"Control in... that's true, as Justice Stevens and Justice--"
1995.94-8729,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1928.867,1938.434,"So does your theory... if there's no right to control as an element of your theory, is your theory basically the kind of antique theory that this is the guilty object?"
1995.94-8729,1,35013,larry_l_roberts,,1938.434,1941.327,--That may... that is part of the theory.
1995.94-8729,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1942.486,1943.227,What else?
1995.94-8729,1,35013,larry_l_roberts,,1943.227,1946.91,"--Well, the object is the method whereby the nuisance conduct was committed."
1995.94-8729,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1958.446,1959.696,"Well, that's what makes it a nuisance."
1995.94-8729,1,35013,larry_l_roberts,,1959.696,1964.03,"--And as an individual committing certain types of conduct, which is the nuisance, in that--"
1995.94-8729,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1964.03,1982.263,"Right, but you're saying once the object has been used to create the nuisance, your right to require... your right to go after it on a forfeiture proceeding rests, in essence, on the theory that it is a guilty object in the old common law sense, the deodand sense."
1995.94-8729,1,35013,larry_l_roberts,,1982.263,1991.339,"--A guilty object in the sense that the conduct that the law is aimed at abating was committed with the use of that, be it in or... the vehicle perhaps takes, taking an individual--"
1995.94-8729,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1991.339,1994.361,If it's a stolen vehicle... suppose it's a stolen vehicle?
1995.94-8729,1,35013,larry_l_roberts,,1994.361,1998.432,"--Then that would be outside the scope of this, and that was mentioned in the Michigan supreme court opinion in this matter."
1995.94-8729,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1998.432,2000.945,How about a car rental... a car rental?
1995.94-8729,1,35013,larry_l_roberts,,2000.945,2003.567,"Again, then we would get to the point of control."
1995.94-8729,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2003.567,2005.097,"The rental car, and--"
1995.94-8729,1,35013,larry_l_roberts,,2005.097,2005.518,Car rental.
1995.94-8729,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2005.518,2012.912,--Under your theory the State would take the car if the person renting the car committed the unlawful act in the car.
1995.94-8729,1,35013,larry_l_roberts,,2012.912,2015.766,"The State would take the car, but would not be able to forfeit the car--"
1995.94-8729,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2015.766,2016.494,Why not?
1995.94-8729,1,35013,larry_l_roberts,,2016.494,2025.56,"--The distinction is made at the stage whereby it's determined that the car is a rental car that the rental company had no control over, nor could they have been party to--"
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2901.567,2916.377,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-8729,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2944.995,2963.678,"So if the... going back to the argument that counsel on the other side made, if the co-owner did not know at the time of acquiring ownership that the property was likely to be used by the other co-owner for a criminal purpose, and subsequently learns it, there would be no right of control at that point."
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2970.711,2990.525,"That's correct, at that point in time, although we don't agree with the petitioner's suggestion of a negligent entrustment standard, because we think that it's unrealistic to focus simply on the point in time at which the property is transferred from one owner to another or the time at which the co-owner's property interest arises."
1995.94-8729,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2990.525,2998.069,"Mr. Seamon, where... I mean, as an original matter, if I were writing a statute I might well buy your, you know, all reasonable steps standard."
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3013.28,3014.63,The precise formulation--
1995.94-8729,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3014.63,3015.811,Do you find it somewhere in our cases?
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3015.811,3019.795,--The precise formulation comes from the suggestion in Calero-Toledo.
1995.94-8729,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3021.234,3026.057,From a dictum in... and that is enough to adopt it?
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3026.057,3030.189,"--No, it's not enough, and we don't believe that that's all that supports the all reasonable steps standard."
1995.94-8729,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3039.596,3043.52,"What history does that, when we've certainly done it with respect to vessels."
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3043.52,3057.729,"That's right, and even as long ago, however, as a case like Peisch v. Ware, Chief Justice Marshall wrote for the Court in 1808 that a property should not be forfeited when the owner of the property lacks the means to prevent the forfeiture."
1995.94-8729,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3067.603,3068.865,Was he speaking of constitutional law--
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3068.865,3069.446,--He was not speaking of--
1995.94-8729,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3069.446,3071.337,--or of equitable power to declare the forfeiture?
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3071.337,3074.288,--He was speaking in terms of longstanding principles.
1995.94-8729,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3074.799,3086.047,And in Goldsmith we upheld the forfeiture of a conditional vendor's interest in an automobile because the buyer who's driving it around used it for drugs.
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3086.047,3106.41,"--That's right, and we see two lines of cases, really, one of which includes Goldsmith, Grant, Van Oster, and Calero-Toledo itself, which recognizes that a property owner cannot avoid the forfeiture of property that's been used illegally merely by showing that she lacked knowledge or even reason to know of the illegal use."
1995.94-8729,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3118.628,3121.809,"They do that in dictum, whereas the other cases do it in holding, don't they?"
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3121.809,3122.571,--That's correct.
1995.94-8729,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3123.46,3124.552,It seems a rather significant distinction.
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3124.552,3125.874,--It is a significant distinction.
1995.94-8729,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3146.668,3183.741,"Mr. Seamons, one thing I don't understand is how you put together your test with your end result, because it seems to me that in many, many, perhaps most marital situations, a person in Tina Bennis' situation could do everything within her power to do, but the law gives the co-owner the right to use the car whenever and however he wants, so I don't see how the all reasonable steps would work out to the disfavor of someone in Tina Bennis' situation."
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3183.741,3185.413,--It may be that--
1995.94-8729,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3185.413,3186.593,She has no power over him.
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3191.085,3203.362,"--Our view of the result, I suppose, is in part based on presumptions about how the State law operates in terms of the degree of control that a joint owner can exercise over another owner."
1995.94-8729,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3221.645,3227.399,How is a Tina Bennis supposed to make sure that her spouse doesn't use a car this way?
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3227.399,3239.186,"--It's very difficult to know in the absence of knowing more about how much knowledge or reason to suspect that use she had, which is unclear to us on this record."
1995.94-8729,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3249.404,3256.978,"Would it have been a different case, in your view, if she had gotten on the witness stand and said, this all came as a very shocking surprise to me, I had no idea this was going on?"
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3256.978,3257.669,--Yes.
1995.94-8729,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3257.669,3258.891,That would be the difference.
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3258.891,3266.615,"Yes, but I would emphasize in answering the question that it has a lot to do with the nature of the offense involved here, which is I think another complication."
1995.94-8729,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3283.746,3288.918,"In this case, your office has taken the position we should affirm the judgment of the Michigan court--"
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3288.918,3289.859,--That's right.
1995.94-8729,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3289.859,3298.675,--despite this very troubling question about the wife's knowledge of her husband's activities and her ability to do anything about it.
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3298.675,3299.587,That's right.
1995.94-8729,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3305.361,3306.462,Let's see where we would go with it.
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3322.08,3326.174,--Our view of the proper disposition of this case is based--
1995.94-8729,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3326.174,3335.46,"Well, no, I'm talking about my case, the one in which she takes the stand and says, I knew he was doing it, but I didn't have any right to stop him from using the car, and let's further assume that as a co-owner in Michigan, she didn't."
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3335.46,3337.321,"--No, I'm sorry, that's not our position."
1995.94-8729,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3353.112,3357.514,"Well, is right to control the touchstone for determining what is reasonable?"
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3357.514,3359.854,It certainly is one of the foundations.
1995.94-8729,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3361.427,3361.777,Okay.
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3378.468,3379.67,"--No, not exactly."
1995.94-8729,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3385.353,3389.514,"Well, you're not taking the position that she affirmatively had to call the police."
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3400.162,3401.652,"--Well, I'd say there are two elements."
1995.94-8729,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3409.769,3411.149,But that gets us back to the control issue.
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3429.101,3436.406,"--On that point, I... we would expect property owners to notify the police if they know that the property is being--"
1995.94-8729,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3436.406,3439.776,So it's the position of the Solicitor General's Office that wives should call the police--
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3442.1,3444.451,"--Not in every case, but it is certainly one--"
1995.94-8729,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3447.033,3451.695,Don't let the laughter of clerks who have never even argued a case in a municipal court deter you from your answer.
1995.94-8729,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3451.695,3452.436,--Thank you.
1995.94-8729,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3486.479,3487.53,"Thank you, Mr. Seamon."
