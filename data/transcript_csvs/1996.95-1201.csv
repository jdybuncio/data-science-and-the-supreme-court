1996.95-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.267,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1201, Vicky Lopez v. Monterey County."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,64.503,65.385,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,65.385,65.735,Thank you.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,65.735,71.969,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,110.344,113.427,Do we know that section 5 necessarily applies here?
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,113.427,115.768,"Yes, it does apply."
1996.95-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,122.132,132.089,"But how about the fact this is basically a State statute, and Monterey, the State of California isn't covered?"
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,132.089,146.999,"We are dealing with county ordinances which have consolidated judicial districts starting back in 1969, the date after Monterey County was made subject to the section 5 preclearance provisions."
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.266,187.665,But I guess you stipulated with the county that it is impossible to prepare an election plan that doesn't conflict with State law and still comply with the Voting Rights Act.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,187.665,189.576,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.576,194.009,"And if that's the case, then how do you avoid challenging California State law?"
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,194.009,197.46,"Well, at this particular point, there are still--"
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.46,199.704,And how do you do that under section 5?
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,201.313,201.744,--Yes.
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.744,208.82,And I really would appreciate your addressing this inquiry that the Chief Justice also inquired about.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,208.82,217.915,"Although we are dealing with State statute, we are also dealing with county ordinances and a consolidations of judicial districts that occurred over a period of time."
1996.95-1201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,234.416,244.433,"Well, but if it is the State statute that is the operative law, I think it's just not a case where the Voting Rights Act applied."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,261.454,264.566,"That's correct, Your Honor, but--"
1996.95-1201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.566,266.075,So I don't know why it works the other way here.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,269.038,288.361,"--The reason why it doesn't work is because here, Monterey County has the authority to consolidate judicial districts, and it exercised that authority under State law, and so as a result of those consolidations, there were changes which had to be precleared under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act."
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,322.032,322.252,Mr.--
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,326.275,334.57,"It could, but it didn't in this particular case, and when we look at, say for example--"
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.57,336.641,"Well, I mean it either does or it doesn't."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,343.886,347.73,--The State laws that are under review in this particular case did not.
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.479,368.104,"So you take the position that the county, Monterey County was free to consolidate or not."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,368.104,368.692,--That is--
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,368.692,374.517,And what is challenged here was Monterey County's decision to consolidate.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,374.517,374.956,--That is correct.
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,374.956,378.509,"Which was not mandated, according to you, by State law."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,378.509,381.38,"Under the State laws that are under review, are not... they were not mandated."
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,381.38,388.146,And there has never been a determination that there is a substantive violation of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act?
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,388.146,389.197,That is correct.
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,426.4,427.63,"Well, it withdrew that suit, I guess."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,427.63,427.941,It did.
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,427.941,436.338,"It dropped the suit, and so that leaves us in a posture, as of now, there's been no finding of a substantive violation of section 5."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,436.338,437.287,That is correct.
1996.95-1201,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,437.287,447.925,"Mr. Avila, you're not making an alternative argument which I would have thought you would have made, and I'm beginning to think that I'm missing something or you would have made it, and the argument would be this."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,485.239,486.789,"Yes, it would, Your Honor."
1996.95-1201,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,493.673,495.674,"Well, I'm not talking about enabling it to take a course of action."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,511.677,512.628,"--That's correct, it would."
1996.95-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,512.628,517.909,"But you say that the State law authorized but didn't require consolidation, is that right?"
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,517.909,538.293,"The 1983 State statute was in essence based on a contingency of consolidation of three judicial districts which the county board of supervisors at that point authorized, and duly adopted an ordinance consolidating these three judicial districts, but--"
1996.95-1201,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,538.293,547.149,"Was the county free, after the enactment of the State statute and after consolidating, to go back to the preconsolidation regime?"
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,547.149,589.628,"--It was not free under State law to go back to the status quo ante, and the reason why is because the justice of the peace courts were eliminated in 1993 under a State proposition, and at the time of 1968, there were two municipal court districts and seven justice of the court... justice of the peace court districts, and to go back to that procedure was deemed to be unfeasible by the district court, and for that reason the district court found it compelling to issue an order to require an election based on an interim plan for the June 1995 election."
1996.95-1201,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,589.628,595.522,"And it was also true that there was a State statute that required countywide courts, isn't that correct?"
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,595.522,596.692,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1996.95-1201,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,596.692,603.416,"Isn't there also a statute, a State statute that requires that the courts be countywide, or am I wrong about that?"
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,603.416,610.83,"Under the State statutes and the constitution, State constitution, you could have a countywide municipal court district."
1996.95-1201,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,623.809,635.848,"Are there such counties in California where you have... unlike this county that now has just one district, are there counties in California that have multiple judicial districts?"
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,635.848,639.771,--There are some counties in California that do have multiple court judicial districts.
1996.95-1201,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,653.068,659.452,So the State law that we're dealing with that ratified or approved the consolidations is not part of a Statewide plan.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,669.829,670.4,--That's correct.
1996.95-1201,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,670.4,676.824,"But to the extent that California approved what had been done by the county, that's peculiar to this one covered county."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,676.824,680.157,The State statute specifically refers to Monterey County.
1996.95-1201,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,708.684,728.359,"As I take it, what this case presents to us is not the question so much what the court should have done, or might have done, but the question of whether what it did do was wrong, and you're saying what it did do was per se wrong."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,728.359,729.999,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1201,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,729.999,730.87,It was clear error.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,730.87,731.812,Clear error.
1996.95-1201,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,731.812,734.282,"Yes, and that's the only issue before us, I take it."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,738.904,740.664,That's precisely our point.
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,756.897,776.067,"Well, it's possible that the only thing before the court at the time it acted was the allegation that no preclearance had been obtained, and perhaps the only thing the court could do was just say, that's right, get it precleared."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,776.067,778.03,--Yes.
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,778.931,779.172,Nothing else.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,779.172,779.352,--That... no.
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,779.352,779.562,Nothing else.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,779.562,782.664,There were other alternatives that the district court could have explored.
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,782.664,784.106,"Well, I'm not sure there are."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,784.835,785.326,Well--
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,785.326,792.752,"I mean, at that stage, with no substantive violation of section 5, what more can the court do except say, okay, get preclearance?"
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,792.752,799.617,"--Well, for one thing the district court could have continued to extend the terms in order to permit the State--"
1996.95-1201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,799.617,801.256,"Well, even that isn't so clear, is it?"
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,801.256,811.933,"--Well, in this particular case the district court did... after the issuance of this Court's stay did extend the terms until further order of the district court and further order of this Court."
1996.95-1201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,811.933,813.235,Are you actually disagreeing?
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,831.718,833.428,Ordinarily that would be correct.
1996.95-1201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,833.428,835.128,And isn't that what you want to happen here?
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,835.128,835.649,Yes.
1996.95-1201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,835.649,839.241,"And you're saying he didn't do that, but under Clark, he should have done it."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,839.241,839.461,Yes.
1996.95-1201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,839.461,851.119,"You're... but you have to add one fact to it, extend the terms of judges elected under a plan that the court believes may be unconstitutional."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,858.626,859.694,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1996.95-1201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,859.694,865.799,So that... that's quite a significant factor as to whether a realistic option is to let those terms continue.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,865.799,871.813,"Well, there was ample opportunity that was provided to the district court in order to resolve and address that question."
1996.95-1201,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,871.813,892.767,"But your case, as I understand it, does not depend upon our so assuming, because all you want, in theory, and all... as I understand it, all that it would take for us to resolve this case, and all that it would have taken for the district court to resolve the case was to order, just as Justice Breyer suggested a moment ago, no election under this plan."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,909.186,909.947,That is--
1996.95-1201,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,909.947,911.87,And that's all you want us to say.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,911.87,913.551,"--At this point, yes, it is, Your Honor."
1996.95-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.671,945.851,"But would you not agree that your position would be different if, instead of the district judge... instead of saying, well, I think there may be a violation of equal protection under Miller and so forth, if the judge had held a hearing and found that the plan in effect was unconstitutional, then we'd have a different case, wouldn't we?"
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,945.851,946.342,"That's correct, and I--"
1996.95-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,946.342,949.995,"Of course, he did not do that, but they just sort of assumed it might be."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,949.995,962.083,"--And at a minimum we wanted to have an evidentiary hearing so that we could present various alternatives and the district court could then determine whether in fact the 1994 was unconstitutional, but that's not the issue here."
1996.95-1201,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,962.083,964.254,Then why didn't you bring a complaint saying it's unconstitutional?
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,980.545,994.234,"I think it's very important to point out that the plan that we're talking about is the 1994 precleared plan, which was a proposed plan that was submitted by the appellants and the county to try to resolve this litigation."
1996.95-1201,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,994.234,994.554,Yes.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,994.554,1002.649,And it is that plan that the district court felt that after this Court's decision in Miller raised constitutional concerns.
1996.95-1201,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1002.649,1007.253,"Well, that's right, but that plan was limited in its temporal scope--"
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,1007.253,1007.594,That's right.
1996.95-1201,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1007.594,1008.412,--as I recall.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,1008.412,1008.872,That's correct.
1996.95-1201,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1008.872,1024.935,"So once again, the only thing that the court had before it as a matter of pleading or complaint was a claim that in the absence of that interim precleared plan there was no precleared plan, and therefore no election should be held, isn't that correct?"
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,1024.935,1025.616,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1025.616,1025.933,Yes.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,1051.842,1052.343,That's correct.
1996.95-1201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1052.343,1056.614,"Has that situation ever come up before, because that would be a relevant precedent."
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,1056.614,1063.928,"Well, the typical procedure is to go back to the status quo, and you cannot challenge--"
1996.95-1201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1063.928,1064.589,"Yes, even if that status quo--"
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,1064.589,1065.47,"--Yes, you can--"
1996.95-1201,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1065.47,1065.991,--You don't go back to it.
1996.95-1201,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,1083.532,1104.386,"--Well, in the... the 10-year litigation that occurred in the Conner v. Johnson, Connor v. Waller, which started off as a one-person-one-vote violation, which there was established, in fact, a violation, and subsequent court proceedings dealt with the remedial issues, and that would be the precedent that I would cite."
1996.95-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1108.109,1109.409,"Very well, Mr. Avila."
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1111.529,1125.781,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1201,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1176.722,1179.815,"But Mr. Jenkins, isn't the problem that this isn't a status quo ante?"
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1205.112,1217.721,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, our contention is not that the district court necessarily erred in rejecting a particular plan, but that the option that it chose of allowing elections to go forward under an unprecleared plan was impermissible under this Court's decisions."
1996.95-1201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1227.247,1227.748,Would we--
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1249.572,1258.057,"Well, Your Honor, clearly, I think if the district court had done the full-blown Miller v. Johnson analysis, determined that the 1994 interim plan was unconstitutional--"
1996.95-1201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1258.057,1259.8,Let's assume that that was the case.
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1259.8,1265.222,"--Right, and if the only other choice was, if I understand your question, allowing elections under an unprecleared plan--"
1996.95-1201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1265.222,1265.602,Yes.
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1265.602,1269.303,--Then I think elections would have to go forward under the unprecleared plan.
1996.95-1201,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1278.63,1295.513,"Mr. Jenkins, why don't you... why doesn't your answer go this way, that given the unconstitutionality on the one hand, an unprecleared plan on the other, that in fact everything has got to stop until somebody comes up with a constitutional plan?"
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1322.37,1327.173,"--I think that's correct, Justice Souter, but as I understood the hypothetical, the only two choices were an election under an unprecleared plan--"
1996.95-1201,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1327.173,1327.613,Right.
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1327.613,1329.555,--or an election under an unconstitutional plan.
1996.95-1201,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1329.555,1334.286,And I guess I'm saying you shouldn't have accepted the choices as being limited to the two because--
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1343.682,1347.425,"Well, that's certainly correct under the situation that was actually presented in this case."
1996.95-1201,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1361.475,1367.208,"Well, I mean, I don't know why you give this sort of absolute answer rather than it depending on circumstances."
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1397.709,1400.07,I think that... pardon me.
1996.95-1201,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1400.07,1400.591,--circumstance-specific?
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1400.591,1402.093,"I think that's correct, Justice Breyer."
1996.95-1201,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1402.093,1403.692,This is a rather confusing case--
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1420.263,1421.314,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.95-1201,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1430.951,1434.672,"Because it involved courts that no longer exist in the whole State of California, for one thing."
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1434.672,1445.711,"That's correct, but I think before allowing elections under an unprecleared system the district court was required, among other things, to analyze whether that system, the preexisting '68 system, could have been adapted in some way to accommodate current circumstances."
1996.95-1201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1451.334,1463.991,"Did the court have the power to impose any of these remedial alternatives on its own without first making the determination that the extant plan, which would otherwise continue, was unconstitutional?"
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1463.991,1466.852,"Well, we think so, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1201,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1484.216,1489.659,"Well, I'm not sure why, because the court has got jurisdiction to adjudicate a complaint that's brought in front of it."
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1531.217,1545.435,"Well, Justice Souter, if I understand your question, I agree with you that it would not have been objectionable for the district court to simply say, no further elections, and judges that were elected either under the unprecleared plan that existed or under the interim plan will simply remain in their posts."
1996.95-1201,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1545.435,1546.674,"Yes, but I'm suggesting something more."
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1548.817,1550.377,"Well, I think under certain--"
1996.95-1201,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1550.377,1556.342,"It should adjudicate what's in front of it, and if the only thing in front of it is a section 5 claim, it should adjudicate it and stop."
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1563.437,1571.221,"--Well, ordinarily that would be correct, and I agree with you that in order to resolve this case, and to order the outcome that the appellants seek, that's all this Court would have to decide."
1996.95-1201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.308,1580.949,"Yes, but that's--"
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1593.936,1603.202,"--Well, Justice Scalia, in City of Rome this Court held that in fact the fallback remedy essentially under section 5 is elections under the status quo ante system, and as Justice Gins--"
1996.95-1201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.202,1604.774,After a finding of violation.
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1606.274,1613.0,"--Well, there was a finding of a violation here, which was the failure to preclear an election system that was covered by section 5, so there was in fact a violation."
1996.95-1201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1614.519,1622.786,"--I mean a violation that the extant... you know, the system in place, which someone is asking to be stricken down, is a violation."
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1622.786,1626.627,"--Are you referring to the 1994 interim plan, or are you... which one are you referring--"
1996.95-1201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1626.627,1626.868,"In this case, none."
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1631.701,1639.757,"--Well, I'd like to leave it with the fact that I think, Justice Souter, you're correct that this Court need not address that question in order to reverse the decision."
1996.95-1201,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1641.858,1644.138,What about the situation of the district judge?
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1664.414,1675.49,"--Well, Your Honor, that's true, and what I was about to address was the question of State law, and I think Justice Souter in his earlier comment was quite correct that section 5 covers attempts to enact or administer voting changes within the covered jurisdiction."
1996.95-1201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1685.397,1685.496,"Thank, you, Mr. Jenkins."
1996.95-1201,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1685.496,1686.137,Thank you.
1996.95-1201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.137,1687.809,"Mr. Stone, we'll hear from you."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1687.809,1697.844,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1760.715,1778.938,"So if it is established in the Federal district court that preclearance was not obtained, and that it's a covered jurisdiction, what, in your view, could the district court do, beyond simply saying, hold everything, get preclearance?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1778.938,1780.848,That is the common remedy.
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1782.14,1782.591,Nothing more.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1782.591,1783.49,--Nothing more.
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1783.49,1784.331,On this complaint.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1784.331,1785.263,Certainly on this complaint.
1996.95-1201,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1785.263,1788.944,"Well, I take it hold everything means enjoin any further elections."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1788.944,1794.017,"Well, in Clark v. Roemer this Court very strongly suggested that that may be the case."
1996.95-1201,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1794.017,1797.07,"What should have happened here, in your view?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1813.35,1816.942,In most cases the elections must be enjoined.
1996.95-1201,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1817.693,1819.724,What should have happened here in your view?
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1819.724,1823.738,"--Well, for several reasons we don't believe the elections should have been enjoined here."
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1884.036,1890.941,"Is it your position that changes by the county pursuant to State law, even if required by State law, need not be precleared?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1890.941,1891.762,--Yes.
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1893.012,1896.334,"And how do you respond to the ""or administer"" language in the statute?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1896.334,1902.679,"--Well, I believe that... Justice Stevens, I believe that addresses informal as opposed to formal actions by a covered jurisdiction."
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1905.851,1920.55,"So that in your view, even if Monterey County was covered, if the State legislature enacted a whole bunch of changes, it completely redesigned the jurisdiction in ways that were retrogressive, there'd be no... no Federal remedy except under section 2."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1920.55,1921.201,--Exactly.
1996.95-1201,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1929.338,1940.826,"So that in any case of a covered jurisdiction which is less than Statewide, the State legislature basically can preclude any section 5 action simply by enacting a new State statute on your view."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1940.826,1942.685,If it--
1996.95-1201,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1942.685,1948.559,The State can completely defeat the jurisdiction under section 5 and the preclearance requirement.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1948.559,1953.023,"--Well, with respect, Justice Souter, I don't think it defeats the purpose of section 5."
1996.95-1201,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1953.344,1955.134,"Well, if this... maybe I misunderstood you."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1971.884,1973.276,--That is our position.
1996.95-1201,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1973.276,1992.107,"Well, then I think it follows... I mean, that's just an example of a general rule that in any case of a section 5 jurisdiction the requirements of preclearance can simply be eliminated by the adoption by the State of a statute which changes the manner of election in the covered jurisdiction."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1992.107,1993.439,"I agree with that, too."
1996.95-1201,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1994.801,1996.12,So there isn't much left of section 5.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1996.12,1997.382,"--Well, of course there is."
1996.95-1201,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2012.861,2034.445,"Mr. Stone, when did that become... would you just describe to us, when did that become California's position, because... correct me if I'm wrong about this... I thought that California had itself sought to preclear changes that would affect... changes in State legislation that would affect covered counties."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2034.445,2059.422,"--It's true that the Secretary of State's Office for the State of California does submit on occasion... I don't think it's absolutely every time, but it does submit regularly State statutes and enactments for preclearance, but this Court has never held, and it's been our position throughout this case, to answer your question, that the State is not a covered jurisdiction, and therefore its enactments do not require preclearance."
1996.95-1201,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2059.422,2070.179,Even though the State has sought such preclearance when its enactments affect... will make a change in a covered jurisdiction.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2070.179,2071.389,"It has, Your Honor."
1996.95-1201,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2072.221,2079.187,"So you're saying that California has acted out of an excess of caution, is that your view?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2079.187,2081.358,"--That is exactly what has happened, and also--"
1996.95-1201,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2081.358,2091.065,And not on... based on its understanding of the law that it was required to seek preclearance when State law changes voting in a covered jurisdiction.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2091.065,2122.213,"--There's a Department of Justice regulation... I believe it's section 51.23 of 28 Code of Federal Regulations... which suggests that States have that requirement, and in an abundance of caution the Secretary of State's Office has, as a general matter, attempted to obtain preclearance, but this Court has never held that such preclearance is required of an uncovered jurisdiction, and I would suggest that it's a very grave incursion into principles of federalism to do so."
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2122.213,2126.618,"Well, Mr. Stone, I'm not sure that's even an issue here."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2134.352,2135.914,The--
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2135.914,2139.186,--at the time that it took the actions that it did?
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2139.186,2139.494,--Yes.
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2140.986,2143.148,It wasn't mandated by State law?
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2143.148,2143.959,--No.
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2148.15,2148.971,But didn't require it.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2148.971,2152.303,"--No, although there's some confusion on the record in that respect."
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2162.952,2164.763,But that's not your position here.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2164.763,2167.935,"--I think that's right, that the legislative--"
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2167.935,2176.83,And so all of this other discussion about your views of State action and section 5 is not really at issue in this case.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2176.83,2180.803,"--No, I believe they are, Justice O'Connor, because we... the State is now, as you know, a defendant party."
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2198.385,2232.176,"Well, but to the extent that what was challenged here in the complaint was a failure to preclear a change in Monterey County's municipal and justice court setup, that change you say was not mandated by State law, and to the extent we look at that, I assume that the Court would just determine whether it was or wasn't, and if it wasn't would order preclearance."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2232.176,2233.308,"--Oh, I see, Your Honor."
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2233.308,2235.128,Why do we get into all this other stuff?
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2235.128,2236.23,I misunderstood your question.
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2240.591,2241.392,Right.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2241.392,2242.274,--to design the district--
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2242.274,2245.296,And wasn't what the complaint alleged?
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2246.938,2266.26,"--But at the time the lawsuit was filed, there was on the books a State statute indicating that the Monterey County Municipal Court District is the entirety of Monterey County... that's section 73560 of the Government Code... and there was this change in the State's constitution, Article VI, section 5, which said that there may no longer be Statewide--"
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2266.26,2267.982,But that wasn't what the complaint challenged.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2267.982,2269.394,"--No, but the point is--"
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2269.394,2269.694,No.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2269.694,2280.341,"--that at the time they filed it, 20 years after the first of these ordinances, things had changed considerably, and the State during that intervening period had dictated what the Monterey County Municipal Justice--"
1996.95-1201,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2280.341,2281.473,"All right, but why doesn't that go to the merits?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2329.355,2330.933,--Because--
1996.95-1201,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2330.933,2335.038,--rights on the basis of race under the circumstances that you outline in your brief.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2335.038,2338.571,--Our arguments go to whether preclearance is required.
1996.95-1201,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2346.999,2349.48,"All right, so if you disagree that it's not subject to preclearance--"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2349.48,2350.168,--Right.
1996.95-1201,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2350.168,2355.314,"--why don't you appeal, the district court's judges to the contrary, to the Ninth Circuit?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2355.314,2356.963,The issue is still open in the district court.
1996.95-1201,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2366.28,2378.808,"Then why isn't it up to the district court under ordinary precedent to enjoin all elections until it decides that matter, at which point, if you lose you will have to go to the D.C. Circuit, and if you win, you won't."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2388.834,2390.547,"--Your Honor, that would have been fine."
1996.95-1201,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.864,2431.204,"All right, but can we say bygones are bygones--"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2431.204,2431.935,We cannot.
1996.95-1201,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2431.935,2435.277,"--whatever happened in the past, now proceed according to Clark?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2435.277,2435.726,No.
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.999,2487.431,"Well, is that quite true?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2497.927,2499.169,Yes.
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2500.248,2506.973,Which at least gives the district court a colorable basis for assuming their ought to be some interim remedy until they get preclearance.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2506.973,2525.826,"--Well, I'm not sure it does, Justice Stevens, because the district court... this Court has held, in defining the different kinds of actions that may be brought under the Voting Rights Act, it has specifically said that a coverage case such as this, where the only question was coverage, has no jurisdiction to determine either retrogression, which is expressly limited to the District of Columbia courts, or constitutional violations."
1996.95-1201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2526.818,2537.383,"When you say stipulate, Mr. Stone, was there what you would think of as a technical stipulation filed in the district court which stated what you said it stated?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2537.383,2560.909,"As part of these interim orders that they urged the court to order, to direct, the parties stipulated... not the State, certainly, but the parties then existing, stipulated that the county was unable to establish that the ordinances, that several of the ordinances, it wasn't specific, were not retrogressive in that they may have had--"
1996.95-1201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2560.909,2566.375,The parties... they stipulated that they couldn't bear the burden of proof of proving that they were not retrogressive?
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2566.375,2569.895,"--Yes, of proving that several of them were not, and that was all they stipulated."
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2581.892,2588.638,Is it not also relevant that the interim remedy put into effect in December of 1994 was precleared?
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2588.638,2590.34,"--That is irrelevant, Your Honor."
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2590.34,2591.039,That's irrelevant.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2591.039,2591.41,Yes.
1996.95-1201,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2591.41,2598.595,"May I get clear on, I guess, a further point there that is raised both by your answer to Justice Stevens and your answer to Justice Breyer?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2619.529,2621.32,Yes.
1996.95-1201,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2621.32,2622.111,Okay.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2622.111,2623.891,And that's the normal remedy.
1996.95-1201,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2625.313,2626.021,And that's the extent of it.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2626.792,2632.446,--Absent extraordinary circumstances that seems to be the limits of this coverage case court's remedial authority.
1996.95-1201,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.154,2682.298,"Well, how is that relevant, because the State might not have made this disposition with respect to this county if it had known that it was under attack?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2682.298,2682.809,--No.
1996.95-1201,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.803,2694.888,"No, but I'm trying to connect that to the lack of due diligence that you were referring to."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2694.888,2716.83,"--Well, it's the fact that they waited 20 years, permitted a great deal of time in which the State took several actions with respect to justice and municipal courts in Monterey County, so their diligence... had they filed this action immediately after passage of the first ordinance, or the second, or the third, and taken issue with it at the time, then an injunction would have been against the county, I suppose, at least much more clearly."
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2746.48,2751.336,"Yes, but the interim remedy did accommodate the State interest in having countywide jurisdiction."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2755.576,2759.44,"--Actually, Your Honor, the State interest is not in having countywide jurisdiction."
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.895,2784.776,"But only for election purposes, not for jurisdictional purposes."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2790.74,2792.802,"But that's even worse, Your Honor, than dividing it into--"
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2792.802,2795.744,It's almost as bad as letting a judge be assigned to another district.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2800.656,2803.679,"--Yes, and we of course disagree to the extent that it belittled the State's interest."
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2824.974,2832.186,"Mr. Stone, can I interrupt your presentation for one moment, because I understand you're making arguments that really haven't been decided on by the district court."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2854.953,2864.7,"--That... yes, Justice Stevens, that in combination with the fact that the interim remedy... and I always put it in quotes... was issued in the first place, because I believe that Miller--"
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2864.7,2867.502,But that's not why the district court set its own remedy aside.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2870.384,2875.068,"--Well, that's correct, on the basis that it was... substantial questions about its--"
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2875.068,2875.246,Right.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2875.246,2876.428,--constitutionality came into play.
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.428,2882.602,"And my question is, do you think that was a proper way to decide that issue without first deciding whether there was a Miller violation?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2882.602,2885.884,"Well, the court didn't say there was a Miller violation."
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2885.884,2886.174,No.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2886.174,2888.937,"But I don't see how it could come to any other conclusion, Your Honor."
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2962.023,2974.863,"But don't you think that the reason the district judge thought Miller invalidated the plan, or its interim plan, was because the district judge thought that any reliance on race in fashioning the districting would be invalid?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2974.863,2985.679,"--The district court did say that Miller draws into question whether any reliance on race may be invalid, but it didn't go that far."
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2985.679,2989.112,So do you think it's up to us to decide whether the district court correctly or incorrectly construed Miller?
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,2989.112,3002.839,"Your Honor, I think the sentence that the court... that you're citing in the court's decision is certainly subject to some scrutiny and clarification, but that was not necessary to the Court's decision here."
1996.95-1201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3027.807,3038.493,"Your position here, Mr. Stone, is that you are satisfied with the November 1995 interlocutory injunction, and you ask that the district court's judgment be affirmed?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3038.493,3038.814,Yes.
1996.95-1201,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3056.636,3063.771,"It seems to me that affirmance is inconsistent with your basic argument here, which is that all the Court could do was order preclearance."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3088.235,3098.914,"Except, Your Honor, that I think the court's most recent order, the November order, was an attempt to correct what it had unfortunately messed up initially."
1996.95-1201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3111.451,3120.716,"Well, if we should reverse the November 1995 order, that wouldn't necessarily mean approval of the December 1994 order, would it?"
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3120.716,3124.069,"--Well, but that would then be the status quo, as the Court has used it."
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.454,3138.759,"But you would be free to advance all the arguments you've been making here, including the unconstitutionality of that remedy, because those haven't really been ruled on."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3140.779,3151.628,"Well, the court has not expressly stated that it's remedy, its '94 remedy was unconstitutional, but as I started to point out, the only purpose for the dividing of this district was race."
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3151.628,3152.069,"Yes, I know."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3171.79,3179.845,"Well, and at this point it would be moot, except for the extension of terms, because the court was obviously uncomfortable with its remedy in the first place."
1996.95-1201,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3179.845,3197.748,"Well, if it would be moot, then your answer... then you're not standing by... I think you're not standing by the answer you gave a moment ago that if all we do is conclude here that he should have enjoined the use of the plan that he adopted, that that would restore a status quo ante, and the status quo ante is unconstitutional."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3200.599,3202.411,"No, it would, because the court has extended the terms."
1996.95-1201,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3203.109,3204.371,"Oh, because of the court's extension."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3227.918,3230.629,"--Well, when the Court held its hearing on Miller, that was the question it wanted to address--"
1996.95-1201,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3230.629,3237.675,"Yes, and that's the question... and that's the question that you can litigate if it goes back in the posture that Justice Stevens and I are suggesting."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3237.675,3243.277,"--Well, that's true, Your Honor, although in the meantime the results of that unconstitutional--"
1996.95-1201,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3243.277,3244.827,That is yet another issue.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3250.29,3251.151,--Yes.
1996.95-1201,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3251.151,3251.602,Yes.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3251.602,3257.627,"But on the same token, on these facts this Court it seems to me could very quickly and easily find that under Miller, that--"
1996.95-1201,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3257.627,3264.012,"Well, we don't... I don't know what procedural basis we'd have to be deciding a Miller claim, either."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3264.012,3265.321,--Well--
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3265.321,3267.992,"We don't even have a map in the record, I don't think."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3267.992,3271.265,"--Well, actually, I did submit a map which shows that there's no--"
1996.95-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3271.265,3271.566,I couldn't find it.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3307.89,3327.532,"--Well, the principal reason that you know Miller should annul this interim remedy of December '94 is the point made by Justice O'Connor that no substantive harm to voting rights has been established, so any remedy that brings race in at all, any remedy at all is inappropriate in this Court."
1996.95-1201,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3327.532,3335.607,But suppose... let's suppose the D.C. Circuit finds you can't have this change because it's retrogressive.
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3359.602,3365.546,"Well, that's... it would be a very different case if this were in the district court and if retrogression, a substantive violation had been determined."
1996.95-1201,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3367.967,3382.998,"But we never even have empowered the right decisionmaker, because it's been frozen in... as I understand it, in the district court within the Ninth Circuit that doesn't have the authority to make that retrogression determination."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3382.998,3388.831,"Well, it's correct that it hasn't yet gotten to any court in which substantive harm can be determined."
1996.95-1201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3388.831,3390.053,"Thank you, Mr. Stone."
1996.95-1201,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,3390.053,3390.644,Thank you.
1996.95-1201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3390.644,3392.014,"Mr. Avila, you have a minute remaining."
1996.95-1201,3,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,3392.014,3406.722,I would like to refer the Court to Conner v. Waller as providing authority for the issuance of injunctive relief and additional relief beyond merely the issuance of a permanent injunction.
1996.95-1201,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3467.715,3469.205,"Thank you, Mr. Avila."
