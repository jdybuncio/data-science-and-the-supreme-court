1977.77-117,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,52.086,"We'll hear arguments next in 117, National Broiler Marketing Association against the United States."
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,54.787,58.312,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,148.234,155.976,"Mr. Posner I understand that isn't disputed, but frankly I was kind of puzzled, what it is that the marketing organization sells for its members?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,155.976,165.285,"The marketing organization itself, the cooperative, is not engaged in sale other than some export sales."
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,169.922,173.934,"Well, it's not the typical coop then?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,173.934,175.444,It is a --
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,175.444,179.114,"It's more like a trade association, is it?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,179.114,189.911,"It has several functions, one that it has; that many cooperatives have, it purchases products on behalf of its members, buys for them to get lower prices."
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,189.911,191.401,Buys chicken or what?
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,191.401,198.173,"No, it will buy various equipments used in production and other supplies."
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,207.589,213.465,"Getting back to my original question, what is the product as to which the price information is exchanged?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,213.465,228.073,The product is a broiler chicken which has been plucked and eviscerated and its head and feet cut off and it is then sold afresh to the grocery stores or supermarkets.
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,228.073,231.652,Why isn't like meat that's been dressed by the packers?
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,238.489,241.571,It is really nothing more than a plucked chicken and as long as the chicken itself is a --
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,241.571,246.008,"It's gone through the processing plant, isn't it?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,254.868,255.712,Well –
1977.77-117,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,255.712,269.193,"Another way if I may, is there anything more to do before they sell it just as they do with the piece of beef that Justice Stevens is talking about, except perhaps cut in half, if they only want half a chicken?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,269.193,273.788,I don't know enough about the processing of beef to answer the question fully.
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,293.181,297.644,"But it has gone -- it has gone through a processing plant much like a slaughter house has, isn't it --"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,297.644,300.186,It is a slaughter house.
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,315.932,318.026,I don't understand the difference.
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,327.997,374.924,"As I say, I don't know a great deal about the processing of beef, if all it was involved was taking a steer, killing it and shipping the meat to a grocery store, a supermarket and if that meat packer or meat preparer for market engaged in the various activities that these producers do, and I assume it would be also entitled to form this type of cooperative, I do want to differentiate though very sharply the kind of manufactured product of which hotdogs, flour, or sugar made from wheat would be good examples, because it's perfectly clear that the Capper-Volstead Act was not intended to allow manufacturers in that sense to form a cooperative."
1977.77-117,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.488,395.471,"Mr. Posner, I find some difficulty along the same lines expressed by Justice Stevens and the Chief Justice, as to the precise facts that we are talking about here."
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,417.922,425.749,"The record, the main part of the record is a brief stipulation of facts, pages 6 to 30 of Volume 1."
1977.77-117,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,456.943,474.444,"Now frequently if you look on a Safeway shelf you will see chicken breasts or chicken legs and as you get to think more has happened from the time that the bird was shipped by the processor, to the time those things appear on the shelves in that form?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,474.444,485.559,"Well some times, as I understand it, some times the producer will dismember the chicken and ship parts."
1977.77-117,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,485.559,487.56,But this isn't clear from the record?
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,487.56,496.424,The record does not – no it does not give that degree of detail.
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,526.042,534.34,"But that concession covers again, a meat packer that owned up the ranch plant to grow its own cattle, would it apply or would there be any difference?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,534.34,535.55,That is true.
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,545.529,548.154,"But in fact they killed it and chopped it up in pieces, wouldn't make any difference?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,548.154,557.244,"If it is merely killed and sliced, it would retain its original agricultural character."
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,561.509,563.058,I don't understand that.
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,563.058,564.13,-- it would be a manufacture.
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,564.13,576.86,"I know the government has conceded, are they any cases that hold that this kind of product is an agriculture product and this kind of vertical integrated entity is a farmer?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,586.921,601.71,"Actually there are very few decided cases under the Capper-Volstead Act in the entire history of the act and in those cases these issues have not occurred, have not been raised."
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,601.71,613.205,"Let me ask you one more and then I will leave you, why isn't, why the fact that two members don't even control any breeder flocks, under Case-Swayne why doesn't that dispose of the case?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,613.205,620.524,A producer who does not control a breeder flock and it's important to distinguish a breeder flock from a broiler flock.
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.298,649.784,So these two do that?
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,649.784,650.299,Yes.
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,650.299,650.742,I see.
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,650.742,671.48,"He would take the chicks from the hatchery and place them with the grower and he would supervise the growing of the chickens, send his personnel to supervise them, ship them, feed, capture, catch and coop the chickens after the grow out stage --"
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,671.48,686.66,Well is it not correct Mr. Posner that we must conclude that those two members are farmers within the meaning of the act in order for the whole coop to be exempt under Case-Swayne?
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,686.66,695.278,"Yes, there is no question that – well, let me put it this way."
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.177,705.72,"But if anyone is not a farmer this whole defense fails if I understand Case-Swayne, isn't that correct?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,705.72,707.249,"Yes, that is correct."
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,707.249,716.98,"So, we have to take the two most difficult examples from your point of view and satisfy ourselves that those are farmers in order for the coop to prevail?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,716.98,726.3,"Yes, I have no particular difficulty with the ones that do not have a breeder flock or do not have a processing plant."
1977.77-117,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,768.703,777.188,"Well that has to be your position, doesn't it Professor Posner that you have no difficulty whether they are -- otherwise your case goes down the drain."
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,777.188,796.563,"Yes, but the essence of a farmer is not the ownership of a feed mill or a slaughter house or a breeder flock that is the parents of the agricultural commodity or flock in which we were interested."
1977.77-117,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,809.022,816.595,Does the record dispose incidentally the attitude of the Department of Agriculture as to the appropriate interpretation of the Capper-Volstead Act?
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,816.595,817.544,"No, it does not."
1977.77-117,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,844.28,854.35,"Mr. Posner, I maybe misheard you, if you said Page 21 the government's Brief has run out of pages at Page 11."
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,854.35,858.017,"You may be referring to the Brief in Opposition, but the Brief for the United States --"
1977.77-117,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,858.017,860.276,"The colors, the new colors."
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,860.276,870.366,"Oh, I am so sorry."
1977.77-117,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,977.911,980.036,And medicines?
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,980.036,997.324,"Correct, he supplies them with all medicines, vaccines, he inoculates the chickens, he tells the grower what diet, what mixture of feeds to administer the chickens at different periods of their growth."
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.736,1075.587,"Mr. Posner, let me ask you one more question that occurred to me."
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1086.64,1089.269,"The owner of the chicken is the producer, not the grower."
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.269,1093.722,Does the producer have an option to do something other than kill it at that particular stage of its life?
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1093.722,1094.785,"No, he does not."
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.745,1103.041,For a larger chicken and –
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1103.041,1109.27,"Yes, I was going to say, there is no market as far as I know for the un-plucked chicken, but in addition to that –"
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1109.27,1113.823,"Isn't there – these are two and half pound chicken; they are something like that, aren't they?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1118.045,1122.878,"No, a fryer and a broiler are identical; they are the same young chicken."
1977.77-117,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1141.457,1144.985,They are previously contracted on it --
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1144.985,1148.286,The only thing that is contracted out is the –
1977.77-117,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1148.286,1156.483,"I mean if you want to make a contract, you -- so many on such and such date every week?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1162.462,1164.259,Give to the retail store.
1977.77-117,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1164.259,1166.486,"Yeah, to the supermarket."
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1169.008,1174.536,"Well, it doesn't, typically it does not work that way as I understand it."
1977.77-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.503,1215.615,"Mr. Posner, I can understand why at the age of 8 weeks the product is perishable in a sense it's got to be marketed right away, but after it's been, chicken has been killed and dressed, why can't it be frozen and stored indefinitely?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1215.615,1223.434,"For reasons that are not explained in the record that I do not understand, there is not a market, there is not a substantial market for frozen chicken."
1977.77-117,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1232.852,1234.835,"That is fresh, unfrozen."
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1234.835,1235.769,Fresh unfrozen.
1977.77-117,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1243.933,1266.736,"Mr. Posner, I -- perhaps you have covered this before, but it's suggested in at least one of these amicus briefs here that we have, that there is a choice here, an alternative, either the contract growers are within the exception, the Capper-Volstead Exemption from the Antitrust Law or your clients somewhere that they can't both be, that's -- but you reject that, don't you?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1266.736,1276.428,"Yeah, in fact, until this case was brought the grower and the producer were both the conceded farmers."
1977.77-117,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1287.563,1291.361,"That one or the other is, and if one is, the other isn't, that's the suggestion?"
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1291.361,1308.234,"The problem that's happened with poultry production is that the attributes of a complete or traditional farmer have become divided between two entities; the grower has some, in the sense that he actually has the day to day custody of the birds."
1977.77-117,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1367.563,1367.989,"Title, well there is no title."
1977.77-117,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1374.664,1389.839,"Yes, that would fall under the government's -- under the branch of the government's rule for which the person with custody is a farmer, and the person with title of the land is another farmer, thus the plantation owner and the tenant farmer."
1977.77-117,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1469.377,1473.516,Very well Mr. Posner.
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1477.628,1484.005,"Mr. Chief justice, ma0y it please the Court."
1977.77-117,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1581.666,1598.898,"Wasn't their intent also to treat as differently under the Antitrust Laws, farmers because they bore the risks of drought and price depressions in a way that lots of other purchasers didn't?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1598.898,1605.008,"Well the risk is, it turns out not to be crucial I believe in the legislative history."
1977.77-117,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.251,1652.347,"But wasn't one of the reasons that farmers were leaving the farms just because of this agriculture depression, whereas other parts of industry were prosperous and that was because farmers suffered from these peculiar risks."
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1652.347,1669.875,"When you look at the reasons that farmers at the land in the farm houses suffer, the risks they bear, the costs they invest and all of those factual things are the things one looks at, but it seems to me no single one of them nor indeed any of them in an aggregate should be deemed to be determinative."
1977.77-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.202,1685.843,How long was the Antitrust Division thought that the farmer excluded the integrator?
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1685.843,1691.55,That raises the question Mr. Justice White of the Business Review Procedure.
1977.77-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1692.972,1696.143,"No, I will put the other way; did it ever consider the integrator to be a farmer?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1696.143,1696.588,It did.
1977.77-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.182,1710.743,And I suppose the department then looked back and put the legislative history in context or not?
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1710.743,1726.206,I think it refined its views and in 1971 it issued a second Business Review letter making quite clear that these integrators were not to be considered farmers and indeed a press release was issued at same time.
1977.77-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.693,1809.62,"But you would agree, I take it that the integrator integrates a little farther and thus the growing, that he is a farmer?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1809.62,1811.158,We would agree with that.
1977.77-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.158,1817.388,And then those larger more integrated units could price fix and as a cooperative.
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1817.388,1832.574,"That's correct, but I think the crucial point is not that we are objecting to vertical integration as a general concept with particular emphasis on your question --"
1977.77-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.574,1836.247,The question is whether this is a property of the farmers?
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1836.247,1836.753,That's correct!
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1836.753,1840.963,Not what the vertical integration is?
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1840.963,1844.361,That's precisely correct; we did not challenge the vertical integration.
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1844.361,1853.746,"On that point Mr. Shenefield, what if the meat packers bought up a lot of ranches and then formed this kind of association, would they be exempt?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1853.746,1862.445,It would depend on the resolution of the question whether meat in that form packed by meat packers were an agriculture product.
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1862.445,1865.18,Supposing they sold it just unfrozen?
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1865.18,1883.103,"The debate, the Capital-Volstead debates themselves particularly the words of Senator Cummins make quite clear that he thought meat packed in that way wasn't agricultural product, and if that were the conclusion, then they would be farmers in the situation hypothesis you propose."
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1883.103,1888.982,Of course at the time the statute was passed I guess there wasn't frozen -- didn't have the art of freezing probably.
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1896.15,1922.767,"That subject came up in the legislative history as I recall it, and there are references to Mr. Armour and Mr. Swift who if they bought ranch lands, raised the cattle themselves and endured those particular kinds of risks, they too could be farmers, and that was regarded as a problem, but it was regarded as a necessary defect of trying the form some kind of standard in words that they had available to."
1977.77-117,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1922.767,1925.284,Let me see if I understand you correctly.
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1932.166,1934.409,That's correct.
1977.77-117,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1934.409,1936.548,How much land does he have to own?
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1936.548,1941.41,"He has to own, technically only enough to have the buildings sit on them."
1977.77-117,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1949.456,1960.135,"Well, for ownership only a part is enough, then why isn't it sufficient if the integrator owns the land for the breeding flocks and the hatchery facilities?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1960.135,1967.2,"Well, first of all six members of NBMA do not own either hatcheries or breeder flocks."
1977.77-117,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1967.2,1969.054,"Well, then why don't you go off on Case-Swayne?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1969.054,1973.737,"Well, we I think we win on Case-Swayne in any event, but I don't think it gets us --"
1977.77-117,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1973.737,1976.237,You certainly don't put it forward as your main thrust?
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1976.237,1990.087,"No, reason is that we would be, I assume, back here again next year, because the association will have reorganized to exclude these six and the litigation isn't disposed off, but I think just to go to that point; I think we do went on the basis of Case-Swayne."
1977.77-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1990.087,2000.664,"But they have to see, if the integrator just owned the land, but nevertheless got independent contractor to come no his land to do the growing function."
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2000.664,2008.438,The legislative history suggests that land ownership on the one hand and tilling the soil on the other hand are both separate and independent.
1977.77-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2008.438,2016.985,"But contrary wise, contrary wise I suppose you would say that the integrator was a farmer if he actually, he actually did the growing."
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2016.985,2017.987,That's correct.
1977.77-117,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2034.377,2038.705,"But you don't mean literally the tilling of the soil, do you, I mean the growing of the chickens?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2038.705,2040.942,"Tiller of the soil, grower of the chicken, shepherd --"
1977.77-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2040.942,2042.35,Doing the work of actually feeding the chickens?
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2042.35,2044.328,Yes sir.
1977.77-117,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2078.344,2103.496,"Because one of the problems is the extraordinary technological change in the agricultural – it is now called Agro business, that's a problem not unfamiliar in other areas of the law, the technological change that made the 1907 Trademark, Copyright Law, so difficult to apply."
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2120.585,2138.399,"Well, we have a slight indication of what that Congress might have done in a situation because they were offered a chance to view something called the Phipps Amendment which is referred to on our Brief at Page 15."
1977.77-117,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2138.399,2140.839,Mr. Shenefield why we have changed the color of the Briefs?
1977.77-117,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2140.839,2142.176,Can't get the paper.
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2142.176,2143.533,I have the phobia's notion --
1977.77-117,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2143.533,2150.472,We were phoned last week by someone who was at the General's office; the defender can't furnish the same grade paper anymore.
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2150.472,2153.062,Technological improvements.
1977.77-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.062,2159.312,The Phipps Amendment is farming out the paper --
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2159.312,2162.813,"If I am not interrupting, I don't know -- have you finished your colloquy with Mr. Justice Rehnquist?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2162.813,2164.295,"I think I have, yes."
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2164.295,2165.405,I have another problem.
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2195.785,2207.985,"Well, we have set the case in a way so that the sole question I take it is the applicability of the words as farmers."
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2207.985,2212.491,"I know but the ultimate question is whether these activities are within the exemption, isn't that true?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2212.491,2213.221,That's true.
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2213.221,2218.356,And you concede that the farmers may fix prices without acting through a marketing agent?
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2218.356,2218.993,No.
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2233.382,2238.688,"Even though they don't do what the statute exempts, namely act through a marketing agent?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2238.688,2239.452,No.
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2245.147,2249.499,But your complaint doesn't allege activities of the kind described in the statute?
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2249.499,2251.308,The complaint alleges price fixing.
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2251.308,2252.046,That's right.
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2252.046,2252.711,And –
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2252.711,2256.539,"Doesn't allege, nobody tells us anything about a marketing agency?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2256.539,2268.646,"Well, I have -- the only thing one can say is to that I suppose is that if they are price fixing and the exemption doesn't apply, we would argue that the Antitrust Laws apply, if they are --"
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2268.646,2276.172,"But shouldn't you be arguing that in this Court today, and you don't seem to be making an argument, it seems wide open to me?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2276.172,2281.204,I think at least the burden of my argument is precisely that.
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.039,2297.127,"Yes, but there are two quite separate reasons why the exemption may not apply; one, because they are not farmers, and two, because even if they are farmers, they haven't formed a statutory marketing agency."
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2297.127,2302.108,I am not aware of whether the record or the appendix shows anything on that.
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2304.899,2307.836,You may have another good argument but you're not particularly interested in it?
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2307.836,2310.685,"Well, I am very interested in it if it's good, I just don't have it at this point."
1977.77-117,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.685,2311.228,Yes.
1977.77-117,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2311.228,2335.874,"Well, that's one of the difficulties with this case to me Mr. Shenefield is that the record is so sparse as to actual facts, I realize that the complaint and stipulated facts and no trial, but it seems inevitably the discussion does turn to what these people are doing, and not all of us at least are sure of what they are doing."
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2335.874,2349.137,"Well, the case comes to this Court on the basis of sufficient facts at least in my view to dispose of the issue of whether these defendants are farmers within the Capper-Volstead Exemption."
1977.77-117,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2369.073,2374.105,It's a group of lawyers trying to talk about what farmers do?
1977.77-117,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2374.105,2402.031,"Mr. Shenefield, when you spoke a while ago of backward and forward, is it correct to take that to me and that if Mr. Armour and Mr. Swift brought the ranches and the herds, or if some ranchers bought large ranches owning large herds, bought Swift and Armour Company, is that what you're talking about the backward and forward process?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2402.031,2415.144,That was what I was talking about and all I meant to say is that that issue isn't in this case and waits until another day whether the same legal rules apply to backward as well as to forward integration.
1977.77-117,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2415.144,2419.544,"Surely, I shouldn't say anything sure in this area."
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2433.544,2445.314,"It seems to me that that's exactly correct, taking into account the concern that the Congress had for the farmers and their wellbeing as opposed to Mr. Armour and Mr. Swift."
1977.77-117,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2755.27,2770.472,"Doesn't have to be these days, doesn't have to be land, another thing can be water, can it, hygroscopic agronomy?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2770.472,2775.312,It doesn't seem to me that there is anything necessarily in the debates which would rule that out as a possibility.
1977.77-117,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2775.312,2781.08,"Well, they couldn't envision any such thing in 1922?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2781.08,2799.219,"But as long as you are trying to divine the essence of what that Congress thought farmers were interested in or what farmers did, it had to do with not necessarily ownership of the land, but actually producing the crop, being involved with the production of the crop or the shepherding of the flocks."
1977.77-117,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2799.219,2803.617,But shrimpers and oystermen were not covered by this or were they?
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2803.617,2810.274,I believe there is a separate act that governs fisheries.
1977.77-117,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2810.274,2823.259,"But certainly the industry, business analogy is there, is it not?"
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2828.685,2831.05,That's exactly correct.
1977.77-117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2867.164,2871.097,So they had to bring in tractors up in –[Laughter]
1977.77-117,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,2871.097,2873.34,I am not sure that much has changed.
1977.77-117,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2940.418,2940.895,Very well.
1977.77-117,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,2946.029,2946.231,Thank you.
1977.77-117,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2964.904,2967.366,I don't know; if they concede that--
1977.77-117,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,2967.366,2979.903,"He said, I thought he concede that, I think he next said, what is required is being involved with the production of an agriculture commodity and that's what these integrators are."
1977.77-117,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2979.903,2981.288,Or owning the water --
1977.77-117,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,2981.288,3000.898,"Or owning the water and let me add with regard to the Phipps Amendment which keeps cropping up, the Phipps Amendment said, someone who made flour was not an agriculture producer merely because he had a deal with a wheat farmer that gave him a percentage of the crop."
1977.77-117,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3036.44,3046.032,"Do you think it necessarily follows because you have got an exemption for common marketing agent, that you have an exemption for price fixing and separate individual marketing?"
1977.77-117,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,3049.908,3072.612,"Yes, it does not necessarily follow, but if the justice department concedes as it has that the activities of the petitioner, of NBMA, are exempt if they are producers subject to Capper–Volstead Act that to us establishes that this is a completely legitimate --"
1977.77-117,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3072.612,3075.794,"It doesn't necessarily establish it to us though, does it?"
1977.77-117,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,3075.794,3077.046,"Well, that issue has not been --"
1977.77-117,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3077.046,3086.612,"Is not going to be decided by any court and the language of the statute doesn't compel that result, it may be right, but you have to agree with that I believe."
1977.77-117,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,3086.612,3091.706,"Well, the issue has not been decided in this Court."
1977.77-117,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3098.184,3108.966,"There's rather substantial difference between the businessman's decision of whether to enter into a price fixing agreement, assuming it's all legal, and his decision to turn over all his marketing activities to a common marketing agent."
1977.77-117,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,3111.538,3113.363,"Yes, let me give you just one example."
1977.77-117,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3115.366,3116.344,Let me ask you one other question?
1977.77-117,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,3116.344,3116.806,Yes.
1977.77-117,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3116.806,3125.647,"Is it also not true that the legislative history shows a great interest in the cooperative movement, the idea of trying to market through common cooperative agencies?"
1977.77-117,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,3133.182,3133.556,"Yes, it did."
1977.77-117,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3158.144,3164.062,This record doesn't tell us that anybody negotiates on behalf of all the members of this association with anybody.
1977.77-117,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,3166.216,3167.857,"They do buying, they do export sales."
1977.77-117,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3167.857,3169.787,Selling of the broilers.
1977.77-117,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,3169.787,3171.628,They do export sales and surplus sales.
1977.77-117,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3181.986,3189.574,"But, they have a bargaining representative as I understand who bargains for them and negotiating currently with the processing plants."
1977.77-117,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,3189.574,3202.783,"Yes, but it is not a marketing agent because they are not engaged in marketing since they do not have a --"
1977.77-117,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3202.783,3213.328,"There is nothing, am I right, and this is summary judgment case, there's nothing in the record that tell us that this association, that's a defendant here does any common marketing on behalf of its members?"
1977.77-117,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,3213.328,3221.901,"Yes, the record does show that it engages in marketing, in export trade and of surplus chickens."
1977.77-117,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3246.91,3250.201,I suppose we're the ultimate judges of that then.
1977.77-117,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,3250.201,3252.428,Yes.
1977.77-117,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3252.428,3255.504,We are all from farm states Mr. Posner.
