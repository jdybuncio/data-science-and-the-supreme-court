2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,16.5,23.364,We'll now hear argument in Whitfield against the United States and Hall against the United States.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,24.14,27.825,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,99.404,100.952,Would you just clarify one thing for me?
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,103.799,105.722,Excuse me?
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,105.722,109.854,Does the Government have to prove an overt act in order to establish venue?
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,109.854,119.734,Our position is that the venue provision in 1956(h) for money laundering conspiracies requires that they establish an overt act and that venue would lie--
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,119.734,121.751,"Well, your... you say the... the statute requires."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,135.31,135.999,--Yes.
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,135.999,136.291,--as they do--
2004.03-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.291,139.173,Is that the only basis for venue?
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,142.99,150.197,"Our position is that the venue provision in 1956, 1956(i), is the exclusive venue provision for money laundering."
2004.03-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.197,150.915,But... but read it.
2004.03-1293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,151.525,158.526,Are we talking about section 1956(i)?
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,158.526,160.831,Section 1956(i) is the venue provision.
2004.03-1293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.831,176.031,And doesn't it allow it to be brought where venue would lie if the completed money laundering offense that's the object of the conspiracy has been accomplished or anywhere an overt act was committed?
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,177.152,178.432,Yes.
2004.03-1293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.589,184.817,So you don't have to read it as requiring venue.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,197.799,201.847,"--Certainly, but where the completed offense occurs, there certainly would be overt acts."
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,208.432,214.103,--But why would they state it in the alternative if... why would they state it in the alternative if the overt act were always required?
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,214.82,237.663,"I agree that it's... it's somewhat confusing, Your Honor, but we would submit that the Government's interpretation of subclause (2) is that if two people conspired in... if two people in Florida conspired to commit a money laundering offense in California, absent any overt act whatsoever, conspiracy would lay in California."
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,237.663,240.772,But that doesn't respond to the venue question.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,267.622,275.808,"Well, this Court has made venue provisions exclusive in the patent infringement context and in the Banking Act precisely using the--"
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,275.808,279.678,"Well, this Court has no authority to make a venue provision either exclusive or permissive."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,281.568,286.617,--And our position is that Congress made this venue provision the exclusive venue provision--
2004.03-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.617,311.108,"I... I mean, one can understand that if the venue provision just read, a prosecution may be brought in any... in... let's see... may be brought in the district where venue would lie for the completed... if it just read, venue will lie in any district where an act in furtherance of the attempt or conspiracy took place, then we could argue about whether that is the exclusive venue or not."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,335.328,341.774,--Our position is that those are the two alternatives for where venue would lie for a conspiracy case.
2004.03-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.774,349.852,"Oh, okay, but... but then... then you acknowledge that the place where an overt act took place is not the exclusive venue."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,349.852,356.944,Our argument is that the first clause of that provision contemplates the existence of an overt act.
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,356.944,362.674,"What about the rule provision for venue, which has not been excluded by the statute?"
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,364.992,369.448,The ordinary provision for venue would be that venue lies in the district where the crime occurs.
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,369.448,370.407,Yes.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,370.407,377.363,"That would be... in the money laundering context, under our interpretation of 1956(h), that would be where the overt act occurs."
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,380.733,382.575,I thought the crime is the conspiracy.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,386.804,395.279,"--The overt act is part of... it's our position that the overt act is required, and there needs to be an agreement--"
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,395.279,405.968,"But you will... you will concede that there are many Federal crimes, conspiracy crimes, in which an overt act is not required."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,409.101,409.479,--Correct.
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,446.868,452.629,So you're saying that it doesn't mean very much because an overt act wouldn't be hard to prove.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,452.629,453.191,As a--
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,453.191,469.321,"But there are... I mean, the difference between statutes that say overt act is required and those that just say conspiracy... there are many, many such statutes, and we dealt with one in Shabani."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,486.55,487.08,--That's correct.
2004.03-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,577.079,587.39,"Except that there are other statutes that... that read this way, which we have held to... to create the conspiracy offense, as well as impose the penalty for it."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,587.39,589.195,Your Honor--
2004.03-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.195,590.152,"I mean, it... it could do that."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,603.652,606.702,--It could be construed as a freestanding offense provision--
2004.03-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.702,608.411,"And there are other such provisions, aren't there?"
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,608.411,617.088,--There are not any of the offense... conspiracy provisions that this Court has interpreted that had the same structural ambiguity as 1956(h).
2004.03-1293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,617.088,619.638,"Well, Shabani comes pretty close, doesn't it?"
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,619.638,622.578,"Shabani is a separate, distinct statute."
2004.03-1293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,627.158,637.175,"--like this it seems to me contains no express requirement of an overt act, and we've said, indeed, none is required and that at common law it wasn't required."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,637.175,637.998,That's true.
2004.03-1293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,637.998,640.235,So why would we read it in here?
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,640.235,647.861,"Because text... as this Court has said on multiple occasions, in order to understand what the words mean in a statute, you have to look at context."
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.032,661.04,"--Of course, if you look at this statute as a whole, you don't find the overt act requirement in it anywhere, do you?"
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,661.04,663.544,--You don't find the overt act explicitly in the statute.
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,663.544,667.085,"And the fact that you described it as a long, detailed statute it seems to me cuts against you."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,667.085,679.665,"No, because our position is that placing it in subsection (h) evidences that Congress' intent and sole focus when they enacted this was the purpose of increasing the penalty for money laundering."
2004.03-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.31,680.881,Let's get--
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,680.881,686.52,And they were making it unnecessary to rely on the general conspiracy statute in 18-371 or whatever it was.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,686.52,694.315,"--It's our position that they're incorporating the overt act requirement, the act in furtherance requirement, from 371 as evidenced by the legislative history."
2004.03-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.315,707.342,"--If that's so... if that's so, then why does the venue provision which you were just alluding to earlier read, except as provided in paragraph (2), a prosecution for an offense under this section."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,728.16,736.3,And it would be an offense under this section because certainly the jury would need to find that the object of the conspiracy was money laundering.
2004.03-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.689,742.9,I... I think that language really cuts very hard against you.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,751.914,755.88,"I can see how you would read it that way, Your Honor, but the offense--"
2004.03-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,755.88,757.451,Only because I'm a reasonable man.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,758.729,766.617,"--The offense provisions set forth in 1956 are clearly set out and enumerated in subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3)."
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,827.451,836.499,"Then you would expect at least a cross reference to 371 for defining the conspiracy, but there's nothing here."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,836.499,840.371,"--That's true, and it clearly would... it certainly would be clearer had they done so."
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,882.511,911.638,"You have given a few examples of a word may mean different things in different contexts, but you haven't given any example... and I don't know if there is one... where the entire string of words is identical in two statutes, both dealing with conspiracies, and you read an overt act requirement into one and not the other."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,922.36,933.541,"That's true, Your Honor, but as this Court said in Shabani, absent contrary indications, the Court will presume that Congress intends to incorporate the common law concept of the terms that it uses."
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,959.091,961.724,"Yes, but there's nothing in the text of the statute that's ambiguous, is there?"
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,961.724,971.528,"--No, but that is not dispositive because the placement the Congress has said... I mean, this Court has said on multiple occasions that you need to read a statute as a whole, and when you look at the--"
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.528,973.88,"But if you read it as a whole, you can't find any ambiguity."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,973.88,976.665,"--I think you can find ambiguity, Your Honor."
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,976.665,977.76,In the text of the statute?
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,977.76,978.61,In the--
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.61,980.006,Reading the whole text.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,980.006,991.715,"--Reading the whole text of the statute, it looks to me it reads that the offenses are set off... set forth at the beginning, followed by the civil penalties, then procedural aspects, including this penalty provision for increasing conspiracies."
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.715,993.356,None of which mentions an overt act.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,993.356,994.942,"No, it doesn't mention an overt act, but--"
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,994.942,997.151,So I don't find anything ambiguous in what you describe.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,997.151,1004.033,"--Well, we believe that 1956(h) clearly reflects Congress' intent to solely increase the penalty."
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1004.033,1008.2,"Perhaps that's all they thought of, but maybe they did a little more than they thought they were doing."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,1008.2,1021.02,"Well, if Congress inadvertently omitted the overt act requirement, this Court has on prior occasions read into congressional silence terms, definitions that Congress may have inadvertently left out."
2004.03-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1157.813,1185.342,"Can I... can I ask what you make of subsection (d) of... of this provision which says that violations of this section may be investigated by such components of the Department of Justice as the Attorney General may direct and by such components of the Department of the Treasury as the Secretary of the Treasury may direct, as appropriate, and with respect to offenses over which the Postal Service has jurisdiction, by the Postal Service?"
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,1211.962,1214.68,I'm not sure I understand your point.
2004.03-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1223.795,1225.177,The offense is never completed.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,1251.669,1257.617,"--It's our position that when Congress enacted this, they were trying to enact a penalty-enhancing statute."
2004.03-1293,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1295.518,1296.633,What do you... excuse me.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,1375.726,1384.031,--I... I think that would be a sensible way to work your way through thickets of statutes that were enacted after Shabani when this Court created that formulary.
2004.03-1293,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1384.031,1387.734,But Shabani rested on... on the existence of these prior models.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,1389.502,1399.741,"That's correct, but there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that Nash and Singer, the cases that Shabani relied on, were ever discussed or contemplated by Congress."
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1415.19,1428.367,"There are about... there are over 50, I think, in title 18 alone conspiracy provisions with no overt act requirement, no explicit overt act requirement."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,1462.523,1476.843,"Well, we don't... we don't believe that's the case because if you look at all of those subsections in title 18, none of them have the structural ambiguity that 1956(h) has, combined with a venue provision--"
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1476.843,1479.113,"Have you looked at all 59, I think--"
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,1479.113,1479.978,--The--
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1479.978,1481.339,--and assured yourself on that?
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,1481.339,1486.038,"--I've... I've looked through the entire statute, and I have not found... title 18."
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1494.479,1505.68,"Well, we've already dealt with venue where I think your argument is exceedingly weak since the statute phrases it as a permissive not a requirement."
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,1505.68,1527.779,"Well, first of all, we would submit, just briefly on... on the venue point, if Congress wanted this to be a permissive venue provision, they could have said venue would lie where and in the circumstances or as otherwise required by statute, in which case they could have shown that they were applying to other statutory bases for venue, as well as what Congress was establishing here."
2004.03-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1566.854,1570.655,It gave... it gave the prosecutor more choices of where to bring suit.
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,1570.655,1575.405,--We say those are the only choices on where to bring suit.
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1576.983,1579.076,Do you want to reserve any time?
2004.03-1293,0,42117,sharon_c_samek,,1579.076,1580.049,"--Oh, yes."
2004.03-1293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1580.263,1587.357,Mr. Marcus.
2004.03-1293,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1587.357,1590.182,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1293,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1681.854,1688.093,"If... if 371 were repealed, would it affect the actual practice in the Justice Department?"
2004.03-1293,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1701.337,1706.435,"--Well, my understanding is on... on occasion that is done in a multi-object conspiracy case."
2004.03-1293,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1713.896,1715.51,But not in exclusively laundering cases.
2004.03-1293,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1715.51,1716.71,"--Generally, no."
2004.03-1293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1730.673,1739.429,"When... when you say when there are multiple objects, you're not getting the money... money laundering just under 371."
2004.03-1293,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1749.832,1752.668,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-1293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1767.255,1769.749,"If it were just money laundering, could you charge under 371?"
2004.03-1293,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1769.749,1772.602,"Yes, you could charge under 371."
2004.03-1293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1818.025,1819.544,This is 846.
2004.03-1293,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1819.544,1822.005,"846, yes, in title 21."
2004.03-1293,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1927.214,1945.915,"What do you make of the... the argument that I think occurs in the yellow brief, that... the reference to any other district where an act in furtherance, et cetera, took place implies that in the clause preceding, they were referring to a district in which an act in furtherance took place?"
2004.03-1293,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1945.915,1951.709,"Justice Souter, I think what... what that terminology was... was referring to was district."
2004.03-1293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2039.83,2044.083,"I had just one other question, just out of curiosity, about how important this case is."
2004.03-1293,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2048.845,2053.507,"--I'm... I'm not aware of... I'm not aware of a number, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-1293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.507,2054.161,Are there any?
2004.03-1293,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2054.161,2055.432,I... I don't know.
2004.03-1293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2056.877,2057.927,It seems to me quite unlikely.
2004.03-1293,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2057.927,2058.229,--Well--
2004.03-1293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.229,2059.343,I'm just wondering.
2004.03-1293,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2062.577,2063.05,--Yes.
2004.03-1293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2074.103,2098.179,"I... I do have one and it's not on the money laundering conspiracy issue, but in this particular case, would it be consistent with the position that the Solicitor General has been taking for us to hold the final disposition of this case pending Booker and Fanfan?"
2004.03-1293,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2101.993,2109.143,"--Well, it's our position that it wasn't... they didn't raise that issue in... in the court of appeals."
2004.03-1293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2123.202,2132.899,And that's consistent with the position that the Government has been taking routinely in cases where Booker... where the sentencing guidelines are an issue?
2004.03-1293,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2132.899,2140.959,"Well, I think in the... I think that that position is based on petitions that have raised the question, I believe."
2004.03-1293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2151.665,2152.988,"Thank you, Mr. Marcus."
2004.03-1293,2,42117,sharon_c_samek,,2155.891,2157.946,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1293,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2292.248,2306.21,The Government has said that... that you have essentially waived their sentencing guidelines issue that you asked us in footnote 6 of your brief to consider.
2004.03-1293,2,42117,sharon_c_samek,,2306.21,2312.449,"In the district court, there were issues raised as to all defendants as far as various sentencing enhancements."
2004.03-1293,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.928,2350.487,"Was the argument below that... # that imposing the sentencing enhancement was unconstitutional, or was the argument just that the facts didn't support it?"
2004.03-1293,2,42117,sharon_c_samek,,2350.487,2353.004,The argument was that the facts didn't support it.
2004.03-1293,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.36,2379.494,Thank you very much.
