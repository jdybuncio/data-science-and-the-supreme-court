1978.78-647,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.075,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 647, Marchioro against Chaney."
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,17.219,21.019,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,74.602,83.448,"Mr. Goldmark, as I understand it in the Supreme Court of Washington you also challenged the requirement that the composition of the committees be one man and one woman."
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,85.372,88.995,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is correct we do not challenge that requirement here."
1978.78-647,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,88.995,93.584,And the last amendments didn't change that sex provision.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,93.584,96.147,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, in my knowledge they did not."
1978.78-647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,189.075,190.43,Between conventions.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,190.43,194.362,"Between, subject only to the overriding authority of the party state convention."
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,199.711,210.219,"And they are defined and provided for by legislation enacted by the legislature of your state, are they?"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,210.219,211.457,"Mr. Justice Stewart, that is correct."
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,211.457,215.008,And how long has that been true?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,215.008,216.403,"I'm not aware, Your Honor."
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,228.116,234.542,"They are creatures of statute, aren't they, the State Committee?"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,310.558,312.522,Mr. Justice Stewart it is not freely --
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,312.522,317.123,They're not voluntary self --
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,317.123,318.129,Let us begin.
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,318.129,319.185,-- selecting organizations.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,319.185,326.858,Democratic Party has been characterized in the King County Republican Central Committee case as a voluntary political association.
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,357.03,362.088,"Well it creates it almost doesn't it, it -- the statute?"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,362.088,362.465,The 1970 decision --
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,362.465,369.032,It says what a State Committee is and what it shall be composed and then it gets its certain statutory duties in that --
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,369.032,369.062,The statement of the Washington --
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,369.062,372.558,-- in that respect is not unlike any governmental agency.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,372.558,393.404,"The statement of the Washington Supreme Court interpreting this statute was that the Party State Committee had inherent power, not statutory power, but inherent power to govern the statewide operations of a party as a political organization."
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,395.307,401.525,And how many other states are the -- are political parties created and defined by state statute?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,401.525,405.186,"Mr. Justice Stewart, it is not clear to me whether they are created by the statute."
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,405.186,406.232,Or defined by state statute.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,406.232,415.191,"To appellant's knowledge, they are regulated in approximately 32 states."
1978.78-647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,441.694,457.033,"Well, aren't almost all of them provide for elections of county delegates or representatives and then provided that the county delegates shall elect the State Committee?"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,457.033,459.915,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, not to my knowledge."
1978.78-647,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,475.412,477.586,Mr. Goldmark --
1978.78-647,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,477.586,480.897,The state's Attorney General is noticeably absent from this litigation.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,483.014,485.21,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, he has not."
1978.78-647,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,494.518,496.771,And also the amended complaint.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,496.771,497.779,That is correct Mr. Justice Marshall.
1978.78-647,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,497.779,499.626,"Just one more question, I didn't hear your last sentence."
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,500.911,509.499,He was also served with a copy of our -- of the appellant's amended complaint and of the -- and the notice of the appeal from the trial court to the Washington Supreme Court.
1978.78-647,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,509.499,511.044,But he -- then he has never appeared?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,511.044,511.81,He has never appeared.
1978.78-647,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,511.81,513.816,Then in the litigation at any stage?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,513.816,515.482,That is correct.
1978.78-647,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,515.482,517.659,That wasn't what I wanted to ask.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,526.391,530.211,Appellants are not aware of any Mr. Justice Marshall.
1978.78-647,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,531.539,538.409,Did you serve him and submit to some state requirement that he must be served of a state statute's constitutionality?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,538.409,539.884,"Mr. Justice Brennan, yes I did."
1978.78-647,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,547.579,550.992,But leaves it to him whether or not he shall defend it?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,550.992,553.248,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,583.511,586.505,"Well, that's almost -- that's the question in this case."
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,586.505,598.54,The statute requires the Democratic State Committee to provide for election of delegates to the Democratic national -- to a national party convention.
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,613.253,623.661,Now this statute which is quoted in your brief refers to the State Committee of each major political party.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,628.87,630.285,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,638.366,640.731,In general too in your state?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,640.731,641.779,That's correct.
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,641.779,642.967,That by definition.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,642.967,649.113,The major benefit of being a major political party is that you are allowed to participate in the state's primary system.
1978.78-647,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,655.039,659.878,How are these parties structured before the statute was passed?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,659.878,663.092,"The record does not show, Mr. Chief Justice, I --"
1978.78-647,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,663.092,669.72,Does that the matter of which we could take judicial notice if we knew about it?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,669.72,670.097,Mr. Chief Justice --
1978.78-647,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,670.097,678.771,"Tell me, was it a purely voluntary organization like that Parent-Teachers Association or a Garden Club as Justice Stewart suggested?"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,679.539,681.192,That would be my assumption.
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,713.241,717.421,"But it's almost a definition first of all, isn't it?"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,717.421,717.609,Mr. Justice Stewart --
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,717.609,725.551,It states to me “of each major political party shall consist of”.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,741.533,753.007,"Mr. Justice Stewart, perhaps I could explain further the ruling the Court in this case with respect to the charter enacted by the Democratic Party, which may further shed light on your concern."
1978.78-647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,801.747,805.218,Is it that the Democratic State Party?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,807.204,812.453,"The Democratic State Convention, meaning the 1976 adopted the charter."
1978.78-647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,827.181,832.279,"And that is a relatively voluntary organization, I take it?"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,832.279,834.754,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,834.754,847.476,What's an example supposing that the Democratic State Central Committee were on the outs with the Democratic State Party as represented by the state convention?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,857.224,870.594,"For example Your Honor, if the Democratic State Convention adopted a party platform which the State Committee then refused to implement that would be a very substantial burden on the party's freedom of association."
1978.78-647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,870.594,883.847,"Well how would a Democratic State Committee, composed such as this one is by a statute play a role in implanting the platform of the state party?"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,883.847,886.659,Because that is its inherent function.
1978.78-647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,926.956,945.437,"But nothing that the State Central Committee to do would prevent the members of the Democratic State Party, or the people who adhere to the platform without the convention from espousing their views as to how good a platform it was."
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,945.437,953.41,A political party is an organization established to influence policy and to win elections.
1978.78-647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,987.028,992.525,Well can't the party itself raise money quite apart from the activities of the State Central Committee?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,992.525,1000.338,"The State Central Committee is under the common law of the state under this statute, and under the party's charter its governing body."
1978.78-647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1009.778,1025.185,Are you saying that the Supreme Court of Washington would tell you if the Democratic Party had a fund raising event in Seattle or Spokane and Tacoma that wasn't sanctioned by the State Central Committee that you couldn't have that event?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1025.185,1028.098,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I'm not suggesting that."
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1099.761,1107.165,Well isn't it that the legislature has defined what the State Committee is and what it shall consist of.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1157.508,1166.955,I do not believe that that organization had its genesis in a voluntary private association.
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1166.955,1168.522,There's no indication that this one did either.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1175.188,1198.632,"Your Honor, appellants believe as the Washington Supreme Court has said, and with the Court's indulgence, I'll read its statement that appears on page 5 of appellee's brief in which the Washington Supreme Court stated the powers of the state committees, and stated their role in under this statute."
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1209.658,1214.766,"Is the state convention, I interrupt just for a moment, to say is that defined by statute anywhere?"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1214.766,1215.522,It is not Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1215.522,1217.119,No.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1217.119,1242.102,"Is a State Committee created by RCW 29.42.020, as a committee designed to function on a statewide level, it is necessarily invested with the inherent power to adopt rules and regulations for its own internal government, as well as to promulgate subject to the overriding authority of the state convention."
1978.78-647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1265.115,1270.094,Doesn't everything you read say it's all subject to what the convention dictates?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1270.094,1271.262,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1978.78-647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1271.262,1273.797,Can't the convention widely it wants to?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1273.797,1275.065,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens and it has."
1978.78-647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1275.065,1277.109,Well that's -- what?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1277.109,1278.684,And the convention has.
1978.78-647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1280.159,1284.51,We'll take the platform example you gave in Mr. Justice Rehnquist's we're talking.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1292.573,1297.103,"That is, Mr. Justice Stevens that is what the suit is about."
1978.78-647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1300.746,1301.942,"Oh no, forgetting the membership."
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1313.027,1313.943,"No, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1978.78-647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.943,1316.348,And what example would they not prevail?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1316.348,1321.107,To give you an example of something that occurred during the pendency of this case.
1978.78-647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.725,1365.232,It doesn't have to.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1368.868,1379.676,"If the state convention meets every two years, it has no power during the interim, except through the party's representatives on the State Committee to see that its mandates are carried out."
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1391.639,1402.408,"Well it's certainly -- the situation is now that what a State Committee is, is defined by statute."
1978.78-647,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1416.864,1419.542,But he says he can come here and give us then.
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1419.542,1421.087,That is right.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1421.087,1432.102,"The common law of the State of Washington gives the Democratic Party the authority to assign functions to its Sate Committee, the same State Committee regulated by the statute and to delegate authority to it."
1978.78-647,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1432.102,1434.236,"It does not just regulate it, it's created."
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1441.789,1453.632,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I must respectfully disagree in terms of terminology, given the decisions of the Washington Supreme Court in the King County Republican case and in the decision of the court below."
1978.78-647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.838,1469.908,Mr. Goldmark --
1978.78-647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1469.908,1483.989,"What if the Democratic State Convention, Mr. Goldmark, had said that the Democratic State Central Committee shall not be subject to any elections at all, but simply be appointed by the Democratic State Convention every two years."
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1510.224,1517.268,"It seems to me if the convention, since it's a large body, was going to appoint these people, it would have to elect them."
1978.78-647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1517.268,1526.097,"Well, but supposing that -- supposing it said then that the chairman of the convention would appoint them?"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1526.097,1529.563,It's not clear to me whether that would be proper.
1978.78-647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1544.456,1564.931,"What if the convention decided would be -- initial committee should be composed of two members from each candidate, but the legislator then said “Oh no, the central committee should be selected on a population basis.”"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1564.931,1576.122,"Mr. Justice White, I thought about that question and it is not clear to me whether the state would have a compelling state interest enforcing a State Committee to be a portion on the basis of one person one vote."
1978.78-647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1601.043,1604.056,What is the status of that litigation?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1604.056,1614.195,"That was a stipulated injunction between the Democratic State Committee and the parties in that case, that the State Committee only exercises its electoral functions on very rare occasions."
1978.78-647,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1614.195,1626.785,Well it seems like most party political troubles that via the most states that they settle within the convention politically in Washington they settle them in courts.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1626.785,1633.232,"There is no way for the party to settle this in the court Mr. Justice Marshall, because it can't control its own State Committee."
1978.78-647,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1642.43,1649.683,So that's the difference from other states where you'd vote it down and not politically?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1649.683,1651.771,"Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1978.78-647,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1651.771,1654.853,So we'll be supervising the parties eventually.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1654.853,1664.73,"Mr. Justice Marshall, it is appellants belief that if parties are free to decide how their governing bodies are composed, and exert power over them through the political process --"
1978.78-647,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1664.73,1670.519,Then you go to the legislature and change the Act.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1670.519,1680.42,The fact that a legislature can remove a burden on freedom of association and provide that remedy does not excuse the substantial burden that is creating or justify them in prosecution as --
1978.78-647,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1680.42,1684.861,But wasn't that Act passed by political parties?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1687.775,1691.317,The state legislature is controlled by political parties.
1978.78-647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1705.119,1705.167,Mr. Goldmark --
1978.78-647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.167,1708.019,"Oh, could the statute say this?“"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1731.081,1736.864,"Mr. Justice White, only if the party decided that if wish the governing body of some different composition."
1978.78-647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.864,1737.673,Well it does.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1739.777,1740.863,Two persons per county.
1978.78-647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.863,1746.33,"-- it wants two lawyers and two -- I suppose right down the list of them, two of everybody."
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1746.33,1748.724,The party's preference should control.
1978.78-647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.724,1750.271,Well why is that?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1750.271,1758.91,Because it is a voluntary political association that has a right to decide for it self how a governing body shall be composed.
1978.78-647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1765.367,1774.086,Well do you think -- do you think the state can impose the duty on the party if the party doesn't want to perform?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1774.086,1778.007,I don't know Mr. Justice White.
1978.78-647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1778.007,1783.986,"Well, do you suppose it can prevent the party from doing something that the party wants to do?"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1783.986,1788.615,"If the party wishes to take a position on a particular issue, it certainly can do that."
1978.78-647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.176,1812.754,"Well is there some law of Washington or under the Constitution that would -- if you don't like the rules about the Democratic Party or the Republican party in Washington, there's no reason you can't form another one."
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1816.984,1819.487,This is not a realistic alternative for members of the Democratic Party because they're permitted to its ideas.
1978.78-647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.487,1826.491,I know because you -- I know because you wanted to take advantage of the provision for getting candidates on the ballot.
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1826.491,1833.006,"We are not, Mr. Justice White, taking advantages of provisions for getting candidates on the ballot."
1978.78-647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1849.756,1853.596,"Mr. Goldmark, I want to ask you one question before you sit down."
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1872.136,1873.199,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1978.78-647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1873.199,1880.108,"And is it your position then that no matter what the requirement of the statute is, it would be subject to this attack under the First Amendment?"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1880.108,1881.249,"No, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1978.78-647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1895.24,1900.998,"One party member per -- I mean, one voting party member or one voter -- I mean what --"
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1900.998,1908.965,So that the constituency is a State Committee members are composed of approximate equal members of party members or the electorate.
1978.78-647,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1908.965,1914.9,That would be a compelling state interest for having every county represented would not be a compelling state interest?
1978.78-647,0,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,1914.9,1922.493,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens, I said it might."
1978.78-647,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1922.493,1925.904,Mr. Brink.
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,1925.904,1929.158,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court."
1978.78-647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2008.933,2011.138,"Now, when you say “they” is that the state legislature?"
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2011.138,2014.649,"The state legislature, yes Your Honor."
1978.78-647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2107.614,2109.249,May I ask this?
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2114.457,2116.9,"Its powers, by statute, are limited to those."
1978.78-647,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2134.472,2140.649,"What do you think, Mr. Brink, is the federal issue involved in this case?"
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2140.649,2155.347,I do not believe there to be a federal issue because I do not believe there to be a -- an infringement at all upon anybody's rights to associate.
1978.78-647,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2182.095,2193.17,"But you make your case -- do you make your case, I'll put it that way, if you demonstrate to us that there is no federal issue involved in the case?"
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2197.3,2200.422,Mr. Chief Justice that is of course our position.
1978.78-647,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2200.422,2204.392,"Well now, why not focus sharply on that?"
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2204.392,2206.608,I will attempt to.
1978.78-647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2235.674,2253.451,Well is there anything in the Washington law that would prevent the convention from forming a committee whatever you wanted it do to perform all the functions that the convention wanted it to perform except the ones that the statute says the central committee has to perform?
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2253.451,2255.123,"I agree, Your Honor."
1978.78-647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2261.589,2281.393,And so that in so far as -- so that you think the issue really is here whether or not it's constitutional for the state to say that the committee that -- that the central committee that is to perform these five functions have to be two from each county?
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2283.923,2287.683,If the legislature said it should be two from each county and --
1978.78-647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2287.683,2289.248,For it to perform these particular functions.
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2289.248,2291.112,"Yes, just these limited functions."
1978.78-647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.535,2297.808,I understand you say that's really the only issue that's here.
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2297.808,2299.672,That is to us the only issue that is here.
1978.78-647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.672,2309.599,Because the party could provide for -- under the statute that the party could have all the other functions that the State Committee might be given to perform.
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2311.962,2319.068,It can and in fact they have set up a judicial committee by the charter.
1978.78-647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2323.659,2332.638,"Well Mr. Brink, this category five perform all functions inherent in such an organization."
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2335.083,2348.505,That is not very broad in view of the King County Republican case in which the Washington State Supreme Court said that subject to the overriding power of the state convention.
1978.78-647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2353.355,2362.964,"Even the exercise of 1, 2, 3 and 4 under the case you mentioned, the subject to the overriding authority of the convention?"
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2362.964,2371.794,"Absolutely, that is the holding of the Washington State Supreme Court back at 1971 in King County Republican case."
1978.78-647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.118,2394.488,"So your -- you say that under this -- under the Washington law, the -- while there must be a central committee with two members from each county, the convention could remove -- could say if the committee has no functions?"
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2394.488,2396.594,They could theoretically do that in our view.
1978.78-647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2396.594,2404.328,"And will set up another committee to do all the things they want them to do, and will have this committee composed any way they wanted to?"
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2404.328,2417.439,"Right, but they must allow the State Central Committee as set up by statute to exist to attempt to coordinate at least the election procedures of the 39 different counties and their own county committees."
1978.78-647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2629.247,2630.874,What party was that in 1948?
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2630.874,2631.78,"Progressive Party, Your Honor."
1978.78-647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2631.78,2634.664,Progressive.
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2634.664,2637.289,They got enough vote to qualify for the next time.
1978.78-647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2637.289,2637.948,I see.
1978.78-647,1,20608,daniel_p_brink,,2637.948,2642.257,Didn't follow through.
1978.78-647,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2679.964,2681.172,Thank you Mr. Brink.
1978.78-647,2,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,2691.488,2696.965,This case cannot be distinguished from Cousins versus Wigoda.
1978.78-647,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2745.977,2754.5,Didn't the Illinois court there enjoin those representatives from presenting themselves as delegates to the national convention?
1978.78-647,2,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,2754.5,2757.693,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist and that is the effect of this statute."
1978.78-647,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2765.056,2782.247,So you must have to say that the State Central Committee created by a statue in Washington is of the same political and associational significance as the Democratic or Republican National Convention sitting every four years to choose a presidential candidate?
1978.78-647,2,19019,charles_a_goldmark,,2782.247,2785.728,It is of the same significance for freedom of association.
1978.78-647,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2825.711,2826.419,Thank you gentlemen.
