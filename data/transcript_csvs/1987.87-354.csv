1987.87-354,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We'll hear argument next No. 87-354, Arizona versus Ronald William Roberson."
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,18.312,26.115,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.87-354,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,118.91,128.183,What if he had been aware that he had exercised his right to counsel with respect to another crime being investigated?
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,128.183,131.318,The other crime was not in the picture at all at this stage.
1987.87-354,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,131.318,138.741,"I know, but what if the second officer knew that he had invoked his right to counsel at an earlier time?"
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,138.741,146.66,"Our position would be if in fact there were a separate investigation as arose in this case, it would be appropriate to ask."
1987.87-354,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,146.66,148.096,So you'd be making the same argument?
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,148.096,148.696,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,152.298,156.868,Why shouldn't there be a separate warning?
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,156.868,159.837,--There were in fact separate warnings given.
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,159.837,160.904,Separate?
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,160.904,162.356,"Yes, each time."
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,162.356,164.339,That second one was a separate warning?
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,164.339,165.022,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,168.26,169.493,He was rewarned?
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,169.493,170.11,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,170.11,173.812,So that they admitted that there were separate proceedings?
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,173.812,174.995,That's correct.
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,174.995,178.18,"Otherwise, they wouldn't have given the separate warnings?"
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,178.18,179.799,I believe not.
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,179.799,190.856,"But they if they knew there were separate proceedings, why didn't they abide by the Miranda rule which says, once you want a lawyer and make it clear the questioning stops?"
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,190.856,198.443,"Well, neither in Miranda nor in Edwards was there a multiple investigation situation going on."
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,219.357,220.959,Westover was very well argued.
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,220.959,221.543,--Pardon me?
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,221.543,224.043,Westover was very well argued.
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,224.043,227.011,And I believe that the Court resolved--
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,227.011,227.863,I argued it.
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,227.863,257.113,"--The point of Westover though is, and in connection with Mosley was the indication that if in fact there were a separate investigation that proper warnings were given so that the people in the succeeding investigation were not simply taking advantage of whatever badgering or wearing do xx had occurred in the first investigation, that that second investigation should be treated separately."
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,264.036,268.504,I don't want to be questioned.
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,292.119,293.305,"--Well, the Court has indicated--"
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,293.305,294.571,Why do you do that?
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,294.571,298.273,--Because there are legitimate police investigations--
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,298.273,302.661,Because you expect him to go and give xx and breakdown.
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,302.661,305.779,--I would not characterize it as breaking down.
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,313.283,318.771,Is there any restrictions on how many times you can question a prisoner?
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,322.408,342.952,"--The rule that Arizona is suggesting ought to be applied is that if in fact the per se rule of Edwards is maintained at all, that you essentially get one bite at the apple or one chance to interrogate the individual per separate investigation."
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,342.952,347.606,That's in the Westover case.
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,370.138,370.954,Certainly.
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,370.954,377.058,"And that's what the State court says, just about."
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,377.058,389.033,"That is the approach that they've taken, but again, it's the State of Arizona's position that what actually happened was an undue extension of Miranda and Edwards beyond their facts."
1987.87-354,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,414.5,423.356,Is the State's position the same if the interrogator were to see an individual in both interrogation?
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,423.356,425.039,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-354,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,425.039,436.931,So it makes no difference even though that might influence the defendant that perhaps it's a continuation of the first interrogation.
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,446.471,458.01,"Detective Quinn was a common element, but he was not present at the time that Mr. Roberson actually said that he wanted a lawyer."
1987.87-354,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,463.898,465.016,"But Quinn knew about it, didn't he?"
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,465.016,465.916,"--No, he did not."
1987.87-354,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,471.754,475.039,"I know they stipulated, but why wouldn't he be aware of it?"
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,475.039,479.276,"--No one told him, including Mr. Roberson."
1987.87-354,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,503.908,521.02,"It seems to me that in a large and efficiently operated police department, a request for a lawyer ought to be regarded as known to every interrogator, xx or otherwise."
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,521.02,530.458,"Well, the difficulty is that in a fast breaking situation, even in the best of departments, that doesn't always work."
1987.87-354,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,535.612,539.414,"Well, the fast breaking aspect is one of the difficulties that you face, I think."
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,539.414,552.306,"So, we have this situation where in fact none of the succeeding officers was aware that any indication for counsel had taken place."
1987.87-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.306,556.776,"Mr. Ferg, as I understood your answer to Justice White, that really doesn't make any difference to your legal position."
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,556.776,557.693,No.
1987.87-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,557.693,564.799,"Your position, as I understand it, is if you have five or six unsolved burglaries in the same neighborhood, you could question him about one."
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,573.737,576.121,"Well, what Mosley did and what--"
1987.87-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,576.121,576.956,Is that right?
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,576.956,578.006,"--Not exactly, sir."
1987.87-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,578.006,578.672,"Well, why not?"
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,581.374,593.016,"What we are suggesting is that, as was suggested in Mosley, that there has to be facts which indicate a scrupulous observance and that includes separation in time."
1987.87-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,596.801,599.435,"Yes, but a minute ago, you said it didn't have to be a separate officer."
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,601.704,607.423,What we're suggesting is that there reason has to be an examination of the totality of the circumstances.
1987.87-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,607.423,610.643,"Well, I don't understand why."
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,624.835,631.824,"Under the rule that we're asking for, you could, presuming that it was in fact a separate investigation."
1987.87-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,631.824,632.574,"Well, yes."
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,643.114,650.951,"Well, there are various ways in which a separate investigation could be conceivably be defined."
1987.87-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,650.951,653.053,"Well, you have a separate file on each robbery."
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,656.255,664.444,"There could be a separate type of crime, same type of crime, different events."
1987.87-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.413,670.532,But none of those are necessary as I understand your argument.
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,672.048,687.274,"I have been unable to come up with any single factor which would properly distinguish all cases, and that's why it seems to be appropriate to indicate that the totality of the circumstances is the only way to approach it."
1987.87-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,687.274,693.797,What you're saying is that the per se doesn't apply if it's a separate investigation whatever that means.
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,693.797,694.73,Correct.
1987.87-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.73,701.784,But you would continue to look at the confession to see whether in fact it was coerced?
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,701.784,702.919,Yes.
1987.87-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,702.919,706.605,Which could take into account all of these other factors that you're concerned about.
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,706.605,706.855,Yes.
1987.87-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.855,711.323,You would absolutely eliminate the per se rule so long as it's a separate investigation?
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,711.323,712.057,Yes.
1987.87-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.025,714.692,No.
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,716.627,736.022,"Assuming that this Court intends to maintain Edwards in some form, what Arizona is arguing for is that it not be applied beyond Edwards facts, namely, in a situation where you have more than one investigation going on."
1987.87-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,756.019,761.823,"I thought's that what I said, there's no per se disqualification for the second investigation."
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,768.595,769.411,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,769.411,775.915,"What exactly did he say, did the prison say to the officer?"
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,778.867,785.538,"Well, the only wording that we have is from a summary police report and whether that is word for word or not is not clear."
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,794.894,807.137,"Well, did, does that not, could that not be forever, that I don't want to answer any questions about anything until I get my lawyer."
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,809.922,816.509,"Well, that is a semantically permissible interpretation of that, but legally it would--"
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,816.509,823.313,But your interpretation is that I don't want to talk about anything else.
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,826.182,834.538,"--Well, the only investigation that was in view to anyone at the time he invoked his rights was the one which he was in fact grabbed at the scene."
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,837.49,839.106,He wasn't released was he?
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,839.106,841.125,"--No, he was kept in custody."
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,848.88,851.915,"But he was still under prison, he was still under."
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,851.915,858.403,"In jail, yes."
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,899.194,914.138,"What happens under your theory if in the second interrogation which is lawful, he admits to something that pertains to the first investigation?"
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,915.99,917.692,I would argue that it would be.
1987.87-354,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,917.692,919.258,I thought so.
1987.87-354,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,919.258,922.994,Because the police have in that instance done nothing inappropriate.
1987.87-354,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.759,1052.028,"Thank you, Mr. Ferg."
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1053.878,1066.454,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1987.87-354,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.268,1197.022,"About the request for counsel being a fiction, is that true if three or four days go by and no lawyer ever shows up?"
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1218.935,1226.941,"But that isn't likely to be something he's going to blame at the doorstep of, in my example for instance, the FBI when they come into to talk to him."
1987.87-354,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.964,1235.747,I understand.
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1235.747,1238.932,Because he has invoked his right to counsel with respect to what's there.
1987.87-354,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1238.932,1249.557,But you were making the point the fact there was a different interrogator he would still feel quite confident that his right to counsel was not merely a fiction.
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1261.781,1268.018,"Well, he's not going to believe it's fictional in a sense that they are just going to repeatedly interrogate him even though he's asked for it."
1987.87-354,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1281.861,1289.432,"And they say again, we will provide you a lawyer if you want one, he'll take that at face value even though that same thing that was said three days earlier and he never got a lawyer."
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1289.432,1297.62,"--Well, he may not take it at literal face value, but what he will realize is this: he'll realize that these police have told him they're going to talk about a different matter."
1987.87-354,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1329.426,1330.976,I'm a little confused.
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1334.628,1336.93,"A local police officer, Your Honor, xx--"
1987.87-354,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1336.93,1341.899,And the second was an FBI man?
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1341.899,1344.518,"--In my hypothetical, not in this case."
1987.87-354,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1344.518,1345.335,Oh.
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1363.33,1368.817,It would certainly be an appropriate thing for the FBI to do.
1987.87-354,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1368.817,1369.734,Should we require that?
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1369.734,1373.621,Whether you're going to require an additional warning--
1987.87-354,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1373.621,1374.271,Yes.
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1374.271,1375.988,--of that type I think would be inappropriate.
1987.87-354,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1375.988,1378.74,"Why, if this is what he thinks."
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1391.296,1395.117,Because I think it would probably become as soon as he starts asking a question.
1987.87-354,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1395.117,1396.85,"Well, if it's apparent then what's the harm?"
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1396.85,1405.49,The harm may simply be that adding an additional type of rule into this circumstance may perhaps complicate the matter unnecessarily.
1987.87-354,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1407.942,1418.65,"Let's take this case, Mr. Larkin, your assumption unfortunately that he knows that he can't be questioned about the first crime doesn't fit very well into the facts of this particular case."
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1430.457,1431.723,Yes.
1987.87-354,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1431.723,1439.146,So this particular defendant had no reason to believe that they indeed kept their promise that when he asked for counsel that he wouldn't be bothered further.
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1439.146,1443.265,"Well, he... that's because of the peculiarities of this particular case."
1987.87-354,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.265,1446.15,Well unfortunately that's the case we're deciding.
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1446.15,1451.304,But what we're asking the Court to do is recognize that this general rule should apply.
1987.87-354,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1467.646,1472.95,"Well, in this case, should the confession be suppressed, in this case?"
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1472.95,1475.986,The confession in this case should not be.
1987.87-354,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1476.902,1477.469,Why?
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1477.469,1483.14,--was one that was on April 19th about the April 16th burglary.
1987.87-354,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1483.14,1490.912,And you think the repeated violations of his rights are irrelevant as to the second crime?
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1490.912,1500.184,It's relevant only if you take into account the possibility that his waiver has been overcome because he's been badgered by the police.
1987.87-354,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1563.508,1567.912,Suppose the police arrest somebody for shop lifting and they think they had a murder.
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1573.298,1575.066,"--No, I think not."
1987.87-354,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1575.066,1576.249,--to investigate for the murder?
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1578.351,1589.374,"It's not... both... the factors that have to be considered in deciding whether you have a separate investigation we think are first, the subject matter of the inquiry and second the identity of the people conducting it."
1987.87-354,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1590.492,1594.111,"Well, the subject matter of the inquiry is different and you have a different team?"
1987.87-354,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1594.111,1610.655,"--You may have a different team there in that circumstance, but it may also be that the police knew this person had committed the murder at the time they made the arrest, and in that sort of circumstance, it may not be appropriate to apply this sort of rule."
1987.87-354,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1613.691,1622.88,"Well, then you tell me the exception in that I hypothesized."
1987.87-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.572,1690.874,"Thank you, Mr. Larkin."
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,1693.409,1698.095,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1987.87-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.55,1757.417,Excuse me.
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,1778.63,1792.49,"Your Honor, it's my position that four times, he was questioned four different times, that we can presume that if it happened in this case, it's going to happen again."
1987.87-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1822.842,1824.694,--He only asked the first one for counsel.
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,1835.834,1836.251,Yes.
1987.87-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.251,1838.786,So you have one officer who didn't tell the others.
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,1838.786,1839.486,Correct.
1987.87-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.486,1842.238,"And that's bad, it's wrong, but it's not necessarily shameful."
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,1842.238,1859.866,"He was then transported to the police station after being questioned twice, and there questioned again by a two new officers."
1987.87-354,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1906.264,1908.997,What was he being held under?
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,1908.997,1909.882,--Pardon?
1987.87-354,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1909.882,1914.084,Was he charged with any crime these three days?
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,1914.084,1914.601,Yes.
1987.87-354,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1918.136,1919.119,Was he arraigned?
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,1919.119,1920.671,"--No, he was not arraigned."
1987.87-354,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1920.671,1923.54,How long can you hold somebody in Arizona?
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,1923.54,1925.223,More than three days.
1987.87-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2002.623,2006.277,Why is that necessarily true?
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2050.39,2064.13,"Your Honor, my focus, or I think I'm not showing that to say what was in his mind in deciding that he wanted a lawyer, but how he interpreted their statement."
1987.87-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2082.861,2084.877,"Well, that may be."
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2088.229,2094.752,"Well, that's the question."
1987.87-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.988,2106.374,"Well, it was accomplished for a period of two to three days and then a new circumstance obtains."
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2119.784,2123.669,"Your Honor, he didn't say that he did not want to talk about it."
1987.87-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2141.713,2150.838,"Well, Miranda means simply that a defendant, as I understand it, has a right to not answer questions unless a lawyer is provided."
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2159.559,2160.144,Correct.
1987.87-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2204.473,2210.794,"Well, as I say, all he had to say was, no, on the fourth day and it would have been accomplished."
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2222.101,2226.386,"Chief Justice, I don't think it is technical; I think it's very substantive."
1987.87-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.271,2289.662,"If there had been no repeated questionings, and if there were the preface to the questioning on the second charge that Justice Kennedy suggested, you would have no problem?"
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2289.662,2299.852,"I would have a problem because perhaps if we had one more hypothetical, I would have no problem, and that is, the original warnings did not use the broad terms."
1987.87-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.996,2319.681,I see.
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2325.935,2330.037,And that has been explicitly rejected by this Court in Colorado v. Spring.
1987.87-354,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2371.947,2375.851,But you conceded that this is a separate investigation?
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2380.803,2388.842,"I think there's various arguments in the briefs talking about separate members, separate investigations."
1987.87-354,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2406.704,2411.358,But I thought you began by saying at the outset that you agreed that this was a separate investigation?
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2411.358,2421.064,"--Well, I think, little s and little i, if this Court is going to adopt some concept of separateness, this is way too blurry a case to do it."
1987.87-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2550.06,2554.614,What about the defendant who wants to talk about the second.
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2595.858,2602.944,"Well, certainly you can initiate the conversation but you don't know that there's any investigation going on."
1987.87-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.944,2603.511,That's right.
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2603.511,2608.748,I don't see how it would benefit you by having the police explain to you that investigation.
1987.87-354,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2735.931,2756.945,"I suppose part of your submission is that any time a person asks for a lawyer and says, I don't want to answer any questions, then everybody in the police department must be assumed to know that?"
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2756.945,2758.629,Yes.
1987.87-354,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2793.052,2797.256,Yet it was stipulated here that the officer didn't know.
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2797.256,2809.063,"No, that is, it is stipulated that they didn't know, but it has been argued by the Solicitor General that we will put too heavy a burden on the subsequent investigative agencies to find out."
1987.87-354,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2816.883,2829.727,"Stipulation, they just can't stipulate out from... the police can't avoid the presumption that everybody in the department knows."
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2847.604,2863.281,"I think that this Court does have... I think that's the status of it, but my question is, what is the relevance of their ignorance when the issue here is to prevent coercive confessions, not to put a broad exclusionary rule or to deter--"
1987.87-354,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2863.281,2865.816,So you say you just don't need a presumption that everybody knew?
1987.87-354,2,38680,robert_l_barrasso,,2865.816,2867.266,--No.
1987.87-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2923.533,2925.635,"Thank you, Mr. Barrasso."
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,2928.271,2932.306,"Thank you, sir."
1987.87-354,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2932.306,2941.412,--arraigning in your State?
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,2941.412,2951.534,"In Arizona, and this is one of the points I wanted to make, the individual must be brought before a magistrate for his initial appearance within 24 hours."
1987.87-354,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2954.152,2956.421,"Well, was this man brought before a magistrate."
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,2956.421,2957.038,--Yes.
1987.87-354,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2957.038,2961.175,Did the magistrate ask him about a lawyer?
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,2961.175,2970.014,"He was informed at that stage that he had the right to a lawyer, and as an indigent, the exact proceedings--"
1987.87-354,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2970.014,2974.15,And the magistrate could have appointed a lawyer for him?
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,2974.15,2987.91,"--My understanding is that if they did things as they were supposed to have done, the initial appearance was not transcribed, but if they followed the rules, he was told that he has the right to a lawyer--"
1987.87-354,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2987.91,2990.927,"But in this case, he wasn't carried before a magistrate."
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,2990.927,2993.629,"--He was taken before a magistrate, as far as we know."
1987.87-354,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2993.629,2994.663,Is that in the record?
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,2994.663,3008.639,"In the record which I believe is before this Court, it shows his initial appearance on the 17th, the day after his... and under the Arizona rules, that initial appearance includes being asked whether he has a counsel."
1987.87-354,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3008.639,3011.008,And you give us your word that it's in the record?
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,3011.008,3013.008,"I believe that it is, yes, sir."
1987.87-354,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3013.008,3014.127,You believe it is.
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,3018.262,3020.531,"At a simple initial appearance, no."
1987.87-354,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.531,3025.416,But ordinarily he would be asked if he wants a lawyer?
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,3025.416,3031.153,"He would be informed of his right to counsel and told that if he didn't have one, that the public defender would in fact--"
1987.87-354,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3031.153,3032.338,Represent him.
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,3032.338,3034.706,--represent him and someone would be at the jail within a couple of days to see him.
1987.87-354,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.706,3039.575,So we don't know whether that transpired or not?
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,3039.575,3045.896,I've no reason to believe that it did not because that's what the rules stipulate must happen.
1987.87-354,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3045.896,3052.335,"Well, do you suppose the officers who did the questioning the second time, knew?"
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,3064.643,3072.296,"They might well have assumed that, but again, that is talking essentially in Sixth Amendment terms rather than in Miranda Fifth Amendment terms."
1987.87-354,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3085.389,3086.405,About that second one.
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,3086.405,3087.455,That's correct.
1987.87-354,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3144.428,3145.411,Let me ask you a question.
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,3154.049,3154.382,--Yes?
1987.87-354,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3154.382,3163.405,"--would you think that if the police knew he had a lawyer for the first offense, they could go ahead and question him on the second offense without giving notice to his lawyer that they were going to do so?"
1987.87-354,3,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,3163.405,3165.688,I would argue that they could.
1987.87-354,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3165.688,3166.373,They could.
1987.87-354,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3166.373,3168.907,"Thank you, Mr. Ferg."
