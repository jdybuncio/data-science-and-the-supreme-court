1959.485,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,277.323,277.587,Yes.
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,277.587,286.589,The mainline and then the sidetrack came off it and 150 feet of that sidetrack was owned by the railroad and was maintained by the railroad.
1959.485,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,288.882,290.466,(Inaudible)
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,290.466,292.12,It was the end tying into railroad.
1959.485,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,292.12,296.114,"I just wondered the fact, what to another track."
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,296.114,297.533,"Your Honor, if it drew, it --"
1959.485,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,297.533,299.741,(Inaudible)

1959.485,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,396.281,400.753,"And you say the president of the company, you mean the M. & M. -- the Turpentine Company?"
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,400.753,403.867,"Yes, Your Honor.That's right."
1959.485,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,582.358,592.018,"But in that sense, I maybe wrong, but you are using the -- the phrase, “railroad foreman” for the purposes of identifying Mr. Keen."
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,592.85,594.064,"That's -- that's right, Your Honor."
1959.485,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,599.878,606.122,"But do you mean to say that it's agreed, he was serving them in the capacity of employee of the railroad?"

1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,885.002,885.569,That's right.
1959.485,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,885.569,886.555,Considering --
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,886.555,887.3,"That's right, Your Honor."
1959.485,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,887.3,894.425,(Inaudible)
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,894.425,898.552,"Exactly, Your Honor, precisely."
1959.485,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1126.709,1136.481,Does the record show that uniformly the Turpentine Company had used its railroad employees to maintain the track?
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1136.481,1137.907,"Your Honor, I submit, it does."
1959.485,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1155.186,1161.651,Does it show what you had paid them and what the details were in the former instances?
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1161.651,1163.422,"Not in the former instances, Your Honor."
1959.485,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1211.76,1214.376,For the cost of the 1350 feet of it.
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1214.376,1214.652,Exactly.
1959.485,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1214.652,1217.109,That's on the private property of Turpentine Company?
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1217.109,1218.629,That's right.
1959.485,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1320.192,1326.681,(Inaudible)
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1326.681,1327.58,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1959.485,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1353.183,1356.421,(Inaudible)
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1356.421,1367.007,"Certainly, it's had -- now, we certainly contended in the court below, very strongly, that if the point, that if as the petitioner testified, had happened."
1959.485,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1402.976,1423.32,"Do you think -- may I ask you, is that all the court did in -- is trying to determine as a predicate to a defense verdict, namely, it required -- requiring that the man, the petitioner, had been told that he was working for someone else?"
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1423.32,1423.875,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.485,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1425.502,1436.583,"Do you think that's what the language set forth by the Fifth Circuit during at page of 167, the (Inaudible)"
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1436.583,1438.23,"The language in the footnote, Your Honor?"
1959.485,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1438.23,1439.532,In Footnote 10.
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1444.869,1446.481,"I -- I think so, yes, Your Honor."
1959.485,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1455.593,1460.925,"Now, do you think made it clear to him has the same significance as told?"
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1460.925,1470.383,I certainly -- I -- I think what the Court was -- was getting at was what the petitioner himself understood at the time.
1959.485,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1470.633,1480.248,"Now, you went ahead and you said to the court to the presence of the jury, “Your Honor, to make it clear, he was working for some third person, not working for the railroad.”"
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1503.178,1503.877,"Yes, he was, Your Honor."
1959.485,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1503.877,1518.853,That if you find in this evidence that he was so advised before he went out there to work and went out on his own volition and joined the others to make some extra money and he was not an employee of the railroad and you would and they would not be liable and so forth.
1959.485,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1523.351,1546.117,"Your Honor, I don't -- I -- I think, this is not the complete charge on the employment issue and the reason that I stood up at that point, which is at the conclusion of the charge and the objective was because, it seemed to me, that the judge was telling them that if he understood that he was working on a private track, why then, he wasn't working for the railroad?"
1959.485,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1561.699,1563.189,Mr. Dell.
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,1563.189,1567.493,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please Your Honors."
1959.485,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1705.451,1711.432,Did he use the word as he understood?
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,1711.432,1712.801,Mr. Chief Justice.
1959.485,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1712.801,1716.053,"I'm looking at page 153, as to the first."
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,1716.053,1717.413,Yes.
1959.485,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1717.413,1718.102,You said in --
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,1718.102,1725.529,The foreman had made it clear to him that he was working for some third person and not the railroad.
1959.485,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1745.086,1747.289,What record page is that?
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,1747.289,1747.748,"Beg your pardon, sir."
1959.485,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1747.748,1749.286,What record page?
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,1749.286,1750.014,153.
1959.485,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1991.48,2018.508,"Suppose, Mr. Dell, this (Inaudible)"
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,2018.508,2021.936,"Your Honor, let me [Laughs] correct your statement in just one thing."
1959.485,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2067.521,2067.993,(Inaudible)
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,2067.993,2069.623,In front -- in front of their property.
1959.485,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2470.049,2473.208,(Inaudible) used for its own purpose.
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,2473.208,2477.415,"So far as the record discloses Your Honor, it -- it had not."
1959.485,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2804.883,2806.552,"That's not admitted, however."
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,2809.233,2809.966,Absolutely.
1959.485,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2832.294,2836.254,Supposed the -- supposed it's been entered by some defective tools?
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,2836.254,2838.258,That would have raised an entirely different question.
1959.485,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2838.258,2841.091,(Inaudible) has been liable.
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,2841.091,2841.983,I don't think so.
1959.485,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2861.247,2862.535,I'm only suggesting the fact --
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,2862.535,2862.752,"No, sir."
1959.485,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2899.899,2919.002,"May I ask you sir, was there any exemption taken to the recharge of the jury after -- at counsel -- what petitioner's request during (Inaudible)"
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,2919.002,2919.443,"No, sir."
1959.485,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2919.443,2923.65,Then the accepting taken by the petitioner that recharge?
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,2923.65,2925.896,The petitioner asked for it.
1959.485,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2925.896,2928.064,I know he asked for it and got -- and --
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,2928.064,2928.407,"No, sir."
1959.485,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2929.63,2929.825,No exception --
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,2929.825,2944.608,"-- then because the -- the court, in effect, did exactly what the counsel for the petitioner asked him to do and that was to spell it out from the jury once more that they had defined that the petitioner knew that he was working for a third party and not the railroad."
1959.485,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2944.608,2951.371,"Because there wasn't this, after the trial judge had refused the request of charge in a broader form?"

1959.485,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2965.445,2967.121,"There's a limit to which he would charge, but if the --"
1959.485,1,41210,sam_t_dell_jr,,2967.121,2967.662,"That's right, sir."
