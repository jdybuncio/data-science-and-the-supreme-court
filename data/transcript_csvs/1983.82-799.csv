1983.82-799,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,62.848,"Ms. Corwin, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,62.848,66.595,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-799,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,210.741,230.796,"Ms. Corwin, in 7131(a) where the statute says that the employee representative, exclusive representative, shall be authorized official time for such purposes, does that mean anything more than that his federal salary will be paid during those and he will not have to take leave?"
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,230.796,232.965,That is the understanding.
1983.82-799,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,258.347,261.314,Does that mean travel time?
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,261.314,278.214,"It did not mean travel time under the executive order program, and we suggest that the term ""official time"" as it grew up in the labor relations program indicated that you did not have this right to federal reimbursement of your travel time."
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,278.214,282.009,Did it not at least mean that you were on official business?
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,282.009,283.931,"No, it definitely--"
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,283.931,291.286,You mean they were paying the employee when he was on unofficial business?
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,291.286,297.268,--The understanding of official time was that the salary was paid--
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,297.268,298.722,Because why?
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,298.722,305.094,--There were several reasons that... Are you referring to the old executive order program at this point?
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,305.094,307.171,I am referring to the statute we are construing.
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,307.171,314.323,"The statute we are construing uses the term ""official time"" as it was used under the executive order program and that is why--"
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,314.323,322.353,"Well, why do you think Congress would authorize unlimited time for collective bargaining purposes and pay for it?"
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,322.353,328.538,"--Well, I think there are several rationales that Congress probably had in mind."
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,328.538,330.566,Did they say which one they had in mind?
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,330.566,342.954,"In the legislative history of the 1978 Act you do not have any statement of why it was that Congress concluded... For example, in the House report you do not have any explanation of why they incorporated this."
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,368.909,377.485,So I suppose they were paying them either because they considered it official business or because they thought it was in the public interest to subsidize collective bargaining.
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,377.485,384.656,"Well, I think there were several considerations, but the assumption that it was official business was not one of them."
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,386.967,387.513,How do you know?
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,387.513,393.074,--The Comptroller General had been asked this question early on in the executive order program.
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,393.074,394.478,Is he the final interpreter of congressional intent?
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,394.478,420.89,"The Comptroller General had been consulted in his capacity as the individual who makes rulings on expenditures of federal funds, and his conclusion was under this executive order program even if an employee was granted official time, that is, even if his salary was paid that did not translate into official business for the federal government, that in essence the employee--"
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,420.89,423.172,What was the rationale for paying the salary?
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,423.172,430.997,"--Well, several rationales were suggested in the various reports underlying the executive order program."
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,431.98,435.883,Did the Comptroller General say what it was?
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,435.883,455.081,"--Well, the Comptroller General in ruling on the official business point suggested that even though it had been stated in the executive order that collective bargaining might be in the public interest, it was nevertheless not equivalent to official business."
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,469.026,474.32,But that was... They surely must have been concerned with making collective bargaining work.
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,474.32,486.362,"That is certainly true, and I think that has always been the case under the federal labor relations program that that clearly was a concern that Congress had in the 1978 Act."
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,507.307,521.286,"Well, surely the federal government is doing something with respect to collective bargaining representatives that industry does not do, or does industry do the same thing?"
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,521.286,524.066,"No, this is not the practice in industry."
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.81,539.513,Even by paying salaries?
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,539.513,550.353,The only instances in which that occurred would be when the parties had agreed to it through a negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement.
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,550.353,556.6,"Well, then the government does subsidize the process to an extent that private industry does not."
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,556.6,568.596,"That is so, and in 1978 I think you have a very careful consideration by Congress in determining what it ought to put into this legislation about how far it ought to go in terms of--"
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,568.596,571.188,"By using that word ""official time""?"
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,571.188,582.466,"--Well, I think the terminology ""official time"" is what they picked up from the old executive order program, and I think it is significant that they used that term as opposed to some other term they might have used."
1983.82-799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,684.828,686.918,May I ask you a question right there?
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,719.611,728.37,"Well, I think the general principle that you have set out is one with which we agree that an administrative agency normally does deserve deference."
1983.82-799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,745.816,748.78,What if we were persuaded that the Congress just never thought of this problem?
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,748.78,759.043,"--Well, I think that there are several other points that you ought to consider in determining whether deference is due if that is the concern here."
1983.82-799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,771.818,783.782,"Will it not always be true that in the labor disputes that this agency has jurisdiction that there will always be a potential for imposing costs on the sovereign and, therefore, every time it rules against the government they are not entitled to deference?"
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,783.782,804.917,"No, I think that is not the case because Congress clearly had in mind that the remedies ordered by the Authority would involve things like back pay, and it did include within Title VII a specific reference to the Back Pay Act because it anticipated that this sort of award was going to come up on a regular basis."
1983.82-799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.387,897.447,"Ms. Corwin, you have given me the reasons why they should get less deference than agencies often get."
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,911.254,948.861,"I do not think that under the circumstances of this particular case that the Authority ought to receive any deference because of the principle that in the case of imposition of monetary liability on the federal government the presumption of this Court has always been that one does not read that into the statute absent some expression of congressional intent, but I think even if the Court did determine that there ought to be some deference it is not enough to overcome the indications of that principle and other indications that suggest that Congress did not--"
1983.82-799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,948.861,951.439,Put your answer to my question really is they are not entitled to any deference?
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,951.439,955.782,--That would be our position under the circumstances of this particular case.
1983.82-799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.782,961.796,But in effect they are construing a statute that is committed to the Comptroller General rather than to them.
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,961.796,968.526,I think that is one point that they have gone outside of their own statute and that diminishes any deference.
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.445,991.985,I thought you were... You really said earlier that you thought the Congress had really addressed it in the sense that it had limited the subsidization to official time and that that is a term of art.
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,991.985,994.111,I think that is correct.
1983.82-799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.746,1005.42,And as though it said and no more.
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1005.42,1016.9,"--Yes, I think this is a statute which Congress considered quite carefully how far to go, and as I was suggesting to Justice Stevens there were people who were urging it to go much further."
1983.82-799,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1036.748,1037.248,That is all.
1983.82-799,0,18633,carolyn_corwin,,1049.87,1068.127,"I think that general principle is certainly applicable here, but I think in this particular context in this statute you do have rather careful consideration about whether the Congress ought to go further in terms of subsidizing unions and subsidizing collective bargaining."
1983.82-799,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1374.207,1384.795,Very well.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1385.17,1387.731,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-799,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1484.755,1491.751,Is it your view that Congress just absentmindedly overlooked this problem?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1491.751,1494.625,--I do not think Congress overlooked it.
1983.82-799,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1505.434,1512.134,Do you agree that it shows that Congress had the general subject matter in mind?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1512.134,1520.755,"It had in mind what status it wanted these people to be on while they were bargaining, negotiating and--"
1983.82-799,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1520.755,1525.286,Would that not reasonably suggest all the other problems that were related to it?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1525.286,1555.056,"--I think that Congress could have seen that it chose the phrase NTEU, in this regard that it is significant that Congress chose this term because it does equate with duty time or work time and is different from nonduty time or leave or administrative leave or excused absence."
1983.82-799,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1593.508,1609.988,Do you agree with the proposition that before you can hold the United States government responsible of the payment of money it has to be in clear and unambiguous language?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1609.988,1617.296,"--Well, I certainly do not agree with the Petitioner's approach to the authority that they have cited in their brief."
1983.82-799,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1617.296,1619.047,I did not say the Petitioners.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1620.809,1635.226,"Well, there are a number of statutes that deal with the federal work force that have broad statutory terms such as ""official time"" or in the Fair Labor Standards Act, for example, ""hours of work""."
1983.82-799,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1648.597,1656.591,Give me one statute that says official time which includes travel time.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1656.591,1660.12,--I cannot cite you to a statute that says official time--
1983.82-799,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1660.12,1661.028,But do you not need one?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1661.028,1678.365,"--No, because I think official time means duty time or duty status and that connotes that it is official business within the meaning of the Travel Expense Act and that the things that you have going when you are on official time, paid time, time for which you are paid by the government--"
1983.82-799,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1678.365,1686.722,Would you go so far as to say that if you go to a meeting in Paris you could charge the government with the Concorde rates?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1686.722,1697.59,"--Well, that would be a subject I guess for the GSA travel regulations as to what kind of carrier you can take, but that is not really the issue here."
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.902,1709.46,"But is your sole reliance not on the language ""official time""?"
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1709.46,1712.382,Our sole reliance on that?
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.382,1720.862,"Yes, that should be interpreted to mean official business and hence subject to reimbursement for travel expenses."
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1720.862,1729.282,"Well, our reliance is on that and our reliance is on the congressional objectives and purposes where they found collective bargaining to be in the public interest."
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.282,1737.011,"I know, but if they had not... Suppose they had decided not to subsidize collective bargaining at all."
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1737.011,1737.451,Right.
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.451,1740.356,You would not then be here making a claim would you?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1740.356,1741.027,That is right.
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1741.027,1747.321,Except for the official time and the payment of wages while you are bargaining you would not be here.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1747.321,1748.148,That is right.
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.148,1762.813,So is there any historical support in the executive orders or practice in the government for suggesting that official time includes travel?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1762.813,1779.543,"Well, the Assistant Secretary of Labor Management Relations Regulations under the executive order provided that witnesses at hearings be granted official time, and they also got travel expenses."
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1783.852,1793.6,"But that is a far cry from saying... Witnesses is one thing, but representing an organization as its bargaining representative is another."
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1798.05,1821.259,"--Well, we have that and then, of course, under Executive Order 10988 did provide that meetings and consultations could be conducted on official time and the Comptroller General first said that they could not get travel expenses either but then he modified that in keeping with the Civil Service Commission guidelines so that it would seem that in some circumstances--"
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.259,1822.023,How did he modify it?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1822.023,1822.538,--Pardon?
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.538,1823.493,How did he modify it?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1823.493,1839.002,He modified it by saying that travel expenses could be paid pursuant to the Civil Service Commission guidelines which those guidelines for the most part did not allow the payment of travel expenses for negotiations.
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.604,1873.364,Do you know of any instances in the past where travel expenses have actually been paid for the time spent negotiating or to go and come from negotiating sessions?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1873.364,1874.924,You mean before the Act?
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1886.123,1888.358,Is there any practice since?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1888.358,1893.793,"In the payment... Well, people are sort of waiting to see what this Court does on it before--"
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1893.793,1896.963,Has anybody actually paid the expenses up to date?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1896.963,1904.537,"--Not that I know of, no, but that is because the matter has been in litigation I believe."
1983.82-799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1970.165,1972.789,Who promulgated those regulation Ms. Peters?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1972.789,1973.694,--That was OPM.
1983.82-799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.287,1988.411,What is the relationship between the FLRA and OPM?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1988.411,1994.72,--They are separate agencies with separate areas of responsibility.
1983.82-799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.182,2026.798,"If you analogize that to state workmen's compensation laws, certainly state workmen's compensation laws have been extended to situations where they will find something arose out of and in the course of employment that it is inconceivable the employee would have been paid for if he had been demanding pay."
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2026.798,2039.577,"--That may be, but my point is that there are a number of attributes of employment that attach to someone who is in the federal sector on official time for--"
1983.82-799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.577,2042.623,I am suggesting your last example proves very little.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2042.623,2065.847,"--I think that perhaps more instructive than the various factors that support our view that it is official business, that time spent negotiating is official business is the fact that Petitioner really has not provided any reason why negotiations should not be considered official business."
1983.82-799,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2370.719,2380.884,"What you are saying is that they are construing the authority of another agency, the authority conferred by Congress on a different agency."
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2380.884,2400.441,"--Well, first I would note that GSA which has authority under the Travel Expense Act in its regulations has essentially said that individual agencies can authorize travel and thus determine whether it is official business or not except as otherwise provided by law."
1983.82-799,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2417.727,2422.164,But the underlying proposition is that it is the business of the agency.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2429.114,2431.052,Yes.
1983.82-799,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2431.052,2450.187,"In other words, if a judge is assigned from one district to another he is authorized to have his expenses paid and his per diem, but there he is engaged or she is engaged in the business of that agency and not some other agency."
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2450.187,2452.168,Yes.
1983.82-799,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.102,2584.365,"Ms. Peters, can I ask a question at this point?"
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2584.365,2584.849,--Sure.
1983.82-799,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2584.849,2587.614,It goes to the standard of the review problem and the method of review.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2587.614,2588.222,Sure.
1983.82-799,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2588.222,2614.914,"Supposing the issue arose such as Justice Marshall asked you about that whether the employee was entitled to take first class because there was not tourist available or something that went to the amount of the travel expense reimbursement and there was a refusal to pay the requested amount, could the employee under your view of the statutory scheme cite that as an unfair labor practice and ask that it be decided by your Authority?"
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2614.914,2619.289,They might try to take it up through the unfair labor practice route.
1983.82-799,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2635.484,2636.829,This is the route they took in this case.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2636.829,2637.313,--Pardon?
1983.82-799,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.313,2639.671,This is the route they took in this case.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2641.887,2642.577,Yes.
1983.82-799,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2642.577,2652.946,"As I understand you you say the standard of review is arbitrary and capricious for that reason, and I was giving you a hypothetical with the issue just a little different."
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2658.959,2661.287,"If it came up in an unfair labor practice proceeding, yes."
1983.82-799,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.287,2664.661,The question of whether they could have ridden first class instead of tourist?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2664.661,2677.421,"Well, if he raised that as an unfair labor practice matter, but what I am saying is that you might try to bring it up that way but it would not necessarily be a violation of the Act and the general counsel would not necessarily issue a complaint."
1983.82-799,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2677.421,2692.242,"No, but if your Authority thought that the Comptroller General's people were being much too strict I would suppose under your view you would have the right to say yes that is an unfair labor practice if we are not getting the right amount of money."
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2692.242,2714.107,"The Authority would be bound by the GSA's federal travel regulations which it recently recognized in a negotiability determination are a government-wide regulation and that an issue cannot be... For example, a union bargaining proposal cannot be inconsistent with the federal travel regulations, and I believe that there--"
1983.82-799,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.107,2730.477,"Well, what if we had here... I know we do not, but what if we had here a regulation by the Comptroller General labeled travel regulation and it said just what the Solicitor General is saying here that union negotiating sessions do not support a travel expense claim?"
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2730.477,2741.33,"--Well, one point in that regard is that GSA has never before or since the Authority's determination said anything like that nor has Congress."
1983.82-799,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.327,2752.092,But the case would be different if they had such a regulation.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2753.796,2756.011,--If they had such a regulation?
1983.82-799,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2756.011,2756.654,Yes.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2756.654,2757.543,That said that--
1983.82-799,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.543,2765.62,"If we knew that the Comptroller General in some written formal document had adopted the position of the Solicitor General in this case, would it be a different law suit?"
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2765.62,2782.063,"--If he issued a decision or if the GSA instead of having the regulation saying that an agency may determine whether it is authorized travel or not, yes, it would be a different case and the Authority would have to look at those regulations."
1983.82-799,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2818.333,2824.03,"Ms. Peters, this is irrelevant, but I am curious."
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2829.669,2832.278,Overall or--
1983.82-799,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2832.278,2833.825,In this issue.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2833.825,2836.575,--In this particular case or government-wide?
1983.82-799,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2836.575,2837.902,In this issue generally.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2837.902,2838.887,In this issue generally.
1983.82-799,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2856.049,2857.675,No hard evidence.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2857.675,2859.11,--Hard evidence on that point.
1983.82-799,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2859.11,2860.502,We have a lot of speeches cited to us.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2860.502,2861.266,Pardon?
1983.82-799,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2861.266,2863.766,We have a lot of speeches cited to us.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2863.766,2864.374,I see.
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.986,2895.364,Have you got any commentators in this case?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2896.861,2899.438,"I have not a single commentator to cite, student or nonstudent."
1983.82-799,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2976.797,2996.338,"If I could follow Justice Blackmun's question one step further, if we agree with you is there any way we can prevent all of the meeting being held in Hawaii, Nevada, Puerto Rico, et cetra?"
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2996.338,3002.398,"Well, that is generally one of the ground rules that has to be established by the parties."
1983.82-799,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3011.487,3014.342,They will deduct theirs from the income tax.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3015.828,3053.45,"Not if it is official business I do not think, but in any event that is a matter for parties to determine and in fact given the number of nation-wide bargaining units that is one additional factor in support of the Authority's determination because it facilitates the parties coming to agreement on where to hold the meetings so that if all the management representatives are already centrally located in Washington, D.C., for example, they can bring the union representatives in there and there will not be any cost of travel for the management representatives at all."
1983.82-799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3095.108,3101.04,"Have you said as much as you are going to say, Ms. Peters, about why this is justifiably different than private collective bargaining?"
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3101.04,3122.518,--It is different from private collective bargaining first of all because in the private sector there is no statutory official time requirement and secondly because both the parties to private bargaining are private parties there is not even a question of equalizing public funding support.
1983.82-799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3122.518,3124.581,But you can look at that two different ways I think.
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3149.788,3163.314,"Well, I think there are differences in the nature and scope and structure of private sector bargaining as compared to federal sector bargaining which means that it may well not be an appropriate determination in the private sector but it is supportable here."
1983.82-799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3208.888,3216.087,Why does narrow versus broad bargaining suggest that your conclusion rather than the opposite one should be reached?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3216.087,3220.025,--Because it dictates that there is a different nature of bargaining.
1983.82-799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3244.514,3255.386,That shows why it may be different but why does it show that it is more likely that the official time should be construed to include what you contend it is here as opposed to the private sector?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3255.386,3257.76,Because it is a question here.
1983.82-799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3273.017,3283.311,"Yes, but you concede then I take it the private sector bargaining unless they cover it in the collective bargaining contract the union representative would not be paid."
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3291.336,3293.493,"Well, that is not entirely clear to me."
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3322.95,3331.758,The wage payment or the payment for the official time does not necessarily have to be official business does it?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3331.758,3333.728,--The wage payment?
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3344.611,3345.504,Whether it is official business or not?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3345.504,3349.657,"Well, management is an official business so if they are on paid time the same as management--"
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3349.657,3350.218,"No, but the employees."
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3350.218,3351.342,--Pardon?
1983.82-799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3351.342,3353.171,How about the employee?
1983.82-799,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3353.171,3355.76,"Well, in our view the employee is on official business."
1983.82-799,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3355.76,3358.181,Thank you.
1983.82-799,2,18633,carolyn_corwin,,3359.246,3362.495,"Mr. Chief Justice, just a few points."
1983.82-799,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3499.889,3502.452,"Ms. Corwin, can I ask one other question?"
1983.82-799,2,18633,carolyn_corwin,,3502.452,3503.122,"Yes, indeed."
1983.82-799,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3503.122,3507.076,In a way this law suit is kind of a strange case because it is a fight within the family.
1983.82-799,2,18633,carolyn_corwin,,3524.96,3534.268,"Well, unfortunately the situation and I will try to clarify that is that the Comptroller General has been asked for his views under this statute."
1983.82-799,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3552.978,3554.9,His time is less valuable than ours I guess.
1983.82-799,2,18633,carolyn_corwin,,3558.476,3563.928,--Unfortunately I think by the time somebody thought of that alternative things were already in the Courts of Appeals.
1983.82-799,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3563.928,3567.722,But the other agencies are not bound by the Comptroller General.
1983.82-799,2,18633,carolyn_corwin,,3571.099,3577.501,"That is, of course, a matter that is of great interest to the agencies, but I--"
1983.82-799,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3577.501,3580.219,It certainly does not bind the individual employee.
1983.82-799,2,18633,carolyn_corwin,,3580.219,3601.725,"--Well, generally there is a considerable amount of deference given to the Comptroller General's views, and I would like to clarify the executive order situation in which the Comptroller General rules that in the case in which an agency concluded that it was in the best interests of the government that there could be authorization of travel expenses."
1983.82-799,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3696.187,3697.984,"Thank you, counsel."
