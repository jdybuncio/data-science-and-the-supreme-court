1999.99-5153,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.423,"We'll hear argument now in No. 99-5153, Cornell Johnson v. the United States."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,12.222,14.284,It's pronounced La Lumia.
1999.99-5153,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,14.284,15.027,La Lumia.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,16.225,17.711,Thank you.
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,19.735,20.683,It's like Scalia.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,22.047,22.912,--Something like that.
1999.99-5153,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,80.126,84.38,What... what do you mean or what do you think respondent... by the term retrospective?
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,84.38,95.07,"Retrospective means an application of a statute that is applied after commission of the offense, the initial offense."
1999.99-5153,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,114.844,115.299,From that offense.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,115.299,115.792,Yes.
1999.99-5153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,115.792,132.017,"Now, the First Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Selya I believe, thought that the original statute, 3583(e) unmodified permitted the same thing."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,135.361,136.476,That's correct.
1999.99-5153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,137.34,143.739,"So, if that were the case, it wouldn't matter that 3583(h) was enacted I suppose."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,145.392,148.652,"--That's... that's exactly right, Justice O'Connor."
1999.99-5153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.652,154.158,"So, if we were to adopt the First Circuit view, end of case."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,154.158,155.256,That's correct.
1999.99-5153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,159.797,164.09,"Well, except there was a split of authority and I suppose they wanted to deal with that."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,164.09,165.166,That's right.
1999.99-5153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,165.576,167.516,Because we hadn't.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,167.516,173.172,--I think that there was an invitation for this Court to deal with it because there was a circuit split.
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,187.457,188.404,But we don't weigh the number.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,190.179,191.748,--I'm sorry.
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,191.748,196.866,"We weigh the persuasiveness of the Court's reason, not how many were on one side versus the other."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,214.039,222.751,"The decision in O'Neil is incorrect, and the rationale of several courts who have addressed this issue is more persuasive."
1999.99-5153,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,264.854,270.138,But they used the... the term revoke in (3) but terminate in (1).
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,276.743,288.797,I believe that there's a difference that could be drawn from... from the use of terminate in subsection (e)(1) as opposed to revoke in... as used in subsection (e)(3).
1999.99-5153,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,313.606,318.064,Terminate has some sort of benevolent connotation and revoke doesn't?
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,318.064,321.575,"Well, in this situation it... it does."
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.75,352.122,"Well, it's more than just unfavorable."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,386.507,388.614,"--That's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.614,391.353,"So, I mean, that explains using revoked instead of terminated I suppose."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,391.353,392.823,"That's exactly right, and if--"
1999.99-5153,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,392.823,394.93,Where... where does it say that you can't... sorry.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,408.221,408.677,--Yes.
1999.99-5153,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,408.677,413.999,"2 years passes, and the guy violates 14 conditions."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,457.096,463.206,"Well, and in fact, Congress has made that authority available by enactment of subsection (h)."
1999.99-5153,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,463.206,464.32,I know that.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,497.841,498.789,That's correct.
1999.99-5153,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,498.789,499.615,I'm right.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,499.615,499.903,That is correct.
1999.99-5153,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,503.99,504.362,All right.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,513.445,517.448,The starting point would be a look at the word revoke.
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,523.576,558.536,"But how can you maintain that when (h), which does take the position you would say prospectively only... that section also uses the term revoked, and then spells out that you revoke it, you go back to square one, and you can make the division, but not quite as you conceded before because (e)(3) says even if the term of that's revoked is 3 years of supervised release, you can put him back in prison only for 2 years for this category of offense."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,559.058,559.429,Yes.
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,563.35,568.158,"So, you... so, the extra year that's been revoked under your reading doesn't get made up."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,568.923,580.894,"Under our reading of subsection (e)(3) that was in effect at the time of Mr. Johnson's offense, the... the authority that's provided by subsection (e)(3) is strictly for revocation."
1999.99-5153,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,588.985,589.894,"Well, I think--"
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,589.894,597.53,"--Yes, but the word revoked... you can't put much weight on it when it's retained in the section that does say, Judge, here's the 3 years."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,612.369,628.716,"In... in subsection (h), where Congress has specifically authorized the courts to reimpose supervised release, they have given that authority upon consideration of the split in authority that's come out... a split in the circuits' decisions--"
1999.99-5153,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,628.716,637.715,"Well, that's what... it... it seems to me that you are better off with (h) because you can say (3) has this very strict reading and we...."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,647.17,647.913,--That's correct.
1999.99-5153,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,647.913,666.861,"So, I think we have to... I... I suppose we have to look at the statute as if (h) were not there, other than the Congress gives a reading which we may give some... some weight to because it seems to interpret the statute in a particular way."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,669.544,670.037,I agree.
1999.99-5153,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,679.78,681.926,"So, although you'd like to use (h), I'm not... I'm not sure that you can."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,685.558,712.308,"--I agree with you, and under subsection (e)(3) where the Congress has provided the authority to revoke a term of supervised release, if one looks at a common, plain dictionary definition of the word revoked, it clearly contemplates a recision, an end, a conclusion, that type of thing, a termination of a probation or... or in this case, a supervised release order because of a rule violation."
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,712.308,713.134,It doesn't have to.
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,713.134,727.13,"Ms. La Lumia, is... is Judge Selya's position, the Government's position here, that the only supervised release that can be imposed after the revocation is whatever had not yet been served?"
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,749.71,755.298,I believe it's the Government's position that they may impose 5 years of supervised release.
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,755.298,756.025,The full 5 years.
1999.99-5153,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,807.211,808.243,"Well, it's (e)(2)."
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.903,809.812,(e)(2).
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,809.812,812.784,Under... under subsection (e)(2)--
1999.99-5153,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.784,817.819,(e)(2) talks about extending a term--
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,817.819,818.207,--Allows--
1999.99-5153,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.207,819.017,--which has already been revoked.
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,819.017,821.346,"Well, then the maximum was... was imposed."
1999.99-5153,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,821.346,823.558,"No, no. (2) can extend."
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,828.926,830.329,Was... was previously imposed.
1999.99-5153,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,835.159,835.547,"No, no."
1999.99-5153,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,837.388,838.503,Let counsel participate.
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,838.503,840.732,"Well, counsel doesn't understand the question."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,840.732,850.286,"--In this... in this particular case, the extent of the supervised release order at initial sentencing for Mr. Johnson was 3 years."
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,855.964,857.329,Was that the maximum he could have imposed?
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,857.329,857.783,Yes.
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,857.783,858.359,Okay.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,858.359,860.217,"Yes, he did and he imposed the maximum."
1999.99-5153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,892.827,893.282,Yes.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,899.682,900.775,No.
1999.99-5153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,912.48,912.63,"No, but an overall 5-year."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,912.63,913.8,--Yes.
1999.99-5153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,934.566,936.934,"Okay, and on revocation, what happened?"
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,943.604,952.149,"--Upon revocation, the limit under subsection (e)(3) is a maximum period of reimprisonment of 2 years."
1999.99-5153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,952.149,953.718,And that's what was given?
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,953.718,955.576,"No, not in this case."
1999.99-5153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,958.548,959.663,All right.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,959.663,968.292,"--and thereafter imposed a sentence of supervised release that... it's our position, that no supervised release of any length of time was permissible."
1999.99-5153,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,968.292,968.785,I know that's your position.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,970.149,971.635,1 year.
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,988.187,988.93,Counsel--
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,988.93,992.728,--But the total... but the total supervised release was still under 3 years?
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,992.728,995.495,In this particular case--
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.495,1000.364,How much supervised release had he served before he violated it and it was... and it was revoked?
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1000.364,1002.016,--Roughly 7 months.
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1002.016,1003.047,"Okay, so--"
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1003.047,1006.763,It was roughly 7 months at the time that he committed a new crime and--
1999.99-5153,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1006.763,1008.703,"--So, it was all within the statutory maximum."
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1008.703,1012.79,All within the statutory maximum for supervised release at the original sentencing.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1012.79,1013.866,--No.
1999.99-5153,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1023.564,1027.279,Right and now has another... another how many?
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1027.279,1030.334,He had another year of supervised release.
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1040.161,1041.396,"Counsel, would you please--"
1999.99-5153,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1041.396,1041.851,"--No, but it was--"
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1041.851,1044.535,--clarify one thing which I think there's been some confusion about?
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1073.969,1076.57,That the period of time had not been reached?
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1077.146,1084.493,"That the judge could have said, without regard to how much time he had served, you go back on supervised release for 3 years."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1087.465,1090.975,I would disagree with that interpretation of subsection (e)(3).
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1090.975,1091.923,What did it permit?
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1091.923,1100.058,"It permitted the court, upon revocation, to require the person to serve in prison all or part of the term... excuse me... to require the person in prison all or part of the term."
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1100.058,1101.294,It required prison time?
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1101.294,1104.183,It allows the court.
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1104.183,1116.322,"If it allowed prison time but didn't require it, wouldn't it allow supervised release to rerun on the idea that it's revoked and it starts over?"
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1116.322,1119.173,I would disagree with... with that.
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1134.405,1135.064,All or part.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1135.064,1137.293,--All or part of the... up to 2 years.
1999.99-5153,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1143.421,1144.929,Your position is all or nothing.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1149.553,1156.158,"No supervised release once it's revoked under subsection (e)(3), but it's not so much all or... all or nothing."
1999.99-5153,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1160.244,1170.73,"Well, it's all... all or nothing in the sense that it's rather odd to say that the judge can either... must either set him free or put him in prison and can't give him the lesser punishment."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1172.05,1184.56,But that's assuming that supervised release is a lesser punishment and... and I would not be willing to state that supervised release is a less harsh or... a less harsh punishment than imprisonment.
1999.99-5153,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1184.56,1211.431,"But your... as I understand it, your position is that whatever combination of imprisonment and supervised release, whenever imposed, that... the total amounts of those two components... the total lengths of those two components may not extend beyond the maximum date that... that would have been possible for those two components at the time of sentencing."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1212.917,1217.17,There's a... a limitation on what can be imposed.
1999.99-5153,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1219.316,1220.969,But let me make it... let me make it simple.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1253.413,1258.408,--That is the position because that's the statutory... that would be the statutory authority provided by Congress.
1999.99-5153,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1258.408,1258.864,But isn't--

1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1524.705,1524.993,That's correct.
1999.99-5153,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1528.048,1528.958,"Yes, there are limitations."
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1539.937,1540.847,That's right.
1999.99-5153,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1540.847,1543.735,And your view is revoke means terminate and finish.
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1548.36,1549.142,That's... that's it in a nutshell.
1999.99-5153,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1549.142,1549.514,All right.
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1549.514,1556.944,"And why isn't (h) instructive at least to that extent, that Congress again used the word revoke?"
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1567.225,1575.231,The difference is that in... in (h) Congress gave the specific authority for reimposition.
1999.99-5153,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1577.999,1584.436,But it's not inconsistent with interpreting the... the word revoke to mean call back because that's clearly what it means in (h).
1999.99-5153,0,39736,rita_la_lumia,,1584.436,1591.002,"--However, in order to undo something, one has to undertake an additional act."

1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1636.987,1642.726,I think that it is... I don't think that you have to have specific authority.
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1648.504,1654.548,But you do agree there's no express authority in (e)(3) for granting supervised release after a revocation.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1654.548,1657.709,"--Well, it depends on how you read (e)(3)."
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1659.733,1660.492,Tell me... do this for me.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1660.492,1660.864,Right.
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1660.864,1665.034,Tell me what the express language in (e)(3) is that authorizes supervised release.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1665.034,1665.239,Right.
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1681.403,1682.108,In prison.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1682.108,1683.798,"--Right, right, but the... right."
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1684.874,1686.77,--served on supervised release.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1686.77,1691.394,--The question is what happens if he serves part of it... of the term of supervised release in prison.
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.659,1713.686,"You're talking about the originally sentenced term, not the authorized term, but the term to... so, you would agree that you can never sentence him to a new term of supervised release, a new 3-year term if that was the original limit."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1724.915,1731.231,"--Well, you have to bear in mind that he loses credit for time previously spent on the street."
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1737.547,1738.866,"Well, he uses credit--"
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1738.866,1739.154,--Right.
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1739.154,1740.519,--against the jail time for that.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1740.519,1740.84,"No, no."
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1741.195,1747.289,"It doesn't say he loses credit against the... against the future... in fact, I guess it says nothing about the future supervised release time."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1747.289,1747.865,No.
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1754.758,1755.13,Both--
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1755.13,1756.866,--let's assume that--
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.866,1758.845,--both against prison and against a future supervised release sentence.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1758.845,1769.99,"--Yes, but the total of prison... no, but the total of prison and supervised release under (e)(3), as it existed before, couldn't exceed the time that he was ordered to serve on supervised release initially."
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1776.761,1777.299,Right.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1777.299,1781.591,--then he's released from prison and... and goes out and serves his supervised release.
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.503,1787.009,Okay.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1787.009,1790.386,"--that... and... and he's... let's assume that he's revoked immediately, just to simplify."
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1818.743,1821.139,Where does it authorize him to spend part of it in supervised release?
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1832.034,1833.892,"--Justice Scalia, I... I don't think I agree."
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1859.405,1863.696,It does... I wonder... actually this is a point I had not at all focused on.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1896.406,1897.133,Right.
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1897.133,1905.639,"I would have thought that (e)(2), since it gives the authority of the judge to extend, as well as to cut down in the same way, it says, that we used to do that with parole."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1920.25,1943.534,"Well, I'm not sure it's just like parole, but... but if... if he was initially... let's suppose it was a class A felony and... and he could have gotten 5 years of supervised release, but he initially got only 2, and close to the end of his period on supervised release, the prosecutor or the probation office says we think that his record warrants a new... an extension of the term."
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1945.681,1948.857,That's relevant for this case in the following way.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1971.603,1976.267,--I... I think that some courts have said that you could look at it that way.
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1989.924,1992.12,But I think Justice Breyer's example was no violation.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1994.554,1994.843,--Right.
1999.99-5153,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2037.733,2071.337,"But the reason you say that is that it... I take it, that it would make no sense or it wouldn't make much sense to say that upon revocation the sentence may be to all or even a portion of the original period of supervised release, unless Congress had meant that if the court sentences only to a portion, there would be at least the balance of supervised release to be served as supervised release because that only... that's the only reading that would be consistent with the theory of what supervised release is there for."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2071.337,2072.862,I think that's basically right.
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2097.092,2110.651,"Well, the... the answer is pretty easy to that, that you have a tough law and order of Congress that says we want people on supervised release to know that if they revoke... if they violate a term of... of their condition, their release can be revoked, and they must now do prison time."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2113.236,2113.829,Well--
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.829,2124.753,And... and we don't want... we don't want some bleeding heart judge to... to refuse to give them the full time in prison by giving him some of that time back on release which they've just violated.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2124.753,2125.329,--Well--
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.329,2125.95,We don't want that to happen.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2129.583,2131.19,"--Well, I'm not... I'm not sure--"
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.19,2132.016,"I mean, that makes some sense."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2133.009,2134.784,"--I'm not sure I agree with that, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2203.431,2205.866,"No, there's no doubt about that being a very sensible policy."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2216.64,2219.612,--I'm not going to--
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2219.612,2228.612,"Because the only... and... and to answer it, they could have spelled it out, but they could also say, well we've given the judge... judge his four options in (e)(1), (2), (3), and (4)."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2239.281,2257.757,"--I don't think... I'm not going to argue that it would be an absurd result, but I do think that it is somewhat... it is a somewhat... it is a somewhat illogical policy to say that Congress wanted to deny the district court the flexibility to say you should both have some time in prison and some time in supervised release--"
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2257.757,2262.148,"All they would have had to do was say, to serve in prison or on an additional period of supervised release."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2264.666,2265.392,--It could have... it could have said that.
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2265.392,2265.93,--That's what it means.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2265.93,2266.423,Right.
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2273.832,2274.225,--the language.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2274.763,2303.287,"Well, what it... what it points out, though, I think is that if the district court saw that only a short amount of time in prison was necessary and it gave that to the discretion of the district court... if only a short amount of time in prison was necessary to sort of get the offender back on the right path, and then after the offender was on the right path, you know, it was time to start the supervised release experiment again, I think that... that... that's what Congress intended for... for district courts to have the flexibility to do."
1999.99-5153,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2303.287,2316.002,"The reason... the reason you say it would be illogical to deny that, I take it, is that supervised release is supposed to increase the odds of the prisoner succeeding in working his way back into society without further trouble."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2323.077,2324.752,I think that's basically right.
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2327.724,2331.977,Except that the guy had already forfeited his entitlement to that by violating the conditions once.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2346.012,2353.153,"--Well, the district court does in some cases... the district court doesn't have to... doesn't have to give him another chance on supervised release."
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2383.331,2397.57,"--If we're speaking metaphysically, I guess metaphysically the term of supervised release must still exist, for otherwise how could you serve all or part of it?"
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2397.57,2401.74,I think that's... that's... that is what we've argued basically.
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2401.74,2403.597,I think if you're speaking non-metaphysically--
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2403.597,2404.052,"Right, right."

1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2422.135,2424.736,Are we speaking metaphysically or non-metaphysically or what?
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2424.736,2437.2,"--Well, the term... I think the word term in this situation is used to mean the... the sanction that was imposed upon the offender, that is, the... his actual term."
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2456.231,2462.464,I'm asking that because I think where she's right... your opponent... is that you do have to do a little bit of twisting of this language.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2471.38,2473.692,"Well, I'm not sure that... I'm not sure I agree to this point."
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2473.692,2474.098,--literally.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2474.098,2475.467,I'm not sure that I agree it is twisting.
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2481.783,2493.3,"Yes, but the First Circuit calls upon a meaning of revoke as given by Sheridan approximately, which... which I think is at least an unusual meaning and other than Sheridan, it might be tough to find examples."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2494.331,2499.244,"--Revoke means... I mean, literally of course it means call back, and that's--"
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2499.244,2502.505,"That's true, but we don't seem to use it in that way."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2507.213,2513.816,"--Well, it is used in that way actually in the predecessor provisions, that is, special parole."
1999.99-5153,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2597.947,2599.311,What do you want us to say about (h)?
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2601.002,2602.693,"The less, the better."
1999.99-5153,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2625.235,2631.55,"Well, the district court thought it was relying on (h) and that it was going to apply it retrospectively."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2631.55,2641.331,"--The district court... I agree the district court thought it was relying on (h), but I think nobody doubt... nobody disputes that what the district court was proper under (h)."
1999.99-5153,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2653.553,2668.413,"It does seem to me from one standpoint that if your construction is correct, they would have gone back and... and amended (h)... pardon me... and simply amended sub (3)."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2668.413,2676.958,"--Well, they could have done that, but I think obviously they were aware of this conflict and perhaps wanted to make it more clear by putting out--"
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2676.958,2679.187,And they did... and they did change (3).
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2679.187,2680.052,--They changed (3) also.
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2685.253,2693.798,"And instead of it being... the limitation being the period of supervised release originally imposed, it's the statutory maximum that now governs under (e)(3)."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2693.798,2694.337,That's correct.
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2705.027,2706.984,"Mr. Wolfson, what about... what about the rule of lenity?"
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2730.95,2737.349,"--Well, of course, to invoke the rule of lenity, the Court has to conclude that there is a true ambiguity in the statute and--"
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2737.349,2738.381,"--Oh, you don't think there's a true ambiguity here."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2738.381,2738.835,--and--
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2738.835,2744.613,"You argue that your position is not... is not only right, but it's not even the resolution of an ambiguity?"
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2744.613,2753.612,"--The... the Court has to arrive at the conclusion that the statute is truly ambiguous after looking to... to all of the tools available, including--"
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2753.612,2754.272,Let's assume I have no trouble with that.
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2760.383,2765.13,"--Your answer I suppose, Mr. Wolfson, is you look at the rule of lenity before a statute is amended."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2770.209,2780.24,"--I think I have to say that that is... well, that is... one has to look at (e)(3) or at (e), the statute at the time that petitioner committed his offense."
1999.99-5153,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2787.132,2788.99,It's hard not to confuse that--
1999.99-5153,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2788.99,2799.226,"--Well, I thought you... I thought that your answer might have been it is an odd rule of lenity that says that all of these prisoners have to serve in prison and can't get... and can't get--"
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2799.226,2799.681,"--Right, right."
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2823.375,2824.368,--Maybe they would in the case of her client.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2824.368,2825.399,Maybe they would.
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2843.52,2858.092,"It's no doubt true if you... if you apply the rule of lenity as of... as of the time the statute was enacted, but interpreting the statute currently, there is no doubt which interpretation is more favorable to defendants."
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2858.092,2859.578,Really?
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2862.468,2863.871,--I think to any defendant.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2873.902,2885.669,"Well, today... well, today of course (h) does confirm that the district court has... has that option, but... but... I think that's--"
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2885.669,2886.699,--Is that right?
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2897.473,2897.929,"--Right, right."
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2897.929,2906.39,"--and you cut away the option of putting them for 7 months on supervised release, the judge might say, well, I can't give him a supervised release."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2908.164,2909.529,"Well, that might happen and--"
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2909.529,2910.932,"So, how do we know which way it will cut?"
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2910.932,2917.369,--But I was assuming that... I was assuming that the question meant suppose somebody committed their offense today with (h)... with (h) in the picture.
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2917.369,2918.278,The offense date is no problem because--
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2918.278,2919.022,With (h)... right.
1999.99-5153,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2919.022,2924.761,--but we're only talking about the class of people who committed their offense prior to (h).
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.376,2948.743,But you... you would apply (h) to those people even if the offense was committed before (h) was adopted.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2964.635,2966.121,No.
1999.99-5153,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2967.153,2968.805,--who committed their offenses after (h) was enacted?
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2968.805,2978.632,"--Well, our position in this case is that it was... it was acceptable to apply (h) because it was... it was... even with (h), it's not more onerous than... than it was... than the previous law was."
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2978.632,2989.816,"No, but (h) is part of a statutory amendment that made (e)(3) more severe because (e)(3) under the new amendment imposes... authorizes a longer period of imprisonment than (e)(3) under the old statute."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2989.816,2990.187,Right.
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2991.096,2994.911,"So, that statute as a whole could, in some cases, be more severe."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2994.911,3010.128,"--It depends on one looks at the amendment that was made to (e)(3) because, after all, what is true is that even before (e)(3) was amended, under the old... under the old (e)(3), of course, that the limit... there was a limit of the term that was actually imposed."
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3022.675,3028.825,"Well, that depends on how one reads (e)(2) because (e)(2) doesn't speak in terms of violations of supervised release."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3032.54,3033.283,--Well--
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3033.283,3040.221,Either that or it might be double jeopardy to be adding... imposing a higher sentence later on.
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3040.221,3042.366,"--Well, I don't know that the double jeopardy is--"
1999.99-5153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3042.366,3043.026,There are a lot of problems with--
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3043.026,3044.058,--is in the picture.
1999.99-5153,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3063.46,3080.632,"--Mr. Wolfson, as I read your brief, you were relying specifically on (e)(3) and the reading of that, as Judge Selya did, and you were not infusing this section (e)(2) that was first introduced into this colloquy by Justice Breyer."
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3084.553,3085.091,That's right.
1999.99-5153,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3103.584,3117.951,"And... but... and I think you would have to concede, would you not, that there is some ambiguity, otherwise how could you account for this circuit split that is lopsided the other way?"
1999.99-5153,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3117.951,3132.191,"Well, certainly courts have looked at this different ways, but the... this Court has said many times that the mere fact that several lower courts have disagreed about the meaning of a criminal statute doesn't necessarily bring to bear the rule of lenity."
1999.99-5153,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3174.915,3176.501,"Thank you, Mr. Wolfson."
1999.99-5153,2,39736,rita_la_lumia,,3179.085,3180.284,Thank you.
1999.99-5153,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3221.623,3229.507,"But under (e)(3), it's clear the court could, if it wanted to, impose additional imprisonment, isn't it?"
1999.99-5153,2,39736,rita_la_lumia,,3232.73,3238.895,"--Under subsection (e)(3), the court could, indeed, impose reimprisonment, and there--"
1999.99-5153,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3238.895,3245.294,The question is whether it can impose another term of supervised release or more supervised release.
1999.99-5153,2,39736,rita_la_lumia,,3245.294,3246.408,--That's correct.
1999.99-5153,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3254.849,3259.816,"So, a judge is faced with the alternative, either you send the guy to prison or he goes free."
1999.99-5153,2,39736,rita_la_lumia,,3259.816,3266.842,"You send him to prison for up to 2 years, the statutory limitation under the supervised release statute... any period in between."
1999.99-5153,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3272.498,3278.731,How about the benefit of supervised release in enabling someone to reintegrate into society?
1999.99-5153,2,39736,rita_la_lumia,,3278.731,3291.362,"Well, if one considers the benefits weighed against the disadvantages, I think that supervised release is clearly more disadvantageous because it... it imposes a restraint on liberty."
1999.99-5153,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3292.372,3294.889,"Well, but surely prison is a restraint on liberty too."
1999.99-5153,2,39736,rita_la_lumia,,3294.889,3301.476,--But the proper comparison in this case is not between an imposition of a prison sentence and imposition of supervised release.
1999.99-5153,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3312.456,3323.973,"I don't why that's the proper comparison because you're denying the district judge under the old law the ability to say I won't send them to prison at all, but I am going to reimpose supervised release."
1999.99-5153,2,39736,rita_la_lumia,,3323.973,3325.253,"--Well, that's correct."
1999.99-5153,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3340.214,3346.226,"Yes, but even I agreed with you about that, you are saying it's got to be the maximum prison."
1999.99-5153,2,39736,rita_la_lumia,,3355.802,3357.204,"--Under subsection (e)(3), that's correct."
1999.99-5153,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3357.204,3358.896,"Thank you, Ms. La Lumia."
