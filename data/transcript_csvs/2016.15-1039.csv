Before we get started, Ms. Maynard, Ms. Maynard and Mr. Waxman, the Court has decided to give each of you five extra minutes, and you can proceed, Ms. Maynard, when you're ready."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,17.125,18.665,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,18.665,30.155,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Biosimilars Act created a comprehensive and self-contained scheme for the early resolution of patent disputes."
2016.15-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,74.55,85.485,"Could you tell me, suppose that in year 2 of the 12-year exclusive period, the application for the biosimilar is made."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,95.755,96.86,Well --
2016.15-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,96.86,101.06,Or is it not licensed until the very end of the 12-day period.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,101.06,105.995,The FDA cannot license a biosimilar until the end of the 12-year period.
2016.15-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,118.49,126.875,"If it's done in -- if the approval is done in year 6 or year 7, is that announced publicly, that -- that the approval is done?"
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,126.875,146.71,"The statute prohibits the -- the -- the FDA from making an approval effective, and -- and that's in -- in the statute, Your Honor, at (k)(7). It's the exclusivity provision that you're referring to. It prohibits the FDA from making the license effective until 12 years have run."
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,147.985,148.58,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,148.58,148.67,They --
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,148.67,173.415,"Could you clarify? Does that mean that the FDA can't announce its intent to approve on year 12 plus 1 earlier than year 12, or -- I'm not quite sure I understand. How long does it take for the FDA to approve the biosimilar? Assuming you go through Phase I, and there is -- and Phase II has been finished."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,178.585,179.43,That's right.
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,184.85,190.08,"So how long -- I want you to go back to Justice Kennedy, but I just want to get a sense of timing."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,198.205,200.58,"So two points about that, Justice Sotomayor."
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,225.16,225.53,"No, no."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,225.53,225.65,No.
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,225.87,227.77,I'm trying to get the process down.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,227.77,228.175,Okay.
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,228.175,229.815,It takes them 10 months.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,229.815,230.735,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,230.735,235.055,Let's assume you put in an application in year 4.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,241.885,250.73,"They can't -- under the statute, under (k)(7), they can't make it effective. They can't make the approval effective until year 12."
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,250.73,252.775,When do they tell you that they will?
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,252.775,257.72,"Well, there -- there's nothing in the statute that calls for an approval before year 12."
2016.15-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,257.72,263.42,"I mean, do they get a phone call? They say, hey, good news, we've got it approved, but in five years, we're going to be able to market."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,264.315,265.01,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,265.01,272.78,"And then -- incidentally, when you're talking about (k), is this in -- can you give me the citation and the appendix to the --"
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,272.78,273.37,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,275.26,275.625,Right.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,275.625,276.2,-- at 24A.
2016.15-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,276.2,276.24,24A.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,277.64,287.085,"Exclusivity for reference from, and it says: Effective date of biosimilar application approval."
2016.15-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,329.015,330.5,I -- I have one more question --
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,330.5,331.02,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,331.02,332.765,-- and then I'll -- and then I'll subside.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,342.94,347.24,"I'm not sure I understand the premise of your question, Justice Kennedy."
2016.15-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,347.24,355.73,"Well, if -- the -- the 180 days has to run from some time, and it seems to me that it has to run from the time that it's licensed --"
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,355.73,356.43,Well --
2016.15-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,356.43,358.385,-- based on what you're telling me.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,358.385,359.22,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-1039,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,380.655,381.7,Yes.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,410.475,410.99,Well --
2016.15-1039,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,410.99,427.1,"And I take it that they had in the agency -- this goes to an agency, doesn't it? And I have -- in the agency, they have the authority to say, we will license this provided it's made this way, but not that way; provided you do this kind of a check, but not that kind of a check."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,457.595,458.09,The FDA.
2016.15-1039,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,459.06,460.07,All right.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,496.43,502.025,"Well, I think, Your Honor, to take the text, which is where I think the Court should look for the answer to this question --"
2016.15-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,502.025,502.48,Oh?
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,502.48,503.65,-- on page 39A.
2016.15-1039,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,503.65,504.76,"Yeah, I've got it."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,504.76,507.45,"-- of the blue brief, is the Notice of Commercial Marketing Provision."
2016.15-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,507.45,507.75,Yeah.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,507.75,516.42,"And it says, as you read: The subsection (k) applicant shall provide notice to the referenced product sponsor not later than -- so the --"
2016.15-1039,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,516.42,516.55,So --
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,516.55,521.945,-- not later than 180 days before the date of the first commercial marketing.
2016.15-1039,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,526.48,527.33,"Yeah, yeah, that's true."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,527.33,527.93,Because of that --
2016.15-1039,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,527.93,531.36,Provide the what? What is it you're to provide notice of?
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,531.36,534.635,Of the biological product licensed under subsection (k)
2016.15-1039,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,538.65,544.34,But you just -- but you've just said in answer to my question that the license doesn't happen until 12 years plus 1.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,544.34,553.705,"Well, the license can't happen until 12 years plus 1, Justice Kennedy, but, like, right now and for years to come, the exclusively period has already run."
2016.15-1039,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,595.04,598.14,But Justice Breyer's question was about agency regulations.
2016.15-1039,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,598.14,598.955,That's right.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,599.85,607.21,"Well, with -- with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, the United States is here explaining its reading of the statute and agrees with our reading."
2016.15-1039,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,607.21,643.265,"Oddly enough, I -- I would -- I would find an explanation far more convincing as a layperson, if, in fact, there had been notice and comment proceedings before an expert agency, which, in fact, having heard all the different views on what that word ""notice"" means, and having figured out whether if we allow day one notice, what's going to happen is we're going to gut the possibility of people going in and making these exchanges, because everybody will be free under the 23 -- under whatever this is 9 -- 9(a), to go and start bringing declaratory-judgment actions."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,653.72,654.3,"Well, we --"
2016.15-1039,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,654.3,655.445,-- same thing the Chief just said.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,655.445,658.955,"Well, we -- we know -- we know two things from the text of the statute, though, Your Honor."
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,678.12,683.245,Can I go back to the beginning of Justice Breyer's question.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,741.59,743.03,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,803.34,827.095,Could it -- could the company with the product file a declaratory-judgment action when they don't know what you're going to do? Do they have a good-faith basis for believing you're going to infringe if they don't have the application to look at until they get discovery?
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,827.095,828.02,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,828.27,828.855,Tell me how.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,828.855,829.505,Okay.
2016.15-1039,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,859.405,861.52,But it doesn't know the specifics of the biosimilar.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,870.055,871.21,"It might, Your Honor."
2016.15-1039,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,889.245,891.83,"Well, you're suing saying, this thing infringes our patent."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,893.565,905.02,You know that -- that the applicant has submitted to the FDA using your data to produce a product that's highly similar to your product.
2016.15-1039,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,905.02,910.565,"Is the way this statute works, Ms. Maynard, that if I have a valid patent, I sue?"
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,910.565,911.975,Yes.
2016.15-1039,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,913.83,915.18,"Is that it? I mean, I don't know."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,915.885,916.18,Yes.
2016.15-1039,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,916.49,924.335,"But just, is the practice that given that these will all be similar, if I have a valid patent, I bring litigation?"
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,924.335,925.12,Right.
2016.15-1039,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,947.84,951.12,You would not -- I don't know if I agree with you on that.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,974.89,975.4,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-1039,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,975.4,976.405,So this -- no?
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,976.405,977.075,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-1039,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,979.67,995.095,"All I was asking as a matter of practice, that, in fact, that's the way people operate under this statute; that given the similarity of these products, if I believe I have a valid patent, that the patent hasn't lapsed, I'm going to bring a suit."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,995.095,996.94,That is exactly what Amgen did here.
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1006.25,1006.985,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1036.42,1037.76,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1065.33,1066.7,"Well, that's assuming good faith."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1092.295,1092.77,This --
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1092.77,1096.575,What is your biosimilars remedy in that case?
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1096.575,1102.64,"The statute provides powerful incentives for the sponsors to continue through the process, Justice Sotomayor."
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1102.64,1105.68,All incentives have a way of failing.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1107.17,1107.56,If --
2016.15-1039,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1107.56,1108.25,So -- (Laughter.)
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1108.25,1108.735,Yes.
2016.15-1039,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1146.715,1168.52,"Can you explain the difference -- there are two rounds of patent infringement; right? Round 1 and -- can you explain the difference between those two? And with respect to Justice Breyer's question, you started out by saying all of this is about early resolution of patent litigation."
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1179.005,1193.775,"Well, just to clarify to the -- Mr. Chief Justice's questions and Justice Breyer's questions, Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe FDA would have -- or the patent office has rule-making authority to interpret these provisions."
2016.15-1039,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1201.74,1201.82,Yeah.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1221.185,1231.275,"I think the text answers these questions that I'm being asked. May I go back and answer Justice Ginsburg's question about the -- the way that the two phases work? First, Your Honor, there's not always two phases."
2016.15-1039,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1316.715,1317.875,Yes.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1317.875,1319.325,May I reserve the time?
2016.15-1039,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1319.325,1319.95,Yes.
2016.15-1039,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1319.95,1325.98,Thank you.
2016.15-1039,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1325.98,1333.995,Mr. Yang.
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1333.995,1348.025,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Congress enacted a detailed process for early resolution of patent disputes through patent infringement litigation while FDA is evaluating a biosimilar application."
2016.15-1039,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1391.42,1395.085,But Justice Breyer's question and my question is the same.
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1429.985,1432.225,I actually think it's not so clear.
2016.15-1039,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1463.41,1463.71,"Mr. Yang, do --"
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1463.71,1464.41,-- about a statute.
2016.15-1039,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1465.12,1470.02,Do we have your assurances that this is the FDA's position?
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1470.02,1471.81,It is the FDA's position.
2016.15-1039,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1474.315,1481.52,Has it been a consistent position in other situations? I don't know if it gets --
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1481.52,1481.94,Yeah.
2016.15-1039,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1481.94,1483.69,-- opinion letters or -- or --
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1483.69,1489.675,"Well, they've not issued opinions on how this works, so I don't know of anything that's inconsistent."
2016.15-1039,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1490.34,1492.85,"In any litigation, have they taken a different position?"
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1492.85,1494.355,"No, not that I know of."
2016.15-1039,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1494.355,1500.195,"Mr. Yang, you -- you indicate that (l)(9) is the exclusive remedy for a (2)(A) violation."
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1500.195,1501.13,Close.
2016.15-1039,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1501.13,1502.57,All right.
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1531.535,1545.11,"Well, I believe Sandoz argued, at least in the court of appeals, that it was preempted. But putting that to aside, the Federal Circuit in this case deemed the State law claim for the injunction to be moot."
2016.15-1039,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1573.19,1575.47,"That's certainly not Amgen's position, so --"
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1575.47,1579.62,I will say that there are -- I think there are strong arguments that this would be preempted.
2016.15-1039,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1592.4,1592.83,Exactly.
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1592.83,1593.11,Here we --
2016.15-1039,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1593.11,1597.4,"I agree with you, but the absence of any argument on preemption is what makes it so curious."
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1597.4,1600.335,"Well, the judgment below did not rest on the State law claim."
2016.15-1039,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1605.32,1610.32,"No, but it rests on a Federal law cause of action that also might not be there."
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1631.515,1634.34,I don't think State law is a piece of the puzzle.
2016.15-1039,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1640.18,1643.355,"Well, it becomes part -- so are you arguing the preemption question or --"
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1643.355,1645.81,"Well, we think there are strong arguments."
2016.15-1039,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1652.87,1662.23,"So you think that -- do you think the statute can function in the way you're arguing, even if there are injunctions? Based on the State law provisions?"
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1662.23,1674.455,"Can the statute work? I think it would mess up the scheme that Congress -- because if you were to look at ""shall,"" you know, there's -- there are eight subsections, that's clauses of -- of subsection (l)"
2016.15-1039,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1689.555,1716.035,"So you're asking us, assuming, just an assumption for the sake of argument, that we rule in your favor and say, as you've asked us to say, that a declaratory judgment is the -- that -- the only remedy available, and there is no Federal injunction that's possible here, do we vacate and remand for the court below to decide whether State law provides --"
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1716.035,1720.41,"No, I think the best -- the best way for the Court to decide is what's required under the statute."
2016.15-1039,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1727.98,1731.565,"I'm sorry, so I say the statute says -- we say the statute says that."
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1731.565,1732.65,If the statute --
2016.15-1039,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1732.65,1735.36,What are we doing? We're saying the State law is moot?
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1735.36,1737.03,"No, because there's no State law claim."
2016.15-1039,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1749.92,1753.235,"If it's not preempted, how would it be mooted?"
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1753.235,1763.295,"It would just fail, just like on (l)(2), the Federal Circuit said, you're complying with Federal law, therefore, you have no State law claim, because your State law claim is predicated on violating the Federal law."
2016.15-1039,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1765.66,1783.37,"But that begs the question on the question we're not looking at, but it begs the question on point 2 -- on the first point which is, is it a requirement that the biosimilar applicant give over the application."
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1791.48,1794.23,"And the exclusive remedy, and which would answer -- that would --"
2016.15-1039,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1794.23,1795.89,That goes back to preemption.
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1795.89,1797.28,"Well, no, I think that would answer."
2016.15-1039,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1846.32,1856.03,"That isn't the problem. The problem is you take her reading, there's language supporting it, but you can read that word notice, gee, if you read it, tough, you can't work it."
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1856.03,1856.62,"Well, I think the --"
2016.15-1039,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1856.62,1859.95,"And now -- now, but that's the language. Now, look at the next one."
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1866.165,1866.63,Right.
2016.15-1039,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1866.63,1869.72,"-- no declaratory actions, they're all frozen."
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1873.355,1873.8,Right.
2016.15-1039,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1873.8,1879.3,"And so all we have to do is, number 1, day 1, they give the Section (2) notice, send them all the information."
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1885.1,1885.69,That's right.
2016.15-1039,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1885.69,1886.37,"Yeah, that's right."
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1888.55,1888.81,That -- that is --

2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1902.77,1904.22,There are strong incentives.

2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1909.19,1911.21,-- the applicant is for -- is barred.
2016.15-1039,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1911.21,1911.98,"No, he'll give it."
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1912.7,1914.5,"Well, if he gives the information, then they're only --"
2016.15-1039,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1914.5,1917.21,Then all the declaratory courts come in and everybody jumps in on day 2.

2016.15-1039,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1924.82,1925.09,Okay.
2016.15-1039,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1938.495,1939.78,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.15-1039,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1939.78,1946.1,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-1039,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1946.1,1947.36,Mr. Waxman.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1947.36,1982.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress did not create detailed procedures for resolving biosimilar disputes and repeatedly use the word ""shall"" merely to have applicants who choose to take advantage of the statute's benefits and use the sponsor's information, then disregard those mandates. I think -- I think I -- I'm inclined to be guided on what the -- which of the many complicated aspects of this statute to talk about by the Court's -- by the Court's questions."
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1988.91,1989.77,How -- I'll phrase a -- I'll --
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1989.77,1989.89,Okay.
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1989.89,2002.26,"I'll put a question before you, okay? As I understand -- I got your position, which is that they have to give notice after the FDA approval, correct?"
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2002.26,2006.3,"On the -- yes, on an (8)(A) issue, they have to give --"
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2006.3,2024.27,"Wouldn't that stop Phase 2 litigation from starting immediately? By your definition, they could go the biosimilar and the license --"
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2024.27,2024.99,Referenced product.
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2024.99,2029.03,-- product could go all through round 1.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2065.645,2066.15,No.
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2086.08,2086.39,"No, no, no."
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2088.06,2089.78,I'm -- I'm just getting warmed up.
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2089.78,2094.01,You're assuming -- you're assuming commercial launch has to be 12 years plus 6.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2094.01,2094.21,Well --
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2094.21,2100.875,I'm assuming that commercial launch should be 12 plus 1 --
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2100.875,2101.53,So let me --
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2101.53,2104.27,-- because you only have an exclusive license for 12 years.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2104.27,2150.24,"So let me address that, the 12 years plus 6 months first, and then go to the point of why the notice of commercial licensing has to -- can only coherently be done once the FDA has announced what molecule has been approved for what therapeutic uses and by what manufacturing processes, which is the paramount importance when you're talking about biosimilars. So as to the 180 -- the 12 versus 12 and a half years, the FDA -- no one has yet applied for biosimilar licensure until long after the 12 years has ended."
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2200.855,2202.79,That strengthens my argument.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2202.79,2203.29,Well --
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2203.29,2212.43,"Because if the FDA is taking that position, then it's basically kicking off the possibility of round 2 pretty early."
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2212.43,2213.26,Yes.
2016.15-1039,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2584.81,2585.3,How -- how many times --
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2585.3,2586.8,-- what it is that's being enjoined.
2016.15-1039,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2586.8,2593.42,How often is the issue the validity of the patent rather than its infringement?
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2593.42,2632.2,"We don't have a sufficient data set to be able to evaluate it because, you know, in the seven years that this Act has been in place, the FDA has accepted for review only 14 of these applications and has only granted 5 of them, the last one being last Friday. And so in some of them, there have -- you know, for example, Amgen got approved -- biosimilar approval for its biosimilar to AbbVie's referenced drug Humira."
2016.15-1039,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2740.77,2745.59,"Mr. Waxman, let's say -- let's say I spot you that, okay, that (2)(A) ""shall"" means shall."
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2746.095,2746.31,Okay.
2016.15-1039,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2746.31,2751.725,"But the question still remains under (l)(9) -- (9) -- (9)(C), rather, (l)(9)(C), what the remedy is."
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2766.785,2777.95,"Well, what -- I mean, we agree with the government that when (2)(A) says ""shall,"" and when (1)(B) says ""shall,"" that is a mandate."
2016.15-1039,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2777.95,2778.8,I'm spotting you that --
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2778.8,2778.95,Okay.
2016.15-1039,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2778.95,2780.11,-- for purposes of this question.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2780.11,2781.12,I just want to make sure that --
2016.15-1039,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2781.12,2786.34,"You can't -- it's hard to divorce a right from its remedy, isn't it, and to understand the contours of the right."
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2792.33,2792.39,So --
2016.15-1039,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2792.39,2794.155,And here the remedy is (9)(C).
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2794.155,2800.0,"So let me -- can I bookmark the State law cause of action, because I do want to get back and explain why --"
2016.15-1039,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2800.0,2801.18,However -- however best you want to do it.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2801.18,2801.42,Our -- okay.
2016.15-1039,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2838.88,2840.05,I -- I got that.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2840.05,2840.38,Okay.
2016.15-1039,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2840.38,2840.86,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2848.745,2849.31,"Well, the --"
2016.15-1039,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2849.31,2855.31,Because the -- a violation is circumscribed in a certain way here by the remedies provided by Federal law.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2855.31,2872.86,"Well -- so I don't -- this may be a definitional failure of communication, but ""shall"" either means ""shall."" The remedy question is who -- who, if anybody, can do anything about it, if you don't comply with ""shall,"" right?"
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2872.86,2875.35,That -- that's -- no. It's not quite that.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2884.545,2885.19,Okay.
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2885.44,2894.695,"All right? So if you don't invoke the Federal process, what remains? That's not a remedy."
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2921.47,2922.185,Okay.
2016.15-1039,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3052.22,3052.3,No.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3053.08,3063.69,"And (9)(C) simply confirms what is -- what should be obvious, which is if it isn't provided, the sponsor is left to his background rights to -- to litigate the declaratory-judgment action."
2016.15-1039,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3063.69,3071.47,"So why haven't you driven us to the following conclusion, which will be unsatisfactory, again, from everybody's point of view? We said you're right --"
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3071.47,3074.12,Setting the bar pretty low for me. (Laughter.)
2016.15-1039,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3074.12,3075.09,You're right.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3122.69,3122.9,I -- no.
2016.15-1039,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3163.83,3167.98,"Well, that is fine. But we also have pretty well-established preemption laws."
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3177.985,3178.4,Well --
2016.15-1039,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3178.4,3186.885,"And not only that, I mean, if we apply California law, then, presumably, in some circumstances, we apply the law of every other State and maybe they reach different consequences."
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3199.69,3201.95,"Well, let me -- let me address that head on."
2016.15-1039,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3201.95,3203.71,"Not to prejudge the issues, maybe."
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3203.71,3209.88,"First of all, the preemption question, there's no ambiguity about whether preemption was waived."
2016.15-1039,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3211.66,3211.93,"Oh, no."
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3217.855,3248.25,"I completely understand that. In Bates v. Dow Agroscience, the Court rejected my argument that the -- the farmer in question had a remedy under, I believe, it was Texas State law for the violation of a substantive -- Texas State law made a violation of State law a violation of a substantive provision of the Federal FIFRA statute."
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3347.71,3348.05,But that --
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3348.05,3348.59,-- for a court to --

2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3454.64,3457.66,"What you're not telling me is, it's no longer a choice --"
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3457.66,3458.93,So let me explain --
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3458.93,3462.17,-- because State law can force them --
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3462.17,3462.95,So --
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3462.95,3467.96,-- through you seeking injunctions to participate unwillingly.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3467.96,3468.495,Okay.
2016.15-1039,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3552.96,3564.635,"Well, what's -- what's wrong with that? Why can't you argue that the notice is defective and seek a declaratory judgment on that basis, that the notice is insufficient, doesn't provide you with adequate notice as required by statute?"
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3564.635,3567.76,"Well, that -- that, of course, is exactly what we claim."
2016.15-1039,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3570.55,3570.67,Right.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3570.67,3571.97,-- filed their application.
2016.15-1039,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3579.92,3581.06,I understand that.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3581.2,3581.745,-- and the remedy.
2016.15-1039,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3581.745,3591.909,"If you say the notice itself is defective, apart from when it's given, because it doesn't provide enough information, isn't that a possible remedy right there?"
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3591.909,3594.22,"Well, yes."
2016.15-1039,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3656.74,3665.255,"But isn't that true of a lot of what this Act contemplates? I mean, all the round 1 litigation can occur before the approval is given."
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3665.255,3665.96,That's right.
2016.15-1039,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3681.37,3698.39,"But I guess what I'm saying is that it seems as though this statute contemplates that you can do a lot of this process prior to the approval, but that's not a necessary piece of information you need in order to start evaluating whether there's infringement."
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3698.39,3704.99,"So, Justice Kagan, the -- let's say Phase I starts."
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3892.49,3902.875,"I'm sorry, Mr. Waxman. Assume that there has been phase I, round one and round two before the approval."
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3967.48,3967.915,So --
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3967.915,3974.9,They lost on all the wider ones. I -- I'm not sure what unfairness there is to the license.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3974.9,3975.055,So --
2016.15-1039,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3975.055,3978.15,If you -- if you go through the process the way it's anticipated.
2016.15-1039,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3978.15,4020.19,"Number one, it is very -- we've not had a situation, and it is remarkably unlikely that we will get to a situation in which there are no patent disputes left to be resolved once the license issues both because, as has happened with respect to our product at issue in this case, and in the Apotex case, the FDA -- the -- the PTO has indeed issued us a patent that bears on this that we couldn't include in the lists. Number two, everybody needs some time to be able to figure out whether your hypothesis is right, which is that what the FDA has approved is narrower than what the application was, not broader."
2016.15-1039,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4049.705,4053.49,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Ms. Maynard."
2016.15-1039,3,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,4053.49,4060.59,"Thank you, Your Honor. There can be no doubt that the judgment that we've petitioned on is a Federal judgment."
2016.15-1039,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4257.18,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
