1958.7,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,1230.27,1235.47,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3370.294,3374.552,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1958.7,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3465.169,3466.6,One of Southern cables and --
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3466.6,3469.355,"It's one -- there, it's one -- it's a cable."
1958.7,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3477.135,3481.193,You mean 21 (Inaudible) rather than -- the Government has --
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3481.193,3482.454,The Government had leased it.
1958.7,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3483.377,3484.819,What do they need it?
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3484.819,3496.461,They just -- just as Your -- Your Honor would do when you have a number given to you in -- in the city for your use it was many more than what the Government has.
1958.7,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3499.735,3503.009,Are you -- are you telling me that looking at these transactions --
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3503.009,3505.206,"You couldn't, Your Honor couldn't tell it."
1958.7,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3505.206,3506.307,Two solid cables?
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3506.307,3508.502,Two solid cables with another cable.
1958.7,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3526.883,3536.139,"Well, what do this -- meaning (Inaudible) the Government's dissent was get in there and repair them, what -- what's that mean?"
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3536.139,3547.881,"The evidence shows that before they would go in to fix some of those circuits, they would just notify the Government that they were coming in and they were going to repair it."
1958.7,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3548.67,3549.642,What would they repair?
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3552.884,3568.003,"It certainly wasn't the cable, unless something broke somewhere down the line on the -- on the coaxial and became disconnected or a thunderstorm or a -- or tornado may have turned that hot, but there really isn't anything to -- to repair."
1958.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3568.003,3572.782,"Could the Government say no, if they wanted to come in and repair whatever there was to repair?"
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3572.782,3574.539,"Yes, I suppose the Government --"
1958.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3574.539,3576.556,Doesn't that mean with full --
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3576.556,3576.993,Well --
1958.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3576.993,3580.389,"-- desire to get your permission to do something, don't you control my (Voice Overlap) --"
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3580.389,3585.333,"But we're -- we're not raising here the point, Mr. Justice Frankfurter about the control that's been over."
1958.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3586.558,3588.923,"Well, I don't understand what the point of your argument?"
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3588.923,3589.889,"Then, it's the same thing."
1958.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3624.711,3630.432,"Well, do I -- the inference I get from your argument is important."
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3636.747,3638.489,"Oh no, Your -- Your Honor."
1958.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3639.083,3645.846,And it -- because I understand that it's protected by -- not even relying to the telephone company turned in and accept why it say so.
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3646.836,3658.002,"Yes, it protected in that respect, but only to the extent that if there anything has to be done, the telephone company will just call up the government official and say, ""We're coming in and we're going to fix it."""
1958.7,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3665.323,3669.421,"Suppose Uncle Sam says, ""No, you can't do this,"" then what?"
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3669.421,3681.712,"Well, I suppose it would be the same as if I had a lease wire and the telephone company wanted to come in and fix them -- the line and I -- just says, ""No, you can't do it."""
1958.7,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3681.712,3689.115,But there's no question that the Government could deny the telephone company access to whatever it has --
1958.7,2,18382,charles_a_bellows,,3689.115,3697.841,I -- I would agree that the Government could.
