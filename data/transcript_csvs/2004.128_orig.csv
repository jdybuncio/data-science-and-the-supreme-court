2004.128_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,5.471,We'll now hear argument in Alaska against the United States.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,6.345,9.674,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.128_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,95.897,105.453,"Well, counsel, you... apparently you agree that the U.S. retained title to the uplands in Glacier Bay National Monument under section 5--"
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,105.453,106.03,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.128_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,106.03,106.589,--of the statehood act.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,106.589,107.123,Absolutely.
2004.128_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.123,121.602,And why was Federal title to the monument not sufficient to retain title to the submerged lands as well without reference to section 6(e) at all?
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,121.602,123.405,"Because of section 6(m), Your Honor."
2004.128_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,189.937,210.629,"--problem, as... you just said that... that the main clause is very, very narrow, and we're told by the Government that no wildlife reservation would come within that main clause, so that there would be nothing to retain under the second clause."
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,210.629,212.544,"--The Government is incorrect, Your Honor."
2004.128_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,312.356,319.892,Why... why shouldn't we look to the tests set out in the Idaho case here?
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,319.892,323.658,"We are advocating the tests set out in the Idaho case, Your Honor."
2004.128_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.732,326.164,Right.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,326.164,328.504,"First, you have to look and see if there is a--"
2004.128_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,328.504,336.419,"Whether Congress has notice of the inclusion of the lands and a Federal reservation, which it certainly did for Glacier, did it not?"
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,336.419,339.166,"--That's... that's relevant to the first prong, Your Honor."
2004.128_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,340.035,345.602,"And second, whether the transfer to the State would undermine the purpose of that reservation."
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,346.957,353.09,"--If the Court were examining the... the first prong, Your Honor, I think those factors might be relevant."
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,384.893,386.103,Why do you say explicit?
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,390.326,391.254,In--
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,391.254,397.333,What it says... the language I think is... or definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,397.333,397.669,--Yes.
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,398.154,398.96,Is that right?
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,400.704,407.455,"--Well, Your Honor, in the Alaska case... and here I refer the Court to page 44 of the 1997 Alaska case."
2004.128_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,416.058,420.756,"But doesn't that simply mean that if it explicitly recognizes, it has made it plain."
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,420.756,421.529,--Yes.
2004.128_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,421.529,424.078,But it doesn't mean that it must be explicit in every case.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,424.915,427.107,"Well, I... I think explicit--"
2004.128_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,427.107,428.612,You don't have to be explicit to make it plain.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,431.257,433.956,"--It has to be definitely... Justice Breyer, you're correct."
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,434.431,434.873,All right.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,434.873,436.302,--definitely clear or otherwise made plain.
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,436.302,446.573,"If I'm correct, then... if I'm correct, then I guess the main argument I thought is here we have a national park and we want to keep the national parks as the United States, which you'd expect."
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,470.781,474.824,"Well, there is something special about the water, Your Honor, and that's what the Court has recognized."
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,479.01,479.82,I understand that.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,509.441,513.477,"--First of all, the geysers are not included because we're talking about navigable--"
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,513.477,513.664,I understand that.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,514.698,514.811,--Yes.
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,572.501,573.285,--Like in Yellowstone.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,575.301,580.01,"--Well, Yellowstone was created before the State of Wyoming and--"
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,580.01,580.24,No.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,583.338,587.205,--One would need to examine the particular reservations and statutes there.
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,587.205,588.208,What about in Yosemite?
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,594.57,597.925,"I'm not familiar with that, but I will give you an example that I am familiar with."
2004.128_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,597.925,605.487,"Before you do that, Mr. Franklin, is... is the rule that... that we're operating under that Congress had to have made it clear--"
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,605.487,605.908,Yes.
2004.128_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.908,612.281,"--that it reserved, or is the rule that it is clear that Congress ought to have reserved it?"
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,612.281,612.618,No.
2004.128_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.577,613.689,It's the former.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,613.689,614.174,Yes.
2004.128_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.174,621.469,"So the mere fact that it doesn't make any sense not to have reserved it does not make it clear that Congress reserved it, does it?"
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,621.469,622.334,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,622.334,627.72,"Right, but normally you assume, I guess, that Congress does what is... tries to avoid things that are ridiculous."
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,632.638,633.165,It's not--
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,633.165,634.083,--can you read it this way?
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,635.634,639.607,"--Well, first of all, this is not the ordinary... in this case we presumed the... the opposite."
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,643.932,644.391,Yes.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,644.391,646.689,There's something called the California Coastal National Monument.
2004.128_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,664.176,668.591,"Mr. Franklin, are... are these submerged lands covered by navigable waters?"
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,668.591,668.959,--Yes.
2004.128_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,668.959,686.019,"What is it that the Government could do, if they owned the submerged lands, by way of protecting wildlife and doing all the good stuff they want to do, that they cannot do simply by... by reason of... of having jurisdiction over the navigable waters?"
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,686.019,692.009,"There are a few things, presumably very localized activities that the State would have the exclusive authority in."
2004.128_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,703.758,707.101,"Yes, but just as a practical matter, tell us what you're arguing about."
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,717.534,722.91,"--As... as a practical matter, there are issues relating to local subsistence fishing that are important to the State."
2004.128_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,726.99,728.685,"Well, could... could you be concrete?"
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,733.048,738.306,"--Well, one explicit example is I think the State would prefer to have more local subsistence fishing in the bay."
2004.128_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,741.965,745.858,So the State would permit more fishing than the U.S. would allow--
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,745.858,746.551,--I think--
2004.128_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,746.551,747.457,--as a practical matter.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,747.457,748.108,--As a practical matter.
2004.128_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.169,753.355,But couldn't Congress forbid that under... by reason of its control of the navigable waters--
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,753.355,753.995,"--Well, if--"
2004.128_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.995,755.002,--if it really wanted to?
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,755.002,759.494,"--If Congress really wanted to, Congress could... could affect activities relating to interstate commerce."
2004.128_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,866.576,875.642,"Well, there... there are big differences between the... the analysis concerning the bays that you assert and Glacier Monument."
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,877.001,878.719,"--Well, the... the tests are different."
2004.128_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,885.477,889.908,"You're lumping them all together, but I think the tests are quite different."
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,889.908,890.767,--The tests are different.
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,896.921,898.643,But in... in respect to Glacier Bay--
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,898.643,899.331,--Yes.
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,899.331,923.768,"--I... I mean, is the only... you said, for example... is the only dispute about the use of the water that's in the middle of the Glacier Bay park whether there should be more or less fishing, or are there other things that Alaska wants to do with that water in the park that they can't do if the United States owns it?"
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,923.768,924.37,There are two issues.
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,933.751,934.326,How could they do that?
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,940.982,945.498,"--Well, that's normally what... what people do is they just visit the--"
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,945.498,945.551,I see.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,945.551,946.052,--by boats.
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,950.729,950.873,No.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,983.474,985.128,"Well, that's not true, Your Honor."
2004.128_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,992.001,995.089,"No. I understand that, but I mean, it's the way of visiting the park."
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,995.089,998.336,"--Yes, but I just mentioned, for example, the two monuments in California."
2004.128_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1070.403,1085.511,"In the... in the '97 case, was the area at issue within the first part of 6(e)?"
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1088.562,1089.111,Yes.
2004.128_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1095.89,1097.901,--It... it made an assumption.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1097.901,1100.338,"The Court made an assumption, but in fact--"
2004.128_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1100.338,1102.087,But was it in fact?
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1102.087,1110.845,"--I think there would have been a substantial... had that... had that issue been litigated, there would have been a substantial argument that it was not within the main clause."
2004.128_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1156.28,1157.485,I thought we had left that open.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1158.514,1166.851,"--I think what I said is that the Court embraced that position, and it was actually an essential attribute of the... essential premise for the Court's holding."
2004.128_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1250.098,1259.356,"Well, the argument on the other side, as I understand it, is that the... the assertion of authority to regulate fishing really is... is relevant."
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1263.97,1264.497,That's the assertion.
2004.128_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1298.518,1299.904,What... what page was that?
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1299.904,1300.207,I'm sorry.
2004.128_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.313,1385.264,"--On... on this point, it seems to me there... unlike the first point you were discussing where I think the Federal Government can work its will anyway, on this point there is really a significant Federal interest involved."
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1401.702,1403.21,--No.
2004.128_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.451,1430.875,"No, but... but you say a determinative fact, a conclusive fact is simply... is simply enforcing discriminatory fishing regulations."
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1430.875,1441.904,"It is a claim to the... to the waters, which was made in 1903, accompanied with discriminatory fishing enforcement, accompanied with other statements in this case, including the California brief to this Court."
2004.128_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1465.114,1471.268,But it's not the United States that will be making the judgment about what areas are controlled.
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1481.289,1481.412,--Right.
2004.128_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1481.412,1487.235,And they will decide what looks like the Alaska--
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1487.235,1487.421,Right.
2004.128_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1543.297,1545.111,--Why should it make that suggestion?
2004.128_orig,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1547.474,1554.444,"Well, it... it needs to explain more specifically then, other than just stating we think it might affect our position."
2004.128_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.028,1585.211,"Yes, Mr. Franklin."
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1587.125,1591.611,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.128_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1609.301,1613.706,"Could... before you go into that, could you tell me how 6(e) begins?"
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1613.706,1614.261,--Yes.
2004.128_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.384,1617.518,"I mean, (e)--"
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1617.518,1618.899,--of our... of the gray brief.
2004.128_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1618.899,1624.163,"--Yes, but the... well... well, the... the introduction to it is... is not listed, is it?"
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1624.574,1627.22,That may... that may be so.
2004.128_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.22,1628.452,"--I mean, it's incomplete."
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1638.206,1646.701,"Well, 6(e) I think begins stating that this... these are exceptions to section 5 which is the retention... the general retention provision of the United... for United States lands."
2004.128_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.4,1650.397,"Well, you say they're exceptions."
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1662.598,1662.655,--No.
2004.128_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1675.23,1675.603,Okay.
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1675.961,1679.091,--But if I could walk you through those provisions because I think they're quite important.
2004.128_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.021,1689.517,Right.
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1689.517,1691.576,It's followed by another provision here.

2004.128_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.9,1815.995,--let me... why don't you go back to your argument?
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1823.206,1823.574,Yes.
2004.128_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.947,1827.275,But that's not the proviso at issue here.
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1827.275,1827.536,--Yes.
2004.128_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.536,1835.921,The proviso at issue here is the second proviso which begins provided that such transfer shall not include lands.

2004.128_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.571,1867.925,"I mean, anybody reading that would... would think that proviso refers to that transfer or at least it is not clear that it provides to... that it applies to every transfer in... in the whole act."

2004.128_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1884.303,1884.734,What does the such refer to?
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1884.734,1886.729,--It does refer to the transfer before.
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1941.913,1953.31,"Yes, but where is the language that says that the submerged land that fits the proviso is retained by the United States?"

2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1954.84,1956.296,What the proviso says is just what Justice Scalia said.
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1956.296,1958.712,--We do not need express language that expresses--
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1958.712,1960.76,"No, no, but where is the implication in that?"
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1960.76,1963.966,--The implication is that we are retaining all of the reservation.
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1967.79,1980.238,"That's... that's... it... I mean, in... in... I take it in the Alaska case we were considering a transfer that did fall within the main sentence of (e)."

2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1987.886,1988.755,Were we or weren't we?
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1988.755,1990.018,--You were not considering that.
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1990.018,1990.018,We weren't.
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1990.018,1994.604,That... that was... simply neither party suggested that ANWR fell within the first provision.
2004.128_orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2010.764,2013.723,But the Court did assume... the Court did assume that.
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2013.723,2015.062,Yes.

2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2029.093,2029.418,All right.
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2029.7,2031.304,It's an afterthought that simply reinforces.
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2031.304,2031.758,--All right.
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2064.84,2075.601,"Your Honor, but that's... it's clear that what this is... this is more along the lines if someone said that I will sell you my house, provided that transfer shall not include the detached garage."
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2075.601,2077.152,"Fine, and then it doesn't go in that."
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2077.152,2077.275,In that case--
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2077.275,2078.657,But it doesn't mean that the next--
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2078.657,2079.018,"--Yes, but it was not a part of the house."
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.018,2079.661,--Yes.
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2079.661,2084.844,"You know, that's... it's just providing clarification, just that one of the purposes of the proviso is to provide clarification."
2004.128_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2084.844,2085.768,This is an abundance of caution?
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2085.768,2087.629,In other... that is exactly right.
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2088.882,2089.341,All right.
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2097.741,2099.41,--That would be section 5.
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2102.445,2112.668,But 5 is subject to the Submerged Lands Act and the Submerged Lands Act brings you back to the reservation has to be explicit.
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2114.354,2117.298,"Well, Justice Breyer, again, if I can just complete the point--"
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2117.298,2118.07,--That's why I was talking about Yellowstone.
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2118.07,2118.199,--Yes.
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2118.199,2122.689,I was looking for something that would be obvious that they wouldn't have meant to transfer.

2004.128_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2180.982,2187.078,But why... why doesn't (m) supersede that argument anyway?
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2193.953,2202.327,"--Then you have to explain what happened in the Arctic Coast case, why we were able to retain the ANWR lands which did not fall within the main provision."

2004.128_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2334.222,2337.988,And... and it seems to me that's exactly why we have a clear statement rule.

2004.128_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2429.057,2430.129,Are they likely to do that?

2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2446.631,2446.843,--All right.
2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2458.508,2459.665,That is correct.
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.665,2460.177,All right.

2004.128_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2491.167,2492.394,--That's--
2004.128_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2492.394,2505.241,"Now... now, once I made that argument, he said that's a very clever argument, but really, there are all kinds of instances where States have reserved submerged land inside national parks and it's worked fine."
