1998.97-2000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.189,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 97-2000, American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company v. Delores Scott Sullivan."
1998.97-2000,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,11.156,13.891,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-2000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,54.734,56.284,"Have they petitioned, Mr.... Mr. McConnell?"
1998.97-2000,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,56.284,58.019,--They did petition.
1998.97-2000,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,114.656,128.713,"Mr. McConnell, from what you've said, it seems to me that if the due process question were decided in your favor... as you mentioned, you have the State insurance fund in there and public employers."
1998.97-2000,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,135.485,137.802,"--Your Honor, that may very well be true."
1998.97-2000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,145.841,149.06,That was the way we decided Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison.
1998.97-2000,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,158.934,171.908,"Yes, Your Honor, although in the... in the San Francisco Athletic case, the Gay Olympics case, the Court did both decide a State action question and the First Amendment question which was logically related to... to the two."
1998.97-2000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,174.36,178.395,Leaving... leaving later generations to say that one-half or the other is dictum.
1998.97-2000,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,179.062,184.466,"--Lower courts, fortunately, aren't free to say that, Justice Kennedy."
1998.97-2000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,217.77,221.322,What's your best argument to distinguish Tulsa Professional Collection?
1998.97-2000,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,224.959,240.468,"Well, Your Honor, in... in Tulsa... an ordinary private citizen, such as the administrator of an... of an estate does not have the power to... to end, to cut off the rights of their creditors."
1998.97-2000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,273.457,277.759,"So, the distinction is between cutting it off all together and simply deferring payment?"
1998.97-2000,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,277.759,291.601,"--Well, Your Honor, it has to do with... what the... what the private party can do is withhold payment pending some kind of legal process that comes down the road, which is, of course, the standard practice with insurance."
1998.97-2000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.126,342.684,"Well, that is true if you focus just on the specific action here, to wit, failing to pay benefits while you determine if it's reasonable or necessary."
1998.97-2000,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,361.496,370.501,"Well, Your Honor, workers' compensation is a substitute for private tort, but that seems to support our contention that this is private action."
1998.97-2000,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,406.107,409.245,But you've pointed out the unseemliness of having two regimes.
1998.97-2000,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,434.944,439.348,"I don't think that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.97-2000,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,444.834,446.267,"Yes, but if you're right on your theory of State action."
1998.97-2000,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,446.267,457.642,"If we're right on our theory of State action, we still have... there are still parties before this Court who are bound by the judgment of the Third Circuit and who are confessedly State actors."
1998.97-2000,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1124.042,1134.498,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-2000,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1293.302,1296.671,Is the UR examiner a State actor?
1998.97-2000,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1296.671,1297.421,We believe that it is.
1998.97-2000,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1308.912,1310.93,Who is the... who is the URO?
1998.97-2000,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1314.465,1320.036,--My understanding is that they are organizations which will... they will be selected at... at random.
1998.97-2000,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1348.686,1354.875,"So, if the UR cut off notice... cut off plans without any notice, then you'd have a Tulsa Collection case."
1998.97-2000,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1354.875,1373.42,"Well, certainly if... if... to take the easiest example, if the doctors on the... if the utilization review organization was composed of people who had a financial interest in the outcome of the dispute, you would have a classic due process violation because the UR itself would be subject to procedural due process rules."
1998.97-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1557.739,1560.058,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1561.926,1570.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1616.778,1621.132,"But you are only contesting the time before the URO, as I understand it."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1634.539,1636.558,"--Well, the process itself is integrated."
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1654.02,1658.055,"Well, we... we've over that now because I think it's taken as given under the new State notice."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1692.561,1695.68,"--I think, Justice Ginsburg, that you raised two separate issues."
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1738.507,1753.766,"Yes, but if one... I understand your argument to say this person's own doctor thinks they should be paid, and until the utilization review person makes a determination, it isn't fair to take these benefits away."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1768.609,1769.076,All right.
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1781.584,1781.867,Right.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1792.725,1793.692,It goes on for months.
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1803.83,1805.43,The briefs say 30 to 70 days.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1805.43,1807.282,--There are no limits as to how--
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1807.282,1809.115,Is that... is that 30... is that accurate--
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1809.115,1809.548,--No.
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1810.317,1812.4,"--that the statute says 30 days, but it can go--"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1812.4,1813.936,It's clearly not 30 days.
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1822.708,1827.592,--Where did the 30 to 70... the average is something like 70 days--
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1827.592,1831.211,"I have no idea, Your Honor, because this case was dismissed on a 12(b)(6) and there is no record."
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1859.547,1860.164,--Wait.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1872.521,1872.89,Right.
1998.97-2000,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.89,1875.706,"Now, in a private tort system, couldn't the same thing happen?"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1880.294,1882.496,"Yes, but this is not a private tort system."
1998.97-2000,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.948,1892.518,"Well, but... but you... you don't claim you're any worse off than... than what you would have been like without workmen's comp.--"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1892.518,1893.851,--Not without workers' comp--
1998.97-2000,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.851,1899.755,"--I mean, in fact, you might have to wait years until completion of... of all the appellate proceedings in... in a private tort suit--"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1899.755,1900.288,--But--
1998.97-2000,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.288,1900.921,--against the insurer.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1900.921,1904.89,"--But in that system you don't have a public benefits system, which we clearly do in this situation."
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1904.89,1905.992,What about any medical?
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1915.514,1916.247,That's correct.
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1916.247,1920.216,I thought that this was about reimbursing the doctor.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1950.521,1952.254,There are certainly many doctors--
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1952.254,1953.973,"It doesn't discourage yours or mine, does it?"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1953.973,1965.113,"--Well, I... I can't say about yours or mine, Your Honor, but clearly in this situation, as the experience of most of the named plaintiffs indicates, doctors don't treat unless they're going to get paid within the... within the--"
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1965.113,1968.982,"You know, but they'll get paid for what the insurer considers reasonable."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1978.004,1978.388,--Yes.
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1978.388,1978.954,Why?
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1978.954,1979.421,They were.
1998.97-2000,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.421,1981.64,I thought 5 out of the 10 continued to receive treatment?
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,1981.64,1982.323,"No, it wasn't five."
1998.97-2000,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2013.177,2019.247,"Well, to say... to say you can't go outside the system, I mean, that's really true long before workmen's compensation came in."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2037.042,2040.16,"That's correct, Your Honor, but Pennsylvania substituted that system."
1998.97-2000,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2042.527,2043.027,Why do you--
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2043.027,2043.677,--plaintiffs have a property interest.
1998.97-2000,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2043.677,2044.177,--Just a minute.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2052.716,2056.435,We think that it changed the nature of the property right.
1998.97-2000,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2062.572,2064.822,What do you mean by public benefit system?
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2065.121,2080.098,"--I mean a system that is guaranteed by State law, which is administered by State law, in which all of the criteria, all of the... the payments, the nature of the payments, the amount of payments, when the payments can be made, when they can be stopped, the administration, everything is controlled directly by the State."
1998.97-2000,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2080.098,2082.033,Why isn't that essentially true of a tort system?
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2098.078,2103.899,What the petitioners are basically analogizing this to is car insurance and other kinds of private commercial insurance.
1998.97-2000,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2104.882,2106.515,"Yes, but what about the answer... what about the answer to my question?"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2120.325,2123.11,"No, because it's not guaranteed."
1998.97-2000,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2126.495,2131.299,"Well, it... it guarantees, if one determines eligibility, for the coverage."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2131.299,2132.149,--That's correct.
1998.97-2000,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2132.149,2142.088,And the tort system guarantees payment if one fulfills the conditions before a finder of fact or a jury for... for liability and damages.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2155.332,2157.784,What the State has done is to substitute that system.
1998.97-2000,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2165.453,2167.222,"Well, now, just a minute."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2175.328,2176.928,"--That's correct, and there is no--"
1998.97-2000,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2176.928,2180.963,"So, there's a criteria just as there is in tort law where you have to show negligence."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2185.517,2188.636,"--But for the purposes of utilization review, all of that is assumed."
1998.97-2000,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2192.588,2203.661,"But... but your argument is that this is a public benefit system, and I... I think the question suggests that we're curious as to know why that makes it different analytically from the traditional tort system."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2203.661,2207.597,"--Because the State has the duty, in the context of this system, which it has imposed on itself."
1998.97-2000,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2212.517,2215.183,"Well, what... what duty has the State imposed on itself?"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2215.183,2218.235,"--The State guarantees the benefit, number one."
1998.97-2000,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2225.075,2232.062,"Are you... are you saying that if... if the workmen's compensation insurer should default, then the State comes in and itself makes the payment?"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2232.062,2233.012,"--Yes, I am saying that."
1998.97-2000,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2236.947,2244.887,Is the security fund appropriated public money or is the security fund a fund established by contributions of insurers?
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2244.887,2246.887,"--I'm not exactly sure how it works, but I know that--"
1998.97-2000,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2246.887,2248.939,"Well, it would make a difference, though, I would think to your argument, wouldn't it?"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2249.239,2250.289,"--I don't think it does, Your Honor."
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2270.252,2280.476,"Basically what I think is worrying at least me is if you were to win this case on the State action point, what about Blue Cross-Blue Shield?"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2330.307,2332.009,"No, that is not what we're suggesting."
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2334.195,2335.161,Then what's the difference?
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2335.161,2337.747,--is a unique context in which the benefits are guaranteed.
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2339.063,2340.432,They're guaranteed in ERISA.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2352.822,2354.691,--But you have to look at the way the statute works.
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2373.836,2378.057,But does due process require the particular scheme Pennsylvania has?
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2402.772,2406.541,"--Well, certainly if the individual is precluded from receiving treatment during that time--"
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2406.541,2409.576,"Not precluded from receiving treatment, certainly not."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2435.893,2438.345,--I don't think it necessarily does.
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2449.284,2450.934,"Well, I wish you address my question."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2467.579,2470.131,--I think it would depend on how it works.
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2476.851,2477.251,No.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2478.886,2479.52,--I'm trying to.
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2479.52,2484.54,--Nothing is going to happen for years because there's going to be a check on each bill.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2504.169,2516.678,"I think as long as it's quick, very quick, and as long as the individual has a right to be heard and the treatment is not stopped during a lengthy process, probably that system will be constitutional, but clearly that's not what we have here."
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2517.861,2530.319,"I don't know what you mean by the treatment not stopping because I've given you... my question is, must there be payment first during litigation or can there be like it would be in the tort system?"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2538.359,2544.263,--It doesn't necessarily have to be that... that way... you're correct... as far as a due process... for due process purposes.
1998.97-2000,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2575.967,2576.634,Excuse me.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2608.521,2614.758,--What I'm saying is that in this context what we have is a transfer of State power from the State to the insurance carrier.
1998.97-2000,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2614.758,2615.041,No.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2623.364,2623.881,I'm attempting to do that.
1998.97-2000,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2625.597,2635.171,"The question is... you recall Justice Ginsburg's question, a State system in which you don't get any payments until you establish that... that it was reasonable medical care."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2642.075,2642.708,Right.
1998.97-2000,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2642.708,2654.966,Would your answer to that question be different if Justice Ginsburg's system were imposed by the State after the State had initially had a system in which you could get your medical payments immediately?
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2671.844,2674.046,I'm not sure it would be different.
1998.97-2000,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2676.046,2692.675,"Well, what I'm getting at is it seems to me you say that once a State passes a statute enacting a certain welfare scheme, everyone has a vested interest in that welfare scheme, and any change from it... I mean, it's your characterization that it's a welfare scheme."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2702.364,2703.649,--Not necessarily.
1998.97-2000,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2719.242,2723.444,"No, but the... I think you're saying, though, that the State cannot change its law."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2778.714,2779.231,No.
1998.97-2000,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2785.803,2798.46,"Then what is the relevance of the fact that in the scheme prior to the modification that is in question here, there was an obligation to pay without an option to withhold payment under protest?"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2800.562,2803.146,Because the nature of the property interest hasn't changed.
1998.97-2000,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2805.864,2808.697,"But the nature of the property interest was derived from the State law, wasn't it?"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2808.697,2810.149,--It was and--
1998.97-2000,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2810.149,2814.434,And now the State law has changed and you have agreed with me that the State can change its law.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2820.874,2830.396,"--Well, there's no due process right to necessarily have the law always be the same, but in this context, you have a State system providing public benefits to individuals."
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2839.285,2853.428,"It sounds like you're saying that if the State is more generous, then it's going to be saddled with the due process obligations that it wouldn't have if it had been less generous to the worker."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2853.428,2854.011,--No.
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2858.197,2867.386,"But you have just said if the State doesn't pay up front, if it says we want proof before we pay any bill, then you wouldn't have your claim about no suspension."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2898.088,2904.225,--We don't have to... we don't have to even look at the prior statute before Act 44 to answer the question.
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2919.367,2928.323,"My question is what process is due, and you told me that in a case of... that the State could say, we'll check every bill, and that wouldn't violate due process."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2933.31,2939.046,"--Because you're taking away a vested property right, and that's what the problem is, through a State established procedure."
1998.97-2000,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2944.6,2959.943,"So, if you were to prevail, an appropriate answer for the State would be to say, we're going to move this checking system up and we're not going to pay any bill without... without determining as insurers... isn't that the way insurers ordinarily work?"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2965.112,2966.23,--I think that's correct.
1998.97-2000,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2971.884,2974.286,Let me get into these hypotheticals for a second.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,2991.831,2992.631,--That's exactly what I'm saying.
1998.97-2000,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2992.631,2998.485,But can one not respond by saying the right is not an unlimited right to continued payment forever.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3011.709,3012.495,That's correct.
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3036.008,3047.466,"Well, is that then... is it different in your... I take it the same statute, the same scheme applies whether the insurer protests the first bill or whether he protests the 18th bill."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3047.466,3048.501,That's correct.
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3048.501,3051.453,But you're only talking about the second and subsequent bills.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3051.453,3054.238,That's... that's really the... that's really where the problem comes in.
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3054.238,3055.154,You're not talking about that first bill.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3061.725,3064.676,Because you don't have... you don't have--
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3064.676,3066.128,Is that right?
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3066.545,3067.211,--That's correct.
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3076.651,3076.934,All right.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3100.749,3101.282,Well--
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3101.282,3103.818,--How in your mind is all that stuff sort itself out?
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3103.818,3112.305,--The real... the real problem comes in in the way the cost containment actually works and what they're really focusing on is ongoing treatment and the experience of the named plaintiffs shows that.
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3117.642,3119.411,"All right, but you see... I understand that."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3134.17,3134.837,"--Well, there are--"
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3134.837,3136.153,I'm just asking you how you've sorted that out--
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3136.153,3136.889,--There are--
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3136.889,3137.205,--in your mind.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3137.205,3141.323,--There are precertification provisions in the act for that particular thing.
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3167.974,3182.667,Is there anything in the Third Circuit's opinion that says what it's talking about is limited simply to those situations in which there has been an ongoing set of treatments of the same sort that now the company wants to terminate?
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3182.667,3184.436,"No, I don't believe there's anything--"
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3184.436,3191.923,"So, as far as we're concerned, we're dealing with an opinion that applies as much to the first treatment as to the last treatment."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3191.923,3193.156,--Except that it's not--
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3193.156,3193.575,Is that right?
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3193.575,3194.292,"--Yes, but it doesn't--"
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3194.292,3194.958,"That's right, okay."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3194.958,3196.494,--really work that way.
1998.97-2000,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3230.445,3232.981,"Of course, in Tulsa, the claim was cut off completely."
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3232.981,3234.016,"--Yes, but--"
1998.97-2000,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3234.016,3241.086,Here there's just a procedure established to defer its adjudication.
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3241.086,3252.227,"--Yes, but this Court has said time and time against that interim deprivations of property are subject to due process constraints just as complete deprivations of property."
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3255.779,3265.952,"How in your opinion is the insurance company supposed to deal... in your opinion under the Constitution as you see it... with a claim that's clearly fraudulent, vastly overstated?"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3275.926,3279.128,"Well, first of all, outside of the system, they would clearly have the right to do that."
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3279.128,3279.544,I'm asking how you--
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3279.544,3284.413,"But in this system, they should ask for utilization review, and they will--"
1998.97-2000,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3284.413,3291.186,"--Can you just say... do they have to pay the bill initially and then try to get the money back, even the clearly fraudulent ones?"
1998.97-2000,2,34823,loralyn_mckinley,,3291.186,3292.152,"--Yes, they do."
1998.97-2000,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3308.73,3309.313,"Thank you, Ms. McKinley."
1998.97-2000,3,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,3312.099,3314.615,I waive my time for rebuttal.
1998.97-2000,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3314.615,3316.099,Very well.
