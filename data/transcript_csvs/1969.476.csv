1969.476,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,19.919,"We'll hear arguments in number 476, Sears, Roebuck and Company against Carpet, Linoleum, Tile, Local Union 419."
1969.476,0,26138,gerard_c_smetana,,22.219,25.387,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.476,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,2016.394,2020.862,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.476,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2085.089,2088.971,And it's pending in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on the petition for rehearing?
1969.476,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,2088.971,2089.36,Right.
1969.476,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2089.36,2090.033,Right.
1969.476,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,2090.033,2090.799,Yes.
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4089.655,4093.775,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4225.577,4236.526,"Mr. Barr, all of that argument is addressed to the litigation in the first stage and we're more or less beyond that, aren't we?"
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4238.216,4238.224,Yes.
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4238.224,4239.723,-- not standing for review.
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4239.723,4248.66,"I'm talking precisely Mr. Chief Justice, about standing to appeal, standing to appeal when the Regional Director refuses to do so."
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4258.238,4263.457,Is that the language that you used when you're talking about an appellate review?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4271.466,4271.762,Yes.
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4271.762,4273.956,There's no evidence to present it in your appellate level.
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4273.956,4279.464,"No, the statute, I admit, does not say precisely there shall be no right of appeal."
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4279.464,4281.213,And I want to have you interrupted for a moment.
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4281.213,4286.87,But it is less than -- it is less than language which would have given them party status.
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4303.323,4304.398,Now --
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4304.398,4304.892,"Now, that same language --"
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4304.892,4320.232,"Of course, you haven't -- you haven't had a chance really to digest the opinions that Mr. Justice Douglas read this morning in connection with the Data Processing case with Barlow case but I suspect you glanced over them."
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4333.133,4343.977,"Unfortunately, the decision that was read this morning has not been read by me and so I cannot compare, I cannot compare the facts in that case to this one but I would like to say."
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4343.977,4345.712,We won't take advantage of you then.
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4345.712,4346.931,I'm very sorry about that.
1969.476,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4555.405,4574.976,"I suppose, your argument, is somewhat similar to an argument you had make where a man charges another with a crime by an affidavit that's authorize but he does not have control of the litigation."
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4574.976,4582.247,"The prosecutor state, that's correct Mr. Justice Black."
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4597.272,4601.444,But wasn't that what all the emotion was about that you spoke of?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4601.444,4601.788,No.
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4601.788,4603.225,Emotional debate.
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4605.906,4606.282,Yes.
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4647.683,4653.418,What does that have to do -- what does that have to say about the reviewability aspect?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4653.418,4666.183,"I conceded Mr. Chief Justice and I do again, there is no legislative history that specifically says charging parties shall not have the right to appeal where the Regional Director refuses to do so."
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4686.152,4692.453,Why should you not if the statute says that the parties who are aggrieved by decision?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4695.875,4713.347,"Well, because all of these other statutes do not have the Norris-La Guardia flavor and background that Section -- that the enactment of Section 10 had each statute has to be looked at in light of its own particular purposes as this Court has stated."
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4713.347,4718.082,Do you deny that the -- that Sears is a party.
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4719.622,4722.677,It was not a party in the 10 (l) litigation.
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4725.444,4726.724,But it was permitted to appear?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4726.724,4728.318,It was permitted to appear.
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4731.513,4734.029,And then cross-examined?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4734.029,4736.404,We would suppose that they'd have right to cross-examine.
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4740.122,4743.502,"Well, they do habitually, as a matter of practice, don't they?"
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4743.502,4744.664,Pardon me?
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4744.664,4747.254,They are allowed to do it as a matter of practice consistently?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4747.254,4748.52,They are allowed.
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4759.571,4760.087,Say the Board is --
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4760.087,4762.697,"In this case, they didn't engage in cross-examination."
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4762.697,4769.048,"Say the Regional Director appealed in this case, would the charging party be permitted to intervene?"
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4769.048,4770.334,No.
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4770.334,4772.788,Would the -- would that already be the party?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4772.788,4774.117,No.
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4774.117,4776.35,Is there a (Inaudible)?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4776.35,4783.443,"Yes all the cases that rule on that issue have said it cannot intervene, every single case that has ruled in itself."
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4783.443,4786.912,Just as the 53 cases here?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4786.912,4790.022,I think it's perfectly consistent with the cases here.
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4817.139,4824.052,With respect which is the discretionary of the Section?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4824.052,4836.123,"The holding that I'm familiar with has denied the right of a charging party and that Reynolds versus Marlene Industries, the union charging party in the 10 (j) was denied the right to intervene in that case."
1969.476,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4836.123,4840.373,He had a right to support the position.
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4840.373,4842.711,I believe he does and I believe he should.
1969.476,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4842.711,4860.461,"Under the -- I'm just looking at it in the appendix, in 10 (l) as you well know it's spelled out at least, part of it is spelled out that the charging party shall be given an opportunity to appear by counsel and present any relevant testimony as in the text of 10 (l)."
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4865.242,4867.489,"Yes, and I really have no explanation for that."
1969.476,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4899.684,4902.756,"10 (j) is not very often utilized, is it?"
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4902.756,4904.755,It's utilized very rarely.
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4978.191,4980.562,"The Board order isn't final yet, is it?"
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4980.562,4983.373,"The Board is final, Mr. Justice White."
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4985.53,4986.906,Was that appealed?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4986.906,4987.888,It was appealed.
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4987.888,4989.774,Does that appeal mean to oppose?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4989.774,4992.237,It was appealed only because it was final by the way.
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4995.049,4997.713,Was it in effect?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,4999.635,5001.832,The decision is in effect.
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5001.832,5004.262,What if the Court of Appeals reverses the Board?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,5004.262,5007.628,"If the Court of Appeals reverses the Board, well that ends --"
1969.476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5007.628,5011.752,Very final in that sense.
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,5011.752,5014.658,"Well, it's final -- it's a final adjudication of the Board."
1969.476,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5024.619,5027.909,Is it an appeal or is it a petition for enforcement of the Board's adjudication?
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,5027.909,5032.196,"It's an appeal that we filed Mr. Justice Stewart for review, for review."
1969.476,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5032.196,5032.742,For review.
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,5032.742,5033.32,For review.
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5050.553,5056.352,"Mr. Barr, your time including your additional three minutes is up unless you want to just finish that sentence."
1969.476,2,20557,david_s_barr,,5056.352,5057.611,I'll just finish that sentence.
1969.476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5088.548,5094.059,"Thank you, Mr. Barr."
1969.476,3,26138,gerard_c_smetana,,5102.013,5104.075,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1969.476,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5485.371,5485.775,Thank you.
