1980.79-6740,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.785,We'll hear first this morning Bullington v. Missouri.
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,8.67,11.022,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-6740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,154.631,172.628,"Mr. Sindel, what if your client had been convicted by the jury or the judge and sentenced to the death penalty in the first proceeding and it was set aside on the Duren ground?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,172.628,189.054,"I think that at that particular time since there had been no determination by the jury of an acquittal or that death was not the appropriate sentence in this particular case, and a jury is specifically instructed in Missouri as to what they need to find."
1980.79-6740,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,238.384,239.736,Does that make any difference?
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,244.371,244.805,"Yes, I would."
1980.79-6740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,318.586,321.121,"Mr. Sindel, let me ask you one question, if I may."
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,327.259,328.461,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,328.461,346.172,"Supposing your procedure required the jury to make special verdicts, and they had found that pursuant to Instruction No. 38 even though the mitigating circumstances do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances, as a matter of leniency we will not impose the death penalty."
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,346.172,348.055,I believe that's... excuse me.
1980.79-6740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,348.055,350.89,"Had that been done expressly, would you then have the same position here?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,350.89,351.826,I would.
1980.79-6740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,357.48,367.336,"Well, I know, but it says they are not obligated to impose the death penalty even if they find in aggravating circumstance and also that the aggravating circumstance is not outweighed by the mitigating circumstance."
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,367.336,375.708,"And I believe that that instruction is consistent with this Court's decision in Lockett, wherein they say that there has to be allowance of a broad scope to the defendant."
1980.79-6740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,375.708,376.758,There's no problem with the instruction.
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,387.082,391.034,But I think that that instruction does cover nonstatutory mitigating circumstances.
1980.79-6740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,434.111,447.954,"Mr. Sindel, isn't your position really... why, for whatever reason the jury may have done it, they did not impose the death penalty, they imposed only a life sentence, and that act operates as an implied acquittal of the death sentence?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,447.954,448.671,--Absolutely.
1980.79-6740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,448.671,455.477,"In other words, I gather, this would be an extension of Green, wouldn't it, if we were to agree with you?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,455.477,456.727,"Yes, I believe it would be."
1980.79-6740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,462.731,464.833,Would you say that it's an actual acquittal?
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,464.833,465.95,It's an express acquittal.
1980.79-6740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,480.842,489.615,"Well, it is possible, isn't it, that a jury, irrespective of the evidence, irrespective of instructions, for whatever reason, they decide not to impose the death penalty?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,489.615,490.4,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,539.814,550.272,"Mr. Sindel, in your answer to Justice Brennan's question a moment ago you said the jury expressly found that death would be an inappropriate sentence in this case."
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,565.198,569.666,There is no special interrogatory or special verdict form that's allowed in the State of Missouri.
1980.79-6740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.368,740.962,"So you're... what about in non-death cases, where, in jury sentencing, and the jury comes in with a sentence of ten years and on retrial the other jury comes in with a sentence of 20 years?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,740.962,744.266,I think that there's no question under the Chaffin decision that that would be proper.
1980.79-6740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,744.266,748.901,"Well, I know, but your argument seems to me to require overruling those--"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,748.901,750.253,I don't believe so.
1980.79-6740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,936.39,947.43,"Well, why should you rely on, be entitled to rely on what this jury did, when you say that jury was unconstitutionally constituted to render a decent verdict?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,947.43,949.696,There was one verdict that jury--
1980.79-6740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.696,956.786,"Apparently, you think it was enough of a jury for you to hang your hat on for an acquittal?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,956.786,961.071,"--Absolutely, because there is no question that that jury was empowered to acquit."
1980.79-6740,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,962.856,965.308,Your position was that jury was a nullity.
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,965.308,966.408,--Excuse me?
1980.79-6740,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,966.408,972.545,Your position when you asked for a new trial was that in effect the jury was not a jury.
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,972.545,976.847,Our position was that the jury was unconstitutionally composed.
1980.79-6740,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,976.847,980.068,"So, then, it wasn't a jury, was it?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,980.068,999.88,"Would there be any question in this Court if we had filed our motion, in that case, if they had returned a verdict of not guilty of murder, and perhaps guilty of one of the other offenses, that he could then be retried because we were able to obtain a reversal on that conviction?"
1980.79-6740,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1037.255,1041.54,I take it you anticipate a more sympathetic jury the second go-around?
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1041.54,1044.824,I certainly hope for a more sympathetic jury.
1980.79-6740,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1044.824,1051.247,Even though a harder-nosed jury didn't give your man the death penalty?
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1051.247,1052.514,That's correct.
1980.79-6740,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1065.438,1069.959,"Well, you'd like a second bite at the apple, wouldn't you?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1069.959,1082.1,"Well, I would like a second bite at the apple, but then there is no constitutional provision that forbids that second bite to me, but there is a Fifth Amendment provision that forbids that bite to the prosecuting attorney."
1980.79-6740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1082.1,1090.555,"Well, it's just... maybe it's just an accident that the flaw you found in your case was related to the jury."
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1100.495,1101.263,That's correct.
1980.79-6740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.263,1104.899,Then your issue would be cleaner now?
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1104.899,1107.334,I don't think that the issue would be any cleaner.
1980.79-6740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1108.684,1110.703,"Well, I know you don't, and you must not think so."
1980.79-6740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1110.703,1123.677,"Well, what if the original conviction had been reversed for failure to suppress testimony secured in violation of Miranda?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1134.151,1135.601,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-6740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1136.351,1140.222,How do you reconcile that with our decision in United States v. Scott?
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1140.222,1146.209,"Well, I... well, my understanding is that if there was an acquittal of any offense."
1980.79-6740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1146.209,1161.886,"Well, the jury convicts, an appellate court reverses, because there was improperly admitted evidence in violation of Miranda?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1161.886,1164.937,But we are not asking the Court to set aside a verdict of conviction.
1980.79-6740,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1230.379,1234.098,"You're the one who is asking for the second bite, the State didn't ask for the second bite."
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1234.098,1243.186,"Well, I asked for the second play, but I do not believe that by asking for the second trial I waive my rights to protection under the Double Jeopardy Clause."
1980.79-6740,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1243.186,1251.125,"Counsel, doesn't your argument really get down, as so many of these cases do, to the proposition that death is different?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1251.125,1255.577,That is one part of the argument.
1980.79-6740,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1266.302,1272.623,"Well, as Justice Rehnquist pointed out, the authorities seem to be against you on most of the procedural points."
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1272.623,1276.925,But the authorities have never dealt with the situation in what's been a bifurcated trial.
1980.79-6740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1356.025,1371.202,"Well, what about the situation where you have another panel of 12 jurors and this panel of 12 jurors happens to believe three or four prosecution witnesses that the earlier panel did not believe?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1371.202,1382.776,"I don't believe it's a question of belief or not belief in this particular case, but I don't think that the prosecution is allowed the opportunity to again present their case to either strengthen it or to present the same case."
1980.79-6740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1401.119,1415.379,"You don't disagree, do you, that as to your double jeopardy contention, your client can be retried on the same charge, but the death penalty not sought?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1415.379,1416.195,Absolutely not.
1980.79-6740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1455.003,1467.561,"Just before you sit down, your argument would require us to directly overrule Stroud v. United States and to overrule what was said, at least, in North Carolina v. Pearce and other cases, wouldn't it?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1467.561,1468.244,I don't believe so.
1980.79-6740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1474.065,1477.832,"Well, Stroud was a decision directly on this issue, wasn't it?"
1980.79-6740,0,40496,richard_h_sindel,,1477.832,1486.272,"--It was a decision in which the jury was not presented with evidence as to why, in fact, a verdict or a particular sentence was proper."
1980.79-6740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1517.541,1520.176,"Well, I won't take any more of your time."
1980.79-6740,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1520.176,1522.861,Mr. Cook.
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1522.861,1525.646,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-6740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.271,1607.864,"Well, Mr. Cook, in Missouri is the jury ever asked to specifically determine what aggravating circumstances and what mitigating circumstances they find present in the case?"
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1607.864,1614.101,"If they come back with the death penalty, they must state which of the aggravating circumstances they have found beyond a reasonable doubt."
1980.79-6740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.505,1630.943,"They may have found no aggravating circumstances or they may have found that there were mitigating circumstances that outweighed the aggravating circumstances, or they just may have been merciful."
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1630.943,1631.729,--Right.
1980.79-6740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1632.429,1633.529,Suppose you did?
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1646.405,1649.089,I don't think that that would be a problem here.
1980.79-6740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.074,1652.976,"Well, would it... could you then retry him?"
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1652.976,1654.609,--I think so.
1980.79-6740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1654.609,1656.111,And ask for death penalty?
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1656.111,1657.045,I believe so.
1980.79-6740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.38,1664.284,"Well, what if they said, we find that aggravating circumstance A was not present?"
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1670.187,1671.587,--I'm not sure.
1980.79-6740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1673.972,1674.589,Yes.
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1674.589,1684.078,"On the other hand, though, this Court has approved the statutory theory of Florida which is that even if the jury doesn't find the aggravating circumstances, the judge can."
1980.79-6740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1685.447,1692.618,"So you're relying mostly, then, on the fact this is a general verdict, and the jury just might have been merciful?"
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1692.618,1696.672,--I don't want to say I'm relying on that but I do assume that.
1980.79-6740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.076,1717.501,"Well, if you assume that the jury imposed life because they found there were no aggravating circumstances you have a problem about pressing the same aggravating circumstances, if you just assumed that that's what the jury did."
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1736.547,1736.997,--Right.
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1880.607,1893.182,"Mr. Cook, suppose the statute said that you can be guilty of first degree murder and second degree murder, which I assume you have in Missouri."
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1893.182,1893.515,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1893.515,1897.403,"And if you're convicted of second degree murder, you're acquitted on first."
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1897.403,1898.019,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1898.019,1898.786,In Missouri?
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1898.786,1899.369,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1899.369,1910.294,So why isn't it automatically true that if you are found guilty of life imprisonment you are acquitted as to death?
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1913.745,1914.828,"Yes, sir, I think so."
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1930.771,1941.645,"Well, what would be the difference if they said that you can get life for one or 100 years for the other, and it was the degree was used?"
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1945.264,1949.668,--I think you have to look at what that is entitled and what is--
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1949.668,1952.034,But is the language really important or what happens is important?
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1952.034,1953.203,--What happens.
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1953.203,1955.488,"The jury said, this man shall not be killed."
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1955.488,1956.155,That's right.
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1956.155,1958.274,In the first hearings?
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1958.274,1959.057,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1959.057,1964.761,"And, but he was again put in jeopardy as to whether he should be killed or not."
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1964.761,1966.361,Because--
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1966.361,1966.963,Right?
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1966.963,1967.496,--That's correct.
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1967.496,1968.646,"That's correct, so."
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1968.646,1971.082,"If... well, that's not correct."
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1980.787,1984.072,"What do you mean, he never lost jeopardy when the jury came in?"
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,1984.072,1992.828,"--Well, that is true if you assume, Mr. Justice Marshall, that jeopardy applies to sentencing."
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1996.38,2003.136,"I didn't... mine was just hypothetical, was that it had... it wasn't sentencing, it was degree of crime."
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,2003.136,2003.853,I see.
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2011.107,2025.016,"Well, if Missouri says, if you killed somebody with aggravating circumstances, you are subject to conviction of first degree murder and death."
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,2039.526,2040.159,--Yes.
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2040.159,2044.061,"And the jury brings in a second degree verdict, life."
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,2047.013,2047.763,No.
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2047.763,2050.398,So the only difference is words?
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,2050.398,2052.5,No.
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2083.203,2091.642,I hope you realize that my hypothetical didn't say anything about limited to death.
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,2091.642,2092.292,I understand.
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2092.292,2093.461,Right?
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,2093.461,2093.877,Yes.
1980.79-6740,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2093.877,2095.613,We're together that far.
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,2095.613,2112.455,"Petitioner mentions that death is unique and therefore that is one of the reasons why this Court can distinguish This case from Stroud, or certainly, Pearce and Chaffin, and Di Francesco, even."
1980.79-6740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2168.459,2175.565,"Incidentally, I gather your colleague argues not only the Double Jeopardy Clause but Due Process, doesn't he?"
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,2175.565,2177.165,--I think so; yes.
1980.79-6740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2177.165,2178.767,And what's your response to that argument?
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,2178.767,2183.921,I think the Due Process Clause comes in here under the vindictiveness issue.
1980.79-6740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2186.721,2187.205,Only?
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,2187.205,2188.722,I believe so.
1980.79-6740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2193.209,2195.225,And sentencing by jury doesn't apply then sometimes?
1980.79-6740,1,29389,james_cook,,2199.994,2212.754,"--Yes, Pearce does net apply because it's a jury sentencing and that's Chaffin and that's indicated that the concern that caused us to set the limits."
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2872.128,2890.257,"Well, Your Honor, I still believe under those circumstances, especially under the circumstances where the State themselves had not complained about the composure of the jury, that the defendant after undergoing the ordeal of trial has a right to rely on that verdict if it is in fact an acquittal."
1980.79-6740,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2895.578,2899.862,"He doesn't rely very much on the verdict finding him guilty, does he?"
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2899.862,2902.914,--He relies on the verdict of acquittal.
1980.79-6740,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2908.135,2915.639,"Well, you're using the term acquittal to describe the failure to return a death verdict?"
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2915.639,2916.574,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6740,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2923.661,2925.18,"Of course, that happened in Stroud too."
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2925.18,2937.738,But Stroud was prior to this Court's decision in Gregg recognizing how unique the death penalty was and did not have the same equivalency to a verdict of acquittal.
1980.79-6740,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2937.738,2944.641,"Well, then you're getting back to the basic proposition which I think is yours, that death is different."
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,2944.641,2953.414,"That is one part of it, and that the procedure used to obtain the sentence of death is different as well."
1980.79-6740,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3001.328,3012.053,"Well, it still isn't the case, I gather, Mr. Sindel, that your due process argument as distinguished from your double jeopardy argument is key to the concept that death is unique."
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,3012.053,3014.821,I'd like to correct that point.
1980.79-6740,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3027.978,3033.216,"No, but is it central to your due process argument that death is unique?"
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,3033.216,3035.168,I believe so.
1980.79-6740,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.636,3139.386,You mean the death sentencing procedure?
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,3139.386,3140.219,--That's correct.
1980.79-6740,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.431,3167.203,"If... if we agree with you on the retrial which will go forward, will the jury do the sentencing?"
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,3167.203,3169.155,--Yes.
1980.79-6740,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3169.155,3170.821,And is there more than one--
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,3170.821,3170.988,Yes.
1980.79-6740,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.988,3174.023,--Is there only one sentence it could give if it finds guilty?
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,3174.023,3175.975,Of capital murder; right.
1980.79-6740,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3175.975,3180.444,So it has no... there's no discretion?
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,3188.117,3191.318,"But if there were a mandatory sentence... yes, that's right... if there are mandatory sentences, it would be the same result."
1980.79-6740,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3191.318,3196.888,"Well, at the first trial they imposed a life sentence but then something about a 50 years?"
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,3196.888,3203.642,The provision under the statute is that he is to be sentenced to life without provision for probation and parole for a period of 50 years.
1980.79-6740,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3203.642,3205.328,"But that's statutory, that wasn't the jury's verdict?"
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,3205.328,3206.344,In essence he's buried.
1980.79-6740,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3206.344,3218.719,"So on retrial, if you win, there will be no need to present to the jury any evidence whatsoever with respect to sentencing?"
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,3218.719,3221.504,"If I win here there, will be no need."
1980.79-6740,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3223.223,3227.325,"No, no, but if you win here on retrial?"
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,3227.325,3232.661,"If he were to be found guilty of capital murder, then there would be only one available sentence."
1980.79-6740,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3232.661,3235.863,"Well, there wouldn't be a separate sentencing proceeding at all?"
1980.79-6740,2,40496,richard_h_sindel,,3235.863,3238.382,There would be no need to because there would be only the one available sentence.
1980.79-6740,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3238.382,3238.699,Exactly.
1980.79-6740,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3238.699,3240.599,"Thank you, gentlemen."
