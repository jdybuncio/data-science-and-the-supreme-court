1974.74-362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.66,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in number 74-362, Intercounty Construction Company against Walter and others."
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,14.724,18.667,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,150.896,153.371,Change of what date did you say it was barred.
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,153.371,160.621,"We would say Mr. Justice Brennan that as of January 1969, I believe the date would be the 23rd."
1974.74-362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,160.621,164.393,This would be a year after the carrier stopped making payments?
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,164.393,167.203,Yes Your Honor.
1974.74-362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,472.195,478.74,"This Section 22 on page 33 of the Appendix was proposed but never enacted, is that correct?"
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,478.74,501.57,"Yes Mr. Justice Stewart, that's correct, and I think it is significant because we then go to Section 22 as it was actually enacted which would be found at page 21 of the Government's brief and I think if we compare what was done with what was proposed, we see that there are significant differences."
1974.74-362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,648.322,651.116,Is there anywhere in the briefs?
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,651.116,655.968,It's referred to Your Honor but it is not reproduced.
1974.74-362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,705.209,719.715,"What if this case had come up before the 1934 amendment, how would it have come out with Section 22 reading as it did before Congress amended it?"
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,719.715,727.676,I don't believe there would have been any power in the Deputy Commissioner to do anything because we did not have the time situation involved.
1974.74-362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.676,735.533,"Well, but you would have a claim filed and no award ever made, wouldn't he have the power to make the award prior to 1934?"
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,735.533,736.911,"Oh yes, I misunderstood."
1974.74-362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,758.254,772.91,"Well, but what -- what is it about the Act before 1934 that prevents the Deputy Commissioner from acting after the expiration of a year from the payment of the last compensation if a claim was timely filed?"
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,772.91,791.011,"Well, my recollection is that as long as money was continuing to be paid, there would be no occasion for him to act but if the man said in effect that the carrier had arbitrarily cut me back 50%, then he would have had the power to go ahead and act."
1974.74-362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,809.421,825.325,Can't the carrier always protect itself by having the -- having an order entered or having an award entered if you -- if the carrier starts to pay voluntarily after a claim is filed which happens which happens I suppose most of the time.
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,825.325,826.563,It does.
1974.74-362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,830.267,832.303,"But it is additional paper work, isn't it?"
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,833.131,834.159,Not for the carrier.
1974.74-362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,845.475,849.294,"Well, may not -- the United State is against you, aren't they?"
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,849.294,858.145,"Well, I think that they are looking at the statute from the standpoint of how they interpret it rather than how the Deputy Commissioners perhaps actually administer it."
1974.74-362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,863.264,869.991,"I suppose you're suggesting -- what you are suggesting is that rather they never start voluntarily, you're just going to wait till there's an order entered."
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,869.991,870.919,"Well, this is correct."
1974.74-362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,917.536,925.398,What would be -- it would be -- you would be protected after a certain length of time after you made the last payment required by the order?
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,925.398,926.117,"Yes, right."
1974.74-362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,926.117,926.905,Yes.
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,926.905,933.333,"But that is the only -- the only protection, otherwise, the claim can be resurrected at any time."
1974.74-362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1039.983,1044.455,"On that recommendation, even though accepted by the carrier is not an order?"
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,1044.455,1044.994,That is correct Mr. Justice Brennan.
1974.74-362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1044.994,1045.803,It is not?
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,1045.803,1046.281,It is not.
1974.74-362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1172.494,1174.381,"Yes, yes."
1974.74-362,0,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,1174.381,1195.156,"Suppose we have a situation where again the claim is filed within a year and the carrier pays without an award and we reached a statutory maximum of in this case $17,280.00 and there has been no adjudication by the Deputy Commissioner and then we have more than a year run."
1974.74-362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1215.476,1222.801,Very well Mr. Duncan.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1224.701,1227.805,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1343.124,1346.228,And he -- the original claim must be filed within a year after the --
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1346.228,1353.536,The original claim must be filed within either a year after the injury or a year after the last payment of compensation without an award.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1355.053,1357.009,That I guess is common ground between you and your adversary.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1357.009,1358.307,"That's right, right."
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1387.802,1389.299,19 (a) in the briefs here.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1389.299,1411.413,"Section 19 (a) is in the Government's brief and the statutory section at page 3, procedure in respect of claims subject to the provisions of Section 13, claim for compensation may be filed and the Deputy Commissioner shall have full power and authority to hear and determine all questions in respect of such claim."
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1439.19,1443.362,What you are talking about is whether or not a compensation order has been issued?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1443.362,1443.631,That's right.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1443.631,1444.56,That's the critical clause?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1444.56,1448.392,That's the critical clause in Section 22.
1974.74-362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1472.058,1486.293,How can you have a modification of the award which is I guess the subtitle of Section 22 whether or not a pay -- whether or not a compensation order has been issued?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1486.293,1499.948,"Justice Rehnquist, if compensation is paid without an award, it may terminate before the award has been issued or it may terminate prior to the award after the award has been issued."
1974.74-362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1551.23,1559.674,"Well, I can see that in connection with the payment of compensation but in Section 22, you have a title that says modification of award."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1559.674,1560.293,That's correct.
1974.74-362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1560.293,1577.071,Suggesting that everything you're talking about there is dealing with the modification of an award previously made and then you have this clause that both of you regard as critical in the middle of that thing that says whether or not a compensation order has been issued.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1579.856,1597.329,"Oh, the title originally was inserted in 1927 when the provision supplied only to awards and an award meant in 1927, an order compelling an employer to pay compensation."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1627.004,1627.483,That's right.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1627.483,1628.601,"-- by the Deputy Commissioner, you had --"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1628.601,1628.801,That's correct.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1628.801,1630.049,-- voluntary payment?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1630.049,1630.628,That's correct.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1630.628,1640.806,And as I understand my brother Rehnquist's question is how can you have a modification of an award when there hasn't been any award?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1640.806,1645.571,And the answer is you can't which is why Section 22 does not apply to this case at all.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1645.571,1664.241,And I thought on the contrary that you were relying very very heavily on the subtitle of Section 22 modification of awards to give -- to explain the meaning of the language and yet the title of -- is simply is inapplicable for the reason suggested by my brother Rehnquist --
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1664.241,1682.282,The title is inapplicable in all cases in which there has been no award of compensation or any formal or the denying compensation and that's precisely the point upon which we rely Mr. Justice Stewart that the title of this section is inapplicable and indeed the entire section is inapplicable in this case.
1974.74-362,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1697.533,1703.694,Did you just read that language out on the section then whether or not any compensation order has been issued.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1703.694,1703.844,No we don't.
1974.74-362,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.844,1704.692,You just ignore it?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1704.692,1708.228,No we don't Justice White and I think we can make a good deal of sense of it.
1974.74-362,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1711.901,1713.817,"Well, suppose it hasn't?"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1713.817,1715.194,If it has not been issued --
1974.74-362,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.194,1716.438,Let's suppose it hasn't?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1716.438,1717.347,"That's right, as in this case."
1974.74-362,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1717.347,1730.289,And this reads right on it whether or not and this covers the possibility and order hasn't been issued and nevertheless says within one year after the date of last payment you're supposed to file something?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1730.289,1734.503,"No, I think we can make a little bit more sense of it than that."
1974.74-362,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1735.541,1736.479,That's the point.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1739.8,1744.641,I think there's a plain reading of it that bears on the case where an award has been issued.
1974.74-362,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1746.487,1762.216,"Well, not that I talked about whether it has been one and why doesn't this section apply to a situation where an award has issued because it seems to apply to a case, whether -- where a compensation has not issued."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1762.216,1763.274,I think there is a --
1974.74-362,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1763.274,1764.212,You said nothing.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1764.212,1767.046,It's an easily understandable confusion.
1974.74-362,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1768.264,1771.009,"Why don't -- who's confused, that's the problem."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1771.009,1772.726,It's a question of interpretation.
1974.74-362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1885.615,1886.074,"Now, wait a minute."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1889.438,1889.867,That's correct.
1974.74-362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1889.867,1892.163,There was no possibility of reviewing the awards?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1892.163,1893.161,That's correct.
1974.74-362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.161,1897.553,"Well, if there hadn't been any award, why would there be the review?"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1897.553,1903.561,"In many cases Justice Rehnquist, employers would pay compensation without the necessity of an award."
1974.74-362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1945.564,1956.915,"But then you wouldn't be reviewing an award if you look at something after that, you would be either giving an initial award or adjudicating to his but at least you wouldn't be reviewing an award."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1956.915,1967.699,"If the award were actually entered, the only provision in the statute that would allow for any action was Section 22 which said that you could modify an award."
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1974.016,1975.362,That was about in the original statute in 1927?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1975.362,1977.308,"That was in the original version, in 1927."
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1977.308,1981.058,They modified an award and what was the time limitation?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1981.058,1986.934,During the term of the award and after it has become final so that if the payment of compensation --
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1986.934,1993.521,"And the point is it opted by the time the award came, the term expired."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1993.521,1994.29,The term had already ended.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1994.29,1994.639,Alright.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,1995.607,1997.783,And it was no longer possible to review it.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1997.783,2000.514,And there is -- and no review of a rejection claim?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2000.514,2001.861,That's right.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2004.566,2006.193,You allow review of a rejection?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2006.193,2007.74,"No, that was in 1938."
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2007.74,2008.289,Oh.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2008.289,2012.405,"In 1934, it was amended to expand the time for review."
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2012.405,2013.253,For one year?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2013.253,2020.581,"To one year but it used the same time for compensation of that year that it had previously, that is the date of last --"
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2020.581,2022.158,Where would you find that line?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2022.158,2023.356,-- payment of compensation that's on page --
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2023.356,2025.063,I had that line a while ago but it just somewhat --
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2025.063,2032.855,Page 3 of our brief still contains the operative language.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2032.855,2037.406,"No, no, but this is a present one, you're talking about the 34 about a --"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2037.406,2040.141,"Right, as amended in 34, its on page 21 of our brief."
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2040.141,2042.846,Yeah.
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2042.846,2050.478,"Mr. Easterbrook, as I read your brief, you've ignored Strachan Shipping, are you going to ignore it in your argument too?"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2050.478,2055.567,"In our view, we have devoted our entire brief to explaining why Strachan Shipping was incorrect."
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2121.047,2123.642,"Well, when was this one end?"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2123.642,2124.49,Pardon?
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2124.49,2126.736,When will this one end?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2126.736,2130.488,This claim has now been adjudicated and the Deputy Commissioner has handed an order.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2136.766,2149.858,We discussed in our brief the possibility that if the employer or his insurer could show actual prejudice from the lingering of the claim that the size of an award might me diminished because of that prejudice.
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2149.858,2154.927,"That's not the part I'm talking about, that's in extraordinary circumstance."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2154.927,2155.037,It's a doctrine --
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2155.037,2155.536,Is it?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2155.536,2161.547,-- very similar to the doctrine of Latches Your Honor in equitable actions in which there is no statute of limitations.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2161.547,2163.184,There's nothing in the statute to putting that any such limitation on that?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2163.184,2165.43,There is nothing in the statute to put any limitation.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2165.43,2166.618,As you read the statute --
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2166.618,2167.057,That's correct.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2167.057,2175.57,"Of all statute, the result suggested by my brother Marshall's question would prevail, i.e. would be no limitation at all?"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2175.57,2176.987,There would be no formal limitation.
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2204.087,2207.022,But this remain in place.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2207.022,2207.561,Pardon?
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2207.561,2209.317,This man remain in Court?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2209.317,2211.381,It has however been very similar to that.
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.687,2252.659,"I submit is dismissal like a prosecution, its done everyday."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2252.659,2253.278,Yes and it might --
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2253.278,2256.011,Is there any procedure here for doing that?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2256.011,2260.626,Under Section 14 (h) (2) I believe is the number.
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2278.77,2287.297,"And so because of this any action, this man has a right at any time within his lifetime?"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2287.297,2291.736,"Just -- just as it would be if he filed in the district court but at the same time, the important --"
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2291.736,2300.783,You think if you give me that -- if you file a case at the district court and you don't do anything with it and then 20 years later you come back and file another one?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2300.783,2301.382,Not another claim Your Honor.
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2301.382,2303.777,I know you can't.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2303.777,2308.896,You seek for adjudication of the claim.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2308.896,2311.181,The district court will often dismiss for one prosecution.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2311.181,2325.933,"Well yeah, but the analogy really here, when a complaint is filed in the district court and then the defendant voluntarily begins giving it a relief you asked for in the complaint --"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2325.933,2326.642,There will be no point in seeking out follow-up.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2326.642,2331.722,"There is no analog -- there's no analog between that situation and this, is there?"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2333.329,2333.838,It doesn't happen --
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2333.838,2344.439,"Under the latest filed on the district court, generally, the defendant doesn't voluntarily begin given the relief that the plaintiff wants to the plaintiff."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2344.439,2344.808,That's right.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2344.808,2351.342,"If there is any such thing as 3906, it's wrapped in a settlement and the lawsuit is dismissed."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2351.342,2359.19,As it could have been done here if the employer had sought a formal order based on its desire to pay a specified amount of money and he could have sought such an order from the --
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2359.19,2370.07,"Periodically in the district court, the Court called all the cases in and says either move or drop and get out, they claimed it, they keep a clean target."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2370.07,2370.419,"Yes, and under --"
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2370.419,2375.314,"And these people don't keep, they don't even pretend to do it but you're relying on it."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2375.314,2376.082,The Deputy Commissioner has the power to do that.
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2376.082,2380.594,"You're relying on the fact that the deputy did not act, is that what you're relying on?"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2380.594,2390.797,That's correct and we're also relying on the fact the employer could have sought action if he wanted but I'd like to point out one other highly salient difference between this and an ordinary toward claim.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2426.516,2428.682,"To arise out of the employment, doesn't it?"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2428.682,2429.191,That's right.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2430.888,2432.185,And this is --
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2432.185,2433.013,And there's no question of that here.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2433.013,2437.999,"In this kind of a case, the carrier wouldn't have begun paying unless he had agreed it had or had not in this point."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2437.999,2439.137,That's correct.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2467.286,2469.561,What's 4107
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2469.561,2472.721,Unless there has been an accident in the interim and there is a question of allotee.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2472.721,2473.619,Right.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2473.619,2496.61,The causality question is very interesting because that often is the subject of separate motions for additional compensation before the Deputy Commissioner and the evidence that would be pertinent to that is not either preserved or dissolved because of the application to review this compensation case.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2504.295,2519.342,"Mr. Easterbrook, what would be the undo hardship on claimants if one way to read the language of Section 22, the way it seems to read and the way your brother says we ought to read it."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2519.342,2520.709,We're not sure that it seems to read that way.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2520.709,2524.218,"Well, or the way your brother says we ought to read it."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2524.218,2528.539,There are several things that might happen to claimants on situations of this sort.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2605.688,2610.446,"Did you ever think that the payments were made on the basis of temporary total, weren't they?"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2610.446,2613.021,The employer claimed that there was temporary total.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2613.021,2618.588,And that was the basis on which the voluntary payments were made and he accepted those payments?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2618.588,2621.452,He accepted those payments although he claim --
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2621.452,2621.871,"Now, then now he comes in --"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2621.871,2623.918,And still claims that he was permanent.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2623.918,2626.183,"And then the payment stopped, the carrier stopped him."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2628.552,2629.251,That's correct.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2629.251,2635.477,"And certainly, he knew when they were reduced by half and he certainly knew when the payment stopped."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2635.477,2636.685,"That's right, and there was a informal conference held."
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2636.685,2644.238,And he had a year then to say the change in condition is that I'm not permanently and totally disabled.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2644.238,2646.943,"No, he could not claim that Your Honor."
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2667.026,2680.804,"Well, I think it's a little perhaps easier to read the change in circumstances language generously than maybe to read the critical clause and this is the annotation."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2680.804,2690.354,The only way we could read change in circumstances in that way Justice Stewart would be to say that the change in circumstance is a change in the positions of the party rather than a change in the physical conditions.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2690.354,2693.627,And that's not an anomaly tortured meaning.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2693.627,2693.847,Right.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2735.295,2739.966,"One change in the condition -- it says on the ground of a change in conditions, don't say assert has said."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2748.826,2757.597,We think that it would probably be more consistent with the history of this act to read change in conditions as change in the condition of the employee.
1974.74-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2757.597,2761.972,"No one ties you up to that case, this case goes against you, do you?"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2761.972,2763.908,We have interpreted it that way in the past.
1974.74-362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2763.908,2778.253,"Mr. Easterbrook, from the government's point of view, taking a look at Section 22 as it appears on page 3 of your brief, the language in about the 8th line on the bottom page issue a new compensation order."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2797.275,2823.38,"We think that's highly important that the -- all that gives the Deputy Commissioner a power to do is under a new compensation order and if there has been no old compensation order, we don't understand that new compensation order could have any meaning and as I also suggested to Justice Stewart, the language in the Act providing for the reasons for review under Section 22 has the same import."
1974.74-362,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2839.452,2845.977,"In any events, something is going to have to be read generously however the case had decided."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2845.977,2866.605,I think so but our position to summarize it once more is that that language one year after the date of last compensation whether or not an order has been issued simply fixes the time from which the year begins to run and it does not establish for whom the year runs.
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2878.619,2885.484,Is that applied to all of the cases that are informally close?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2885.484,2892.159,So that an application for review or a resurrection of the claim if you will could be made at some later date?
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2892.159,2896.061,You don't suppose to a million nine other than some thousand.I
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2896.061,2902.726,"n most of those cases Your Honor, payments for compensation are no longer due because there's no longer any disability attributable to the act."
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2902.726,2904.463,That should be a considerable number.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2904.463,2916.588,"And in the vast majority of those cases, no Section 13 (a) was ever filed so that within a year after the injury, or within a year after the last payment of compensation in cases in which no formal claim was filed that expires."
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2916.588,2918.025,"And yes, yes."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2920.6,2923.555,We estimate that several hundred a year are in a position similar to John's.
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2923.555,2927.487,"That was -- oh, that means several hundred in the past."
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2927.487,2928.699,For each of past years as well.
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2928.699,2930.326,For each of the past years.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2930.326,2931.055,That's correct.
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2931.055,2933.64,You don't have the slightest idea how many.
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2933.64,2933.86,There maybe a large number or small number.
1974.74-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2933.86,2936.405,"Do you know how many people, how many units do you?"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2936.664,2941.363,We can't tell with certainty.
1974.74-362,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.363,2958.411,"I take that the employee is locked into his -- if more than a year has passed since the injury, he is locked in to the claim that he has originally filed, he can't amend that claim and claim permanent disability when he originally filed for temporary?"
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,2958.411,2962.253,"He can indeed, although it's not in the nature of an amendment."
1974.74-362,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3000.206,3009.573,Do you think that the Government's position here would encourage employers to make prompt and informal dispositions of these cases?
1974.74-362,1,24107,frank_heasterbrook,,3009.573,3010.621,We believe it would.
1974.74-362,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3031.684,3033.47,Do have anything further Mr. Duncan?
1974.74-362,2,29445,john_cduncan_iii,,3033.47,3035.087,Nothing further Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.74-362,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3035.087,3035.736,Thank you gentlemen.
