1963.583,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,34.691,35.614,May it please the Court.
1963.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,43.305,44.124,He may be admitted.
1963.583,1,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,47.496,50.952,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,809.854,813.312,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,903.653,906.494,"Those statutes are not covered in your brief, are they?"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,906.494,906.89,No sir.
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,916.747,918.836,Would you mind reading that first one again.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,918.836,919.778,Alright sir.
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,919.778,925.224,I can't -- what can be done under plea in abatement and what cannot?
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,925.224,936.387,No objection to an indictment on any ground going to the formation of the grand jury which found the same can be taken to the indictment except by plea in abatement to the indictment.
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,946.195,948.601,"That's what your trial court held, wasn't it?"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,948.601,949.493,"Yes, sir."
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,956.817,958.712,Within this case.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,958.712,970.965,"In this case, after the trial court refused to allow evidence on the question of the formation of the grand jury in connection with the motion for a new trial."
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,997.744,1003.843,"That there was -- they said, he was not denied an opportunity, did he not, to offer that evidence?"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1003.843,1005.427,"In effect that's what they said, yes."
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1005.427,1007.581,I -- how can you explain that?
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1007.9,1008.494,Well I --
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1008.494,1008.618,I don't understand it.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1008.618,1011.493,"I'll explain it this way, if I can --"
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1011.493,1015.135,"Because plainly, he was denied the opportunity."
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1015.135,1028.955,"He was denied the opportunity to present the evidence in support of his motion for a new trial on the ground that under Alabama procedure, he was supposed to raise that question prior to his pleading to the indictment and he was --"
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1028.955,1029.13,And then he (Voice Overlap) --
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1029.13,1030.224,-- supposed to raise that by plea in --
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1030.224,1033.003,The Supreme Court affirmed it but not on that ground.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1033.003,1034.445,They didn't point out that particular ground.
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1034.445,1036.54,"They didn't affirm it on that ground, did they?"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1042.46,1047.169,"Well, maybe I don't understand either, but the fact remains that they did affirm."
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1047.169,1048.252,"They did affirm it, but --"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1048.252,1048.309,Yes.
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1048.309,1055.142,-- by saying -- that -- the trial court had given him an opportunity to offer the evidence.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1055.142,1056.729,"No, they denied him the opportunity to --"
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1056.729,1060.829,"I know they did, but the Supreme Court said he had been -- he had the opportunity."
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1060.829,1063.404,"They used some unfortunate language there, I'm afraid Mr. --"
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1063.404,1063.461,What?
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1063.461,1064.104,-- Justice Black.
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1064.104,1064.569,(Inaudible)
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1068.898,1069.815,"Well now, the --"
1963.583,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1069.815,1073.587,(Inaudible) at least tell me whether I'm wrong about it.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1112.339,1114.528,I don't think the Court had to even make that statement.
1963.583,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1115.683,1116.669,"Well, they did make it."
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1116.669,1117.141,They did make it.
1963.583,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1117.141,1119.371,"And we have to put some reading on it, don't you?"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1119.371,1121.189,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1963.583,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1121.189,1123.984,But you agree that he was not given an opportunity.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1123.984,1125.12,I agree that he was not given enough opportunity --
1963.583,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1125.12,1126.196,And they didn't (Voice Overlap) --
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1126.196,1132.195,-- and the other -- the trial judge denied him the opportunity on the basis of the previous holdings of the Alabama Supreme Court on --
1963.583,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1132.195,1138.243,And then the reason -- and you don't -- you -- you have no idea what evidence would've come into the record had he been given an opportunity.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1138.243,1154.713,The only thing that was attempted there along that line was when the Circuit's list was put on the witness stand as an adverse witness by the attorneys for the petitioner and attempted to ask him some questions about the population ratio there and bring --
1963.583,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1154.713,1156.64,That was just an opening question?
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1156.64,1157.171,Yes.
1963.583,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1157.171,1159.887,That -- but that was the end of the examination.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1159.887,1160.704,Yes sir.
1963.583,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1160.704,1165.569,And so the Court is clearly wrong when they said that they -- you said not -- he was granted an opportunity.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1165.569,1169.162,"I'm afraid, I'd have to agree."
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1176.114,1184.138,(Inaudible)
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1184.138,1187.74,I'm sorry I'm not familiar with that case Your Honor.
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1187.74,1202.131,"(Inaudible) not affirmed which on a basis which was not (Inaudible) but the judgment below, charging him was a different event, very much likely."
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1202.131,1203.166,Yes.
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1203.166,1204.398,It was a different event.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1204.398,1204.83,Yes.
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1204.83,1206.056,(Inaudible)
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1213.077,1214.423,That's correct.
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1221.926,1228.432,May I ask you Mr. Hall if your court has departed from those statutes at any other time.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1228.432,1229.95,"I don't believe they have, Your Honor."
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1229.95,1232.402,Did you hear the cases that (Voice Overlap) --
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1232.402,1236.615,"Well, I heard they mentioned the case of Arrington but I don't read that case that way and --"
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1236.615,1237.861,What does that hold?
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1237.861,1245.975,It holds that the procedure in Alabama requires the defendant who's going to raise any question as to the composition of the jury.
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1258.094,1262.146,"Well, what did it -- what did the Court proceed to do after saying that?"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1265.677,1266.493,The Supreme Court?
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1266.493,1267.245,Yes.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1267.245,1270.441,"As to our understanding it -- my understanding, it did, yes sir."
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1270.441,1277.038,Notwithstanding the fact that -- that he had not -- the defendant had not raised it at the proper time --
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1277.038,1278.873,The -- the Court said he was too late in raising --
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1278.873,1279.292,I beg your pardon?
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1279.292,1280.464,-- it afterward.
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1280.464,1281.054,I beg your pardon?
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1281.054,1284.539,The Court said he was too late in raising the question afterwards.
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1284.539,1285.892,But I -- I --
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1285.892,1286.642,A motion for a new trial --
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1286.642,1287.049,I don't know (Voice Overlap) --
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1287.049,1288.33,-- was not the place to do it.
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1288.33,1302.571,I don't know your case but counsel just cited two cases in which he said that the Supreme Court had considered cases on the merits where those statutes had not been followed.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1302.571,1303.19,"Well, I don't know."
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1305.338,1306.279,"Well, alright."
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1306.279,1316.113,"The Court of Appeals has, I believe as you said, it seems to me I recall reading them, held that it would not be bound by that --"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1316.113,1317.868,You mean the Court of Appeals of Alabama?
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1317.868,1318.578,"No, the -- of the --"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1318.578,1319.211,Of this Circuit?
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1319.211,1322.603,The district -- of the United States courts.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1322.603,1328.297,"Well, let me to point out something in connection with those two cases that the -- they cited here."
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1359.354,1360.717,Why did they reverse it the first time?
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1360.717,1368.265,"The -- the reason why they reversed it the first time, because he was represented by a white court appointed attorney."
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1419.232,1425.038,"Court -- the Court therefore declined in effect to follow these tactics in that case, isn't it?"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1425.038,1425.957,Yes.
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1426.285,1427.774,It was the other one also.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1427.774,1435.977,"In the Mississippi case, the case of United States on a relation of Golsby versus Harpole."
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1510.34,1514.092,"Now, did the Seals case come before or after the case -- the decisions (Voice Overlap)?"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1514.092,1516.392,The Seals case was after the Harpole case.
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1516.392,1520.869,It comes before or after the decision of this case?
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1520.869,1521.971,It was before.
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1521.971,1522.854,It was before.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1522.854,1523.215,Yes.
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1523.215,1524.437,A short time before?
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1524.437,1532.167,"Goes back to 1950 -- 1962, late 1962."
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1536.705,1538.973,Has there been any change in the statute or anything (Voice Overlap)?
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1538.973,1539.352,No sir.
1963.583,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1542.044,1545.14,Have there been any other cases besides this one?
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1545.14,1551.045,No recent cases besides this one on that question.
1963.583,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1581.152,1588.835,"But, Mr. Hall, I take it when you (Inaudible) even though the decision (Inaudible)"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1588.835,1593.959,"I think so, yes."
1963.583,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.959,1602.358,But you wouldn't agree that it can't (Inaudible)
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1602.358,1605.06,"Well, I'd expect everybody to have due process at least to --"
1963.583,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1605.06,1608.565,"Well, he wasn't -- he wasn't permitted the (Inaudible)"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1608.565,1613.797,"Yes, and the reason being by the lower court that he didn't raise the question at the proper time."
1963.583,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1613.797,1622.751,"What (Inaudible) Supreme Court of Alabama said in its opinion, we do not believe that the waiver rule applies here."
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1629.208,1629.82,Yes.
1963.583,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.82,1638.102,"But, he had no opportunity and he didn't produce the evidence."
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1638.102,1645.708,"Well, if they had said that, they would've been going contrary to their holdings in -- in other cases and also contrary to the statutes."
1963.583,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.708,1648.147,(Inaudible)
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1648.147,1650.668,"Well, he -- he had an opportunity for due process."
1963.583,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.531,1657.712,"I know, but assume that the Alabama courts (Inaudible)"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1657.712,1683.114,"Well, the -- I think the Alabama Supreme Court would have to reverse what it said in this Brune (ph) case that I was just quoting from about a person taking his chances on getting an acquittal and then if he's dissatisfied and gets convicted, he could then comeback with a motion for new trial and seek to do something that he couldn't do otherwise."
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1692.048,1697.904,"Mr. Hall, I just want to ask you one question."
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1734.976,1748.148,"Well, that is due to the statutory provision that we have in Alabama that all capital cases are -- are automatically appealed to the Supreme Court of Alabama and the Supreme Court is required to look at the whole record and determine --"
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1748.148,1754.811,And -- and that -- you can make a distinction clear in that -- in these cases.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1754.811,1755.344,Sir?
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1755.344,1756.583,In this case.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1756.583,1756.608,Well --
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1756.608,1759.642,Do you --
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1759.642,1768.456,"If they found no reversible error, I don't know whether it was necessary for them to even point out wherein they failed to find no reversible error."
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1778.956,1788.114,"But it says, “Without the necessity of seasonable objection.”"
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1791.866,1792.216,Yes sir.
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1792.216,1793.087,-- seasonably.
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1793.087,1793.699,Yes sir.
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1793.699,1810.015,"Now that -- and your Court has said that in this kind of occasion, this is a capital case also that they're obliged to take the case and to examine all evidence for reversible error without the necessity of seasonable objections."
1963.583,2,34535,leslie_hall,,1817.755,1823.201,I'm afraid that I can't.
1963.583,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1823.201,1827.209,Mr. Meltsner.
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,1827.209,1829.886,Unless the Court has some additional questions.
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1830.995,1832.276,"Well, I -- I have a question."
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,1853.584,1857.338,"Well, I think the -- the disposition should be similar to Cole."
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1859.468,1860.355,This isn't Cole.
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,1873.13,1880.23,I think this petitioner is entitled to an opportunity to prove systematic exclusion in the courts of Alabama.
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1880.23,1881.383,In the trial court?
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,1881.383,1881.991,"Right, if -- if --"
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1881.991,1882.298,Alright.
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,1903.236,1903.673,Well --
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1903.673,1917.122,"And therefore, I would -- I would -- I -- it's bound to follow the law of Alabama and would therefore deny you the right to put in this evidence at this late date."
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,1926.079,1933.291,I think that's totally inconsistent with the reading of this Court -- of the opinion of the Supreme Court of Alabama --
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1933.291,1933.659,Yes.
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,1933.659,1938.609,-- which this Court would have to make to make that disposition of the case.
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1943.903,1944.377,Yes.
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,1944.377,1951.187,-- one reason the -- the Supreme Court's opinion is putting the waiver rule aside saying it's not the law of this case.
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1951.187,1951.948,In this case.
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,1951.948,1952.662,That's right.
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1974.867,1975.126,Yes.
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,1975.126,1980.813,"-- is crystal clear and that's the judgment before this Court, not the whole corpus of Alabama law."
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1980.813,1990.848,"Well, what -- the Supreme Court of Alabama did in this case among other things is to simply make a factually mistaken statement that the -- that the defendant was given an opportunity to present this evidence."
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,1992.678,1993.25,And that is --
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1993.25,1994.067,Would they?
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,1994.067,2001.799,In that sense denies the petitioner an opportunity to sustain a federal question.
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2001.799,2018.828,"Now, you would have us therefore say that despite the law of Alabama which requires in its clear terms that an objection to the makeup of the grand jury has to be raised by a plea in abatement before arraignment on indictment."
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,2031.638,2036.17,"I suppose, what I'm saying is that this case is also the law of Alabama."
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2036.17,2036.859,Yes.
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,2036.859,2042.279,That -- that those statutes don't constitute the full corpus of Alabama law that this cases (Voice Overlap) --
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2042.279,2043.6,Because of this opinion.
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,2043.6,2049.228,And this opinion must be read as holding that you can raise the question for the first time.
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2049.228,2051.48,In this case at least.
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,2051.48,2052.187,In the -- in this case --
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.187,2052.583,Yes.
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,2052.583,2058.123,-- but this case also holds that you can raise the question for the first time on motion for new trial.
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2058.123,2059.049,Of course if you --
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,2059.049,2059.469,And --
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2059.469,2065.683,This case also holds or at least the opinion says that this man was given a full opportunity to produce this evidence.
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,2068.047,2068.25,No.
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2068.25,2069.757,-- in this opinion and -- and decide that --
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,2069.757,2070.819,"Well, maybe --"
1963.583,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2070.819,2073.29,-- he states the law of this case.
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,2073.29,2082.71,"Well, I think, there, we have to draw some distinction between the -- the interpretive function of this Court and -- and what this opinion says is Alabama law."
1963.583,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2104.137,2109.448,"Well, I have that opinion in front of me and I don't agree with you reading that, I must say."
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,2145.839,2146.317,Well --
1963.583,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2146.317,2147.622,(Inaudible)
1963.583,3,36353,michael_c_meltsner,,2147.622,2155.197,"Well, I -- there are -- there is language in that opinion which I think is much stronger than that."
