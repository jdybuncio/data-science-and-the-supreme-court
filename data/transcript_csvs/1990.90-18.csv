1990.90-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.772,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-18, Robert D. Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corporation."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,11.072,13.658,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,51.933,60.372,"Mr. Allred, don't you have a preceding question, which is whether the Federal Arbitration Act even applies--"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,60.372,60.789,Yes--
1990.90-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,60.789,61.99,--in this case?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,68.394,69.744,--That is correct.
1990.90-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,70.294,70.846,Why not?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,70.846,90.058,"Well, because in the... first off, we thought that the Mitsubishi... I mean, that the Gardner-Denver line of cases were dispositive of the Federal arbitration issue, and in fact... and we... we looked at Tenney, the circuit court case, and the cases that followed that, and we did not appreciate the importance of that argument."
1990.90-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.497,104.9,"Well, do you think we should address it here in this Court, and are you prepared to have us do so?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,104.9,105.3,We think--
1990.90-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,105.3,108.685,And to argue the issue?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,108.685,121.529,"--Justice O'Connor, we think that the enforceability of the agreement under the FAA... if you're going to look at the Federal Arbitration Act, you of necessity have to look at section 1."
1990.90-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.68,193.875,Why do you suppose the Congress referred expressly to seamen and railroad workers if the last phrase dealing with those engaged in interstate commerce would have covered all of those categories?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,193.875,213.789,"Well, I think... I think, Your Honor, that they referred to seamen and railroads because those were basically the two union groups that were lobbying for the exclusion, but the language went on further and said... it mentioned those two groups but then went further and said all classes of workers engaged in interstate commerce."
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,224.745,230.881,Do you think your client was engaged in interstate commerce the way a railroad worker or seaman is engaged in interstate commerce?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,231.583,236.618,"Well... well, to the extent that money is engaged in interstate commerce."
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.962,251.662,"--Well, I think he's effecting interstate commerce."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,254.247,265.138,"Well, I'm not... I'm not sure that... if you look at the first... at the second part of the statute, it didn't... it didn't really use the word engage, as I recall."
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.006,270.708,"But the first part is the part we're talking about, right?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,271.608,272.308,"--Section 1, yes."
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,272.308,273.76,And that does say engaged in.
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,273.76,274.56,That is correct.
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,274.56,278.981,Seamen or railroad workers or any other person engaged in interstate commerce.
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,278.981,287.67,"Well, it seems like to me that if you are working in interstate commerce, you are indeed engaged in it."
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.157,297.193,"This was enacted, of course, in when?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,300.645,301.961,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.961,309.084,"And the country had, or the Congress had a quite different view of what interstate commerce was in those days."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,311.517,312.536,That may well be.
1990.90-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.917,340.603,"Gardner-Denver was a collective bargaining contract, wasn't it?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,340.603,342.305,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,391.738,399.558,Was the exclusion of employment contracts argued in Gardner-Denver?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,399.558,401.177,"--I do not believe so, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,401.177,404.629,And... or in any other of the cases that we have dealt with in the employment context?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,404.629,407.164,"No, that... that is true."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,408.364,411.466,Everybody has missed it up until this very case.
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,411.466,431.363,"--What was addressed in Gardner-Denver was the fact that when Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII, that Congress was acting to correct an enormous national wrong that had gone on for many years."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,504.177,510.148,How is your client engaged in interstate commerce?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,510.148,511.115,--How would I define engaged--
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,511.115,511.548,No.
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,514.517,522.539,"--Oh, well... well, he was manager of, he was hired as manager of financial services for interstate securities."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,522.539,526.408,"Well, how was he himself engaged in interstate commerce?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,526.408,531.812,"Well, the record... there's nothing in the record on that, but he was involved in the sale of mutual funds."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,531.812,537.382,Well how would we ever decide in this case whether that's a good answer to your claim or not?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,537.382,542.952,"Well, what happened before Judge McMillan was that they moved to dismiss."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,553.308,557.646,What would be your submission as to why your client was engaged in interstate commerce?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,557.646,559.062,--What would be my submission?
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,568.854,575.007,In 1925 do you think that he would have been held to have been involved in interstate commerce?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,575.007,576.857,"--I don't know the answer to that, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,576.857,589.065,"Maybe his actions would have... might effect interstate commerce, but... maybe Congress these days has the power to regulate what he's doing."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,591.683,602.158,"Well, now, if you looked at it from a narrow standpoint that engaged meant that you had to be physically engaged, you had to be driving a bus or a truck or in the transportation industry, I would agree with you."
1990.90-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,617.5,621.136,--But there was no evidence taken in the trial court on this point?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,621.136,621.886,That is correct.
1990.90-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,621.886,623.421,Because you hadn't raised it?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,623.421,624.838,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,640.783,666.6,"Mr. Allred, one thing that sort of suggests that your expansive notion of engaged in interstate concept may be wrong is that, although section 1 uses the term engaged in interstate commerce, section 2, the operative provision here, says it applies to a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,675.123,678.908,"Well, Your Honor, there's a good answer to that--"
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,678.908,679.525,I hope so.
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,679.525,680.175,--in one of the briefs.
1990.90-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,814.927,824.933,"Mr. Allred, could I go back to the question Justice Scalia asked you about reconciling... involving... contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce in section 2 and engaged in commerce in section 1."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,831.623,834.189,I think that that was the AFL-CIO addressed that.
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,899.148,911.122,"You can have a transaction between people engaged in commerce, or a transaction among people engaged in commerce, or a transaction concerning people engaged in commerce."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,911.772,912.572,Indeed.
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.046,932.8,On the contrary [inaudible] in section 1 if they meant the same thing they could have referred to employees engaged in any business affecting commerce or in any business involving commerce.
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,932.8,933.485,I--
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.485,936.52,It's a very strange way to say it if they meant the same thing.
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,936.52,956.649,"--But when you look at the legislative history, though, of the Federal Arbitration Act, it is abundantly clear that it was designed only for the business entities, where, when they got together and made their contracts there to buy, sell, or what have you, they agreed to arbitrate their dispute."
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,961.953,966.707,"You mean only corporations, it applied... it was meant to imply only to corporations or partnerships, is that it?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,966.707,967.473,"--No, no, no."
1990.90-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,983.249,988.036,Is it your contention that your client did not knowingly agree to arbitrate?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,988.036,989.905,That is correct.
1990.90-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,989.905,996.226,"You... that was a contention you made in the district court, that he did not, he did not knowingly agree to arbitrate?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,996.226,1002.63,I did not... I did not say that he... we were relying on fraud in the district court.
1990.90-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1004.682,1007.867,"Well, but that's quite different than saying he didn't knowingly do it."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1007.867,1033.315,"--Well, he knew he signed a clause that said under the New York Stock Exchange he would agree to arbitrate his disputes, but he had no idea that it would rely to any sort of civil rights that he had, when Congress has passed a law, and under the age act, that says he's entitled to a jury trial, that says that the EEOC has all of this... all of this process there to investigate, to conciliate."
1990.90-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1043.04,1046.425,"I still don't understand your contention, Mr. Allred."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1056.214,1062.334,It's my contention that he had no idea that it would waive his right if he were discriminated against by... on--
1990.90-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1062.334,1068.088,"And how did the lower courts resolve... we didn't grant certiorari on that question, did we?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1068.088,1079.213,"--You granted certiorari on the question of whether or not compulsory arbitration is... will... is available here, can be enforceable here."
1990.90-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1079.213,1079.513,Yeah.
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1090.354,1111.351,"I have a hard time... yeah, you can certainly make that assumption, but our position is that as relates to the securities industry, that this... the entire security industry has... if you go to work for them, then you have to sign this agreement."
1990.90-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1111.351,1113.303,"That was true in the McMahon case, too."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1117.671,1129.377,"But the difference there, Mr. Chief Justice, is that that person dealing with the broker could walk away, and that was a business relationship and not an employment relationship."
1990.90-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1136.633,1142.886,"Well... does the Federal Arbitration Act make the sort of distinction you're talking about, do you think?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1144.904,1156.879,"Well, I think, the way in which I read section 1 is that... is that any employment dispute, whether it's contract or not, is excluded from the Federal Arbitration Act."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1156.879,1163.95,"Well, is that all there is to it here, an employment agreement between your client and his employer?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1166.485,1168.854,His... he was hired as manager--
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1168.854,1173.472,But just anybody can't do that... walk in off the street and do it.
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1180.327,1181.427,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1181.427,1190.95,"Well, isn't this an agreement, sort of a commercial agreement between someone who wants to engage in that industry and the... and the private regulatory regime?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1190.95,1199.473,"Well, it may be a commercial agreement to the extent as it relates to the buying and selling of securities, and that's what the SEC and the SRR was all about."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1199.473,1207.062,"Was he required, because he registered, to sign this sort of an agreement about arbitration?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1207.062,1208.729,"I missed... I did not get your question, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1208.729,1214.216,Was he required by the Exchange to sign this sort of agreement?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1214.216,1215.085,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1215.085,1217.535,And so he agreed to that when he wanted into the business.
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1217.535,1219.037,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1223.94,1234.962,"I know, but he agreed when he... if they were going to... he agreed, in order to be permitted to do it, to get into this business, he registered with the Exchange, didn't he?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1234.962,1236.014,Indeed he did.
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1247.556,1247.656,"Well, that may be."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1258.012,1259.446,That's what the legislative history--
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.446,1266.367,"Isn't this a pretty commercial agreement, if somebody wants to get in the securities business and he has to register and live up to their rules?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1266.367,1275.039,"--Well, discrimination by age, Your Honor, or discrimination by sex or religion or race, it seems to me is not commercial."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.073,1286.347,"Well on that basis, on that basis you would say, you would say the Federal Arbitration Act would never apply to these sort of things."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1286.347,1295.47,"--I think that that's the way section 1 reads, literally, and I think that's the way the legislative history of section 1 reads."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1376.386,1381.723,"Are you familiar with that Signal-Stat agreement, or case, in the Second Circuit?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1381.723,1383.325,Mitsubishi was the case that involved--
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.325,1383.609,No.
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1392.764,1394.78,--I'm--
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.78,1395.716,Were you familiar with it?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1395.716,1396.232,--No.
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1397.599,1407.957,"Well, that case held that employees of an automobile [inaudible] weren't engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of section 1."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1413.76,1415.843,"Well, Tenney held--"
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1415.843,1419.581,So it isn't the first time this issue has ever been raised.
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1419.581,1427.401,"--No, but it's... there was a case before this Court, I believe in 1988, in which neither side briefed it."
1990.90-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1430.52,1431.989,"Of course, we denied cert. in that case."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1435.174,1443.463,"--The one that I was referring to, I think it was Potter, was that it held that the Federal Arbitration Act preempted a State law."
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1468.945,1470.097,What about other kinds of rights?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1475.918,1492.511,"--Well, as I read... as I read... as I read the cases, Your Honor, it's those cases in which the... when the Congress has passed laws protecting employees with minimum statutory standards, minimum rights, like--"
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1492.511,1493.63,But just employees?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1501.216,1506.453,"--Well, that's covered precisely by the... by the FAA."
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.322,1514.209,"--But that's a public policy, just as employment discrimination is a public policy."
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1520.03,1525.601,"Well, what the... they agreed to arbitrate those cases."
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.601,1526.867,Your client agreed here.
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1526.867,1544.145,"Well, I don't think he made... he agreed to arbitrate any... he agreed, in my judgment, to arbitrate disputes with respect to New York Stock Exchange rules, with respect to things of that nature, but not his civil rights."
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1548.18,1549.966,What do you mean by civil rights?
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1551.932,1558.322,"What I mean by civil rights is to be free from discrimination because of your age, because of your race--"
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1558.322,1558.722,I see.
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1558.722,1560.655,--because of your sex.
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.655,1562.024,"I see, but not--"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1562.024,1568.361,Religion.
1990.90-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1568.361,1570.294,"--Now, what do you rest that principle on?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1586.722,1592.976,"Well, because Congress passed the law doing it, and then passed this intricate scheme for the enforcement of it."
1990.90-18,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1670.042,1677.029,"Well, isn't the allegation here that this individual knowingly agreed to arbitration?"
1990.90-18,0,28830,john_t_allred,,1688.504,1691.723,"--I don't... I don't think so, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1733.95,1735.202,"Thank you, Mr. Allred."
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,1740.889,1744.591,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.079,1941.185,"Mr. Spears, I gather you're arguing that the contract would be enforceable even if there were no Federal Arbitration Act?"
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,1941.185,1948.339,"The Federal Arbitration Act mandates enforcement of it unless there's a contrary indication in the statute, Justice Stevens."
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1948.339,1953.258,It mandates enforcement of a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,1953.258,1954.86,And this clearly is.
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1954.86,1960.514,What is... it evident... the contract evidence the hiring agreement between the employer and the employee.
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,1965.316,1966.918,"It's not limited to that, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1975.858,1977.708,"No, that's Justice Stevens."
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,1979.56,1984.564,"I apologize, Your Honor, but I was trying to refer to your comments earlier today--"
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.718,1994.902,But are... are you suing for enforcement of that?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,1994.902,1996.104,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1996.104,1998.604,I thought you were suing for enforcement of the provision in the employment contract.
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,1998.604,2001.073,It's enforceable either way.
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2002.091,2006.293,If he had not signed an employment contract would you still have the same claim?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2006.293,2007.662,"--Yes, Your Honor, because--"
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2007.662,2010.531,So you're not relying on the arbitration clause in the employment contract?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2010.531,2010.981,--No.
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2019.72,2020.303,I understand that.
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2026.874,2028.576,"I'm not sure I understand that question, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.576,2034.812,"Well, I thought you were relying on the arbitration clause in the employment agreement."
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2037.598,2041.466,The arbitration clause is in his registration agreement.
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2130.874,2139.88,So your answer is that the transaction involving commerce was his agreement to abide by the rules of the Exchange?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2144.284,2146.736,Is the contract evidencing the transaction involving commerce.
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.103,2148.736,--And the involving commerce... I see.
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2153.807,2159.71,"Agreed to allow him to buy and sell securities, or have any involvement with that."
1990.90-18,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2159.71,2160.41,Does it sign the--
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2160.41,2165.128,And they also allowed him to take advantage of the arbitration benefits here also.
1990.90-18,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.128,2170.682,"--Does he sign the agreement... does the Exchange sign the agreement, too, and he keeps a copy and they keep a copy?"
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2171.282,2174.301,It comes down from the Exchange as the rules.
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2203.517,2217.443,"The thing that's running through my mind, while you're looking for it, if the transaction involving commerce is his entitlement to engage in buying and selling over the Exchange, why isn't he then a person engaged in commerce?"
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2217.443,2220.145,"--He is, by virtue of this agreement."
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.145,2221.561,He is a person engaged in commerce?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2221.561,2233.905,"He is not only... he... his contract, his agreement to be bound by arbitration and all the other rules of the Exchange is the contract involved in the transaction involving commerce."
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2233.905,2240.142,"And it involves commerce because he then becomes a person engaged in commerce, as I understand it."
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2240.142,2241.742,If he relates to a transaction involving commerce.
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2241.742,2244.511,Which then brings him squarely within the language of section 1.
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2244.511,2245.796,"Well, section 2."
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2245.796,2247.529,And section 1.
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2247.529,2259.77,"Well, with regard to that, I think the difference in the language that was noted intends a broad application of section 2 and a narrow, restrictive application of section 1 exclusion."
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.638,2263.424,"Yeah, but not the way you just described it and explained it to me."
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2263.424,2264.024,"--Well, I--"
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.024,2265.59,"You want to change your explanation, I guess."
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2265.59,2281.219,"--Well, I guess I'll have to, Your Honor, because I... I'm more convinced that the difference in the language gives an expansive reading, and indeed the courts have applied an expansive, have given the FAA an expansive reach, not a constricted reach."
1990.90-18,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.074,2291.141,It's not in your appendix.
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2293.693,2294.693,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2353.715,2361.254,"Mr. Spears, I mean, I don't think there has ever been a statute passed that says someone has to sue."
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2362.821,2363.79,--Exactly.
1990.90-18,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.386,2442.473,"Your point then is that the act puts it in the hands of the aggrieved individual, rather than of some agency or board?"
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2442.473,2446.694,"--Yes, Your Honor, and gives them a choice to go to court or not go to court."
1990.90-18,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2623.207,2629.463,"Well, Mr. Spears, wouldn't the arbitration award be subject to some minimum form of judicial review after it were made?"
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2629.463,2629.946,Yes.
1990.90-18,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2654.911,2657.661,"Yes, but I'm wondering whether your analysis is accurate."
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2666.985,2667.535,"No, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2670.254,2676.758,"Well, but you're going to have... litigation itself would certainly describe what you have when an arbitration award is reviewed, wouldn't you?"
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2683.062,2685.097,But it's not a de novo review.
1990.90-18,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2686.831,2687.966,A more limited inquiry?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2687.966,2696.654,"--A more limited review, as authorized and only as authorized by section, I think it's 10 and 11 of the Federal Arbitration Act."
1990.90-18,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2740.683,2745.302,What if the co-worker is denied relief in arbitration?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2745.302,2754.158,I think... I would assume the individual would understand that was based on the merits and the resolution of that particular claim.
1990.90-18,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2772.989,2786.296,"Mr. Spears, do the arbitrators have the power to award the kind of systemic relief that might be available in court under the ADEA?"
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2786.296,2794.918,"Justice O'Connor, I'm not aware of anything in these rules that would prohibit them from doing that if the facts in a particular arbitration were to justify that."
1990.90-18,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2804.174,2805.408,How about a class action?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2805.408,2807.643,"--Your Honor, I think it's very similar to a class action."
1990.90-18,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2951.532,2959.055,What would you say is the principal distinguishing feature between Gardner-Denver and this case?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,2959.055,2964.257,"Your Honor, I think at bottom it's the collective bargaining context of Gardner-Denver."
1990.90-18,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3039.155,3045.244,Did the arbitration in Gardner-Denver purport to determine the statutory issue?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,3051.065,3054.517,"That's what I meant to say, Justice Scalia, is that--"
1990.90-18,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3054.517,3055.567,Is that what you've been saying?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,3056.067,3063.556,"--No, the Supreme Court said that the arbitration only resolved the contractual claim under the collective bargaining contract."
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3114.388,3117.607,--What about the McDonald case?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,3120.375,3123.577,"Yes, Your Honor, under 1983, as I recall the facts of that case."
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3127.446,3131.6,I thought you said the difference in Gardner-Denver was they didn't resolve the statutory issue?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,3136.754,3144.241,"--Well, there was a collective bargaining arbitration in McDonald also, an already-completed arbitration."
1990.90-18,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3157.065,3161.619,I thought... wasn't the statutory issue submitted to the arbitrator in McDonald?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,3162.752,3164.404,"Your Honor, I don't recall."
1990.90-18,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3165.088,3166.706,I thought it was.
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,3179.664,3180.098,That's right.
1990.90-18,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3180.098,3183.566,But rather somebody else purporting to act on that individual's behalf.
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,3183.566,3188.87,And that probably controlled whether or not the issue even went to arbitration.
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3265.703,3266.721,"Mr. Spears, can I ask you this?"
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,3278.779,3282.665,"--If they are under... if they comply... if they come under the FAA, yes."
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3282.665,3285.183,"Right, if they're engaged in commerce, yeah."
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,3303.394,3303.66,Yes.
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3303.66,3304.51,--I think that's what you're arguing.
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,3304.51,3305.044,Yes.
1990.90-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3308.881,3309.164,Right.
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,3309.164,3310.681,--because that mandates enforcement of that.
1990.90-18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3449.152,3451.937,"Mr. Sherman, was that... was the Bird case an employment case?"
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,3451.937,3453.289,"It was an ERISA case, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3468.049,3474.37,Has the Second Circuit regularly had cases dealing with employees of securities companies?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,3474.37,3476.97,"Your Honor, maybe more often because of New York."
1990.90-18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3476.97,3479.005,Have they ever adjudicated one?
1990.90-18,1,33149,james_b_spears,,3479.005,3480.671,"Not out of New York, Your Honor."
1990.90-18,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3480.671,3482.138,"Thank you, Mr. Spears."
