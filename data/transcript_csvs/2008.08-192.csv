2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.027,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 08-192, Abuelhawa v. United States."
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,8.291,17.899,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A person who purchases a small quantity of drugs for his own personal use commits a misdemeanor, not a felony."
2008.08-192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,58.442,62.973,Can you be specific about who those persons would be?
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,71.579,75.295,"It would depend on which prong you're referring to, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,80.435,80.888,Yes.
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,80.888,87.166,And the facilitating prong would refer to persons who are aiding or abetting the underlying drug felony.
2008.08-192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,87.166,95.21,"Well, suppose you had the girlfriend phone and say: My boyfriend needs drugs; meet him at the corner of 3rd and Main."
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,106.94,108.625,She -- she may--
2008.08-192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,108.625,127.292,"It seems to me that she may then have committed a felony, and yet it seems to me that her culpability is certainly no -- no greater, if you're talking about your -- the policy of your statute, than the -- than the man that uses the drugs."
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,127.292,130.883,"--Well, I think I'm speaking first and foremost about the terms of the statute, Justice Kennedy."
2008.08-192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,148.922,154.39,"Maybe Justice Ginsburg would like some further illustration, but I thought that that was one illustration in answer to her question."
2008.08-192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,154.39,157.419,"Yes, I would like to -- who does this target?"
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,164.883,170.693,"--Well, I think the classic case of somebody under the facilitating prong would be the classic aider and abettor, for example a lookout."
2008.08-192,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,197.931,206.381,The buyer-seller rule would prohibit the prosecution of a buyer on the theory that the buyer aided and abetted -- aided and abetted the seller.
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,218.049,227.329,"Well, it deals with use of a communication facility, but it deals with use of a communication facility only with respect to persons that are committing, facilitating, or causing a drug felony."
2008.08-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.329,234.372,"What is -- what I was going to -- what is the purpose of saying ""who uses a communications facility""?"
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,237.465,239.305,"No, I don't think it's a jurisdictional hook."
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,274.151,282.009,"You keep talking about phones, and you began by saying this covers phones, but this was -- language was added in 1970?"
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,282.009,282.602,Right.
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,282.602,285.944,"Well, there weren't cell phones of the kind you have now."
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,333.767,340.97,"No, I don't -- our argument doesn't depend on assuming that cell phone usage was significant in the 1970s."
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,346.032,356.79,"Well, I know, but let's assume I don't agree -- let's assume I agree with that only in the context of the 1970s technology."
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,356.79,357.76,Uh-huh.
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,357.76,359.429,What's the answer then?
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,359.429,360.727,"Well, if you agree with it--"
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,360.727,362.599,It reminds me of these old hypotheticals.
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,379.891,382.968,"--I'm not aware of a case that speaks directly to that question, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.256,447.519,Your argument sort of assumes -- more than sort of assumes; it assumes -- that facilitating is the same as aiding and abetting.
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,462.903,464.483,"For several reasons, Your Honor."
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,497.984,503.638,"Well, but I mean, it's natural to view the woman in that situation more as a victim than as someone facilitating the crime."
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,503.638,504.356,Well--
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,504.356,506.2,I'm not sure that would extend to your case.
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,506.2,510.993,"--Well, I don't know -- the opinion doesn't stand on the rationale that the woman would be a victim."
2008.08-192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,515.259,516.631,"Well, but that was the same word."
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,527.502,531.187,"--Well, it doesn't -- it doesn't use the word ""purchase"", with respect, Justice Kennedy."
2008.08-192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,560.973,571.049,"Well, I'll think about it, but I think your -- Gebardi does involve one statute, one act, transportation."
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,583.668,596.334,"--I don't think that's a distinction that ultimately makes a difference, Justice Kennedy, for the following reason: This statute does deal both with someone who is involved in the underlying felony and use of the phone on top of that, but it's in the nature of an aggravated offense."
2008.08-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,634.787,642.16,What other -- this statute does not just apply to facilitating a drug offense.
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,676.129,678.785,I don't know that there are other provisions that would create a similar oddity.
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,712.082,716.208,This really isn't the transformation of a misdemeanor into a felony.
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,735.619,739.433,"Well, two steps to respond to that question, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-192,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,772.809,773.261,What if--
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,773.261,774.794,And with respect -- I'm sorry?
2008.08-192,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,774.794,785.007,--What if the -- the defendant -- what if the defendant who is a buyer of -- of a quantity for personal use does more than simply purchase the drugs?
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,799.486,801.409,"I don't think so, Justice Alito."
2008.08-192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,846.826,853.9,This statute doesn't -- it doesn't differentiate between buyer and seller in terms of who makes the call.
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,869.661,872.38,"--That's -- that's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-192,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,901.493,908.333,What would happen in the situation where the person who buys the drug is guilty of -- of a felony?
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,924.325,933.933,"No, I don't think so, because the buyer-seller rule deals with the circumstance in which the way the person is -- is associated with a felony is they're associated with the distributor's felony."
2008.08-192,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,955.049,964.217,"Well, that may -- that may be true, but the buyer there still could not, under your theory, be convicted of facilitating the seller's felony of selling the drugs."
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,964.217,973.54,"Right, couldn't be convicted of facilitating the seller's felony, but would fall within the ambit of section 843(b) in any event because they would have used a phone in connection with their own felony."
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,973.54,980.037,Your gloss on this statute makes -- gives rise to some difficult questions of proof.
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,990.862,1000.046,"Well, I -- I don't know about that, but -- but I think what I do know is it doesn't create any greater problems of application than already exist under Federal drug laws."
2008.08-192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1045.806,1059.973,"If the government were to prevail here, I assume that it would then as a result have a much larger, more expansive discretion in charging and plea bargaining and -- and et cetera."
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1074.546,1080.403,"Well, it's -- it's definitely within the rule of lenity, and I think that's the principal place that it's found."
2008.08-192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1080.403,1080.871,Other than--
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1080.871,1096.457,"And I don't -- I don't -- I don't know of any background principle that one would bring to bear on that other than the -- the normal tools of statutory construction that I've already talked about in the first place, which is you look at the text, and you look at the statutory history, and you look at the statutory context."
2008.08-192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1096.457,1103.659,--No background principles either way on granting the prosecutors vast discretion in charging--
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1103.659,1104.767,"Well, I think as--"
2008.08-192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1104.767,1107.438,--as it applies to statutory interpretation?
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1107.438,1110.843,"--Well, I think as a general rule we ought to be circumspect about doing that."
2008.08-192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1163.587,1165.479,"That was changed in 1970, wasn't it?"
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1170.069,1171.772,"--That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1307.807,1310.915,So you would have lost this case before 1970--
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1310.915,1312.322,Yes.
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1312.322,1314.725,--because the incongruity on which you rely--
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1314.725,1315.899,"Well, the basis--"
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1315.899,1316.414,--didn't exist then?
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1316.414,1316.757,--Yes.
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1327.239,1327.66,Right.
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1333.455,1334.78,--It -- it wasn't sub silentio.
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1335.438,1347.274,"No, but this language: 1970, but not after 1970, because of the changes in some other sections?"
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1347.274,1349.945,"No, well, it's in part because of the changes in this section."
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1395.6,1396.13,"Well, no."
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1399.939,1403.519,"--Right, which is the only avenue available after 1970."
2008.08-192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1449.936,1456.246,You didn't -- I haven't heard you question so far the government's rationale.
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1475.222,1489.232,"--No, we don't question that, Your Honor, but I'd like to make two points with respect to that: First of all, it may be more difficult -- the use of the telephone may be more difficult, and that may be the animating purpose that Congress sought to address through this provision."
2008.08-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1494.181,1495.167,I don't understand what you're saying.
2008.08-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1497.398,1502.304,"--Use of a phone may make detection more difficult, and that may be the animating purpose -- excuse me."
2008.08-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1551.675,1552.626,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1561.045,1572.884,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 843(b) prohibits the use of a communication facility in causing or facilitating the commission of any act constituting a felony under the Controlled Substances Act."
2008.08-192,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1597.233,1609.056,"So two people across the park -- and they know there's a drug dealer on the other side, the one waves and the dealer comes over, the other calls on the cell phone and the dealer comes over; the other gets four more years?"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1611.415,1613.896,The phone -- phone user is exposed to four more years.
2008.08-192,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1614.882,1616.192,Suppose he calls three times.
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1618.427,1619.456,--That's right.
2008.08-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1623.613,1626.14,"Not just that, he gets a felony on his record."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1628.905,1629.688,That's right.
2008.08-192,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1629.688,1633.841,"And does the call -- does the call have to be completed -- I mean, if he gets an answer saying,"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1636.887,1643.493,If the call -- the statute requires that the communication facility be used.
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1648.321,1649.834,But if he leaves a message?
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1649.834,1658.72,"--If he leaves the message and the message in some way causes or facilitates a felony drug distribution, then, yes, he has used the communication facility."
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1658.72,1667.326,"In this case we have two separate episodes, each involving one gram of cocaine?"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1667.326,1668.172,That's correct.
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1668.172,1672.216,And there were a total of seven phone calls?
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1672.216,1674.482,There were six.
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1679.509,1683.022,So that would be an exposure--
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1683.022,1686.727,Of 24 years.
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1686.727,1694.626,--Twenty-four years for the one gram of cocaine on two occasions.
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1716.745,1721.307,Just getting that call by itself wouldn't subject someone to the statute.
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1724.197,1724.587,Yes.
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1724.587,1728.381,--with the dealer where you are using the telephone to cause--
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1728.381,1730.132,"Yes, we are assuming the purchase is made in either case."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1730.132,1730.631,--Yes.
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1730.631,1733.863,So what you're saying is it doesn't matter who initiates the call?
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1733.863,1734.565,That's right.
2008.08-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1736.094,1747.68,"Counsel, what do you do -- the case that I find pretty close to what we have here is Rewis v. United States, which involved a statute that prohibited interstate travel with the intent to, quote,"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1775.888,1780.388,"--I think there are a couple answers to that, Your Honor."
2008.08-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.944,1788.524,"Oh, certainly, it focused on the word ""facilitate""."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1804.05,1810.06,"--That's right, and -- and as -- as indicated by the passage you've just quoted, the focus of the Court there was on the traveler's purpose."
2008.08-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1841.221,1846.251,"Don't you think that the ""knowingly"" in this statute also requires that you are knowingly facilitating?"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1846.251,1848.704,--It does require.
2008.08-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1848.704,1849.078,Okay.
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1851.231,1856.148,But it doesn't have to be -- it doesn't have to be that you have the purpose of facilitating the seller.
2008.08-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.509,1862.005,"Well, this didn't mention -- this statute didn't mention purpose, either, did it?"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1862.005,1862.322,"--It -- it said ""intent""."
2008.08-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.789,1870.335,An intent--
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1870.335,1871.661,--an inquiry into the traveler's purpose.
2008.08-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.223,1875.907,"--I find it pretty close, I really do."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1875.907,1894.792,"--Well, one other difference, then, Your Honor, is that the facilitation that has to take place under the Travel Act is facilitation of the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on of unlawful activity, which is defined not as a discrete crime but as a business enterprise involving gambling."
2008.08-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1905.415,1908.944,Why are you going through all this sort of parsing?
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1958.843,1965.09,"Well, I think there are a couple of answers to that: First is that section 843(b) doesn't apply to people who simply possess."
2008.08-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1983.693,1985.425,"As to the first, I said ""subset""."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2001.999,2003.594,"--Well, yes--"
2008.08-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2003.594,2004.514,And what's the second?
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2004.514,2015.666,"--and also that the reason for the -- as you know, the predecessor to 843(b), which was section 1403, referred to causing or facilitating any offense."
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2063.548,2083.32,"But we do know that -- that Congress drew a line it hadn't drawn before between the own-purpose users and people who were in the trafficking business, and it expressed sympathy for the -- or leniency, a policy of leniency."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2114.48,2115.775,Yes.
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2128.722,2131.861,"Yes, but I'm speaking about the post consequences."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2131.861,2133.253,--Yes.
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2134.142,2139.265,Like -- let's take a young person.
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2146.121,2149.088,--Yes.
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2149.088,2161.895,"And it may be that in certain States voting rights are removed, and there is on this person's record forever that he is a felon."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2226.022,2249.119,"I think the buyer-seller principle and the limitation on aiding and abetting and accessory liability, as this Court recognized in Gebardi, doesn't apply here, because the principle that the Court set out in that case, and it has been recognized in subsequent cases, is that -- is that when Congress criminalizes or punishes one party to a transaction, that inevitably involves a second party."
2008.08-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2283.057,2288.244,Except that the use of a phone in this statute is applied to the seller as well as to the buyer.
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2313.98,2326.322,"--The -- the statute -- but by its terms makes clear that the person using the phone and the person committing the felony don't have to be the same person, and I think I understood Petitioner to -- to acknowledge that."

2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2375.394,2380.315,"--But this -- this isn't one, because this isn't a case that punishes people just for being a customer."
2008.08-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2384.798,2386.452,It's the way they're a customer.
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2386.452,2386.982,--and using a phone--
2008.08-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2386.982,2401.056,"The way they're a customer is they use the telephone, and I guess one side thinks that's not a big deal, and the other side thinks that, anyway, in terms of what Congress thought, it's a tremendously big deal because Congress was really worried about telephones."

2008.08-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2409.178,2410.208,What one comes to mind?
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2410.208,2415.66,"--I mean, the wire fraud statute punishes conduct that might not be a Federal offense at all, but for the fact that somebody used--"
2008.08-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2415.66,2417.629,That's the jurisdictional hook.
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2460.703,2473.762,"--Well, I mean, if -- as we identified on page 25 of our brief, a number of statutes where the use of a communication facility is an element of the offense, and the conduct that was covered by those statutes in many cases might not be a Federal offense at all."
2008.08-192,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2473.762,2476.134,Carry -- carrying a weapon.
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2480.228,2481.351,Right.
2008.08-192,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2497.331,2500.236,"But it -- can you tell me, how does it work?"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2534.174,2547.996,"--I mean -- I'm not aware of anything in the U.S. Attorney's Manual that specifically addresses this statute, but of course the Court recognized in Batchelder that prosecutors legitimately have discretion when there are different criminal statutes that cover the conduct, and--"
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2547.996,2565.178,What about the -- the statement that in the manual -- maybe this is incorrect -- but that the charging policy of the Department of Justice instructs prosecutors to charge the most serious offense supported by the facts?
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2577.033,2584.372,"--That's if they bring charges at all, and of course that policy doesn't require prosecutors to -- to bring charges."
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2584.372,2585.104,Ordinarily--
2008.08-192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2585.104,2588.462,I think we know from this case they're likely to bring charges.
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2588.462,2589.511,"Well, I mean--"
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2589.511,2591.621,"--Is that the policy, first of all?"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2597.396,2599.396,"--Yes, and -- and a--"
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2599.396,2616.11,"So that means in every one of these cases, whether the dealer picks up the phone or the buyer picks up the phone for a transaction for one gram of cocaine, the prosecutor has no choice but to indict under 843(b)?"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2616.11,2619.374,"--Well, again, if -- if there is to be an indictment at all."
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2620.969,2631.633,"I'm talking about the choice between misdemeanor, simple possession misdemeanor, or 843 -- adding on this 843(b)."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2644.284,2659.278,"--That's my understanding of the policy, but, you know, this Court has recognized that, you know, that sort of charging decision is a legitimate aspect of the system as long as it's not exercised for unconstitutional reasons."
2008.08-192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2659.278,2677.632,"No, but there's -- there's a difference here, and that is, as these cases illustrate, three phone calls for one trifling sale, two for another, this gives a kind of multiplier effect which it's -- it's hard to find a parallel for in the law."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2697.778,2705.854,I think the -- the text of the statute and the fact that it covers any act constituting a felony does demonstrate that that's what Congress intended as well--
2008.08-192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2705.854,2706.621,"Well, what about the question?"
2008.08-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2706.621,2711.242,"Let's feel sorry for this -- for the felon who is selling this stuff, too."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2713.476,2714.147,--Yes.
2008.08-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.147,2718.41,Every time he makes another phone call he gets socked with another how many years?

2008.08-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.533,2725.721,"Yes, so four times four times four every time he makes a phone call."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2725.721,2727.394,"--Right, and I think that--"
2008.08-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2727.394,2728.954,"We should feel sorry for him, too."
2008.08-192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2728.954,2737.513,"--he knows the difference, that -- he knows that he's committing a felony, and the possessor of a gram or less doesn't."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2737.513,2744.899,--The possessor who purchases the drugs using his phone knows that he is causing the felony.
2008.08-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2750.412,2752.897,"Well, what about the legislative history?"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2798.443,2799.13,"Yes, and it--"
2008.08-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2799.13,2800.284,And what should I read?
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2800.974,2806.862,"--I mean, beyond -- first of all, the -- the Congress has a traditional interest in keeping the channels of commerce and communication free from--"
2008.08-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2806.862,2814.778,"--Normally, where that is involved, I've learned, it's called what Justice Scalia called it ""a jurisdictional hook""."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2843.423,2861.432,"--The legislative history of the 1956 Act, which is the -- where the predecessor statute, 1403, was enacted, shows that Congress was concerned with the ability of drug traffickers and people engaging in drug transactions to avoid detection by using the phone--"
2008.08-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2861.432,2864.634,And that's what -- you've cited that in the brief so I can find it?
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2864.634,2865.18,--Yes.
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2900.134,2901.538,How does it work?
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2932.902,2949.913,"I don't -- I don't know the statistics on that, but certainly a wiretap is only possible when demanding standards under Title III are met, and -- whereas, a face-to-face meeting can be observed by anybody who happens to be there."
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2949.913,2956.065,But what had -- what had to be met in this case in order to put this tap on the dealer's phone?
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2956.065,2966.656,"Well, among other things, I believe the statute requires some showing that it's not possible to obtain evidence in some other less intrusive way."
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2988.88,3000.204,"So, you would interpret Congress -- now we're getting away from '56, when simple possession was a felony, to '70, when simple possession becomes a misdemeanor."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3035.549,3039.718,"Well, it's -- I mean, it doesn't apply when -- when a communication facility is used."
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3047.045,3054.995,"But I'm talking about this context, the purchase of one gram of cocaine on one occasion, nothing more."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3054.995,3056.384,--As a first offense.
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3057.132,3072.044,"So Congress's design was we treat as a less grave offender the buyer for his own use, but only if he buys in a face-to-face encounter?"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3090.227,3098.802,"--Yes, although I wouldn't describe it as an issue of a less grave offense or a more grave offense in the sense that the use of the phone aggravates the offense of possession."
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3098.802,3100.05,"But I mean, practically--"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3100.05,3100.659,But use of a phone is a different--
2008.08-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3100.659,3107.377,--the difference between being labeled a misdemeanant and being labeled a felon is an enormous difference.
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3107.377,3108.937,--That -- that's right.
2008.08-192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3127.741,3144.313,"Mr. Miller, in answer to one of Justice Breyer's earlier questions, he indicated that the premise of his question was the effect of the twin amendments from offense to felony and from felony to misdemeanor for possession of small quantities."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3182.439,3187.703,"Well, I mean, if you're asking other misdemeanor offenses under the Controlled Substances Act--"
2008.08-192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3187.703,3188.202,Yes.
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3188.202,3189.216,"--I mean, there's the--"
2008.08-192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3189.216,3191.451,"In other words, how important is this?"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3220.751,3223.392,--I -- I don't know how many prosecutions are brought under those statutes.
2008.08-192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3228.375,3235.122,How many separate -- how many misdemeanor-misdemeanor combined offenses are there under the -- under the code?
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3235.122,3245.459,"842 -- section 842 enumerates I think it is on the order of a dozen or so, and then we cite a couple of them in our brief."
2008.08-192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3254.659,3262.215,You -- you don't have any figures on the number of actual prosecutions under -- under the -- in the misdemeanor-misdemeanor combination cases?
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3262.215,3262.964,--No.
2008.08-192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3276.133,3309.071,"So -- well, then, I guess that leads to my last question, and that is: Isn't it probably true that if we accept your view of the statute, then the effect of those two combined amendments, offense to -- to felony, felony to misdemeanor for small quantities, the -- the combined effect of -- of those two statutes is, in effect, rendered worthless in -- in most cases?"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3323.067,3330.983,"Well, I think the -- the relevant inquiry is: What -- what did Congress intend in 1970 when it changed the statute?"
2008.08-192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3330.983,3334.266,"That may be the relevant inquiry, but what about my irrelevant inquiry?"
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3334.266,3334.797,"Well, I ----"
2008.08-192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3335.358,3343.45,It's going to -- your -- your view of the statute is going to render those two amendments virtually dead letters.
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3343.45,3353.881,"I mean I think -- I think from the perspective of -- of Congress, that there was no -- they wouldn't have anticipated that the amendment would not have any consequence."
2008.08-192,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3360.175,3365.439,"Yes, but as you said -- as you said, they -- you don't have figures on the number of prosecutions."
2008.08-192,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3392.973,3404.142,"--If I -- if I may answer, my understanding is that the number of prosecutions under 843(b) is -- is also relatively small, but I don't have precise figures on -- on the comparative numbers."
2008.08-192,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3404.142,3405.094,"Thank you, counsel."

2008.08-192,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3469.737,3481.562,"--I don't think so, Justice Stevens, because as of 1970 there were already underlying drug laws that barred distribution, that barred receipt of drugs, and that barred most of the activities that are now prohibited under the drug laws."
2008.08-192,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3495.477,3497.119,Could I ask you this question?
2008.08-192,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3532.931,3543.612,"Well, I think the -- the use of the machine gun wouldn't come within the buyer-seller rule because what the buyer-seller rule deals with is a substantive prohibition on distribution."

2008.08-192,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3559.171,3559.811,That wouldn't apply--
2008.08-192,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3559.811,3560.528,--I'm sorry.
2008.08-192,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3561.437,3570.885,--I was just going to say I don't think that would apply with somebody who is using a machine gun because the person who is using a machine gun isn't necessarily part of the distribution offense to begin with.
