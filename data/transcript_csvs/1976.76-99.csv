1976.76-99,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.189,"We will hear arguments next in 76-99, Occidental Life against EEOC."
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,50.806,71.984,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held below, that the EEOC has infinity within which to sue on an individual charge of discrimination."
1976.76-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,179.404,191.344,"I notice in the briefs here, nobody seems to have identified the most analogous State Statute or argued about which one it might be."
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,191.344,191.804,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.76-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,191.804,196.956,"We are in California, so it will be a California Statute if your second argument is correct."
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,196.956,198.675,That is right Mr. Justice Stewart.
1976.76-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,198.675,211.653,And might it be a different statute if it is one for money back pay from -- I thought it might be if it were only for an injunction.
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,211.653,212.585,I do not believe…
1976.76-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,212.585,219.839,"In other words only if in injunction there will be no statute at all, but the State Doctrine of Laches."
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,219.839,231.679,"No, Your Honor, I do not believe there would be a distinction under California law, under the California Statute between a suit for injunctive relief and a suit for back pay."
1976.76-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,231.679,237.37,But there is no identification any where in these briefs that I saw of what the most analogous State Statute might be.
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,237.37,262.136,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, the Court of Appeals of course because of its view that there was no limitation whatsoever did not reach the issue, the District Court held that the one year statute of limitations in California was applicable and that was an alternative holding in the court’s granting of our motion for Summary Judgment."
1976.76-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,274.878,280.999,"It is that, what is that statute for a penalty or for or is it a catch all statute or…"
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,280.999,300.367,"That is the statute for wrongful injury; it is Code of Civil Procedure Section 343, injury caused by the wrongful act of another."
1976.76-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,330.912,332.36,Each was one year statute?
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,332.36,341.053,"No, I am sorry, the first for wrongful injury is one year, the second statute is three years."
1976.76-99,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,341.929,343.859,How long he lapsed here?
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,345.894,365.415,"Yes, that is right Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the complaint was filed over three years and four months from the date upon which the Discriminatory Act occurred being the discharge of the charging party Tamar Edelson on or about October 1, 1970."
1976.76-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,369.09,374.785,"Then it was a pattern of practice suit, was not it?"
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,374.785,411.573,"Mr. Justice Stewart, when the suit was brought, yes, it was -- I do not know whether pattern in practices is quite the right word, it was not an Attorney General Suit under the old pattern in practice provisions of the 64 Act, but it did allege wide ranging, acts and practices of discrimination by the petitioner against both female employees and male employees, going all the way back to the effective date of the civil rights act in 1965."
1976.76-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,411.573,416.648,But all the way up to the time the suit was filed is not it.
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,424.057,428.092,"The allegations of the complaint, Mr. Justice Stewart, yes."
1976.76-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,428.092,436.835,"So, when the statute began to run, it is your claim that it ran from the discharge of the original complaining party."
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,436.835,437.613,That is correct.
1976.76-99,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,437.613,446.162,"But arguably, it might run from the -- according to that government’s allegation that it was going on at the time of the suit."
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,446.162,459.377,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I think it should be recognized that nowhere in the pleadings before the District Court, did the EEOC at any time argue that there was a continuing violation."
1976.76-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,748.21,753.143,"Mr. Vaughn, may I ask you question just to get the whole thing that you told."
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,759.535,779.991,"No formal notification, the record demonstrates that she was advised that she could bring suit and she requested that the case be sent to San Francisco, the EEOC’s regional litigation office for consideration as a vehicle for a litigation."
1976.76-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.991,786.228,"What I was leading up to is, does she now have a right to sue if she got the right kind of letter from the EEOC?"
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,789.495,796.111,"If a right to sue letter now was issued, well I would say certainly not Mr. Justice Stevens."
1976.76-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.111,798.647,She would not be barred?
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,798.647,802.216,"She would be barred, that she would not have a right to sue at this juncture."
1976.76-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,816.67,818.393,Let me put the question little differently.
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,827.08,842.955,"Mr. Justice Stevens, the question you are asking me is what are the conditions to make some suit by a private individual and that of course is not a question before the court in this case."
1976.76-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,886.065,895.411,"What I am really asking I suppose is because you do not rely on express limitation language, but rather an implied limitation and the statutory schemes seems to put together, as you argued it."
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,913.365,920.106,"Well, Mr. Justice Stevens I think I suggested at the outset, I do not think you have to decide, the question is not before you."
1976.76-99,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.048,995.931,"I think it may be relevant Mr. Vaughn is that if you are arguing an implicit limitation rather than express limitation, at least we must have a pretty clear picture, how the whole statutory scheme puts together, that is why it was troubling me and I think, I know that it could maybe necessary to at least take that through and I am not sure what the answer is."
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,995.931,1014.434,"Mr. Justice Stevens I am not sure what the answer is either, I can only say I do not think you need to decide it in this case and I can see arguments being made on both sides, I think it is logical that she would be barred, I believe that Johnson Versus REA would tend to support that conclusion."
1976.76-99,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1023.584,1031.128,Mr. Vaughn you believe that nobody can sue Occidental after two years?
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,1033.97,1045.906,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I do not go that far again, I do not think the court needs to reach the question, under what circumstances a charging party could bring suit."
1976.76-99,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.247,1087.369,Is not that the reverse of what one would usually think the Statute of Limitations applies to the government usually has a longer period of limitations or governmental agencies has a longer period of limitation than a private individual.
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,1087.369,1147.794,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think this perhaps is a unique case because the foundation for what is usually the case I believe and normally would be an interpretation of congressional intention, here Congress was outraged, outraged by the delays and the inaction, that this agency was pursuing in the enforcement of the act and they intended -- I think it is clear to put a relatively short time limitation upon the right to sue after all in this same section, Section 706(f)(1) there is a provision that the charging party after receiving a notice of right to sue will have 90 days within which to sue, a lesser time in fact than the 180 days."
1976.76-99,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1147.794,1164.195,"Well then why does not that govern Ms. Vaughn's  right here rather the charging party is right here, is that that she did not receive the notice?"
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,1164.195,1173.752,"Well we have no issue Mr. Justice Rehnquist before assessed Ms. Edelson‘s, the charging party’s right to do anything."
1976.76-99,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1201.009,1216.01,"Mr. Vaughn I am little concerned about the practical results, if you prevail here, then I suppose assuming their sufficient manpower, the EEOC will bring a lot of suits near the end of the 180 day period."
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,1223.175,1239.917,"Mr. Justice Blackmun I think not only would employers want that I think that, that is what charging parties would want, I think that is what private counsel for plaintiffs want."
1976.76-99,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1378.72,1384.801,"Well my suggestion was that they might be clogged even more, if you prevailed it."
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,1384.801,1403.425,"I think that is a good question Mr. Justice Blackmun and I think it is not the case, I really do believe that a lawyer confronted with a deadline, we are going to settle this case in 30 days, or we the EEOC will file a suit."
1976.76-99,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1436.999,1447.261,"And is not that also attempts to mitigate the damages, the back pay award, so that the employer can make a judgment very quickly, whether he should or should not wash it out."
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,1447.261,1473.983,"I think that that is one of most important practical points Mr. Chief Justice, that if you have made a mistake, that is something you are going to face up to earlier, much more readily than you are five and six and seven years down the road and this is the problem, you do not make those judgments now because nobody is holding your feet to the fire."
1976.76-99,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1591.045,1602.747,"Just one of these call for a brief answer, does this create problems for large employers in terms of setting up reserves for contingent liabilities?"
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,1602.747,1604.378,The present system?
1976.76-99,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1604.378,1607.951,"Yes, If the government’s position is correct, that it is okay…"
1976.76-99,0,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,1607.951,1626.21,"Yes, the present system, the government’s position, yes Mr. Chief Justice the potential contingent liability is again be absolutely staggering and often one’s which you cannot measure, you do not know the duration or the extent of them."
1976.76-99,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1630.29,1632.383,Mr. Martin.
1976.76-99,1,43126,thomas_s_martin,,1632.383,1636.064,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1976.76-99,2,21652,dennis_h_vaughn,,3442.068,3451.505,"Yes, Chief Justice, just really three or four points."
